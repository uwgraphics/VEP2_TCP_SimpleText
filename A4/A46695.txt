The jealous Lover satisfied.
All you that do to love pretend,
Come lend an ear unto my song,
And say no more than you intend,
For therein you your selves do wrong.
Tune of, The gallant Youth of Gravesend.






THere was in Bristol City fair
a Maiden of a good degree,
To whom a young man did repair
and courted her most gallantly:
These were the words to her he said,
Sweet if thou do my suit deny
I am undone, for i am afraid
my heart will break, and I shall dye.
Young Men are now so subtle grown
and play their parts so cunningly,
We Maids had better lie alone.
than covet for your company.
Yet if I thought you would be true,
as now you do pretend to me,
A single life i would bid adieu,
and be as kind as kind could be.
What unto thee I do pretend,
is nothing more than what I mean;
I Will prove thy true and faithful friend,
a kinder soul was never seen.
These were the words, to her he said:
Sweet if thou do my suit deny
I am undone, for i am afraid
my heart will break and I shall dye.
How many men have vowed and swore,
their wanton minds for to fulfill,
Then think upon their vows no more,
which often proved to Maidens ill:
Yet if I thought you would be true,
as now you do pretend to me,
A single life i would bid adieu,
and be as kind as kind could be.
While life does in my heart remain,
most loyal I to thee will prove,
For here I vow and swear again
that nothing shall my mind remove.
These were the words, to her he said:
Sweet if thou do my suit deny
I am undone, for i am afraid
my heart will break and I shall dye.
With that she took him by the hand
and blushing seemed to comply,
Quoth she thou now shall understand
that for thy sake i will live and dye:
And now I think thou will be true,
as thou pretendest unto me,
A single life i will bid adieu,
and be as kind as kind can be.
When he did hear her charming voice
part with such pretty words as these,
Oh how in heart he did rejoice,
then Babies in her eyes he sees:
Then lovingly to her he said,
since thou do not my love deny,
I will no longer be afraid
that I for love of thee shall dye.
No, no, we will so well agree,
that thou no more shall doubtful be,
I Will banish all thy care and fear,
and prove a faithful wife to thee:
For now I think thou will be true,
as thou pretendest unto me;
A single life i will bid adieu,
and be as kind as kind can be.
The wedding day they pitched upon*
and bravely it did solemnize,
Where all things decently were done;
their hearts were both a sacrifice:
And lovingly to her he said*
since thou do not my love deny,
I will no longer be afraid;
that I for love of thee shall dye.
Young Men and Maids where e're you be
take pattern by this loving pair,
And prove what you do seem to be,
seek not each other to ensnare;
But lovingly your hearts unite,
so may you ever happy be;
Those that in falseness take delight*
will tumble into misery.
Printed for J. Blare on London Bridge.
