AIM FOR THE ARCHERS OF St. Georges Fields.

Containing the Names of all the Marks in the same Fields, with their true
distances according to the dimensuration of the line.

Formerly Gathered by Richard Hannis. And now corrected by Thomas (...), and
others.

London: Printed by N. H^well for Robert Min^^^d and Benjamin Brownsmith, and
are to be sold at the sign of the Man in the Moon in Blackman street, 1604.

Rules to be observed and Practiced by all those that exercise Shooting in the
Long Bow.
1 For finding your mark it must be within every man's reach.

2 For Whites or blacks you must have but one in a Game unless they be all
con^ent, and if you shoot at any loose white, and it be stricken out of sight,
it is no mark.

3 For the height of stakes, although the wood be above the pin, yet you are to
measure at the pin if there be any, because it is put in for that purpose.

4 Shooting at a bush or black, whatever you find highest in it (being within
the compass of the mark) you are to take for the height.

5 If in measuring a shoot the difference be so small it cannot be decided,
then that Competitor shall win the shoot that is best at next mark.

6 If in measuring a shoot the mark be stirred out of its place, he loses the
shoot that removed it.

7 If at coming to your mark you claim two or more, and the opposite side draw
their Arrows, you can have no more then you first claimed, although your
Partner when he comes challenges more.

8 If you name one mark and shoot at another, you are to lose your shoot, and
the other are to follow at the mark named.

9 If your Arrow break you may measure at the nearest piece that has wood and
head, or wood and feather.

10 If you have any mis-hap, as nocking amiss, if you can reach your arrow with
your bow you may shoot again, if it flee further it is a shoot.

11 In shooting at Rovers, you must stand no further from your mark then you
can reach with half your bow: but at Pricks you are permitted to stand two bows
before your mark, and as much behind it as you please.

Note,

1 That the first number shows the scores, the second the yards.

2 The marks are to be taken all going into the field: and if you be coming
homewards look for the mark you shoot at, not for the mark you stand at.

3 The marks are placed from the left hand to the right, leaving out none from
10 score to 17 or 18 score; and you must always look for your mark from the
East to the West.

4 Sundry marks have two or three words for their names: Look always for the
mark in the first word; as suppose you look for Minchards Lion, look not for
Lion, but for Minchard: and so in the rest.
