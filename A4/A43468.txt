THE Grand Designs OF THE PAPISTS, In the Reign of our late Sovereign Charles
the I. And now carried on against His Present MAJESTY, His GOVERNMENT, And the
PROTESTANT RELIGION.

Imprimatur. Guil. Jane, Nov. 2. 1678. LONDON, Printed by Henry Hills, Anno
1678.

To the READER.
HE must needs be a man of very slender observation and acquaintance in the
World, who is surprised and startled at the news of Plots and Conspiracies
against Princes, contrived and managed by the restless Emissaries of the Church
of Rome. There is no new thing under the Sun, says the Wiseman. And as to the
present case, we may defy the greatest Villain of the whole Order of the
Jesuits to form any design, however black and execrable, barbarous and
inhumane, which shall be any other than the unavoidable result of their avowed
Principles, which we may gather from their Writings, and the repetition of
their known Practices, which stand upon record in the Histories of former Ages.
This Truth has been convincingly demonstrated by our Protestant Writers in both
the parts of it: Insomuch that the Romish Factors, instead of denying the
Charge, have begun to save us all further trouble, by giving fresh proof of it
themselves; and by a late Traitorous design against His Majesty's Person and
Government, have endeavored to confirm our Assertions by a sad and direful
Experience; as thinking perhaps, that new Massacres are the most effectual
course to stop the cry of the old; and that the readiest way to silence their
Adversaries, is, to make them Instances of the truth of the Accusation.

It is not the design of these Papers, to give an account of the discovery of
the late Plot, but only to present the Reader with the Narrative of another,
against His Majesty's Royal Father of Blessed Memory, so exactly resembling
this which now lies under examination, that it can hardly be called another,
being nothing else but the same thing acted over again, only with the
necessary alteration of circumstances of Time, Place, and Persons.

I will not here undertake to make out the Parallel, which is so obvious to be
discerned in almost all the Circumstances of the Story. The only use I shall
at present make of it, is briefly this, viz. From hence to understand, who were
the chief promoters of the late Troubles, and the most pernicious enemies to
that Royal Martyr: The Sectaries indeed were the most visible and notorious,
but they were neither the only nor the principal Actors in the Conspiracy. The
Jesuits can never sit out, when such great Transactions, as Rebellions and
Regicide, are going forward. And however the Papist and Fanatic are of
contrary Factions, Interests, and Inclinations; yet it is natural enough, that
they may both conspire (though with a different intent) to promote and carry on
the very same design.

We have here a full discovery made to us, where our danger lies; nor are the
Roman practices ever the less mischievous, though usually managed in a way more
secret and undiscerned. What is now secretly practiced in Colleges and
Corners, shall (when ever opportunity serves them) be openly acted in the face
of the Sun. What has been once done, may be done again. And let us not flatter
our selves, that we can have any security from that sort of men, who can
readily break through all Obligations of Gratitude or Religion, for propagating
their Cause, though by a Massacre, or a Powder Plot, by the Murder of a King,
or the Subversion of a Kingdom. The Lord in his mercy awaken us to see our
danger, and in his good time make us a way to escape it; and grant, that we may
all, in this our day, know the things that belong unto our peace, before they
be hid from our eyes.

WHo and what the Author of this Discovery was; who the chief active
Instruments in the Plot; when, and where they assembled; in what vigorous
manner they daily prosecuted it; how effectually they proceeded in it; how
difficult it is to dissolve or counter-work it, without special diligence, the
Relation it self will best discover: Whose verity, if any question, these
Reasons will enforce belief:

First, That the Discoverer was a chief Actor in this Plot, sent hither from
Rome by Cardinal Barbarino, to assist Con the Popes Legate in the pursuit of it,
and privy to all the particulars therein discovered.

Secondly, That the horror and reality of the Conspiracy so troubled his
conscience, as it engaged him to disclose it, yea, to renounce that bloody
Church and Religion which contrived it, though bred up in, preferred by it, and
promised greater Advancements for his diligence in this design.

Thirdly, That he discovered it under an Oath of Secrecy, and offered to
confirm every particular by solemn Oath.

Fourthly, That he discovers the Persons principally employed in this Plot, the
places and times of their secret Conventions, their manner and diligence in the
pursuit of it, with all other circumstances, so punctually, as leaves no place
for doubt.

Fifthly, The principal Conspirators nominated by him, are notoriously known to
be fit Instruments for such a wicked design.

Sixthly, Many particulars therein have immediate relation to the King and
Archbishop, to whom be imparted this Discovery, and durst not reveal any thing
for truth, which they could disprove on their own knowledge.

Seventhly, Sir William Boswel, and the Archbishop, if not the King himself,
were fully satisfied that it was real, and most important.

Eighthly, Some particulars are ratified by the Archbishops testimomony, in the
Memorials of his own Life, written with his own hand some years before; and
others so apparent, that most intelligent men in Court or City, were acquainted
with them whiles they were acting, thoughignorant of the Plot.

The first Overture and larger Relation of the Plot it self, were both writ in
Latin, as they are here Printed, and faithfully translated word for word, as
near as the Dialect will permit. All which premised, the Letters and Plot here
follow in order.

Sir William Boswels first Letter to the Archbishop concerning the Plot.
May it please your Grace,
THe offers (whereof your Grace will find a Copy here enclosed) toward a
further and more particular discovery, were first made unto me at the second
hand, and in speech, by a friend of good quality and worth in this place: But
soon after, (as soon as they could be put into Order) were avowed by the
principal Party, and delivered me in writing by both together; upon Promise and
Oath, which I was required to give, and gave accordingly, not to reveal the
same to any other man living but your Grace, and, by your Grace's hand, unto
his Majesty.

In like manner they have tied themselves not to declare these things unto any
other but my self, until they should know how his Majesty and your Grace would
dispose thereof. The Principal giving me withal to know, That he puts himself
and this Secret into your Grace's power, as well because it concerns your Grace
so nearly, after his Majesty, as that he knows your wisdom to guide the same
aright; and is assured of your Grace's fidelity to his Majesty's Person, to our
State, and to our Church.

First, Your Grace is humbly and earnestly prayed to signify his Majesty's
pleasure (with all possible speed) together with your Grace's disposition
herein, and purpose to carry all with silence from all, but his Majesty, until
due time.

Secondly, When your Grace shall think fit to show these things unto his
Majesty, to do it immediately, not trusting to Letters, or permitting any other
person to be by, or in hearing; and to entreat and counsel his Majesty, as in a
case of Conscience, to keep the same wholely and solely in his own bosom, from
the knowledge of all other Creatures living, but your Grace, until the business
shall be clear, and sufficiently in his Majesty's and your Grace's hands to
effect.

Thirdly, Not to enquire or demand the names of the parties from whom these
overtures do come, or any further discoveries and advertisements in pursuit of
them which shall come hereafter, until due satisfaction shall be given in every
part of them. Nor to bewray unto any person but his Majesty, in any measure or
kind, that any thing of this nature, or of any great importance is come from me.

For as I may believe these overtures are verifiable in the way they will be
laid; and that the parties will not shrink: So I make account, That if never so
little a glimpse or shadow of these informations shall appear by his Majesty's,
or your Graces speech or carriage unto others, the means whereby the business
may be brought best unto trial, will be utterly disappointed: And the parties
who have in Conscience toward God, and devotion to his Majesty, affection to
your Grace, and compassion of our Country, disclosed these things, will run a
present and extreme hazard of their persons and lives. So easily it will be
conjectured (upon the least occasion given upon his Majesty's or your Graces
parts) who is the discoverer: By what means, and how he knows so much of these
things; And where he is. These are the points, which together with the offers,
they have pressed me especially to represent most seriously unto your Grace.

For my own particular, having most humbly craved pardon of any error or
omissions, that have befaln me in the managing of this business, I do beseech
your Grace to let me know,

First, Whether, and in what order I shall proceed hereafter with the parties?

Secondly, What points of these offers I shall chiefly, and first put them to
enlarge and clear?

Thirdly, What other points and enquiries I shall propose unto them? And in
what manner?

Fourthly, How far further I shall suffer my self to hear and know these things?

Fifthly, Whether I shall not rather take the parties answers, and discoveries
sealed up by themselves, and having likewise put my own seal upon them, without
questioning or seeing what they contain, so to transmit them to his Majesty or
your Grace?

Sixthly, Whether I may not insinuate upon some fair occasion, That there will
be a due Regard held of them, and their service, by his Majesty and your Grace:
When all particulars undertaken in these general offers, and necessary for
perfecting the discovery and work intended, shall be effectually delivered to
his Majesty or your Grace?

Upon these Heads, and such other as His Majesty or your Grace shall think
proper in the business, I must with all humility beseech your Grace to furnish
me with instructions, and warrant for my proceedings, under his Majesty's hand,
with your Graces attestation, as by his Majesty's goodness, and Royal
disposition is usual in like cases.

May it please your Grace to entertain a Cipher with me upon this occasion; I
have sent the Counterpart of one here enclosed: In the vacant spaces whereof
your Grace may insert such names more, with numbers to them, as you think
requisite.

If these overtures happily sort with his Majesty's and your Graces mind, and
shall accordingly prove effectual in their operation, I shall think my self a
most happy man, to have had my oblation in so pious a work for my most gracious
Sovereign and Master: More particularly, in that your Grace, under his Majesty,
shall be, Opifex rerum, and mundi melioris origo. Which I shall incessantly beg
in my prayers at his hands, who is the Giver of all good things, and will never
forsake, or fail them, who do not first fail, and fall from him: The God of
mercy and Peace. With which I remain evermore

I have not dared to trust this business (without a Cipher) but by a sure hand,
for which I have sent this bearer, my Secretary, Express, but he knows
nothing of the contents hereof.

Your Graces, Most dutiful and obliged servant, William Boswell.

Rece. October. 14. 1640. Andreas ab Habernfeld, his letters sent by Sir W.
Boswel about the discovery of the Treason. I conceive by the English-Latin
herein, that he must needs be an Englishman with a concealed and changed name.
And yet it may be this kind of Latin may relate to the Italian; or else he
lived some good time in England. The declaration of this Treason I have, by his
Majesty's special command, sent to Sir W. Boswel, that he may there see what
proof can be made of any particulars.

Illustrissime ac Reverendissime Domine,
COncutiuntur omnes sensus mei, quoties praefens negotium mecum revolvo; nec
intellectus sufficit, quaenam aura tam horrenda attulerit, ut per me apricum
videant. Praeter spem enim bonus iste vir mihi innotuit, qui cum me
discurrentem de turbis istis Scoticis audisset; Ignorare me, inquit, nervum
Rei, superficialia esse ista quae vulgo sparguntur: Ab ista hora in dies mihi
fiebat familiarior; qui dexteritate mea agnita, pleno pectore cordis sui onera
in sinum meum effudit; deposuisse se gravamen conscientiae, quo premebatur,
ratus. Hinc Factiones Iesuitarum, quibus totus terrenus intentatur orbis, mihi
enarravit; depastasque ipsorum per virus, Bohemiam and Germaniam ut adspicerem,
ostendit, sauciam utramque partem vulnere irreparabili; Eandem Pestem per
Angliae Scotiaeque repere Regna, cujus materiam, scripto adjacenti revelatam,
me edocuit: quibus auditis, viscera mea convellebantur, tremebant horrore
artus; Tot animarum millibus infestam paratam esse voraginem: verbis
conscientiam moventibus, animum hominis accendi; vixhoram unam monita coxerat,
abdita omnia apperuit, liberumque dedit, agerem, ut iis quorum interest,
innotescerent. Non tartandum cum rebus cenfui: Ea ipsa hora Dominum Bosuelium
Residentem Regium Hagae Comitum, adii, juramento silentii mihi obstricto, Rem
communicavi; ponderaret ista ad trutinam, monui, neque differret ei, quin
ageret ut periclitantibus succurratur propere. Is ut virum honestum condecet,
officii memor, propriusque introspecto negotio, monita recusare non quievit,
quinimo egit e vestigio ut expressus expediretur. Retulitque iterum, quam
acceptissimum Regi, Tuaeque Reverentiae fuisse oblatum; de quo ex cord gavisi
sumus, judicavimusque actutum, favorabile sese interposuisse in hoc Negotio
NUMEN, quo servaremini.

Ut vero rerum enarratarum confirmetur veritas, studio primaria nonnulla
conjurationis capita sunt praeterita, ut notitia eorum ab circumventa
conjurationis Societate extorqueatur.

Promovebitur res cito tutoque in actum, si caute procedetur Bruxellis; Meo
consilio, observandum esse eam diem qua fasciculi literarum expediuntur, qui
sub titulo, Al Monsignor Strario Archi-diacono di Cambray, una coperta ligati,
Praefecto Tabellionum traduntur, ab ipso talis fasciculus tacit poterit
repeti, inutilis tamen erit, quia omnes inclusae Characteristice scriptae sunt;
Alter quoque fasciculus hebdomadatim Roma veniens, qui sub inscriptione, Al
Illustrissimo Signor Conte Rossetti, pro tempore Legato, adportatur, non
negligendus: cui similiter Charactere eodem conscriptae includuntur literae; ut
intelligantur, Reda consulendus erit: supranominata dies expeditionis
expectabitur: Aedibus Redae adcumulata Congregatio, circumvenietur; quo
succedente, Tuae Reverentiae erit Negotium disponere. Detecto tandem per Dei
gratiam, intestino host, omnis amaritudo animorum, quae ab utraque part
causata est, aboleatur, oblivioni tradatur, deleatur and consopiatur, utrique
parti Insidiari hostis. It a Rex, amicusque Regis, and Regnum utrumque
Discrimini vicinum, servabitur, eripietur imminenti periculo.

Haec penes etiam Reverentia tua injunctum sibi habeat, si alias consultum sibi
optime volet, Ne Pursivantibus suis nimium fidat, vivunt enim eorum nonnulli
sub stipendio partis Pontificiae. Quot scopuli, quot Scyllae, quotque infensae
obsultant T. R. Charibdes, quam periculoso mari agitatur vita T. R. Cymbula
naufragio proxima, ipse judicet pellenda ad portum prora propere.

Haec omnia tuae Reverentiae in aurem; scio enim juramento silentii obligatam,
ideo aperto nomine praesentibus Reverentiae tuae innotescere volui, mansurus,

Sept. 14. S. N. 1640. Observantissimus and Officiocissimus, Andreas ab
Habernfeld.
Illustrissimo ac Reverendissimo Dom. Domino Guilielmo Archiepiscopo
Cantuariensi, Primati and Metropolitano totius Regni Angliae, Dom. meo.
Most Illustrious and most Reverend Lord,
ALL my senses are shaken together, as often as I revolve the present business;
neither does my understanding suffice (to conceive) what wind has brought such
horrid things, that they should see the Sunshine by me. For besides
expectation, this good man became known unto me, who when he had heard me
discoursing of these Scottish stirs, said, that I knew not the Nerve of the
business, that those things which are commonly scattered abroad, are commonly
superficial. From that hour he every day became more familiar to me, who
acknowledging my dexterity herein, with a full breast poured forth the burdens
of his heart into my bosom, supposing that he had discharged a burden of
Conscience wherewith he was pressed. Hence he related to me the Factions of the
Jesuits, with which the whole earthly world was assaulted, and showed, that I
might behold how, through their poison, Bohemia and Germany were devoured, and
both of them maimed with an irrepar^^le wound. That the same Plague did creep
through the Realms of England and Scotland; the matter whereof, revealed in the
adjacent Writing, he discovered to me. Which things having heard, my bowels
were contracted together, my loins trembled with horror, that a pernicious
gulf should be prepared for so many thousands of Souls. Which words moving the
Conscience, I inflamed the mind of the man: he had scarce one hour concocted my
admonitions, but he disclosed all the secrets, and he gave free liberty that I
should treat with those whom it concerned, that they might be informed thereof;
I thought no delay was to be made about the things. The same hour I went to Mr.
Boswel, the Kings Ledger at the Hague, who being tied with an Oath of secrecy
to me, I communicated the business to him; I admonished him to weigh these
things by the Balance, neither to defer, but act, that those who were in
danger might be speedily succored. He, as becomes an honest man, mindful of
his duty, and having nearer looked into the business, refused not to obey the
monitions. Moreover, he forthwith caused, that an Express should be dispatched;
and sent word back again, what a most acceptable Oblation this had been to the
King and your Grace; for which we rejoiced from the heart, and we judged, that
a safe and favorable Deity had interposed it self in this business, whereby
you might be preserved.

Now that the verity of the things related might be confirmed, some principal
Heads of the conspiracy were purposely pretermitted, that the knowledge of them
might be extorted from the circumvented Society of the Conspirators.

Now the things will be speedily and safely promoted into act, if they be
warily proceeded in at Bruxels. By my advice, that day should be observed
wherein the Packet of Letters are dispatched, which under the Title of, To
Monsieur Strario Archdeacon of Cambray, tied with one cover, are delivered to
the Postmaster; such a Packet may be secretly brought back from him, yet it
will be unprofitable, because all the enclosed Letters are written
Characteristically. Likewise another Packet coming weekly from Rome, which is
brought under this subscription, To the most Illustrious Lord, Count Rossetti,
Legate for the time; these are not to be neglected. To whom likewise Letters
writ in the same Character are included. That they may be understood, Read is
to be consulted with. The forenamed day of dispatch shall be expected: In
Reads house an accumulated Congregation may be circumvented; which succeeding,
it will be your Graces part to order the business. The intestine Enemy being at
length detected by Gods grace, all bitterness of mind which is caused on either
side, may be abolished, delivered to oblivion, deleted and quieted, the Enemy
be invaded on both parts. Thus the King, and the Kings Friend, and both
Kingdoms near to danger, shall be preserved, delivered from imminent danger.

Your Grace likewise may have this injunction by you, if you desire to have the
best advice given you by others, That you trust not over much to your
Pursevants, for some of them live under the Stipend of the Popish Party. How
many Rocks, how many Scylla's, how many displeased Charibdes appear before your
Grace; in what a dangerous Sea the Cock-boat of your Grace's life, next to
Shipwreck, is tossed, your self may judge; the Fore-deck of the Ship is
speedily to be driven to the Harbor.

All these things (I whisper) into your Grace's ear, for I know it bound with
an Oath of Secrecy. Therefore by open name I would by these presents become
known to your Grace.

Bohemia, his Indorsment hereon.

The general Overture and Discovery of the Plot, sent with Sir Wllliam Boswel's
first Letter.
The Kings Majesty, and Lord Archbishop of Canterbury are to be secretly
informed by Letters.

1. THat the Kings Majesty, and the Lord Archbishop are both of them in great
danger of their lives.

2. That the whole Commonwealth is by this means endangered, unless the
mischief be speedily prevented.

3. That these Scottish troubles are raised to the end, that under this pretext,
the King and Archbishop might be destroyed.

4. That there is a means to be prescribed, whereby both of them in this case
may be preserved, and his tumult speedily composed.

5. That although these Scottish tumults be speedily composed, yet that the King
is endangered; and that there are many ways, by which destruction is plotted to
the King and Lord Archbishop.

6. That a certain Society has conspired, which attempts the death of the
King, and Lord Archbishop, and Convulsion of the whole Realm.

7. That the same Society every week deposits with the President of the
Society, what intelligence every of them has purchased in eight days search,
and then confer all into one Packet, which is weekly sent to the Director of
the business.

8. That all the Confederates in the said Conspiracy may verily be named by the
Poll. But because they may be made known by other means, it is thought meet to
defer it till hereafter.

9. That there is a ready means, whereby the villainy may be discovered in one
moment, the chief Conspirators circumvented, and the primary Members of the
Conjuration apprehended in the very act.

10. That very many about the King, who are accounted most faithful and
intimate, to whom likewise the more secret things are entrusted, ARE TRAITORS
TO THE KING, corrupted with a Foreign Pension, who communicate all secrets of
greater or lesser moment to a Foreign Power.

11. These and other most secret things, which shall be necessary to be known
for the security of the King, may be revealed, if these things shall be
acceptable to the Lord Archbishop.

12. In the mean time, if his Royal Majesty, and the Lord Archbishop, desire to
consult well to themselves, they shall keep these things, only superficially
communicated unto them, most secretly under deep silence, not communicating
them so much as to those whom they judge must faithful to them, before they
shall receive by name in whom they may confide; for else they are safe on no
side.

13. Likewise they may be assured, that whatsoever things are here proposed,
are no figments, nor fables, nor vain dreams, but such real verities which may
be demonstrated in every small tittle. For those who thrust themselves into
this business, are such men, who mind no gain, but the very zeal of Christian
Charity suffers them not to conceal* these things: yet both from his Majesty
and the Lord Archbishop, some small exemplar of gratitude will be expected.

All these premises have been communicated under good faith, and the Sacrament
of an Oath, to Mr. Ledger Ambassador of the King of Great Britain at the Hague,
that he should not immediately trust or communicate these things to any mortal,
besides the King and the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.

The Archbishop of Canterburies Letter to the King concerning the Plot, I
beseech your Majesty read these Letters as they are endorsed by figures, 1, 2,
3, etc.
with the Kings directions in the Margin, written with his own hand.
May it please your Majesty,
AS great as the Secret is which comes herewith, yet I choose rather to send it
in this silent covert way, Ye had reason so to do.
and I hope safe, than to come thither, and bring it my self. First, because I
am no way able to make haste enough with it. Secondly, because should I come at
this time, and antedate the meeting of Sept. 24. there would be more jealousy
of the business, and more enquiry after it; especially, if I being once there,
should return again before that day, as I must, if this be followed, as is most
fit.

The danger, it seems, is imminent, and laid by God knows whom, but to be
executed by them which are very near about you. (For the great honor which I
have to be in danger with you, or for you, I pass not, so your Sacred Person
and the State may be safe.) Now, It is an unanswerable Dilemma*
may it please your Majesty, this Information is either true, or there is some
mistake in it. If it be true, the persons which make the discovery will deserve
thanks and reward. If there should be any mistake in it, your Majesty can lose
nothing but a little silence.

The business (if it be) is extreme foul. The discovery thus by Gods providence
offered, seems fair. I coneur totally with you in opinion, assuring you, that
no body does, or shall know of this business; and to show my care to conceal
it, I received this but this afternoon, and now I make this dispatch before I
sleep. Herewith I send his Warrant, as you advise, which indeed I judge to be
the better way.
I do hereby humbly beg it upon my knees of your Majesty, that you would
conceal this business from every creature, and his name that sends this to me.
And I send his Letters to me to your Majesty, that you may see his sense both
of the business and the secrecy. And such Instructions as you think fit to
give him, I beseech you let them be in your own hand, for his warrant, without
imparting them to any. And if your Majesty leave it to his discretion to follow
it there in the best way he can, that in your own hand will be instruction and
warrant enough for him. And if you please to return it herewith presently to
me, I will send an express away with it presently.

In the mean time I have by this express returned him this answer, I like your
answer extreme well, and do promise not to deceive your confidence, nor make
you break your word.
That I think he shall do well to hold on the Treaty with these men with all
care and secrecy, and drive on to the discovery so soon as the business is
ripe for it; that he may assure himself and them, they shall not want reward,
if they do the service. That for my part he shall be sure of secrecy, and that
I am most confident that your Majesty will not impart it to any. That he have a
special eye to the eighth and ninth Proposition.

Sir, I have sent all back. I think these Apostyles will be warrant enough for
you to proceed, especially when I expressly command you to do so.
for Gods sake, and your own safety, secrecy in this business: And I beseech
you send me back this Letter, and all that comes with it, speedily and
secretly, and trust not your own pockets with them. I shall not eat nor sleep
in quiet till I receive them. And so soon as I have them again, and your
Majesty's warrant to proceed, no diligence shall be wanting in me to help on
the discovery.

This is the greatest business that ever was put to me. In this I am as far
from condemning your judgment as suspecting your fidelity. C. R.
And if I have herein proposed or done any thing amiss, I most humbly crave
your Majesty's pardon. But I am willing to hope I have not herein erred in
judgment, and in fidelity I never will.

These Letters came to me on Thursday, Sept. 10. at night; and I sent these
away according to the date hereof, being extremely wearied with writing this
Letter, copying out these other which come with this, and dispatching my
Letters back to him that sent these, all in my own hand. Once again secrecy
for Gods sake, and your own. To his most blessed protection I commend your
Majesty, and all your affairs; and am

The Kings hand and date.

W. Cant.
The Archbishops Postscript.
As I had ended these, whether with the labor, or indignation, or both, I fell
into an extreme faint sweat; I pray God keep me from a Fever, of which, three
are down in my Family at Croyden.

These Letters came late to me, the Express being beaten back by the wind.

Sir W. Boswel's second Letter to the Archbishop.
May it please your Grace,
THis evening late I have received your Graces dispatch, with the enclosed from
his Majesty, by my Secretary Oueart, and shall give due account with all
possible speed of the same, according to his Majesty's and your Graces
commands; praying heartily that my endeavors, which shall be most faithful,
may also prove effectual, to his Majesty's and your Graces content; with which
I do most humbly take leave, being always

Your Graces most dutiful and most humble Servant, W. Boswel.
Hague, Sept. 24. 1640. Stylo Angliae. The Archbishop's Indorshment, Received,
Sept. 30. 1640. Sir William Boswel his acknowledgment, that he has received
the Kings Directions, and my Letters.
Sir William Boswel's third Letter to the Archbishop, sent with the larger
discovery of the Plot*
May it please your Grace,
UPon receipt of his Majesty's Commands, with your Graces Letters of 9 and 18.
Sept. last, I dealt with the Party to make good his offers formerly put in my
hand, and transmitted to your Grace: This he hopes to have done by the
enclosed, so far as will be needful for his Majesty's satisfaction; yet if any
more particular explanation or discovery shall be required by his Majesty or
your Grace, He has promised to add thereunto whatsoever he can remember and
knows of truth. And for better assurance and verification of his integrity, he
professes himself (if required) to make Oath of what he has already declared,
or shall hereafter declare in the business.

His name he conjures me still to conceal, though he thinks his Majesty and
your Grace, by the character he gives of himself, will easily imagine who he
is, having been known so generally through Court and City, as he was for three
or four years, in the quality and employment he acknowledges (by his
declaration enclosed) himself to have held.

Hereupon he does also redouble his most humble and earnest suit unto his
Majesty and your Grace, to be most secret and circumspect in the business, that
he may not be suspected to have discovered, or had a hand in the same.

I shall here humbly beseech your Grace, to let me know what I may further do
for his Majesty's service, or for your Graces particular behoof, that I may
accordingly endeavor to approve my self, as I am,

Hague, October. 15. 1640. Your Graces most dutiful and obliged Servant, Will.
Boswel.
The Archbishop's Indorsment, Received, October. 14. 1640. Sir William Boswel, in

Kingdom, and Protestant Religion; and to raise the Scottish Wars.
Illustrissime ac Reverendissime Domine,
ACcepta suae Regiae Majestati simulac Reverentiae Tuae, fuisse offerta nostra,
lubentes and ex animo percepimus. Adesse vobis benignitatem Numinis, hoc unicum
nobis Index est, quo stimulus datur, ut tanto alacrius, liberaliusque, illa
quibus vitae discrimen utriusque, statusque Regni Angliae, tum Scotiae, eximiae
Majestatis sede deturbatio intendatur, effundamus, detegamus. Ne autem
ambagibus superfluis dilatetur Oration, nonnulla, quae tantum adrem necessaria
praemittemus.

Sciant primo, bonum istum virum per quem sequentia deteguntur, in pulvere isto
Pontificio esse natum and educatum, qui in dignitatibus Ecclesiasticis aetates
consumpsit; Tandem praesentis Neg^tii expeditioni par inventus, Consilio and
mandato Domini Cardinalis Barbarini, ad auxilium Domino Cuneo adjunctus est:
penes quem in officio ita diligens ac sedulus inventus, ut spes magnae
promotionis ipsi data fuerit: ipse vero, boni Spiritus ductus instinctu, ut ut
dulcia promissa contempsit; agnitisque Religionis Pontificiae vanitatibus;
(quarum alias defensor fuerat severissimus) malitia etiam sub vexillo Papali
militantium notata, gravari Conscientiam suam senserat; quod onus ut deponeret,
ad Orthodoxam Religionem aninum convertit: Mox ut Conscientiam suamexoneraret,
machinatum in tot innocents Animas scelus, revelandum censuit, levamen se
percepturum, si in sinum amici talia effundat. Quo facto ab eodem amico serio
conmonitus, verae conversionis, Charitatisque exemplar oftenderet; liberaret
abimminenti discrimine, innocents tot Animas; In cujus monita lubens
consenserat, calamoque sequentia excipiendum dederat, exquibus Articuli nonita
pridem tuae Reverentiae oblati, luculenter explicari and demonstrari poterunt.

1. *Ante omnia, ut Cardo rei recipiatur, sciendum est, Omnes istas, quibus
tota Christianitas body concutitur, factiones, exoriri ab Iesuitica ista
Chamea Sobole, cujus quatuor per orbem luxuriant Ordines.

Primi Ordinis sunt Ecclesiastici, quorum Religionis promotoria est curare.

Secundi Ordinis sunt Politici, quorum officium est, statum Regnorum, Rerumque
publicarum, quoquomodo intentare, turbare, reformare.

Tertii Ordinis sunt Seculares, quorum proprium est, Regibus, Princibusque, ad
officia sese obtrudere insinuare, immiscere serebus forensibus, emptionibus,
venditionibusque, and quae civilia sunt occupari.

Quarti Ordinis Exploratores sunt, sortis inferioris homines, qui servitiis
Magnatum, Principum, Baronum, Nobilium, Civium, sese submittunt, animis
dominorum imposituri.

2. Tot Ordinum Societatem, Regnum Anglicanum alit: Vix enim tota Hispania,
Gallia and Italia tantam multitudinem Iesuitarum, quantam unicum Londinum,
exhibere posset: itbi plus quam 50 Scoti Iesuitae reperiuntur. Ibi sedem
iniquitatis dicta Societ as sibi elegit, Conspiravitque in Regem, Regique
fidelissimos, inprimis vero Dominum Archiepiscopum Cantuariensem, etiam in
Regnum utrumque.

3. Certo certius enim est; Determinasse Societatem nominatam, reformatione
universali Regnum Angliae tum Scotiae adficere; Determinatio ergo finis, infert
necessario determinationen mediorum ad finem.

4. Ad promovendum ergo susceptum scelus, Titulo, Congregationis Fidei
propagandae, dicta Societas sese insignivit: quae Caput Collegii Pontificem
Romanum, Substitutum, and Executorem, Cardinalem Barbarinum, agnoscit.

5. Patronus Societatis primarius, Londini, est Legatus Pontificius, qui curam
negotii gerit; in cujus sinum, foex illa proditorum omnia explorata
hebdomadatim depoint: Impetrata autem est Residentia Legationis istius Londini
Pontificis Romani nomine, quo mediante, Cardinali Barbarino, agere in Regem
Regnumque tanto tutius faciliusque liceret, Nullus enim alias, tam libere
ambire Regem posset, quam ille qui Pontificia Auctoritate palliatus sit.

6. Fungebatur tum temporis officio Legati Pontificii, Dominus Cuneus
Conjuratae Societatis Instrumentum universale, and serius negotii Promotor;
cujus secreta ut and aliorum exploratorum omnium, praesens virbonus,
communicator horum, excipiebat, expediebatque quo res postulabat.

Adoriebatur Cuneus, primaria Regni Capita, nihilque intentatum sivit, quomodo
singula corrumperet and ad partem Pontificiam inclinaret; variis incitamentis
plurimos alliciebat, Etiam Regem ipsum donationibus picturarum, Antiquitatum,
Idolorum, aliarumque vanitatum Roma allatarum, deludendum quaerebat, quae tamen
apud Regem nihil proficerant.

Familiaritate initia cum Rege, rogatur saepius Hantocurti, etiam Londini,
Palatini causam ageret, interponeretque auctoritatem suam, intercessione Legato
Coloniensi persuaderet, ut Palatinus in conditiones, proximis Comitiis de pace
acturis, infereretur, quod quidem pollicitus est; contrarium vero praestitit;
scripsit quidem, Rogatum sed de talibus ab Rege fuisse, non consul^re tamen, ut
consentiatur, ne ab Hispanis fortasse dicatur, Pontificem Romanum Principi
Haeretico patrocinatum fuisse.

Subolfecit interim Cuneus, ab Domino Archiepiscopo Regi fidelissimo, totum
animum Regium esse pendulum: Omnem se meturum lapidem, nervosque adplicaturum
statuerat, ut ad partem suam lucrari possit: Paratum se habere medium certo
confisus; Mandatum enim habebat, Pileum Cardinalem, nomine Pontificis Romani,
domino Archiepiscopo offerret, lactaretque pollicitis etiam sublimioribus, ut
animum sincerum corrumperet: Commoda tamen occasio nunquam dabatur, qua domino
Archiepiscopo sese insinuare posset (quaerebat enim Scorpius ovum) Per Comitem
and Comitissam Arondelianam, etiam per Secretarium Windebankum; liber accessus
impetrari debebat. Quorum omnium intercessionibus neglectis, sccietatem vel
familiaritatem Cunei peste pejus fugiebat; Persucdebatur etim ab aliis non
infimis, ipsi been notis, nec tamen commovebatur.

7. Quaerebatur and alius qui ad facinus detestandum accessum impediebat,
Secretarius Cook; erat is osor Iesuitarum infensissimus, quibus aditum ad Regem
intercipiebat, encipiebat plurimos promiretis, in illorum factiones, sedulo
inquirebat; quo nomine incitamentum omne, vim magniticam ad partem Pontificiam
spirans, erat apud ipsum inefficax, nihil enim tam carum erat, quod ipsum ad
pravum inclinasset: Hinc, Conjurationis Patronis exosus factus, periclitabatur
de officio ut exueretur, laborabatur per triennium, quod ultimo impetratum.

Mansit nihilominus ab part Regis, nodus solutu difficilis; Dominus
Archiepiscopus enim constantia sua, sicuti durissimum sese interposuit saxum.

Laborasse se incassum, ab part Domini Archiepiscopi Cuneus cum intellexisset,
efferbuit malitia ipsius, totiusque Societatis; mox insidiae parari caeperunt,
quibus dominus Archiepiscopus una cum Rege caperetur.

In Regem quoque (cujus gratia totum istud disponitur Negotium) a quo quia
nihil quod promovendae Religioni Papisticae inserviret speratur, (imprimis
vero, Cum animum suum aperuerit, se ejus opinionis esse, quemvis in Religione
sua dummodo vir probus and pius sit, Salvari posse) sententia lata est.

8. Ad perpetrandum susceptum facinus, executio criminalis Westmonasterii, per
scripta nonnulla Puritanorum causata, primi incendii ansam dedit, quae res ab
Papistis, apud Puritanos in tantum exacerbabatur, exaggerabaturque, ut si
inulta maneret, Religioni ipsis duceretur; cujus incendii, subsequens tandem
liber precum, flammas auxit.

9. In isto fervore expeditus fuit ad Scotos ab part Pontificia Comes quidam
Scotus Masfield, ni fallor nomine, cum quo, duo alii Comites Scoti Papistae,
correspondebant. Is commovere debebat plebem, injuriamque refricare ut animos
accenderet, ad arma precipitaret, quibus noxius libertatis Scoticae,
perimeretur Turbator.

10. Ibi una opera parati in Regem Casses, eo enim directum esse presens
negotium ut Anglorum complurimi sese adglutinarent Scotis; Rex armis maneret
inferior, qui ab Papistis auxilia petere cogeretur, quae tamen non impetraret,
nisi in conditiones discenderet, quibus libertatem universalem exercitii
Religionis Pontificiae, permitteret; ita enim res Papistarum ad nutum
succederent. Quo consensu si difficiliorem sese exhibuerit, remedium erit in
promptu: Adolescente enim cum primum Regio filio, (quia a teneris, ut parti
Pontificiae adsuescat educatur) de Rege actum est: Nux quippe Indica acutissimo
veneno referta in Societate servatur (quam Cuneus tum temporis gloriabundus
mihi oftentabat) quo Regi exemplo Patris, parabatur Pharmacum.

11. In ista Commotione Scotica Marquessa a Hamelton saepius Regis nomine ad
Scotos ablegatur, Regiam auctoritatem interponeret, qua aestus animorum
mitegaretur, sine fructu tamen, reque infecta toties reversus. Ipsius
Concionator tum temporis nos adiit, qui cum Cuneo secret nonnulla
Communicavit; Interrogatus a me, joco; Number etiam Judei cum Samaritanis
convenirent? Ad quoe Cuneus respondit, Utinam omnes ministri tales ut ipse
essent; conjiciatur hinc quidcunque.

12. Rebus sic stantibus, ab Cardinali Richelieu, Dominus Thomas Camerarius,
Sacellanus and Eleemosinarius ipsius, natione Scotus, Londinum adpulit; Qui
Collegio Societatis conjuratae adsidere debebat, remque serio agere, nihil
intentatum relinquere, quo primus exasperaretur fervor. Quo officio honorarium
Episcopatus erat ipsi pollicitum. Conhabita^ bat and Societate per quatuor
Menses, nec prius discedendum licebat, donec rebus ex voto cedentibus, cum
bonis novis redux fieri possit.

13. Cavalliero Tobias Mathei Sacerdos Iesuita, ordinis politicorum, e
capitibus primariis homo vigilantissimus, cui nunquam tam charum cubile, quo
caput reclivet; ad sellam tantum, hora una, atque altera, somno corpus reficit;
nec diei nec nocti machinamentis parcit, vir sum noxius and ipsa Regis,
Regnique Angliae Pestis, homo impudentissimus, qui per omnia convivia,
epulasque, vocatus vel non vocatus, volitat; nunquam quietus, semper in
action, motuque perpetuo, singulis Conversationibus Superiorum immiscuit,
urget familiarie colloquia, ut animos hominum expiscaretur: Quicquid inde ad
parts Conjuratorum commodi vel incommodi concernere advertit, Legato
Pontificio communicate, Secretiora ipse ad Pontificem vel Cardinalem Barbarinum
perscribit. In summa, cuivis Societati sese adglutinat, nullum verbum effari
potest, quod ipse non arripiat and ad parts suas accommodet. Quicquid interea
temporis expiscatus, in catalogum redigit, and quavis Aestate ad Consistorium
generale Iesuitarum Politicorum quod in Provincia Uallensi secreto concurrit,
hospes acceptus defert. Ibi tacit consilia cuduntur quae ad convulsionem
status Ecclesiastici, tum Politici, Regni utriusque sunt aptissima.

14. Capitaneus Reda Scotus, habitans in platea Longaker, prope Tabernam
Angeli, Iesuita Secularis, qui ob detestandum officium praestitum (quo
Ministrum quendam Ecclesiae, incitamentis dulcibus ad Religionem Papisticam,
tota cum familia ipsius perverterat, filia ipsius in uxorem ducta) pro repensa
obtinuit reditus vel vectigal Butyraceum, quod Rustici sibi praestare tenentur,
adquisitum ipsi ab Rege, per non nullos Societatis praecipuos; cui stimulus
nunquam deficit, quo in officio constans detineatur. In ipsius aedibus
Reitotius peragitur Negotium, ubi Societas quoe in Regem and Dominum
Archiepiscopum, Regnumque utrumque conjuravit* plerumque diebus singulis
concurrit; Die vero expeditionis Tabellarii, quae ordinary est dies Veneris,
tanto frequentiores, tum enim omnes exploratores convenient, quae quisque ea
hebdomada expiscatus est, in commune conferunt; qui ut extra suspicionem sint,
secreta sua per Tobiam Matthei vel ipsum Redam, ad Legatum Pontificium
amandant; ipse fasciculum compactum, quem ab exploratoribus nundinatus est,
Romam transmittit.

Apud eundem Redam deponuntur literae Roma illatae, sub titulis and nominibus
fictis, quae per ipsum singulis ad quos spectant traduntur, illorum enim omnium
and singulorum nomina ipsi sunt cognita.

Eadem ipsa occasion adferuntur etiam literae, sub coperta Patris Philippi
(ipso tamen rerum nescio) a quo conjurat^s distribuuntur.

Habetur in illis ipsis aedibus Sacellum publicum, quo Iesuita ordinarius
consecrat, ibidemque habitat. In dicto Sacello Missae celebrantur quotidie a
Iesuitis; Baptismoque liberis domesticis and nonnullorum conjuratorum
inservitur.

Qui in nominat is aedibus concurrunt, Rhedis vel Equis, frequenter habitu
Politico, magnoque Comitatu, quo palliantur ne innotescant, Iesuitae tamen
sunt, and membra Societatis conjurata.

15. Hoc caetui contribuitur ab omnibus Papistis Angliae, ne quidquam ad
promovendum susceptum negotium deficiat. In quem fiscum, unica Vidua,
proprietaria olim aedium quas modo Secretarius Windebank inhabitat, ante
triennium defuncta, 400000 librarum Anglicacarum contulit; sic and alii etiam
citra vires faciunt, modo ad optatum finem promoveatur negotium.

16. Praeter nominatas Aedes, etiam per alia loca secretiora fiunt
Conventicula, de quibus ne inter se quidem fidunt, metu ne dispertiantur.
Convocantur primo ad certa diversoria singuli, (alter alterius inscius) hinc
per exploratores ad locum ubi convenire debent, singuli deducuntur, ignari
alias ubi conventuri sint, ne forte insperato obruantur.

17. Comitissa d'Arondel, strenua Pontificiae Religionis Propugnatrix, ad
Reformationem Universalem omnes nervos intendit: quicquid ad aulam Regis,
secret vel aperte, verbis vel factis geritur, Legato Pontificio insinuat, cum
quo ad minimum ter de die, modo in Aedibus Arondelianis, jam ad Aulam, vel
Tarthalae cum ipso congreditur; Ex ungue talia vix exsug it.

Ipse Comes vocatus jam a triennio, hoc anno ire debebat Romam, acturus ibi
dubio procul de seriis, Negotium concernentibus.

Donis dictionibusque suis, Iesuitae Missis invigilant.

Grinvici, impensis Comitis, Schola Foeminea sustentatur; quae alias
Monasterium Monialium est; Adultae enim inibi Iuvenculae, hinc inde per extera
transmarina Monasteria emittuntur.

18. Dominus Porter, Cubicularius Regins, Pontificiae Religioni addictissimus,
Regis infensus hostis: Is ipsius secretissima quaeque Legato Pontificio aperit,
quamvis rarissime cum ipso conveniat; uxor tanto saepius, quae ab Marito
informata, Legato secreta confidit. In omnibus suis actionibus Tobiae Mathaei
nihil cedit; effari non potest qualiter negotio invigilet.

Filii ipsius in Religione Pontificia occulte informantur, aperte Reformatam
profitentur. Major natu Officium Patris suscepturus, sub Rege futuro; Alteri,
si negotium been successerit, pileus Cardinalis paratus est.

Ante triennium ablegari debebat dictus Dominus Porter a Rege Morocum;
prohibitus fuit ab Societate, ne moram pateretur Negotium.

Patronus est Iesuitarum, quibus adexercitium Religionis, Sacella domi forisque
subministrat.

19. Secretarius Windebank, Papista acerrimus, Regi omnium infidelissimus, qui
non solum secretissima etiam quaeque Regia prodit and revelat, sed etiam
consilia quibus optime Negotio consuleretur communicate. Ipse ad minimum ter in
hebdomada, per nocturna conventicula cum Legato conversatur; injungitque quae
scitu digna cogitat: cujus causa, aedes vicinas Legati demo conduxit, quem
saepius per portam horti adit, hac enim vicinitate facilitatur congressus.

Dictus Secretarius ad partem Societatis conjuratae muneribus emptus, est,
quibus sustentatur, ut magis serio officium peragat.

Filium suum express Romam misit, qui Romano Pontifici sese insinuare debebit.

20. Cavalliero Digby, Cavalliero Winter, Dominus Mountagu junior, qui Romae
fuit, Milord Sterling, Cognatus Comitis d' Arondel, Eques, Comitissa de
Neuport, Ducissa Buckingham, and plerique alii qui in Conspirationem hanc
jurarunt, omnes in opere sunt vigilantissimi. Horum alii, Aulicorum, alii
Politicorum officiorum spe inescantur: Alii ad sexdecim pileos Cardinalium
vacantes attendunt, qui ideo ab aliquot annis otiosi detinentur, ut spem vanam
expectantibus imponant.

21. Praeses nominatae Societatis erat Mi-lord Gage, Sacerdos Iesuita, ante
triennium defunctus. Habebat is palatium lascivis Picturis exornatum, quae
prophanitatem in aedibus mentiebantur; palliabatur vero illis Monasterium, quo
quadraginta Moniales sustentabantur, tanto Palatio occultatae; Situm est in
Platea Reginae, quam statua Reginae aurea decorat. Istam Plateam totam,
Iesuitae seculares emerunt, redegeruntque in quadratum, ubi tacit Collegium
Iesuiticum exstruitur, ea spe, ut quam primum, Reformatione universali incepta,
aperte elaborari possit.

Legatus Pontificius triplici Characters sive Cifra utitur: Uno, quo cum
omnibus Nunciis communicate: Altero cum solo Cardinale Barbarino: Tertio, quo
secretiora nonnulla communicanda occultat.

Quaecunque per hebdomadam ab Societate aut aliis Explor atoribus excepit, illa
uno fasciculo consarcinat, sub inscriptione, Al Monsignor Stravio Archidiacono
di Cambray, dedicat: ab quo tandem promoventur Romae.

His it a constitutis, si singula ad trutinam ponantur, satisfiet in specie
omnibus articulis propositis.

1. COnjuratio in Regem and Dominum Archiepiscopum detegitur; Media quibus
exitium utrique minatur, demonstratur. 2. Pericula Regno utrique imminentia
recensentur. 3. Exortus incendii illius Scotici and progressus enarratur. 4.
Media quibus turbae istae Scoticae sedari possint, suggeruntur; postquam enim
resciverint Scoti, a quibus and in quem finem animi ipsorum accendantur,
consulent sibi propere; neque utriusque partis vires succumbere sinent; ne
medius sese interponat qui utramque quaerit. 5. Quo ense Regis petatur jugulum,
etiam turbis istis sopitis, Cunei Confessio, oculataque demonstratio, docet. 6.
Locus Congregationis in aedibus Capitanei Redae nominatur. 7. Dies expeditionis
octiduae per Redam and Legatum injungitur. 8. Quomodo nomina conjuratorum
innotescere possent. 9. Ubi tota ista Congregatio possit circumveniri. 10.
Infideles nonnulli ab part Regis praecipuorum de nomine notificantur; plures,
quorum nomina non occurrunt, habitationes tamen notae sunt; de nomine facile ab
Reda extorqueri poterunt.
Si caute in his procedatur, nervus totius negotii in apricum prodibit; ita
Sagitta praevisa, effugietur periculo, quod ut succcdat prospere, Creator
Omnipotens faxit.

Most illustrious and Reverend Lord.
WE have willingly and cordially perceived, that our offers have been
acceptable both to his Royal Majesty, and likewise to your Grace. This is the
only Index to us, That the blessing of God is present with you, whereby a spur
is given, that we should so much the more cheerfully and freely utter and
detect those things whereby the hazard of both your lives, the subversion of
the Realm and State both of England and Scotland, the tumbling down of his
Excellent Majesty from his Throne, is intended. Now least the Discourse should
be enlarged with superfluous circumstances, we will only premise some things
which are merely necessary to the business.

They may first of all know, that this good man, by whom the ensuing things are
detected, was born and bred in the Popish Religion, who spent many years in
Ecclesiastical dignities. At length being found fit for the expedition of the
present Design, by the Counsel and mandate of the Lord Cardinal Barbarino, he
was adjoined to the assistance of Mr. Cuneus (Cun) by whom he was found so
diligent and sedulous in his Office, that hope of great promotion was given to
him. Yet he, led by the instinct of the good Spirit, has, howsoever it be,
contemned sweet promises, and having known the vanities of the Pontifician
Religion (of which he had sometime been a most severe defender) having likewise
noted the malice of those who fight under the Popish banner, felt his
Conscience to be burdened; which burden that he might ease himself of, he
converted his mind to the Orthodox Religion. Soon after, that he might
exonerate his Conscience, he thought fit that a desperate Treason, machinated
against so many souls, was to be revealed, and that he should receive ease if
he vented such things into the bosom of a friend: which done, he was seriously
admonished by the said friend, that he should show an example of his conversion
and charity, and free so many innocent souls from imminent danger. To whose
monitions he willingly consented, and delivered the following things to be put
in writing, out of which the Articles not long since tendered to your Grace,
may be clearly explicated and demonstrated.

1. First of all, that the hinge of the business may be rightly discerned, It
is to be known, that all those factions with which all Christendom is at this
day shaken, do arise from the Jesuitical offspring of Cham, of which four
Orders abound throughout the world.

Of the first Order are Ecclesiastics, whose office it is to take care of
things promoting Religion.

Of the second Order are Politicians, whose office it is by any means to shake,
trouble, reform the state of Kingdoms and Republics.

Of the third Order are Seculars, whose property it is to obtrude themselves
into Offices with Kings and Princes, to insinuate and immix themselves in Court
businesses, bargains and sales, and to be busied in civil affairs.

Of the fourth Order are Intelligencers (or Spies) men of inferior condition,
who submit themselves to the services of great men, Princes, Barons, Noblemen,
Citizens, to deceive (or corrupt) the minds of their masters.

2. A Society of so many Orders, the Kingdom of England nourishes: for scarce
all Spain, France and Italy, can yield so great a multitude of Jesuits, as
London alone: where are found more than 50 Scottish Jesuits. There the said
Society has elected to it self a seat of iniquity, and has conspired against
the King, and the most faithful to the King, especially the Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, and likewise against both Kingdoms.

3. For it is more certain than certainty it self, that the forenamed Society
has determined to effect a universal Reformation of the Kingdom of England and
Scotland. Therefore the determination of the end necessarily infers a
determination of means to the end.

4. Therefore to promote the undertaken Villainy, the said Society dubbed it
self with the Title of, The Congregation of propagating the Faith; which
acknowledges the Pope of Rome the Head of the College, and Cardinal Barbarino
his Substitute and Executor.

5. The chief Patron of the Society at London, is the Popes Legate, who takes
care of the business; into whose bosom, these dregs of Traitors weekly deposite
all their Intelligences. Now the Residence of this Legation was obtained at
London, in the name of the Roman Pontife, by whose meditation it might be
lawful for Cardinal Barbarino, to work so much the more easily and safely upon
the King and Kingdom. For none else could so freely circumvent the King, as he
who should be palliated with the Popes Authority.

6. Master Cuneus did at that time enjoy the Office of the Popes Legate, a
universal Instrument of the conjured Society, and a serious Promoter of the
business; whose secrets, as likewise those of all the other Intelligencers, the
present good man, the Communicator of all these things, did receive and
expedite whether the business required.

Cuneus set upon the chief men of the Kingdom, and left nothing unattempted, by
what means he might corrupt them all, and incline them to the Pontifician
Party: he enticed many with various incitements; yea, he sought to delude the
King himself with gifts of Pictures, Antiquities, Idols, and of other vanities
brought from Rome; which yet would prevail nothing with the King.

Having entered familiarity with the King, he is often requested at
Hampton Court, likewise at London, to undertake the cause of the Palatine, and
that he would interpose his Authority, and by his intercession persuade the
Legate of Colen, that the Palatine in the next Diet to treat of Peace, might be
inserted into the Conditions; which verily he promised, but performed the
contrary. He writ indeed, that he had been so desired by the King concerning
such things; yet he advised not that they should be consented to, lest
peradventure it might be said by the Spaniard, that the Pope of Rome had
patronized an Heretical Prince.

In the mean time, Cuneus smelling from the Archbishop, most trusty to the
King, that the Kings mind was wholly pendulous (or doubtful) Resolved, that he
would move every stone, and apply his forces, that he might gain him to his
Party: certainly confiding, that he had a means prepared. For he had a command
to offer a Cardinals Cap to the Lord Archbishop, in the name of the Pope of
Rome, and that he should allure him also with higher promises, that he might
corrupt his sincere mind. Yet a fitting occasion was never given, whereby he
might insinuate himself into the Lord Archbishop (for the Scorpion sought an
Egg) Free access was to be impetrated by the Earl and Countess of Arundel,
likewise by Secretary Windebank. The intercession of all which being neglected,
he did fly the company or familiarity of Cuneus worse than the plague. He was
likewise persuaded by other of no mean rank, well known to him, neither yet was
he moved.

7. Another also was assayed, who hindered access to the detestable wickedness,
Secretary Cook; he was a most bitter hater of the Jesuits, from whom he
intercepted access to the King; he entertained many (of them) according to
their deserts, he diligently enquired into their Factions; by which means,
every incitement, breathing a magnetical (attractive) power to the Popish
Party, was ineffectual with him; for nothing was so dear unto him that might
incline him to wickedness. Hereupon being made odious to the Patrons of the
Conspiracy, he was endangered to be discharged from his Office; it was labored
for three years space, and at last obtained.

Yet notwithstanding there remained on the Kings part a knot hard to be untied;
for the Lord Archbishop, by his constancy, interposed himself as a most hard
Rock.

When Cuneus had understood, from the Lord Archbishops part, that he had
labored in vain, his malice, and the whole Societies, waxed boiling hot. Soon
after Ambushes began to be prepared, wherewith the Lord Archbishop, together
with the King, should be taken.

Likewise a Sentence is passed against the King (for whose sake all this
business is disposed) because nothing is hoped from him, which might seem to
promote the Popish Religion (but especially, when he had opened his mind, that
he was of this opinion, that every one might be saved in his own Religion, so
as he be an honest and pious man.)

8. To perpetuate the Treason undertaken, the criminal execution at
Westminster, caused by some Writings of Puritans, gave occasion of the first
fire: which thing was so much exasperated and exagarated by the Papists to the
Puritans, that if it remained unrevenged, it would be thought a blemish to
their Religion. The flames of which fire, the subsequent Book of Prayers
increases.

9. In this heat, a certain Scottish Earl, called Maxfield, if I mistake not,
was expedited to the Scots by the Popish Party; with whom two other Scottish
Earls, Papists, held correspondency: he ought to stir up the People to
commotion, and rub over the injury afresh, that he might inflame their minds,
precipitate them to Arms, by which the hurtful disturber of the Scottish liberty
might be slain.

10. There, by one labor, snares are prepared for the King; for this purpose
the present business was so ordered, that very many of the English should
adhere to the Scots; That the King should remain inferior in Arms, who
(thereupon) should be compelled to crave assistance from the Papists; which yet
he should not obtain, unless he would descend into conditions, by which he
should permit; Universal liberty of the exercise of the Popish Religion; for so
the affairs of the Papists would succeed according to their desire. To which
consent, if he should show himself more difficult, there should be a present
remedy at hand: For the Kings son growing now very fast to his youthful age
(who is educated from his tender age, that he might accustom himself to the
Popish Party) the King is to be dispatched: For an Indian Nut stuffed with most
sharp poison, is kept in the Society (which Cuneus at that time showed often to
me in a boasting manner) wherein a poison was prepared for the King: after the
example of his Father.

11. In this Scottish Commotion, the Marquess of Hamelton, was often dispatched
to the Scots in the name of the King, to interinterpose the Royal Authority,
whereby the heat of minds might be mitigated, returned notwithstanding as often
without fruit, and without ending the business: His Chaplain at that time
repaired to us, who communicated some things secrely with Cuneus. Being
demanded of me in jest, Whether also the Jews agreed with the Samaritans?
Cuneus thereunto answered; Would to God all Ministers were such as he: what you
will, may be hence conjectured.

12. Things standing thus, there arrived at London from Cardinal Richelieu, Mr.
Thomas Chamberlain, his Chaplain and Almoner, a Scot by nation, who ought to
assist the College of the confederated Society, and seriously to set forward
the business, to leave nothing unattempted, whereby the first heat might be
exasperated. For which service he was promised the reward of a Bishopric. He
cohabited with the Society four months space; neither was it lawful for him
first to depart, until things succeeding according to his wish, he might be
able to return back again with good news.

13. Sir Toby Matthew, a Jesuited Priest, of the Order of Politicians, a most
vigilant man of the chief heads, to whom a bed was never so dear, that he would
rest his head thereon, refreshing his body with sleep in a chair for an hour or
two, neither day nor night spared his machinations; a man principally noxious,
and himself the Plague of the King and Kingdom of England; a most impudent man,
who flies to all banquets, and feasts, called or not called! never quiet,
always in action and perpetual motion! thrusting himself into all conversations
of Superiors; he urges conferences familiarly, that he may fish out the minds
of men, what ever he observes thence, which may bring any commodity or
discommodity to the part of the Conspirators, he communicates to the Popes
Legate: The more secret things he himself writes to the Pope, or to Cardinal
Barbarino. In sum, he adjoyns himself to any man's company; no word can be
spoken, that he will not lay hold on, and accommodate to his party. In the mean
time, what ever he has fished out, he reduces into a Catalogue, and every
Summer carries it to the General Consistory of the Jesuits Politics, which
secretly meets together in the Province of Wales, where he is an acceptable
guest. There counsels are secretly hammered, which are most meet for the
convulsion of the Ecclesiastic and Politic estate of both Kingdoms.

14. Captain Read, a Scot, dwelling in Longacre-street, near the Angel-Tavern,
a Secular Jesuit, who for his detestable office performed (whereby he had
perverted a certain Minister of the Church, with secret incitements to the
Popish Religion, with all his Family, taking his Daughter to Wife) for a
recompense, obtained a Rent or Impost upon Butter, which the Country people
are bound to render to him, procured for him from the King, by some chief men
of the Society, who never want a spur, whereby he may be constantly detained in
his office. In his house the business of the whole Plot is concluded, where the
Society which has conspired against the King, the Lord Archbishop, and both
Kingdoms, meet together, for the most part every day; but on the day of the
Carriers (or Posts) dispatch, which is ordinarily Friday, they meet in greater
numbers; for then all the Intelligencers assemble, and confer in common, what
things every of them has fished out that week; who that they may be without
suspicion, send their secrets by Toby Matthew, or Read himself, to the Popes
Legate; he transmits the compacted Packet, which he has purchased from the
Intelligencers, to Rome.

With the same Read, the Letters brought from Rome are deposited, under seigned
Titles and Names, who by him are delivered to all to whom they appertain: for
all and every of their names are known to him.

Upon the very same occasion, Letters also are brought hither under the covert
of Father Philip, (he notwithstanding being ignorant of things) from whom they
are distributed to the Conspirators.

There is in that very house a public Chapel, wherein an ordinary Jesuit
consecrates, and dwells there. In the said Chapel Masses are daily celebrated
by the Jesuits; and it serves for the baptizing of the Children of the house,
and of some of the Conspirators.

Those who assemble in the forenamed house, come frequently in Coaches, or on
Horsback in Laymens habit, and with a great train, wherewith they are
disguised, that they may not be known; yet they are Jesuits, and conjured
Members of the Society.

15. All the Papists of England contribute to this Assembly, lest any thing
should be wanting to promote the undertaken design. Upon whose Treasury, one
Widow, Owner of the Houses wherein Secretary Windebank now dwells, dead above
three years since, bestowed four hundred thousand English pounds; so likewise
others contributed above their abilities, so as the business may be promoted
unto its desired end.

16. Besides the foresaid Houses, there are also Conventicles kept in other
more secret places, of which verily they confide not even among themselves, for
fear lest they should be discovered. First, every of them are called to certain
Inns, (one not knowing of the other) hence they are severally led by Spies to
the place where they ought to meet, otherwise ignorant where they ought to
assemble, lest peradventure they should be surprised at unawares.

17. The Countess of Arundel, a strenuous She-Champion of the Popish Religion,
bends all her Nerves to the Universal Reformation; whatsoever she hears at the
Kings Court, that is done secretly or openly, in words or deeds, she presently
imparts to the Popes Legate, with whom she meets thrice a day, sometimes in
Arundel-house, now at the Court, or at Tart-hall. He scarce sucks such things
by the Claw.

The Earl himself, called now about three years since, this year ought to go to
Rome, without doubt to consult there of serious things, concerning the design.

With gifts and speeches, the Jesuits watch diligently to their Masses.

At Greenwich at the Earls costs, a Feminine School is maintained, which
otherwise is a Monastery of Nuns; for the young Girls therein are sent forth
hither and thither into Foreign Monasteries beyond the Seas.

18. Mr. Porter of the Kings Bedchamber, most addicted to the Popish Religion,
is a bitter enemy of the King: He reveals all his greatest secrets to the Popes
Legate; although he very rarely meets with him, yet his Wife meets him so much
the oftener, who being informed by her Husband, conveys secrets to the Legate. In
all his actions he is nothing inferior to Toby Matthew: it cannot be uttered
how diligently he watches on the business.

His Sons are secretly instructed in the Popish Religion; openly they profess
the Reformed. The eldest is now to receive his Fathers Office, under the King
which shall be: a Cardinals Hat is provided for the other, if the Design shall
succeed well.

Above three years past, the said Mr. Porter was to be sent away by the King to
Morocco: but he was prohibited by the Society, lest the business should suffer
delay thereby.

He is a Patron of the Jesuits, for whom, for the exercise of Religion, he
provides Chapels both at home and abroad.

Secretary Windebank, a most fierce Papist, is the most unfaithful to the King
of all men, who not only betrays and reveals even the Kings greatest secrets,
but likewise communicates Counsels, by which the Design may be best advanced.
He at least thrice every week converseth with the Legate in Nocturnal
Conventicles, and reveals those things which he thinks fit to be known; for
which end, he hired a house near to the Legates house, whom he often resorts to
through the Garden door; for by this vicinity the meeting is facilitated.

The said Secretary is bribed with gifts to the party of that conjured Society,
by whom he is sustained, that he may the more seriously execute his Office.

He sent his Son expressly to Rome, who ought to insinuate himself into the
Roman Pontif.

20. Sir Digby, Sir Winter, Mr. Mountague the younger, who has been at Rome,
my Lord Sterling, a Cousin of the Earl of Arundels, a Knight, the Countess of
Neuport, the Duchess of Buckingham, and many others, who have sworn unto this
Conspiracy, are all most vigilant in the design. Some of these are enticed with
the hope of Court, others of Political Offices; others attend to the sixteen
Cardinals Caps that are vacant, which are therefore detained idle for some
years, that they may impose a vain hope on those who expect them.

21. The President of the aforesaid Society was my Lord Gage, a Jesuit Priest,
dead above three years since. He had a Palace adorned with lascivious Pictures,
which counterfeited profaneness in the house; but with them was palliated a
Monastery wherein forty Nuns were maintained, hid in so great a Palace. It is
situated in Queenstreet, which the Statue of a golden Queen adorns. The Secular
Jesuits have bought all this Street, and have reduced it into a Quadrangle,
where a Jesuitical College is tacitly built, with this hope, that it might be
openly finished, as soon as the universal Reformation was begun.

The Popes Leget uses a threefold Character or Cipher; O ne wherewith he
communicates with all Nuncioes; Another with Cardinal Barbarino only: A third,
wherewith he covers some greater secrets to be communicated.

Whatsoever things he either receives from the Society or other Spies, those
he packs up together in the bundle, dedicated under this Inscription: To
Monsieur Stravio Archdeacon of Cambray: from whom at last they are promoted to
Rome.

These things being thus ordered, if every thing be laid to the balance, it
will satisfy in special all the articles propounded.

WHEREIN,
1. THE Conspiracy against the King and Lord Archbishop is detected, and the
means whereby ruin is threatened to both, demonstrated. 2. The imminent dangers
to both Kingdoms are rehearsed. 3. The rise and progress of that Scottish fire
is related. 4. Means whereby these Scottish troubles may be appeased, are
suggested: for after the Scots shall know by whom and to what end their minds
are incensed, they will speedily look to themselves, neither will they suffer
the forces of both parts to be subdued, lest a middle party interpose, which
seeks the ruin of both. 5. With what sword the Kings throat is assaulted, even
when these stirs shall be ended, Cuneus his confession, and a visible
demonstration, shows. 6. The place of the Assembly in the house of Captain
Read is nominated. 7. The day of the eight days dispatch by Read and the Legate
is prescribed. 8. How the names of the Conspirators may be known. 9. Where this
whole Congregation may be circumvented. 10. Some of the Principal unfaithful
ones of the Kings party are notified by name; many of whose names occur not,
yet their habitations are known; theirnames may be easily extorted from Read.
If these things be warily proceeded in, the strength of the whole business
will be brought to light; so the arrow being foreseen, the danger shall be
avoided; which that it may prosperously succeed, the Omnipotent Creator grant.

Boswell, to discover against the King and State.
