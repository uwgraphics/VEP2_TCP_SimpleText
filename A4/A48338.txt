The Sincere Man's Supplication.
Excess of Wealth, (Great powerful God!)
I do not wish to see;
Extreme of Want, and Poverty,
Inflict not (Lord) on me:
Since that the one Exalts too high,
The other brings too low;
A Mean therefore for Nature's need,
Great King of Kings bestow.

An Explanation of the first Table.
THE first Table consists of three parts, each part containing Ten Rows or
Columns; the first is of Single Pounds by the Year, beginning at One Pound, and
so on, 2 l. 3 l. 4 l. etc. to 9 l. by the year. -- The second Part is Tens of
Pounds, beginning with 10 l. and so on 20 l. 30 l. 40 l. etc. to 90 l. by the
year. -- The third part is of Hundreds of Pounds, beginning at 100 l. and so on
200 l. 300 l. etc. to 900 l. by the year.

In the first Row or Column of either of these three parts, that toward the
left hand, has in the uppermost lines thereof these words Pounds by the Year,
in the next line under Half Year, and in the next Quarter of a Year. Then under
these you have 12.11.10.9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1. Which are Weeks -- And in the last
Line you have, By the Day. And this Distinction is used in all the three parts
of the Table. Thus for the Description: now for

The Use of the first Table.
I shall explain the use of this Table by these few Questions following,
although infinite might be proposed.

Quest. I. If I spend 7 l. in the year, how much is that in 9 Weeks.

Look in the first part of the Table (because your Sum is under 10 l.) at the
head thereof, for 7 l. which you shall find in the Eighth Column, then look
down that Row or Column till you come to that Line which stands against 9
Weeks in the first Column, and in that Line you shall find 1 l. 4 s. 2 d. 2 q
and so much do you spend in 9 Weeks.

Likewise if you would know how much it is in 8 weeks, it is 1 l. 1 s. 10 d. 2

Quest. 2. If I have an Annuity of 30 l. a year, to receive the same by monthly
payments how much must I receive every Month ^

Look in the second part of the Table for 30 l. which you shall find in the
fourth Column, then look down that Column till you come against 4 Weeks, (which
is a Month) in the first Column, and in that line you shall find 2 l. 6 s. 1 d.

Quest. 3. If I design to spend in Housekeeping a 100 l. a year, how much must

years end.

Quest. 4. If I spend 384 l. a year, how much do I spend in 6 Weeks.

In your Table you cannot find 384 l. in one Sum, therefore you must enter the
Table in 3 places; first you shall find that 300 l. a year in 6 Weeks is 34 l.
12 s. 3 d. 2 q. and 80 l. a year in 6 Weeks, is 9 l. 4 s. 7 d. 1 q. and 4 l. a
year in 6 Weeks is 9 s. 2 d. all which added together, as here you see done,
amounts to 44 l. 6 s. 0 d. 3 q. and so much do you spend in 6 Weeks.

Look in your Table for 40 l. at the head thereof, and seek in that Column for
3 l. 16 s. 11 d. which you shall find to stand against 5 Weeks in the first
Column, and for so long time will the 3 l. 16 s. 11 d. discharge the Interest

Many other Questions might be proposed which may be answered by this Table,
but he that can do these here proposed may frame many more, and apply the Table
to almost what use he pleases, either in Buying or Selling, etc.

The Explanation of the second Table.
THis Table consists of Five Rows or Columns; in the first thereof, there is
from One Farthing to One Penny; then from one Penny to one Shilling; and from one
Shilling to Twenty Shillings, or one Pound, by the day -- Then in the 4 other
Columns you have at so much a day, what by the Week, Month, Quarter, and Year.

The Use of this Table.
Question 1. At one Farthing a Day how much is that a Week, a Month, a Quarter,
and a Year.

Look in the first Column for one Farthing, and right against it in the second,
you shall find 1 d. 3 q. and so much a Farthing a day is by the Week. In the
third Column you shall find 7 d. and so much it is a Month, -- In the fourth
you shall find 1 s. 10 d. 3 q. so much it is by the Quarter -- and in the last
Column you shall find 7 s. 7 d. 1 q and so much is one Farthing by the day at
the years end.

Quest. 2. At 9 d. the day, how much by the Week, Month, Quarter and Year?

Look 9 d. among the pence, against which you shall find 5 s. 3 d. the week, 1
l. 1 s. the Month, 3 l. 8 s. 3 d. the Quarter, and 13 l. 13 s. 9 d. the year.

Quest. 3. At 15 s. the day, how much by the Week, Month, Quarter, and Year?

Look for 15 s. among the Shillings, against which you shall find 5 l. 5 s. the
Week, 21 l. the Month, 68 l. 5 s. the Quarter, and 273 l. 15 s. the year.

Qu. 4. At 9 s. 7 d. 3 q. by the Day, what is that by the Week, Month, Quarter,
and Year?

Take them severally out of the Table, and you shall find them as follows.

Answer. 9 s. 7 d. 3 q. by the Week. Month. Quarter. Year. 3 3 0 0 12 12 0 0 40
19 0 0 164 5 0 0 0 4 1 0 0 16 4 0 2 13 1 0 10 12 11 0 0 0 5 1 0 1 9 0 0 5 8 0 1
2 9 3 3 7 6 1 13 10 1 0 43 17 9 0 176 0 8 3 By this you see, that 9 s. 7 d. 3
q. by the days, is 3 l. 7 s. 6 d. 1 q. by the Week, 13 l. 10 s. 1 d. 0 q. by
the Month 43 l. 17 s. 9 d. by the Quarter, and 176 l. 0 s 8 d. 3 q. by the Year.

The Use of the Third Table of Interest at 6 l. per Cent.
You may find in the first Row or Column of this Table any number of Pounds
from One to Ten, also from 10 to an 100, and from 100 to a 1000 l. the use
whereof is thus: Having found your Sum in the first Column, in the second you
have the Interest thereof for one Month, in the third for 2 Months, in the
fourth for 3 Months, in the fifth for 6 Months, in the sixth for 9 Months, and
in the last for a Year.

Example 1. Let it be required to find the Interest of 60 l. for 9 Months.

If you look in that Column which has IX Months, at the head thereof, in that
line which stands against 60 l. in the first Column, you shall find 2 l. 14
s. and such is the Interest of 60 l. for 9 Months. And thus may you find the
Interest thereof for 3 Months to be 18 s. and for a year 3 l. 12 s.

Examp. 2. If it were required to find the Interest of 80 l. for 8 Months.

First, find the Interest of 80 l. for 6 Months, which is 2 l. 8 s. Then find
the Interest thereof for 2 Months which is 16 s. these added together, make 3
l. 4 s. and so much is the Interest of 80 l. for 8 Months.

Examp. 3. Let it be required to find the Interest of 125 l. for 6 Months.

First, find the Interest of 100 l. for 6 Months, which is 3 l. then the
Interest for 20 l. for 6 Months is 1.2 s. and the Interest for 5. for 6 Months
is 3 s. these three added together, make 3 l. 15 s. 0 d. the Interest of 125 l.
for 6 Months.

l. l. s. d. The Interest of 100 for 6 Mo. 3 0 0 20 for 6 Mo. 0 12 0 5 for 6
Mo. 0 3 0 The Interest of 25 l. for 6 M. 3 15 0.

The Use of the Fourth Table.
Quest. 1. What is the Purchase of 13 years of Fre-hold-Land worth in ready
money?

Look in the fifth Table (in the first Column thereof) for 13 years, against
which you shall find 9, 5, which is 9 years and 5 Months Purchase, and so much
it is worthin ready money.

So that if the Land be worth 20 l. a year, the Purchase of a Lease of 13 years
will be worth 9 times 20 l. that is, 180 l. and 5 Months Purchase more, which
is 8 l. 6 s. 8 d. in all 188 l. 6 s. 8 d.

Quest. 2. What is the Purchase of a Lease of a House of 35 l. 10 s. a year,
for 19 years to come, worth in ready money?

Look in the first Column of the second Table for 19 years, against which you
shall find 8.4. which is 8 years and 4 Months Purchase.

So that the Purchase will be worth 8 times 35 l. 10 s. and 4 Months Purchase
more. Now 8 times 35 l. 10 s. is 284 l. and 4 Months is 4 l. 2 s. in all 298 l.
2 s. and so much is it worth in ready money.
