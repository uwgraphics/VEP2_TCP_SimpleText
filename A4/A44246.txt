OXFORD, Printed by Will. Hall, for the Author.

Anno MDCLXI.

TO The Worthily Honored, the Virtuous and Learned Sr. RICHARD BROWN, Knight
and Baronet, one of the Clerks of his MAJESTY'S Most Honorable Privy Council.
Noble Sr.
THe Remembrance of Just Delight delights; which as it is an acknowledged Truth
in Nature; so especially in the nature of knowledge. This at this time of Joy
and Happiness for our Return to these blessings, under our greatest blessing,
our most gracious Sovereign, aptly prompts to a Repetition of those Studies,
to which the Love and Prudence of your Eminent Father promoted your Youth and
my Industry about forty years since, in your Academical Institution. The
Improvement whereof as your Wisdom has showed in additions of Persevering
Loyally, weighty Employment and Nineteen Years Absence from your dear Country:
So in the Importunity of the late wars and opinions, some addition, I have
made of After-studies in the defense of Religion and Arts. With a necessary
variety therefore from the singularities of the Divine Power and Wisdom, I
here present the Thea^^er of Providence, in some things strange, in All
warrantable, by testimony of Men famous among Heathens and Christians. Which
diligence may be to some a Direction for Choice and Censure; to Others no
uncourteou^^ Recollection of their Own Thoughts. And as they were a Summer's
recreations of my Age, cast thus into the Fashion of Ancient Memorials; so I
intend them not as a Laborious Sum of knowledge; but only, as in the Liberty
and Pleasure of a garden, as some more; pleasing flowers cropp'd for the
Complement and Enchridion (...) a Posy: which by the Novelty may last a Day,
and by the Art of Friendship, may, as Friendship should, outla^^ the vanity of
the Flower. Yet as this pleases by Intermission, the seeming Neglect renewing
the delight, I but present, not obirude, to the leisure of Your great affairs,
respectfully remaining.

Noble Sr. The Glad Observer Of Your Choice Accomplishments And Eminent Merits,
BARTEN HOLYDAY.

To the Studious Reader.
AS weary travelour that climbes a Hill,
Looks back, sitts down, and often, if hand have skill,
Landskippes the Vale with pencil; placing here
Meadow, there Arable, here Forest, there
A Grove, a City, or a Silver-streame,
As offering to yield beauty to his Scheme;
Then decks it for the Gallery, and Views
If the Eye and Phansy count it Pleasing News:
So now my Thoughts and Hopes, that long have climbed
Learning's Ascents, by which True Art's sublimed,
Turn, Rest, and their own wanderings View. Here Light
They see, by which they see; there deepest Night,
The World's New Chaos: here a tinsell'd Sky,
That does with beauty please and pose the Eye;
There Earth, Beast, Foul, Mystical Man, whose brain,
A less World, would the greater world contain,
These, if by Nature's Herald, Art, well placed,
Present Nature and Art by Union graced.
To view which, no new Alps we need, whose height
Shows Europe's dress, which Thence may 't Please, or Fright?
We need no Ararat to show Asian Glory,
It self having Ark'd-up rich Asia's story.
No Atlas need we, Africa's proud eye,
The Mysteries of its Deserts to discry.
The New world's Andes we can wisely spare:
The prospect there, but not quick death, is rare.
We need no Tenariffa, which does shoot
So high, my eye J'de lend it, not my foot.
No cunning mountain need we, whence the Devil
Would show the whole world's Glory, not the Evil:
Feared he 't would spoil his Bribe? But here below
From Art, not Mountain, Truth enough we show.
If then thy Eye venters to be so kind,
Scone View the Long View of a Searching Mind.
Thine, BARTEN HOLYDAY.

BOOK I. OF Inanimate Creatures.
1.
THe Heaven is Arch; Therefore it self Sustaines:
The Earth is Center; Therefore So Remains:
2.
^he World's a Prison; no man can get out:
^et the Atheist storm then; 't is Heaven round about.
3.
^eav'n is the Silke-worme's Sphere: what Art did spinne it
^oes at its pleasure choose to dwell within it.
4.
^ow blessed was Steph'n, whose eje Heaven did permi^
^o see, who does at the Father's right hand sit!
5.
Was Paul more happy at the Third Heav'n^ sight
^r more Tormented to Delay Delight?
6.
Who first Moved Heaven, Philosopher's halfe-skill
^nquir'd: 'T was He, that made the Sun stand still.
7.
(...) weight from the Ninth Sphere Ninety years spends,
^y two hundred miles an howr, e're't quite Descends!
8.
^f Man Ascended still towered the Highest sphere,
^ight thousand years he would spend, e're he were There!
9.
^he white and yelke are closures in a shell:
Art thus makes Orbs kindly in Orbs to dwell.
10.
Though Many Heavens we think there are below
The Highest: to This by Those fair stepps we go.
11.
The Low'st Ascents in Heaven have each their Light:
The Next is Filled with stars; No point is Night.
12.
The Starry Heaven, which Divine power so paints,
In Figure shows the Assembly of the Saints.
13.
Saturn, next the fixed stars, wise death may preach:
Thoughts must be sober, that think Heaven to reach.
14.
Jove was in Fiction Joy: but in the Sky
It Is the next step to Saturne's Gravitic.
15.
A Heavenly Mars, what is it, but a stour hand,
Against the Dragon, in Saint Michael's Band?
16.
The Sun is a Great Light to all eyes free:
And yet Heaven's Greatest Light we cannot see.
17.
The Hurry of the Sun in his Own Sphere,
That measures Thrice five Miles each Minute Here!
18.
Seems not the Sun, for Speed of course, to merit
The name, not of a Body, but a Spirit?
19.
Copernicus will have the Sun stand still,
To escape doubts: He makes New! This is New skill!
20.
Some New Astronomers in the Sun find Spots:
Heaven was nere Cursed: The Sunne's Light knows no Elot!
21.
Some find of late New stars about the Sun!
Needs he more light? God's work with wisdome's done!
22.
Venus in Heaven must needs be Fair and Pure:
^f it Invites, it mocks, the Epicure.
23.
^sercurie's Wit and Tongue do plainly tell
The Wit and Tongue find place in Heaven, used well.
24.
The Moon is the World's Glass, in which, 't were strange,
^f we saw Hers, and saw not our Own Change!
25.
The learned Fa^er has the Journey measured
Up to the Moon: sure, wise men he has pleasur'd.
26.
News from the Moon; 't is told by very Fame,
There Is a strange Man, from Adam that never came!
27.
Galilie in the Moon finds yet more Change:
The Man in the Moon, once Tale, seems Truth! That Is strange!
28.
Trasfique to the Moon! Is It done by art of Wing?
To Ascend, proved Christ God! what proves this New thing?
29.
Who Will fly to Heaven, must store of Vict' alls keep!
And sometimes must at once both Fly and sleep!
30.
Some think the Stars Holes, through which Heaven sends Light:
Then into Heaven might not ascend Our night?
31.
Some think the Earth a star: then should it Light
Send forth abroad upon the Heaven by Night.
32.
The Arabians will the Stars like Letters spell;
But who did e're Demonstrate what they tell?
33.
Experience often Pretends, not so True Art:
That may mistake; from Truth This does not start.
34.
Foreknowledge is Divine; Man's Wit Ambitious:
What Is Hali, Nabod, Bonat, Alcabitius?
35.
Goate-witted Man to climb will venture, if
He may; though he hangs by the claws against a cliffe!
36.
The Art of stars who knows, but He that made them?
But Man's bold Guess, to God's wrong, would invade them.
37.
To found an Art on Figurative Grounds,
Reason without true Art sondly confounds.
38.
What though, to work on Earth, the Stars Endeavor;
Since what is received is changed by the Receivour?
39.
What though the Stars with lower causes close,
If in Man's Actions Grace does Interpose?
40.
The Milky Way which does the Heaven embrace,
Shows, Men of Small Light may in Heaven find place;
41.
The Milky Way must with the stars be ranged:
What Is out of Heaven continues not Unchanged.
42.
Light, what it is, does Sense, nay Wit, well know?
Light is scarce light enough, it self to show.
43.
The World's a picture; Light at first was hurld
Upon It: Is it God's shadow in the world?
44.
The Fire next Heaven's like zeal; but not so Cruel;
^t Burns, yet not Devours: 't is its Own Fuel.
45.
The Aire's Highest Region's Hot; Cold in the Middle;
The Low'st by Reflexe Warm: See Nature's Riddle!
46.
Thunder presents God's Majesty to the Ear;
Which is the Gate of Faith and Holy Fear!
47.
When Hear and Cold, met in the same cloud, jolt;
The Thunder's Sentence! Guilt's the Thunderbolt!
48.
When, on Mount Sinai, Thunders loud did roar,
They shook the Mount, and the Holy Cloud they toare.
49.
One most strange Meteor has it self renound,
The Sinai-Trumpet, which it self did sound!
50.
At the Last-Day, when all things down are hurled,
Jehovah's Voice shall Trumpet-up the World!
51.
Lightning Appears first: Thunder's first: The Eye
Of Conscience sees Guilt, before Judgment's Nigh!
52.
Lightning, the Mother Saved, the Child within
Has killed! The Soul saved, Conscience so kills Sin!
53.
A Comet, is it the Carbuncle of Sin,
Mass'd-up from the Earth and Hell, whence 't did begin?
54.
How at a Comet every one does stare?
When many, who thus Gaze, worse Comets are!
55.
Who Many Suns sees, sees not his Abuse;
Unless of his Mistake he makes more Use.
56.
Clammy Smoakes Fired and Falling stars some call:
Their fancy erres; Truth from their wit does fall.
57.
The Foolish Fire often, that by night does move,
Does by Mistake or Fear, Focles make or prove.
58.
What Blustering, Hott, Thick Aire's This? It Is the Wind;
Faint Emblem yet of Man's more Troublesome Mind!
59.
Whirle Wind, the art a Surprise! Nothing's like Thee
But Rapture, from the Spirit of Prophecy!
60.
Raine's Cloud Dissolved: Thus from the Law, Sad Fears.
By warmth of grace, descend in fruitful Tears!
61.
^y Red, Green, Blew, which sometimes paint the Air,
^uilt, Pardon, Heaven, the Rainbow does declare.
62.
The Rainbow to the Sun yields due respect:
^race, the Soul's beauty, does to God Reflect.
63.
When Heaven rained Clouds, and did Our World confound;
The Air ran Chanel, and All Seas were Drowned!
64.
^ome make Dutch Schuarts Founder of Gunnes and Shot:
The Volly of Hail and the Amorites they forgot.
65.
The Earth through great Heat, Cold, Wind, Dew often does lack:
^y Lust, Despair and Rage, Grace is kept-backe.
66.
Hoare-Frost, a Dew congealed, on high Hills never
^s found: Presumption unacquainted is with Fear.
67.
Snow is a Cloud, Light, but congealed: Grace Joined
With Doubt, may knowledge, yet less Comfort, find.
68.
At the last Day shall the Saints Meteors be?
Their Earth sublimed shall yet from Change be Free!
69.
Sea is the Earth of Water: The sun draines
What Is pure s^om Gross: Sea, that is, Salt, remains.
70.
The Sea is salt; Salt's Wisdom: That can rear
The weight of ship; This the world's burden bear.
71.
It is the Moone's Increase, that swells the Ocean:
It Is the First mover shows the Way o'th motion.
72.
Vanity does too often man's large Mind fill:
But the First mover Guides th'obedient will.
73.
River is Time in Water: as it came,
Still so it flows; yet never is the same.
74.
Some think The Earth star: Indeed stars send forth Beams.
We Will call it Heaven; the Springs so send forth streams.
75.
Shoot up an arrow, not far off it is found:
Moves the Earth then swift enough, if it turns round?
76.
Shall not the Air turn faster then the Earth?
To think it moves not so, is it Truth, or Mirth?
77.
Wonders we have on Earth; thus we may know
What things there are Above, by what is Below.
78.
Clay, Sand and Rock, seem of a different birth:
So men; some Stiff, some Loose, some Firm: All Earth!
79.
Down Picke-axe, to the Depth for Gold lets go:
We Will undermine Pe^u: Is'nt Heaven Below?
80.
Quicksilver, Nature's Jugler's Many in One:
Now it is Fixed: Now it is Loose: now it is Gone!
81.
Quicksilver Conscience, play not Fast and Loose:
Fast will the Loose be, to it is Own Abuse!
82.
Marble, a stately Vanity, does show,
In Natur's A^^^, Spots do for Beauty go.
83.
Each Dust Loadstone has two points: 't will rise
To the Loadsotone: Many at once may fright our eyes!
84.
Why should the world the Diamond so commend?
This Constant is: the World's a Crumbling friend.
85.
The Emerald's the Ey's Favorite: we do
In One find the Object and Spectacle too.
86.
The Ruby is an Earth, and yet a Fire:
A Holy Man! What Earth to Heaven comes Nigher?
87.
The Margarite's composed of Heavenly Dew:
Heaven is the Pearl, that is prepared for Few!
88.
Cedar the Dead from Putresaction keeps:
The just more safely in Christ's merits sleeps.
89.
The Oak bears Fruit, though Blossom it bears none:
The just bears fruit, though of it is not known.
90.
The Olive loves Hot ground, not fat, nor lean:
Grace is the Just Man's Joy, in state though Mean.
91.
The Serpent shunnes the Odor of the Vine:
A Venomed Soul flies from the Sacred Wine.
92.
The Laurell's a perpetual Green: we may
See Grace thus flourish. Grace is its own Bay.
93.
By whom shall Cinnamon's praise be fully Chanted?
It Is as Restorative, as Desire Granted!
94.
The Corn, the Grass, for Man, for Beast, renew:
God teaches them to Feed and Teach us too.
95.
Course wonder, Garlic! Begger's Galen! Wise
Thy Clownes are: Nose-coy fools thy Wit Despise.
96.
The Pinke by Nature's so refined, we dare
Almost to ask, whither't is Flower, or Air.
97.
The Violet, the Flower of Courtesy, Delight
Does yield unto the Touch, Taste, Smell and Sight.
98.
The Rose is but the Flower of a Brier:
The Good man has an Adam to his Sire.
99.
What Is Beauty without Virtue, but the Lilie?
Fair to the Eye; the sent will quickly fill ye.
100.
To weed the Garden pleasure prompts some Care:
To weed the Mind, shall safety no time spare?
BOOK II. OF Living Creatures.
101.
WHo can Acres of Whale, in the Ocean See,
And with his Own wonder, not Astonished be?
102.
To see Nine hundred foot of Whale, may make
One think, Island for Fish he does mistake.
103.
The Whale, a Live Sea, Jonah did enclose:
Were Night, Fear, Grave and Hell at once his foes?
104.
Jonah found Air in water: though command
Freedom he could not; did he not find Land?
105.
Woder in Wonder do the Seamen note:
The Whale's vast bulk has but a narrow throat.
106.
What Is great Leviathan, that does turmoile
Himself so much in Wave, but Bone and Oil?
107.
Oil makes the wool run in the Cards the better:
Sathan's glibbe arts make Man to Grace more debtor.
108.
Though the Whale's Bone finds use too much about us,
Yet Grace and Wit keep the Devil and that without us.
109.
The Whale's Mouth's a Portcullis, but Inverted?
The under jaw's Teeth into Holes above inserted.
110.
O Man take heed of Hell: if that once Swallow,
Leviathan does show thee, what does follow!
111.
The Greene-Land Sea's the world: with happy Gale
And Art of grace, lets master the Great Whale!
112.
Out with your barrels, Sailours, the Whale's near:
Upon another point instantly steer.
113.
A black beast with square head, fiery eyes, 't is Tradition,
Island-Seas show: Is It Fish, or apparition!
114.
The Cuttle-Fish with his Ink the Sea does stain:
His Witt's his Veil: A search is then but vain.
115.
The Remora a shippe's course stopps some say:
The Devilish indeed our Christian course would stay.
116.
The Crampe-fish does the Fisher catch: his hand
He stupifies: Thus Craft against Craft does band.
117.
Polonians to Revenge do not more thronge,
Then Dolphins shoale it, if you do them wrong.
118.
A Porpise, the Sea- Almanac, fore-shows
A Storm: He Is happy that worse storms fore-knows.
119.
Shrimp^, Sea- Elixir. though thy Circle's small,
Thou art to man Food, Temperance, Life and all.
120.
The Prince of Feasts, the Sturgeon, does command
The Ghuests: The Obey, that think they understand.
121.
The Dainty Salmon Courtier of the Seas,
With Temperance is pleasure; else Disease.
122.
Why should the backward Crabbe be so ashamed!
They rather that Abuse him should be Blamed.
123.
Lobster, the warmth of Age, is but Repair;
It Is but Abused, when Used for prouder fare.
124.
Lamprey is Danger; stomach is but Coy;
Pleased you may be; you may your self Annoy.
125.
Nine times an Eele through a Cormorant has passed.
E're killed: A slippery Sinner's caught at last.
126.
The Seal, the Pike, the Perch, though fish, we must
For true repair, call flesh: 't were else Unjust.
127.
The Gudgeon is the tender stomach's meat
And Sause: of this the Rich and Poor may eat.
128.
The Trout represses Choler: what is Cool.
Hot, Moift, or Dry, in fare; should be our School.
129.
Fish speak God's Love and Wisdom, without Voice:
All Is not for All; but Some for All with Choice.
130.
The Sharke, the Otter, Vex the Sea and River:
What Sanctuary can Man still deliver?
131.
The Dying Moale, say some, Opens his eyes:
The Rich, till it is too late, will not be wise.
132.
The Worm Lives in his Grave: Do what he can,
He Is but a worm. No muck-worme is a Man.
133.
To Heaven a Soul some Old Philosophy gives:
On Earth the Gloow-worme is a Star, and Lives.
134.
See the Ant's Mountain! Babel's Tower again?
Here Is as much Business! Though It is not so Vain.
135.
What Seeds the Ant Stores, he Bites: what Grows, he Loose
Scarce shall he grow, whom a Grand Politic Uses.
136.
The Spider builds in Palaces; Her own
Is web: in the midst whereof she is Queen Alone.
137.
To One man's peace, the Spider's Wisdom shows,
An Other man his peace often wisely Owes.
138.
Flies often removed return: Do they want Fear,
Or Shame, or Memory? Flies are every where.
139.
A dried Toad laid nigh the Heart, stays blood: we have
Sin, which if laid to Heart, the Soul may save.
140.
The Flea, that feeds on Dust and Blood, not long
Triumphs; He Is Snapp'd: Such is the end of Wrong!
141.
The Gnat is the poor man's Revenge: He brings
^mall strength; yet makes great noise, and shrewdly stings.
142.
What in the flower is found most pure and Sweet,
That only for his Comb the Be thinks meet!
143.
The Monarch Be, when feeble, by the rest
^s carried: So Jrrev'rence they detest.
144.
Whole pits with Honey in Lithuania flow:
^uge Bears are Choked in it; Pleasure's a Foe!
145.
The Silke-worme's its own wonder, without Loome
^t does provide it self a silken room.
146.
The Silke-worme's Nature's Poet, who excels
^n fancy, in whose Court with Art he dwells.
147.
See how the Eagle mounts toward Heaven: He Is gone
Quire out of sight; Right Emblem of Saint John!
148.
Brave bird of Thunder! Capaneus was Fable:
It Is the Eagle Dares breast Lightning, and seems Able.
149.
Eagle and Lightning met, in just account,
May make us think, we see Eliah mount.
150.
In the Eagle's Eye see the Eye of Justice, fierce
Both seem, and, what they view, they deeply pierce.
151.
The Eagle's Thigh does the Lion's thigh Out-waigh!
Is's not a Bird of an Imperial Sway?
152.
The Eagle to the Sun presents his young:
Is It Bold? He Owns't: Aoe^'t Turn? Away't is flung.
153.
Mount, O my Soul, and to thy maker bring
Thy lostiest Thoughts, his Gift, with Soaring Wing!
154.
Descend, My Soul, sometimes, but to repair
Strength for New Flight into Discov'ring Air.
155.
The Eagle casts his Bill, and becomes New:
Oh, may my Soul find but a Change as true!
156.
The Vultur will draw blood from his Own thigh,
If he wants Prey! Herodian Cruelty!
157.
Man, have thou Grace? The have Sin! See, it is but Meet
Not only the Swan's Feathers, but his Feet.
158.
Pride can not see it self by Mid-day-light: l
The Peacocke's Tail is Farthest from his Sight!
159.
A Parrot learned the Creed: may not such, greeve,
As can not say it, or can not it Believe?
160.
The Nightingale's a Quire, no Single Note:
O Various power of God in One small Throat!
161.
The Cuckow's but Two Notes: what Artist tells
The Cause? Or why the Nightingale excels?
162.
The Cuckow's Halse an Owl; He flies Man's fight:
The Owl, a double Cuckoo, flies by Night.
163.
Wonder it sees, where so e're the Eye does Roll:
The Batt is the Aire-Mouse; The Night's his Hole.
164.
The Swallow's a Quick Arrow, that may show
With what an Instant Swif^nesse Life does flow.
165.
Though the Cocke's Music from his Vigor be,
^an is left posed: The full cause can he see?
166.
^eese Saved Rome's Capitol, the Cock Saint Peter:
^o a wise Mind his Musique's sure the sweeter.
167.
^er Young the Pidgeon first with Salt-earth feeds:
^ise Education thus a wise man breeds.
168.
With what a Roar of Fury Lions rage?
It Is Half a Fright, to see the Lions Cage!
169.
That do we talk of Wild beasts more then One?
The Lion is a Wilderness Alone!
170.
The Lion vexed, with tail strikes the Earth; Next blow
^ates his Own Back: The Last Confounds his Foe.
171.
The Ly^ian Lion eats Man, Woman, Child:
Eats Him; Then Them: His Hunger's wisely Mild!
172.
The Leopard's so strong, so Quick, so Fierce;
As if, whiles Named, he would Leap too in the Verse.
173.
As from the Tiger swift and fierce we would run:
With greater Care our greatest Foe lets shun.
174.
Cruell's the Bear, h' has yet but a weak head;
A blow has killed him: by Christ's Death Sinne's Dead.
175.
The Arabian Fox robbes Houses, and steals Shoes:
Our Foe would us spiritually so abuse.
176.
The Ravenous Wolf will feed on Mice and Moles:
Satan does thus devour dark Earthy souls!
177.
O mock of Pride! Man can not Change his Shape:
Though, whiles unchanged, he is but like an Ape.
178.
The shifting Hear we pity; scorn the Heart;
To fly when Armed, is but the Coward's part.
179.
The Sick Heart eats a Snake, and so grows well:
Repentance Digests Sin, and Man scapes Hell.
180.
Much 't is the Afrique Camels Long can fast:
More, that they Incest Hate, admir'dly chaste!
181.
^normous Excellency! The Elephant
Nor strength, nor wit, nor words, some say, does want!
182.
^n the Elephant's Heart is found a mighty Bone:
Inhappy Man, whose Heart is often All stone!
183.
The Ass for Burden, as the Horse for Speed,
God has given Man, Man's Double help at need.
184.
The Egyptian thought the Dog a God! He might
Take him a Friend: He Is Safty or delight.
185.
Glutton- Jew of all men was most crossed:
The various dainties of the Hog he lost.
186.
The Cow yields milk; the Sheep cloths: both are good,
Thus both Alive; and when Both Dead, the are Food.
187.
The Catt's Eye's Providence, It Sees by Night:
(...) Guard of Angels yields both Joy and Might.
188.
^ore Life to Man, then to the Crow God gives:
^ong lives the Crow: Man lives, and Dies, and Lives!
189.
^an's Brain is Curds and Wonder! Truth this cleares:
^athushelah's was unchanged nine hundred years!
190.
Blood Circles from the Heart unto the Heart:
^an's New America speaks Harvie's Art!
191.
IN Wake and so new Live: a Night's Protection
Is a new Wonder, whiles a Resurrection.
192.
IN Wake and too too soon my Thoughts begin
To stray: Can Sleep halfe-Rescue us from Sin?
193.
The Sunne's up: yet My self and God most bright
I cannot see: J'me too Dark, and He Is too Light!
194.
Cloths, which Hide shame, shame us, sin they present:
Wee're Clothed yet in the Grave, when Innocent!
195.
Hand, wash thy fellow; yet the washing's vain:
We are Sinne's Black-Moores, though we wash again.
196.
Let devout Prayer cast me to the Ground:
So shall I yet to Heaven be Nearer found.
197.
What shall I Do to day? I prayed to shun
All Sin; but, from my Prayer it is, I run.
198.
Hunger says, Feed: Feed? says Temperance;
Through Food, Sloth, Sleep and Lust, Life's but a Dance.
199.
The Holy Book is my Receite; a Sure
Cordial, a Powerful Trouble, and a Cure.
200.
Advance My Task, Thy Praise, Spirit Divine!
I Will Slight the Aid then of Poetique Wine!
BOOK III. OF Nations.
201.
It Is Morning; therefore Night; This Order keeps
The world: still One Half wakes; the Other Sleeps.
202.
^ow Nations fill the Earth, like Different Seeds!
^^ch Country unlike Men and Manners breeds!
203.
