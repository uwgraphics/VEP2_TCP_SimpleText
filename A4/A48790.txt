To the RIGHT HONORABLE Sir Henry Bennet, LORD ARLINGTON, Principal Secretary
of State to His Majesty, and one of the Lords of His Majesty's most Honorable
PRIVY COUNCIL.
May it please your Honor,
IN this Collection (which is humbly addressed to your Lordship, as one of the
most eminent surviving Instances of that Loyalty it treats of) is contained
Remarques and Observations upon above a thousand Persons, in which number may
be accounted no less than two hundred Peers and Prelates, becoming the
Excellency of that Royal Cause, most Sacred in the two Branches thereof,
Government and Religion.

As the Slave in the Historian, gathered up the scattered Limbs of his Great,
but Conquered and Murdered Lords, burning them on some vulgar pile, and
repositing their Ashes in some poor room, till more equal times should erect
them a becoming Monument; Covering them with a Pyramid, or enclosing them in a
Temple: So I, from the perishing and scattered Pamphlets and Discourses of
these times, have Collected some choice Memorials of those Heroes, who deserved
not to be forgotten in that Kingdom, whereof I am a Subject, and that Church,
whereof I am a Member; which Collection may serve for a just, though brief
account, of the great actions and sufferings of these Worthies, till time shall
produce a better History, more lasting than its self, that shall be a reproach
to the weakness of Stone and Marble.

History, (says my Lord Bacon) which may be called just and perfect History,
is of three kinds, according to the object it propounds, or pretends to
represent; for it either represents a time, a person, or an action. The first
we call Chronicles, the second Lives, and the third Narrations, or Relations.

Of these, although the first be the most complete and absolute kind of
History, and has most estimation and glory; yet the second excels it in
profit and use, and the third in verity and sincerity. For History of Times
represents the magnitude of Actions, and the public faces and deportments of
Persons, and passes over in silence the smaller passages and motions of men
and matters. But such being the Workmanship of God, as he does hang the greater
weights upon the smallest wyars, Maxima eminimis suspendens, It comes therefore
to pass, that such Histories do rather set forth the pomp of business, than the
true and inward resorts thereof. But Lives, if well written, propounding to
themselves a Person to represent, in in whom actions, both greater and smaller,
public and private, have a commixture, must of necessity contain a more true,
native, and lively representation.

I do much admire, that the virtues of our late times should be so little
esteemed, as that the writing of Lives should be no more frequent; for although
there be not many Sovereign Princes, or absolute Commanders, and that States
are most Collected into Monarchies; yet there are many worthy Personages, that
deserve better than dispersed Reports, and barren Elogies.

There are Pyramids erected for the Maccabees (those great sufferers for a good
Cause) at Modinum in Palestine, the bottom of which contain the bodies of those
Heroes, and the tops serve for Sea-marks, to direct Mariners, sailing in the
Mediterranean, toward the Haven of Ioppa, in the Holy Land; not unlike
whereunto, for the use and service thereof, is this following Volume, partly to
do justice to those Worthies deceased, and partly to guide and Conduct their
Posterity to the same happiness, by steering their course according to the
honorable patterns of their Lives, and the resolved manner of their Deaths;
being moreover useful intimations to oppressed virtue, when neither Law nor
Government can neither encourage or support, and successful and prosperous
Vices, which neither is able either to suppress or restrain; yet is History
able to do Right to the one, and Justice on the other; History that holds a Pen
in one hand, that can set the most neglected and despicable goodness eternally
beyond injury, and (being the greatest awe over great Villains on this side
Hell) a scourge in the other, that shall give the most powerful and domineering
Villainy perpetual wounds beyond a remedy; a fair warning to all men, that have
any sense of fame or honor, to take as great care of their deportment before
their death, as the Roman Gladiators did of their postures before their fall.

Neither am I without competent hopes, that it will be a cosiderable pleasure
to those worthy Persons still surviving their former sufferings, to see the
Kings friends in a body in an History, as once they saw them in the Field; and
be able upon the view, to make a judgment what Families and Persons are fit to
be employed and entrusted, what deserving men have been neglected, and who may
be encouraged and rewarded; without doubt many will, with great satisfaction,
look on this Catalogue as K. Charles I. did on Essex his Army at Edgehill,
when he gave his reason for his long looking upon them, to one that asked him,
What he meant to do; This is the first time that I saw them in a body.

And the rather, because, though not mentioned themselves, as being alive, (
Nec tanti est ut memorentur perire, Nor is it worth their while to dye, that
they may be remembered) yet by this poor attempt may guess, that when other
means prove ineffectual, (Monuments of Wood being subject to burning, of Glass
to breaking, of soft Stone to mouldring, of Marble and Metal to demolishing)
their own Virtues, and others Writings, will Eternize them.

If any Persons are omitted (as possibly, in so great a variety, there may be
some) or mistaken, or but briefly mentioned, be it considered, that the Press,
like Time and Tide, staying for no man, and real Informations (though
diligently and importunately sought after) coming in but slowly, we were
forced to lay this Foundation, and intend, God willing, if an opportunity shall
serve, to complete, or at least more amply adorn the Structure.

One of the greatest Encouragements whereunto, will be your Lordships gracious
acceptance of this weak, but sincere Endeavor of,

My Lord, Your Lordships Most humble and devoted Servant, David Lloyd.

PREPARATIVES TO The last Civil War, From 1550 to 1640.
AS in Nature there is hardly a Poison growing any where, but in the same place
there grows an Antidote against it; so in Nations, seldom do the loose
principles of Licentiousness, Rebellion, and Disorder prevail so universally,
but that in the same Nation the more excellent principles of Reason, Religion,
Laws, and Allegiance, bear up against them. Various have been the shapes and
pretenses, under which the Lusts of men (for all the disorders in the world,
are nothing else but Lust, casting off the restraint God has laid upon it by
Government) have endeavored (since God set up Government to keep men civil and
quiet in this world, as he did Religion to prepare them for another world) to
shake and invalidate the obligations both of Religion and Government in all
places of the world (for most pretenses last but an Age, in which time they are
looked through, exploded, abhorred, and must be shifted.)

How men willing to live at the highest freedom of a loose Nature, have in this
Nation endeavored in several generations to overthrow all the Checks,
Restraints, Rules, and Disciplines of Religion, is not so properly the business
of this place, as it is commonly the subject of every discourse elsewhere.

The pretentions and appearances under which those that have made a pretty good
shift to suppress all those Principles of Honesty, Sobriety and Obedience that
Religion curbed them withal within, would likewise in this Nation overruled all
Power, Authority, Order and Laws, that keep them within compass from without,
when those unruly Lusts, Pride, Ambition, Animosity, Discontent, Popularity,
Revenge, etc. would overrun all those Banks that were raised against them;
have been

1. The Dubiousness of the Royal Title, the ground of thirty six Rebellions,
one hundred forty six Battle since the Conquest: In all which though the Rebels
were usually the most, the Loyallists were always the best: and when the many
followed sometimes a prosperous Villainy, the most noble and excellent stood to,
or fell with an afflicted right, and bore down all umbrages with this real
truth, That the Crown took off all defects, and that any man may pretend
arguments to begin a War, when but few can make arguments, when it is begun, to
make an end of it.

2. The Liberty of the Subject, forsooth, the old Quarrel for which the Throng
and Rabble would venture much, when wiser men maintained, that there was no
greater oppression in the world, than a Liberty for men to do what they
pleased; and that Government is the great security of freedom.

3. Religion, for whose sake so many resisted Authority, when one of the
Maxims of this Religion is, that none should resist upon pain of damnation:
and albeit the Factious in all Ages have been many, that have taught men for
Religions sake to disobey Authority; yet the sober in those Ages have been as
many, that taught them, that for Religion-sake they should obey them that have
the rule over them.

But when toward the last, that is, the worst Ages of the world, wickedness
grows wiser upon the experiences and observations of former times, and twists
all these pretensions into one; there have been excellent persons that with
their lives and fortunes asserted Government, and have been Confessors and
Martyrs to this great truth, That it is upon no pretense law^^l to resist the
Supreme Authority of a Nation: a truth that keeps up the world, without which
it had been long ere this a desolation.

Upon the Reformation in Henry the eighth's time, it fell out in England, as
Luther observes it did in most other reformed Churches, that the Papists
finding that their way was so odious, that it was to no purpose for it to
appear here with open face to settle it self, therefore did they under several
covert pretexts and cunning scruples, endeavor to unsettle all other ways; and
when it could not establish it self, to hinder all other Professions from being
established, that at least they might watch some opportunities, whereof there
are many offered in distracted times. For no sooner was our Church settled on
the Primitive principles of Religion and Government, than some of those that
fled into the free States, and the places of popular reformation in Germany,
returning when most preferments were gone, and living upon the Liberality of
well-disposed People, set up some popular scruples against the established
Government: A. E. 6. 4. 1550.
and among the rest, John Hooper having been long in Switzerland, upon his
election to be Bishop of Gloucester, scrupled several Ornaments and Rights of
our Church; the Earl of Warwick, afterward Duke of Northumberland (having a
design to oblige all Parties in order to a project he had set up to convey the
Crown to his own family, to preserve the Reformation, though he died a Papist)
writes to Archbishop Cranmer to dispense with the public Laws, to satisfy a
private man's humor; and when his Letter would not do, makes the young King
write another: and now Cranmer and Ridley stand up for these great Principles
of Government: Let private Spirits yield to public establishments: there is no
end of yiedling to scruples, one scruple indulged begetting another, so long,
till there be no more Law than pleases the humoursome: be well advised in
making Laws, and resolute in keeping them. Notwithstanding that the learned and
wise Ridley suffered almost as much for his asserting the Government of our
Church at that rate from the Puritans, as he did afterward for asserting the
Doctrine of it, from the Papists: he was Martyr to the Protestant Church, and a
Confessor to the Church of England; Hooper not being reconciled to him until
the Sun of their lives was going down; and their heart-burning upon this
occasion was not quenched, A. Ed. 6. 7. 1553.
till the Fire was kindled that burned both their bodies.

The Lord Admiral Seymour was a back-Friend to Common Prayer; and old Latimer
takes him and others up for it: I have heard say, when that the good Queen that
is gone, had ordained in her house daily Prayers, both before noon and
afternoon; the Admiral gets him out of the way, like a mole digging in the
earth: he shall be Lots wife to me as long as I live. He was, I heard say, a
covetous man, a covetous man indeed: I would there were no more in England. He
was I heard say a seditious man, a contemner of Common Prayer: I would there
were no more in England. Well! he is gone, I would he had left none behind him.

Yea, when the death of King Edward the sixth put an end to these differences
among Protestants, but putting an end to the public profession of the
Protestant Religion it self in this Nation; the forementioned scruples
accompanied some hot-Spirited men to their exiles under Queen Mary. Q. M. 2. 3.
1557/8.
When Master Calvin's Authority, who forsooth observed some Tolerabiles Ineptia
in our establishment; and Master Knox, Master Whittingam, Goodman, and Foxes
zeal cried down the whole Platform of our English Reformation; the judgment
and gravity of Master Horn, afterward Bishop of Winchester, the learning of
Bishop Poynet and Iuel, the piety and prudence of Doctor Sands and Doctor Coxe,
the moderation and calmness of Master (afterward Archbishop) Grindall, and
Chambers, the Reputation of Sir John Cheek, Sir Anthony Cook, Francis
(afterward Sir Francis) Knolles, bore it up, until it pleased God that with
Queen Elizabeth it was again established and restored by the Law of the Realm.

In the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's Reign, Q. El. 1. 1560/1.
all persons were so intent upon obviating the Public Dangers, that they had
no leisure to mind particular Animosities (though as the Danow and the Savus
in Hungary run with party-colored Waters in the same Channel, so the several
sorts of Protestants upon that alteration, with several Opinions maintained the
same Religion) until the year 1563. when the Canons and Articles of the Church
being confirmed, the Governors of the Church began, as it was their duty, to
press Conformity; and they whom it concerned to oppose that Establishment
refused subscription, Father Fox (as Queen Elizabeth used to call him) pulling
out his Greek Testament, and saying, He would subscribe to that, and that he
had nothing in the Church save a Prebend of Salisbury; and if they would take
that away, much good may it do them. Laurence Humphred determining something de
Adiaphoris, non juxta cum Ecclesia Anglicana: They are Camdens own words. Nay,
Anthony Gibby of Lincolnshire declaring in Print, That the Ceremonies were the
known Liveries of Antichrist, accursed Leaven of the blasphemous Popish
Priesthood, cursed patches of Popery and Idolatry: they are worse than lousie;
for they are Sibbe to the Sarke of Hercules, that made him tear his own bowels
asunder. Doctor Samson Dean of Christ-Church being propter Puritanismum
Exauctoratus: Whittingam and Goodman backing their Schism with Treason, 1567.
in a Book they writ in defense of Wyat: nay, some of them growing so bold, as
being convented before Doctor Grindall then Bishop of London, to answer this
Question of his; Have not we a godly Prince, speak, is she evil? Thus White;
What a Question is that, the fruit does show.

Thomas Rowlands, No, but the Servants of God are persecuted under her.

R. Hawkins, Why the Psalmist answers this Question, How can they have
understanding that work wickedness, spoiling my people, and that extol vanity?

Nay, from single Affronts to Government, they proceed to Conventicles in
Fields, Woods, and Friends Houses; and not only so, but Thomas Cartwright the
Bell-weather of Nonconformity, presents the Parliament 1572. with a Book
called Admonition, a Title not well resented in Parliament, since Admonition is
but the lowest degree of Ecclesiastical Censure, and a Preparative, if
neglected, to Suspension and Excommunication; wherein were several Grievances
represented, with this only Redress prescribed, viz. The admission of that
Platform which the Presbyterians there exhibited. And since one modest
Admonition would not do, another more severe follows, and a Reply to Doctor
Whitgift's Answer to the Admonition, with a world of Libels and Pamphlets,
which they called, The new way to work, following that Reply; they judging it a
good way, to turn serious Books into Satirical Pamphlets.

Find they did so many Friends and Patrons within the Parliament and without,
that they erected a Presbytery in Wandsworth; slighted such sober men even of
their own Scruples, as Master Fox and Doctor Humphred set up Exercises called
Prophesyings, irregularly and dangerously carrying on Meetings of ill
consequence at Cock field in Suf^olk, at Cambridge and London; draw up a
Platform of Discipline at London; petition the Privy Council, and engage
several of them in the Quarrel, particularly Leicester, Burleigh ( Traverse his
Patron) and Walsingham, as appears by their Letters to Archbishop Whitgift;
procure a Conference at Lambeth with the Archbishops of Canterbury and York,
before the Lords of the Council; set up an Assembly of Ministers to sit Jigg by
Joul with the Convocation in London; engaged so many Lords and Commons, under
the pretense of the Liberty of the Subject, the Grievances of Pluralities and
Non-residences, Ecclesiastical Courts and Jurisdictions, to shake the
Established Government, as forced Archbishop Whitgift to repair with an humble
Petition to the Queen to stand by her own Authority as Supreme in all Causes
and over all Persons, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, in these her Majesty's
Realms and Dominions. The Lord Burleigh himself was so importuned by them
against our Liturgy, that he desired them to draw up a better; as they had
done, but that they could not agree. Nay, some persons private Interests making
use of, and closing with these Public Disturbances, the Commons come up with a
sixteen-fold Petition against the Church to the Lords; and many of the Lords
were so high, that nothing would satisfy my Lord Gray less than the turning
out of all the Bishops by Praemunire then, as they had been in King Henry the
Eighth's time; and that the Queen should not confer with the Bishops but in the
presence of the Temporal Lords. A bold Proposal, as an honorable Lord then
observed, that the Lords should appoint her Majesty whom she should confer
withal.

And no wonder now, that such Pamphlets, as, The Epitome, The Demonstration of
Discipline, The Supplication, Diotrephes, The Minerals, Have you any work for
the Cooper? Martin Marprelate Senior and Junior, Have you any more work for
Coopers? flew abroad so much, that the Synod at Coventry acted so boldly as
they did in their Thirteen Canons, as a man may call them; And that they began
to write to one another in this Style, We look for Bickering ere long, and then
a Battle which cannot long endure. A boldness excusable, when both the Kings of
Scots and Denmark interposed in their behalf: yea, and some of them, as Hacket
and Arthington, set up Designs to murder the Queen, and the Privy Council;
Traverse himself, though otherwise reserved and wary, breaking out in his
Temple-Lectures, to open opposition against Mr. Hooker the Master of it, and
the great Champion of the Church of England. And because they began to be
ashamed to make such a stir about Rites, Ceremonies, etc. they added some
Sabbatarian Speculations, and bold Controversies of Gods Decrees, to put weight
into the Quarrel, and brave that the World might take them not for light
Scruplers about indifferent things, but the strong Astertors of the Power of
Godliness, viz. in the keeping of the Sabbath, etc. the design of Dr. Bounds
Book of the Sabbath.

To this height the Impugners of Government and Discipline arrived at in Queen
Elizabeth's time, in whose Reign these Champions withstood them, viz.

1. The Queen, true to her Motto, Semper eadem, would not either by their
Greatness, Number, or Importunity, that maintained the Faction, be moved to the
least diminution of her Authority in Causes Ecclesiastical; yea, and in her
latter days, when she observed how the Church and State was overborn by them,
she grew very severe toward them, as Vdal, Penry, and Cartwright felt; they at
the Assizes, and this in the Star Chamber, till he saved himself by an humble
submission.

2. The Privy Council always in Church Affairs (however some Members of it had
a kindness for the Faction) went along with the Archbishop.

3. The Archbishops, Parker and Whitgift, notwithstanding the many and great
Difficulties they met with, kept up the Authority of the Canons, and required
subscription.

4. Fulke, Hooker, and Rogers, kept up the Authority of the Church in Writing.

Although the Queen was often by them in danger of her life, the Archbishops
made weary of their Lives and Government; Mr. Hooker was heart-broken with
Calumnies and Oppositions; all the Bishops and Ministers of the Church rendered
as odious and ridiculous as the Wit and Malice of men could make them. The
stout Bishop of Exeter went with honorable Scars from the Factions malicious
Tongues and Pens to his Grave.

Archbishop Whitgift not only felt the Fury of this Sect, when Master of
Trinity-Colledge in Cambridge, at what time Carwright was also a Member of that
House, kept a Fast there in his absence, and persuaded all the Scholars, but
two or three, to throw off their Surplices, as they did, till the good Master
returned home. Nor did he only complain of the continual opposition that he
met with, when Regius Professor, from Mr. Cartwright, at the same time Margaret
Professor in the same University; nor of the Indefatigable pains he took to
answer Cartwrights Admonitions to the Parliament, and to reply to Cartwrights
Answers, till his Antagonist laid down the Cudgels.

For these were inconsiderable troubles given him, when we reflect on the great
Oppositions and dangerous Motions in Parliament, that forced him twice on his
knees to the Queen, entreating the continuance of her Grace and Favor toward
him and the Church the first time, and with grief of heart (they are his own
words) craving her Majesty's protection the second: And add to them the several
Contrasts he had with the Lords, by whom in Council, upon their sending to him
the Complaints of the Norfolk-Ministers against Bishop Preake of Norwich, and
of the Kentish-Ministers against himself; he was forced to write, that it was
Irregular for Ministers to address themselves to the Council Table, in Affairs
of the Church, wherein he alone was Entrusted by God and her Majesty; and to
tell them, that it was not for the Queen to sit in her Throne, if such men
might so boldly offer themselves to reason and dispute, 1582, 1583,
as in their Bill they vaunt, against the state established in matter of
Religion; nor for himself to keep his place, if every Curate within his Diocese
or Province, may be permitted so to use him; it being impossible, as he says,
for him to perform the Duty which her Majesty looked for at his hands, if he
might not without Interruption, proceed in that which her Highness had
especially committed unto him. And that the disorderly flocking and gadding
from place to place was dangerous; concluding, that the sending for him to
appear before the Council Table as a Party, and to call his doings in question
(which from her Majesty were immediately committed unto him, and wherein he
supposed he had no other Judge but her self) and this upon the suggestion of
unlearned, despicable, and troublesome men (the meanest and fewest of the
places where they lived) was a thing unexpected from them, from whom, as their
Pastor, he expected all aid and assistance in his Office, for the quietness of
the Church and State, the Credit of the established Religion, and the
maintenance of the Laws made for the same

Neither was this all; alas, what a sad Complaint does this Reverend Person
make against one Beal Clerk of the Council, who reviled and threatened him to
his face, if he proceeded to put the Ecclesiastical Laws in execution as he had
done? telling him boldly, loudly, and bitterly, That he would overthrow the
Church, and that his hands should be shortly stopped: His words are, That were
it not for his Conscience, and well-grounded persuasion in the things he did,
the peace of the Church, her Majesty, and some Noble Lords constancy to him in
the Service, he should hardly be able to endure so great a Burden.

Nay, writing to my Lord Hatton, the good Archbishop says, That my Lord
Hatton's kindness did not a little comfort him, having received ( says he) not
long since, unkind speeches where I least looked for them, only for doing my
duty in the most necessary Business which I have in hand: disobedient wilful
persons, (I will term them no worse) are animated, Laws contemned, her
Majesty's Will and Pleasure little regarded, and the Executors thereof in word
and deed abused: Howbeit these Overthwarts grieve me, yet I thank God, ( so the
good Prelate goes on) I am contented to sustain all these Displeasures, and
fully resolved not to depend upon Man, but upon God and her Majesty.

If you ( says he to my Lord Burleigh) take the part of unlearned, young,
ambitious Disturbers of Order, against the established State of Religion, and
forsake me, especially in so good a Cause; I shall think my coming to this
place to be for my punishment; and my very hard hap, that when I think to
deserve best, and in a manner to consume my self, to satisfy that which God,
her Majesty, the Church requires of me, I should be evil rewarded; and having
risen early, and sat up late, to give all men satisfaction, have my Labor
lost, and called wilful, Papist, Knave, and charged, that I require men to
subscribe, only to maintain my own Book, and so sacrifice the public to my
own private Reputation.

These were the sufferings of Whitgift. Dr. Fulke for writing against the
Brownists, professes that he had not an hours rest for twelve years together.

And how bold Traverse was set up in the Temple against modest Hooker; How the
loud Lectures of the first of these were cried up, against the solid Sermons of
the other; What siding and bandying there was in the House; What confuting in
the Afternoon of what was proved in the Morning; What Addresses to the Lords of
the Council; And how meek Mr. Hooker, weary of the Contrast, was forced to
retire, is obvious to all that do but dip into the History of Queen Elizabeth's
time; not to mention either Dr. Baroe, or Mr. Barrets Sufferings in Cambridge,
with Dr. Howson and Mr. Land's at Oxford, for Anti-Calvimsm, which was only
another little occasion found to quarrel with Authority, and to draw in more
persons to their Party: many learned men who favored not the Faction in point
of Calvinistical Discipline, yet were very Indulgent and serviceable to them in
respect to their Calvinistical Doctrine.

Well, during Queen Elizabeth's Reign, the Quarrel being confined within the
Church and Schools, few acted or suffered thereby besides Churchmen and
Scholars; the Laity of the Nobility and Commons seldom engaging either way
further than by private tampering, encouraging, interceding, motioning, etc.
and none of them suffering any further, than that if they stood to the great
and generous Principles of Government and Religion, they were censured as
Papists, profane Enemies of the Power of Godliness, etc. or so.

But upon the Entrance of King James, whom the Factious thought a Presbyterian
from his Cradle, as frighted to their way in his Mothers belly; the Laity and
Clergy began to side more openly: Dr. Nevil, Dean of Canterbury, was not so
soon with that King, from Archbishop Whitgift, and the rest of the Clergy, as
Mr. Lewis Pickering, a Northamptonshire Gentleman, waited upon him from the
Presbyterians; upon whose return, judging by the Kings temper, that they who
had most Voices and Friends were likely to carry it, at least, for Liberty and
Toleration, (a great Multitude was thought by them a strong Argument with that
Prince) they set up the mille-manus Petition, called so, for the thousand hands
they pretended were to it: (Mr. Cartwright in the mean time Caressing his
Majesty with all the Presbyterian Courtships in the world, in an Epistle
Dedicatory to his Latin Commentary on Ecclesiastes) with the Importunity
whereof, together with the Mediation of some Lords, especially the Scotch, (for
now Presbytery had got a whole Nation, I mean Scotland, of their side) there
was a Conference held at Hampton Court before the King and the Lords of the
Council, between eight Bishops, eight Deans, and two other Divines, on the one
side; Dr. Reynolds, Dr. Sparks, Mr. Knewstubs, and Mr. Chadderton, on the
other: The issue whereof, notwithstanding the Suggestions wherewith they had
prepossessed his Majesty, and the powerful Intercession of many Grandees, was
much beyond their expectation; the King declaring, that if that be all the
Presbyterians have to say, which they said there, they should Conform, or he
would hurry them out of the Land, or do worse: whereupon another Petition is
out of hand carried on, and Hands not so much gathered, as scraped to it; (Mr.
George Goring (afterward Earl of Norwich) being, in the right of his zealous
Mother, one of the Subscribers, when he was so young as to know but little, and
care less for Church Government) and the thing not so much to be presented to
his Majesty to incline him, as to be scattered up and down the Nation, to
Enrage and Engage the People, some great ones consenting to it, and some potent
strangers ( i.e. Scots) undertaking to conduct and manage it. Insomuch that
Archbishop Whitgift fearing a stronger Assault of Non-Conformists against
Church Discipline, than his Age-feebled body should be able to withstand,
desired that he might not live to see the Parliament that was to be 1603/4; and
indeed he did not, for he died before it of a Cold, got by going one cold
Morning to Fulham, to consult with the Bishops and other learned men, what was
best to be done for the Church in the next Parliament.

And though after his death, wise and resolute Bishop Bancroft secured the
Church Government by an hundred forty one Canons, against all Innovations: And
the Puritans were grown to such a degree of odiousness with King James, and
some Courtiers, that the very Family of love made a Petition to King James, to
be distinguished from them, as either ashamed or afraid to be of their Number.
Yea, and though the wise King had silenced all the popular Pretensions with his
wise Maxim, No Bishop, no King, yet Bishop Bancroft suffered so much in Libels
(the Squibs and Paper-Guns that made way for the Gunning that followed) that a
Gentleman bringing him one of them that he had taken up, was desired to lay it
up in such a place, where, he said, there were an hundred more of that nature;
and was censured for a Papist while he lived, and had the Brethrens good word
when he died, to this purpose; Here lies his Grace in cold Clay clad,
Who died for want of what he had.


And upon his altering of his Will: He who never repented of doing ill,
Repented that once he made a good Will.


An Assembly in Aberdeen made a fearful work in Scotland. An Insurrection was
made in Warwickshire, under pretense indeed of throwing down the Enclosures of
some Fields, but indeed to overthrow those of the Church and State. There were
three days hot Contest, 1607. between the Bishops and Judges, before the King,
about the Limitations of the Civil and Ecclesiastical Courts, and about
Prohibitions. Then the dangerous Book called, The Interpreter, came out: And
therewith so much fear, jealousy, and suspicion, as caused the Lords and
Commons, and the whole Realm, to take anew the Oaths of Allegiance and
Supremacy; and so many strange Motions were made in the Parliament, continued
for six years together, that the King thought fit by Proclamation to dissolve
it. The Faction that would, forsooth, redress Grievances in the Church, to make
their Party the more, take in hand all the Grievances in the State. So that no
sooner was a man discontented upon any occasion, but he was made a Puritan
straight, some of that Party taking his Cause in hand; insomuch, that they were
looked upon as the Patrons of the Subjects Liberty, and the best Patriots and
Common-wealths-men, all others being esteemed Betrayers of their Country, and
Court-Parasites. And now they were broke in Parliament, they trouble the
Bishops and others in every Court, countenancing Offenders, teaching them to
elude the Law, vexing Ecclesiastical Courts with Prohibitions, endeavoring to
overthrow his Majesty's Power over the Church, in the Star Chamber, and
High Commission. Poor Dr. Howson is suspended at Oxford, Propter Conciones
minus Orthodoxas, and offensionis plenas: Only for discovering the danger of
admitting the Geneva-Notes. Mr. Lawd censured both for a Sermon and a Position,
by the same party: Yea, and learned Seldom lets fly upon all the
Parsonage-Barns, the dreadfullest storm that they had endured a long time, in a
Book called, The History of Tithes. In the Preface to which Book, he lets fly
as desperately against the persons of the Orthodox Clergy, as he had done in
the body of it, against their Maintenance.

Dr. Mocket no sooner published his Politica Ecclesiae Anglicanae, to satisfy
the World, but his Book was burned, and his heart broken, to satisfy a
Faction; though very learned and good men were by them set against his Book:
They like the Cat, putting others upon that hot service, whereon they would not
venture their own paws.

What ill Offices were done Bishop Laud and Bishop Neale, to King James, by the
Lord Chancellor Elsemere, upon the Instigation of Dr. Abbot the Archbishop of
Canterbury: How Bishop Laud was opposed in the matter of his Election to the
Headship of St. John's: What rancounters there were between him and Bishop
Williams, whom that Party had incensed against him: The Rattling he had from the
Archbishop of Canterbury, for but procuring poor Vicars some ease in the point
of Subsidies, the Archbishop pretending that he meddled too much with Public
Affairs; though the Duke of Buckingham, and Bishop Williams himself confessed,
that it was the best service that had been done the Church for seven years
before.

These, and many more the great sufferings of men well-affected to the
Government of the Church, are notorious in King James his time, but not so
eminent as those in King Charles his days.

When the King being engaged by them in a War and other Troubles, (for it was
at their request, that Prince Charles moved his Father to declare a War against
the Spaniard) they being curbed all the Reign of King James, thought they had
the only opportunity that men could wish in the world: for the King could not
go to War without Money and Men; these they had taught the People could not be
raised without their Consent in Parliament, where among the discontented and
ill-bred Gentlemen (whom the Non-Conformists had bred up; for when you could
hear little of them in the Church, in the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's
Reign, and throughout King James, they lurked as Schoolmasters and Chaplains in
Gentlemen's houses.) They had a great stroke (and so great, that the Duke of
Buckingham, by Dr. Preston, did a great while court the Puritan Faction) and
nothing would they grant the King, unless he would let them do what was good in
their own eyes.

King Charles having the Care of three Kingdoms entrusted with him by the Laws
of God and the Land, and finding the danger they were brought into, called upon
the Parliament to assist him with such Tribute and Contribution as might be
proportionable to the greatness of his Affairs: they considering the straight
he was reduced into, resolved that they would redress Grievances before they
would yield any Subsidies: To that purpose they make bold to question his
greatest and dearest Favorites and Statesmen; and first, the Duke of
Buckingham, against whom they set the Earl of Bristol; and when he could make
nothing of it, the House of Commons its self, with thirteen Articles attaqued
that great Person, who had no fault, as it seems by his Replies, but his great
Place, and his Princes Favor; that Party designing thereby to make it
dangerous for any person to give the King faithful Counsel, or to assist him in
keeping up the Government, unless in compliance with them; as they made it more
than evident, when they offered the Duke with their Interest upon some
Conditions to bring him off. Here is the first blow at the greatest stay of
Government, the Kings Majesty's Council. The next thing they do,
notwithstanding the great danger of the Kingdom, is to declare, That they must
clear the Liberty and Propriety of the Subject, that (forsooth they are the
Demagog^es own words) they might know, whether they could call any thing their
own, before they should give the King any thing. And when Nature, Policy, and
Religion, taught the World, that his Majesty who had the Care of the Kingdom,
must not let it perish for the humor of some people, that would allow nothing
toward the maintenance either of themselves, or it; (choosing, as one Turner
said openly in the House, Rather to fall into the hands of Enemies abroad, than
to submit to the Government, as then established, at home.) And some Divines
preached (what is great reason) That his Majesty being Entrusted by God with a
Power to defend his Kingdom, must have a power too by all means to raise Men
and Money in spite of any malicious Factions, wherewith he may defend it. For
this, Dr. Mainwaring and Dr. Sibthorpe, both, as I take it, his Majesty's
Chaplains, are questioned, not by the Church, to whose Cognizance Errors in
Doctrines most properly belong, but by the Lay Elders of the House of Commons:
Yea, and if the Farmers of the Custom-house advance any money upon the Kings
ancient Revenue of Tonnage and Poundage, they shall be questioned for that; and
for Levying any Imposts upon any Commodities whatsoever. That Is the second Blow
at his Majesty's Prerogative and Revenue: wherein I may include the noise they
made against Coat and Conduct-money and Free Quarter.

Having weakened the Civil Power by these Courses, they thought it easy to
overthrow the Ecclesiastical; for the Faction grown bold and considerable by
the remisness of a great Prelate, and the discontent of others, question all
Proceedings in Ecclesiastical Courts, open a door to several vexatious Suits
against several Officers of that Court; besides that they questioned Mr.
Mountague, Mr. Cozens, and threatened Bishop Laud, Bishop Neile, and others,
that were resolved to stand by the Supreme Power of the King in Ecclesiastical
Affairs, against which they levelled their third Blow.

And when all this would not do, they examine the whole Government for diverse
years together; the disbursment of the Revenue, the administrations of War and
Peace. They rake into Prince Henry and King James his death; and this with such
a deal of stir and tumult, that some of them lock the Parliament Doors, others
make such a noise as rings all over Westminster; others force the Speaker, Sir
John Finch, and hold him, whether he would or no, in the Chair, when he would
have left the House, when it was become rather a Billingsgate Conventicle, than
an House of Parliament.

When the turbulent House of Commons was dissolved, and the Faction having got
a new Maxim, That they might say and do what they pleased within the Walls of
that House, as public persons, whereof they were to give no account, as
private men, lost the benefit of it by that Dissolution, (the King resolving,
that they should not make the Parliament a Conspiracy) they fall to Libelling,
Printing, popular Insinuations, Evasions, and Elusions of the Civil and
Ecclesiastical Laws, that tended to the securing of the Government; secret and
open Oppositions to all the ways the King took to raise money, though never so
legally, (the just King always consulting his Judges about the Legality of all
Taxes, before he ordered his Officers to gather them.) For the first Question
in that Kings Reign was, Is it just? And the next, Is it convenient? And those
men that have imposed Millions on others since, grudged to pay then twenty
shillings; for it was but twenty shillings Ship Money that Mr. Hampden went to
Law with the King for, and my Lord Say but for four pounds. And that five
pounds was the occasion of all the stir afterward made about the Ship Money,
which cost the Nation fifty seven Millions Sterling since. The untoward Reading
in the Innes of Court upon Points most dangerous to Government, possessing the
People with strange Fears and Jealousies about Religion, German Horse, a French
and Arbitrary Government, and what not? Every public Action of the King or his
Ministers, being mis-interpreted. Combinations were held between the factious
English, and discontented Scots; whose begging-time being over at Court, they
bethink of coming to Plunder the Country. The Faction gives out, that the King
had deserted the Protestants of the Palatinate, and France, when the truth is,
they had deserted him. The Bishops in their Visitations were every where
opposed, and the Troublesome taught how to elude all Church-Obligations by
Common Law.

In a word, notwithstanding that the Kingdom enjoyed for the first fifteen
years of the excellent King Charles I. his Reign; Trade flourished, and Gold
and Silver in his time was almost as plentiful as in Solomon's: Learning and all
Arts were improved to the height; and Scholars Encouragements were as great as
their Improvements; Religion grew up to its primitive Beauty and Purity; Law
and Justice secured all persons in their just Acquisitions: The People had
liberty to do any thing by evil; the Rich durst not wrong the Poor, neither
need the Poor envy or fear the Rich.

The Treasure of Spain was coined in our Mint, and exchanged for our
Commodities; foreign Nations either feared our Arms, or sought our Friendship:
We claimed and enjoyed the Dominion of the Sea; Wars, Plagues and Famines were
strangers to our Coasts; and we were, even against our will, the happiest
People under Heaven: except only for this, that we were not sensible either of
our Happiness, or of the use of it; understanding, it seems, no more
improvement of the great blessing of Peace and good Government, than wantonness
and unthankfulness.

Notwithstanding fifteen years of the most blessed effects of Justice, Wisdom,
Piety, and Peaceableness of an excellent Prince, of whom the World was not
worthy: By the practices of Cardinal Richlieu, and others, who envied and
feared our happiness; by the Indigence and Schism of the Scots; by the
comprehensive Combination in England, that had taken in with the Puritan
Factions, all the discontented, ambitious, turbulent, innovating, covetous,
desperate, and most easily-deluded sort of people: by the wild courses of such
as had offended beyond all security, save in a troublesome time; by a general
Odium cast upon all Acts of Government, and a perverse Spirit of discontent,
fears, and jealousies, raised throughout the three Kingdoms, and vehemently
possessing all sorts of people; by the necessities of the King, and some
foreign troubles; by the treachery of some that had the management of the
Affairs of Scotland: That which was at first but an Opinion, after that a
Book-controversie, and never durst look beyond a Motion, a Petition, a
Supplication, a Conference, a Disputation, and some private murmurings at best,
became now a War.

The cause whereof on the one side was an old Schism maintained; men's private
Interests promoted; Rebellion, that sin like Witchcraft, the overthrow of all
Laws and Government, the ruin of Learning, Religion, and Order; the piecing up
of broken Estates by Rapine and Plunder; an ambition to attain to those Honors
and Preferments in troublesome times, that they despaired of in those more
quiet, as derived on persons of more worth and deserving: A canting pretense
for Liberty of Conscience and of the Subject, that proved at last nothing but
Licentiousness; the Umbrage of the public good, when it appeared at last but
the project of private persons, who no sooner overthrew the Government, but
they quarrelled one with another; till at last, instead of one good Government,
we had so many, that we had none at all; and instead of an excellent King, all
the Blood, Treasures, and Pretenses, ended in a sordid, base, bloody,
tyrannical, and upstart Usurper, raised out of the meanest of the people.

A Revenge of some particular and personal Wrongs, with the ruin of the
Public; the setting up of Sects, Schisms, and Heresies, upon the subversion of
the established Doctrine and Discipline: a perpetual disgrace and dishonor to
Christianity and the English Nation, occasioning such Burdens and Mischiefs as
the Child unborn may rue; Burdens and Mischiefs conveyed from them to late
Posterity: the desolation of the Country, the ruin of gallant Churches,
Castles and Cities; the undoing of some thousands of Families; the blood of
80000 killed on both sides, and upon all occasions: An unnatural division and
animosity begun even among Relations, that is like to last from Generation to
Generation; abominable Canting, taking of the Name of God in vain; hypocrisy,
perjury, against the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, the Protestation, yea,
the Covenant which they took themselves, and all the Obligations they owed to
God or Man; the mocking of God by Fasts, Prayers, and seeking of his face to
wicked and vile purposes; the making of him the Author of the Abominations he
abhors; the making of Religion only a Cloak to Villainies; and all the
Ordinances of it, especially Sermons and Sacraments, the Ministeries of horrid
undertakings, filling Pulpits with such Nonsense and Lies, as all Ears that
heard tingled. Such encouragement to loose Fancies and vile Opinions, to
enlarge and increase their Party, as left not unshaken any Foundation in the
whole compass of Christian Religion; a Sacrilege unheard of, that was to
swallow up all Bishops and Dean and Chapters Lands, all Tithes and Ministers
Maintenance, all Universities and public Schools, all Hospitals, Colleges,
and charitable Foundations: a Rapine that carried away all the Crown-Revenue,
and sent a great Royal Family a begging; devoured the Estates of above 12000
Noblemen, Gentlemen, and persons of eminent Quality; and indeed left no man so
much propriety as to say, This is mine, there being no other Law or Judicature,
than that Arbitrary one of the Sword; carrying on of the public good, till the
Nation was beggered; a crying up of the power of Parliaments, till the House of
Lords was laid by, and the House of Commons consisting of almost five hundred
Gentlemen, reduced to fifty or sixty Mechanics and poor fellows, who are
turned out by their own Army, as a pack of Knaves and Fools; a pretense to make
the King glorious, till he was murdered; and fighting for him against evil
Counselors, till they cut off his head, the best Counselor he had. The
rendering of a Nation once the Envy and Terror of the World, now its Scorn and
Contempt; and Englishmen once the Glory of Europe, now its Shame, for doing
that which Turks and Pagans, and the Barbarous abhorred, crying out, You fight,
and judge your King! Not to say any thing of the general horror and
consternation that seized all the Christian World, upon that horrid Conspiracy.
The letting loose of all the Jesuitical Principles that had troubled the World,
but were never before owned by things that would be called Protestants.

1. As, that Subjects may resist force with force in their own defense. 2. That
the Law of Nature, in case of necessity, teaches men to take up Arms against
their Sovereign. 3. That a wicked King may be deposed. 4. That a Tyrant may be
killed by any hand, as a wild Beast, and an Enemy of Mankind. 5. That they do
not break their Oaths of Allegiance, that fight against the Kings person, if
they pretend his power. 6. That the King is accountable to the People, as made
by them, in whom resides the Supreme Majesty. 7. That Success is a sign of
Gods blessing and presence with any people in any undertaking. 8. That if the
King keep not his Oath at the Coronation with the people, they are not to keep
their Oaths of Allegiance toward him. 9. That Arms may be taken by Subjects to
promote true Religion. 10. That Liberty is to be allowed to all men under any
Government, to profess what Religion soever they please. 11. That nothing is to
be established in public, that goes against any man's Opinion, Humor or
Conscience in private. 12. That if any Court, Judicature, Form of Worship, or
Law, be abused, then it must be presently laid down, and not used. 13. That any
thing that has been used by the Papists, or that is but pretended to be Popish
(as what that displeased has not been so?) must be abrogated: A Principle,
that the Jesuits observing our blind zeal against Popery, have suggested, to
overthrow all Religion, under pretense of avoiding Popery. 14. That there must
be no Kingdom, but that of Christ's; and that until he comes in person, the
Saints must reign. 15. That Dominion is founded upon Grace; and that the wicked
have no right to any thing that they enjoy. 16. That the Law of the Land was
not made for the Righteous, but for Sinners: so they abused a place of
Scripture that sounds that way. 17. That all the Prophecies and Revolutions
forespoken of, concern England; and that they may make any stir to fulfill these
Prophecies: all that they did, being (as they said) nothing but Gods pouring
out his Vials on the Beast, etc. the whole Scripture being understood not
according to the inward sense, but according to the outward sound; and as the
Fool thinks, so the Bell tinketh. Besides principles of Policy as much
against all Reason and Laws, as these are against all Religion. As, 1. That the
King and the two Houses made up but one Parliament. 2. And that the King, but a
Member, might be overruled by the Head. 3. That the hereditary King of England
is accountable to the People. 4. That it might be lawful for the two House to
seize the Kings Magazines, Navies, Castles, and Forces, and employ them against
him; the Militia being, they said, in them, not in him, though they begged it
of him. 5. That when the King withdrew from the London-Tumults, he deserted his
Parliament and People, and therefore might be warred against. 6. That the two
Houses might impose an Oath upon the King and Kingdom, to subvert the
Government and Kingdom; who never had power to administer an Oath between man
and man, except it were their own Members. 7. That an Ordinance of the two
Houses should be of force to raise Men and Money, to seize peoples Lands and
Goods, to alter Religion, without the Kings consent; without which they never
signified any thing in England, save within their own Walls. 8. That the two
Houses, yea, and some few of those two Houses, should make a new Broad-seal,
create new Judges and Officers of State, ordain a new Allegiance, and a new
Treason never heard of before, and pronounce their Betters, that is to say, all
the Nobility, Clergy, and Gentry, Delinquents against their Blew-apronships. 9.
That they who took so much care, that a man should not part with a penny to
save the Kingdom unless they had Law for it, should force so many Millions out
of the poor people, by a bare piece of paper, called an Ordinance.

This was the Cause, called The good old Cause, on the one side; when on the
other, there was, 1. The Law of the Land. 2. The established Religion. 3. The
Protestant Cause. 4. The Kings Authority. 5. The Church of England, and the
Catholic Church. 6. The Allegiance and Obedience required by the Laws of God
and Man, from Subjects to Sovereigns. 7. The Peace, Tranquillity, Safety, and
Honor of the Nation. 8. The many obligations of Conscience, especially the
Oaths taken by the Nobility, Clergy, and all the people, several times, (ten
times a man at least) and particularly the Oaths taken by every Member of the
House of Commons, at their first admission to sit there, when they took the
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; and the Protestation they took after they
sat. 9. The true liberty and property of the Subject. 10. The security of
Religion and Learning, against the horrid Heresies, Schisms, Libertinism,
Sacrilege, and Barbarism, that was ready to overrun the Land. 11. All the
Principles of Religion, Reason Policy, and Government, that hitherto have been
received in the most civil part of the World, managed against the canting and
pious frauds and fallacies of the Conspiracy, with that clearness that became
the goodness of the Cause, and the integrity of the persons that managed it.
12. The common Cause of all the Kings and Governments of the World. 13. The
Rights, Privileges, Prerogatives, and Inheritances of the ancient Kingdom of
England. 14. The conveyance of their ancient Birthrights, Liberties,
Immunities, and Inheritances, as Englishmen, and Christians to Posterity. 15.
The public good, against the private lusts, ambition, pride, revenge,
covetousness, and humor of any person or persons whatsoever. 16. The opinion
of all the learned Divines and Lawyers in the World. 17. All the Estates in
England made then a prey to the most potent and powerful; I mean, the Lands and
Revenues of most of the Nobility, Clergy, and Commons of England. 18. The
sparing of a world of blood and treasure, that poor misguided Souls were like
to lavish away upon the juggles of a few Impostors.


This was the Cause on the other hand; and such as the Causes were, were the
persons engaged in them. Against the King, the Law, and Religion, were a
company of poor Tradesmen, broken and decayed Citizens, deluded and
Priest-ridden women, discontented Spirits, creeping, pitiful, and neglected
Ministers, and Trencher-Chaplains; Enthusiastical Factions, such as
Independents, Anabaptists, Seekers, Quakers, Levellers, Fifth Monarchy-men,
Libertines, the rude Rabble that knew not wherefore they were got together;
Jesuited Politicians, Taylers, Shoomakers, Linkboys, etc. guilty and notorious
Offenders, that had endured or feared the Law: perjured and deceitful
Hypocrites and Atheists; mercenary Soldiers, hollow-hearted and ambitious
Courtiers, one or two poor and disobliged Lords, cowardly and ignorant Neuters,
here and there a Protestant frighted out of his wits. These were the Factions
Champions; when on the Kings side, there were all the Bishops of the Land, all
the Deans, Prebends, and learned men; both the Universities; all the Princes,
Dukes, and Marquesses; all the Earls and Lords, except two or three, that
stayed at Westminster to make faces one upon another, and wait on their Masters
the Commons, until they bid them go about their business, telling them they had
nothing to do for them, and voting them useless: All the Knights and Gentlemen
in the three Nations, except a score of Sectaries and Atheists, that kept with
their Brethren and Sisters for the Cause: The Judges and best Lawyers in the
Land; all the Statesmen and Counselors; the Officers and great men of the
Kingdoms; all the Princes and States of Europe. Of all which gallant persons,
take this Catalogue of Honor, containing the Lives, Actions, and Deaths of
those eminent persons of Quality and Honor, that Died, or otherwise Suffered
for their Religion and Allegiance, from the year 1637, to this present year
1666. For the lasting honor of their Persons and Families, the reward of their
eminent Services and Sufferings, the perpetual memory of the Testimony they
gave to the duty of Subjects toward their Sovereign, the satisfaction of all
the World, the Completing of History, the encouragement of Virtue and
Resolution, the instruction of the present Age and Posterity.

The Faction take the same course to ruin a Kingdom, that they said the Gods
took to ruin a Man; first, to infatuate, and then overthrow; make the first
stroke at the Head and Council of the Nation; judging, that they must take off
and terrify the Kings Council and Friends, before they could practice on his
Majesty, or the Government: (so Tarquin was advised to take off the tallest
Poppeys.)

My Lord of Strafford they knew very active, wise, resolved, and serviceable,
when he maintained the Liberty of the Subject, against the Prerogatives of the
Sovereign; and him they judged most dangerous, now he maintained the Rights and
Power of his Sovereign, against the Encroachments of their Faction: He leads
the Van of this gallant Company of Martyrs, and the first Hero that sealed his
Allegiance with his blood, and Consecrated the Controversy; a Protomartyr,
like St. Stephen, knocked on the head by a Rabble, rather then fairly tried in
Courts; condemned with Stones, rather than Arguments; instructing Loyal
Subjects, How when they had done great things for their Sovereign, they might
suffer greater.

THE LIFE, ACTIONS, AND DEATH OF Sir THOMAS WENTWORTH, Earl of STRAFFORD,
Proto^ Martyr for Religion and Allegiance.
SIR Thomas Wentworth Earl of Strafford, owed his Birth to the best governed
City Being born (his Mother coming casually to London) in Chance^ Lane, in the
Parish of St. Dunstans in the West, and Christened there, April 22. 1593.
London; his Breeding to the best modelled School, York; and a most exact
College, St. John's in Cambr. his Accomplishments to the best Tutors, Travel
and Experience; and his Prudence to the best School, a Parliament: whither he
came in the most active and knowing times, with a strong Brain, and a large
Heart: His Activity was eminent in his Country, and his Interest strong in
(King Charles's) Parliament; where he observed much, and pertinently; spoke
little, but home; contrived effectually^ but closely; carried his Designs
successfully, but reservedly. He apprehended the public Temper as clearly, and
managed it to his purposes as orderly as any man. He spoke least but last of
all, with the advantage of a clear view of others Reasons, and the addition of
his own. He, and his leading Confidents molded that in a private Conference,
which was to be managed in a public Assembly. He made himself so considerable
a Patriot, that he was bought over to be a Courtier; so great his Abilities,
that he awed a Monarchy when disobliged, and supported it when engaged; the
Balance turning thither where this Lord stood. -- The North was reduced by his
Prudence, and Ireland by his Interest; He did more there in two years, then was
done in two hundred before.

1. Extinguishing the very Relics of the War. 2. Setting up a standing Army.
3. Modelling the Revenue. 4. Removing the very Root and Occasions of new
Troubles. 5. Planting and Building. 6. Settling Ecclesiastical and Civil Courts.
7. Recovering the hearts of the People by able Pastors and Bishops, by prudent
and sober Magistrates, by Justice and Protection, by Obligations and Rewards.
8. Recovering the Churches Patrimony and Discipline. 9. Employing most able and
faithful Ministers and Instruments. 10. Taking an exact view of all former
Presidents, Rules, and Proceedings. 11. An exact correspondence with his
Majesty, and the Favorites of England.
None was more conversant in the Factions, Intrigues, and Designs than he, when
a Common-wealths-man; none abler to meet with them than he, when a Statesman;
he understood their Methods, kenned their Wiles, observed their Designs, looked
into their Combinations, comprehended their Interest.

And as King Charles understood best of any Monarch under Heaven, what he could
do in point of Conscience: So his Strafford apprehended best of any Counselor
under the Sun, what he could do in point of Power. He, and my Lord of
Canterbury having the most particular account of the State of Great Britain and
Ireland, of any persons living. Nature is often hidden, sometimes overcome,
seldom extinguished; yet Doctrine and Discourse had much allayed the severity
of this Earls Nature, and Custom more: None more austere to see to; none more
obliging to speak with: He observed pauses in his discourse, to attend the
motion, and draw out the humor of other men; at once commanding his own
thoughts, watching others: His passion was rather the vigor, than the disorder
of his wel-weighed Soul; which could dispense its anger with as much prudence,
as it managed any Act of State. He gave his Majesty safe counsel in the
prosperity of his Affairs, and resolute advice in Extremity, as a true Servant
of his Interest, rather than of his Power. So eminent was he and my Lord of
Canterbury, that Rebellion despaired of success, as long as the first lived;
and Schism of licentiousness, as long as the second stood. Take my Lord of
Strafford as accused, and you will find his Integrity and Ability, that he
managed his whole Government either by the Law, or the Interest of his Country.
Take him as dying, and you will see his Parts and Piety; his Resolution for
himself, his Self-resignation for the Kingdoms good; his Devotion for the
Church, whose Patrimony he forbad his Son upon his Blessing. Take him as dead,
you will find him glorious and renowned in these three Characters.

The first, of the best King.
I looked upon my Lord of Strafford, (...). Meditat. 2.
as a Gentleman whose great Abilities might make a Prince rather afraid, than
ashamed to employ him in the greatest Affairs of State; for those were prone to
create in him great confidence of undertakings; and this was like enough to
betray him to great Errors, and many Enemies, whereof he could not but contract
great store; while moving in so high a Sphere, and so vigorous a luster, he
must nedds (as the Sun) raise many envious Exhalations; which condensed by a
popular Odium, were capable to cast a Cloud upon the brightest Merit and
Integrity: Though I cannot in my judgment approve all he did, driven (it may
be) by the necessities of Times, and the Temper of that People, more than led
by his own disposition to any height (...) ^igour of Action, etc.

The second, of the best Historian.
He was a person of a generous Spirit, Dr. R. P. Life of King Charles l.
fitted for the noblest Exercises, and the most difficult parts of Empire: his
Counsels were bold, yet just; and he had a vigor proper for the execution of
them: Of an eloquence next that of his Masters, Masculine and excellent. He was
no less affectionate to the Church, than to the State; and not contented while
living to defend the Government and Patrimony of it, he commended it also to
his Son when he was about to die, and charged his abhorrency of Sacrilege. His
Enemies called the majesty of his Mind in his Lieutenancie, pride; and the
undaunted execution of his Office on the Contumacious, the Insolency of his
Fortune. He was censured for that fatal error of following the King to London,
and to the Parliament, after the Pacification at York; And 'twas thought, that
if he had gone over to his Charge in Ireland, he might have secured both
himself, and that Kingdom for his Majesty's Service. But some attribute this
Counsel to a necessity of Fate, whose first stroke is at the Brain of those
whom it designs to ruin; and brought him to feel the effects of popular Rage,
which himself in former Parliaments had used against Government; and to find
experience of his own devices upon the Duke of Buckingham.

Providence teaches us to abhor over-sine Counsels, by mischiefs they often
bring upon their Authors.

The third, of Common Fame.
A Gentleman he was of rare Choice, H. Lin King Charles ^
and singular Endowments; I mean of such as modelled, fashioned, accomplished
him for State-concernments; of a searching and penetrating Judgment, nimble
apprehension, ready and fluent in all results of Council; most happy in the
vein of Speech, which was always round, perspicuous, and express, much to the
advantage of his sense; and so full stocked with Reason, that he might be
rather said to demonstrate, than to argue.

As these Abilities raised him to State-Administration; so his addressing, his
applying those Abilities so faithfully in promotion of the Royal Interest, soon
rendered him a Favorite of the first Admission: So that never King had a more
Intelligent, and withal, a firmer Servant than he was to his Majesty. But these
qualities which rendered him so amiable to his Majesty, represented him
formidable to the Scots; so that some who were not well persuaded of the
justness of his Sentence, thought he suffered not so much for what he had done
already, as for what he was like to have done, had he lived, to the dis-service
of that Nation: and that he was not sacrificed so much to the Scots revenge, as
to their fear. And certainly his fall was as the first, so the most fatal Wound
the Kings Interest ever received; his three Kingdoms hardly affording another
Strafford; that is, one man his peer in Parts and Fidelity to his Majesty. He
had a singular passion for the Government and Patrimony of the Church; both
which he was studious to preserve safe and sound, either opining them to be of
sacred Extraction, or at least prudent constitution, relating to holy
performances. And had he wanted these positive Graces, yet in so great a Person
it may be commendable, that he was eminent for privative and negative
Excellencies, being not taxable with any vice; those petty pleasures being
beneath the satisfaction of a Soul so large as his. In short, says the
ingenious Gentleman, He was a man who might have passed under a better notion,
had he lived in better times.

This last Period is a Question; since this great Statesman, and his good
Masters Goodness was so over-shadowed with their Greatness, and their Virtues
so lost in their Power, as the Sun (the aptest parallel of their Luster and
Beneficence) is hid in his own light^ that they owe their great, but glorious
Fame, to their misfortunes, and their Renown to their ruin; that levelled
their worth, otherwise as much out of their reach, as their place, to vulgar
apprehensions. Eclipsed Luster, like a veiled Beauty, is most looked on when
most covered: The setting Sun is more glorious than its self in its Meridian,
because more low; and the lowest Planet seems biggest to a common eye.

So faithful he was, and the Archbishop, that in the Iuncto, consisting of them
two and Duke Hamilton, they voted a Parliament, though they knew themselves the
first Sufferers by it; and so confident of his Integrity, that when he had
Treason enough discovered at the late Transactions in York, (touching the Scots
Conspiracy) to charge his Enemies with, he waved the advantage; and secure in
his own Innocence, fell an Instance of that Maxim, That there is no Danger
small, but what is thought so. This was his great Principle, Usurped Royalty
was never laid down by persuasion from Royal Clemency; for, in armis jus omne
regni.

Bishop Land was the man by whose advice he had his Power and Preferment; and
he was the man according to whose direction he managed it: Being no sooner
admitted Member of the House of Peers, than friend to the Bishop of Bath and
Wells; and at the same time of the Kings intimate Council, and the Bishops
intimate Acquaintance: his first Act in Council was, to advise his Majesty to
take Tonnage and Poundage, if it might be had as the Gift of the People; if
not, as one of the Duties belonging to his Prerogative; a Prerogative without
which Kingdoms are not safe; for if Kings have not an absolute power, when
there is need to impose on their Subjects, they may not have power when there
is occasion to defend them: they that weaken their Sovereigns power, weaken
their own security; and when a Prince is reduced to that pass, that he cannot
help and serve himself, he will quickly come to that pass, that he shall not be
able to protect his people. His next was, to advise the King to stand by the
Farmers of the Custom-house, when questioned, viz. Sir John Wolstenholm, Mr.
Daws, and Mr. Caermarthin. Good Servants are neither to be encouraged in Wrong,
nor to be forsaken in the Right: That Prince must show himself resolute and
stout, whose Affairs cannot be managed by cowardly Servants. Many counseled
the questioning of the refractory Members in the House of Commons, that kept
the Speaker in his Chair in spite of his teeth, locked up the Doors against
all Messages from the King, detained the Sergeant at Arms by force, declared
their Fellow Subjects Traitors, etc. But my Lord of Strafford was for
neglecting them: the Action, if questioned, might be made out to the people, to
be a defense of their Liberty; whereas, if slighted, it is but a Hubbub; and
they that were at first condemned by all for their disorder, would be, if
convented, at last pitied for their Sufferings. The great Richlieu construed an
old Maxim Injuriae sprelae exolescunt.
of Tacitus thus: -- Criminals never grow considerable till thought so, and so
raised from despicable Delinquents to a formidable Party. Innovation the whole
Council suspected always, as bringing with it more Inconveniences by the
Change, than Advantage by the Reformation; and he condemned upon this
observation, That where Reformation once drew on a Change, the desire of change
an hundred times but pretended Reformation. Although he had no mind to meddle
with the persons of the Seditious in the last Parliament, yet he took special
notice of the Doctrines of one of them, viz. Eliot, that said, He was not bound
to give an account, as a private person, before the Council, of what he said or
did as a public person in Parliament: As if (as the wise man would observe
with much impatience) That August Assembly that advised about Laws to punish
Disorders, should be the only Sanctuary for them: And a Parliament were no
other than the Saturnalia of Rome, where Slaves for some days in the year,
might say (and do) what they pleased of their Masters.

It was easy for him to foresee the readiness of the Emperor to yield to a
peace, when pressed so hard by the Swede: but to come one Morning to the
Council, when they were most busy and perplexed about the War with France,
Having a design upon Spain, as Spain had upon them.
and assure them that France would beg a Peace, as they did by the Mediation
of Venice, was a foresight none owned, but one, that, as it is said of
Mazarine, Was of all the Councels of Europe: Adding, That that was a time for
England, though low, to be Courted as it was from Spain, Venice, Holland,
Denmark, etc. and not to be provoked.

None more diligent to find out ways to supply the Kings occasions; yet none
more severe than this Lord against Books of Projects, such as Dudley's, and
others Books, designed rather to raise the Jealousies of the People, than the
Revenue of the King: None severer against Libels, and others the sad
Prognostics of the sad times approaching; yet none more against the vexing,
imprisoning, and mutilating those Offenders, than he; judging it safer to cut
off, or pardon, than distress any man; that is, to take away either his power
or will to Revenge: The vexed and distressed man is continually before peoples
eyes, to move or exasperate them, the dead and pardoned are forgotten.

My Lord had vast Affections for the Protestant Interest, as appeared by his
Proposals in Council, his wishes rather than his hopes, and what he would,
rather then what he could do: yet he suspected the Swedes and Scots Assistants,
as rather an Army of Mercenaries, than the Auxiliaries of Friends. Two things
he said undid us: 1. That our Divines had been so careless in opening the
ground of Religion; that Novelties had got such advantages over ancient Truths,
as to charge primitive Practices, for Innovations. 2. That our Lawyers were so
biased in their explications of the ground of the Law, that old Laws, such as
those of Knighthood, (whereby the Subjects holding of the King (as all do
originally) were either to be Knighted, or fined for it) and that for
Ship Money, shall be cried down for new Exactions.


My Lord applauded his Majesty's generous Goodness in stopping the In which
Trial he was one of the Judges.
Combat between the Witnesses about Hamiltons Design to entertain all the
Scots abroad, to serve him against his Prince at home; but he feared his
easiness afterward in trusting him: He like H. 7. being at once what few men
are, most suspicious, most knowing, and most stout; whereas, usually the
suspicious man is one that knows little, and fears much.

Much did he resent the Differences between Protestants and Protestants, and
more, with Bishop Bancroft, encouraged he the Dissentions between the Seculars
and Jesuits; as he did in Civil Matters, between some Scots and English;
advising, that the Press might be open to them, to discover the nakedness of
their Parties; and shut to our Disputants, the Sabbatarians and
Anti-Sabbatarians, the Arminians and Anti-Arminians, lest we betray our own
Opinions; (it was his Maxim) For Schools positive, and practical Divinity
only for Presses and Pulpits. A Maxim of as great concernment to the Church,
as his Contributions for Paul's; which to say no more, were worthy the Earl of
Strafford, and Bishop Laud's friend. From being a Member of the Council in the
South, he was advanced Lord President of the North; and thence a while after,
Lord Deputy of Ireland. In the North begun that Animosity between him and Vane,
about Raby, that was not allayed but with his blood: Here he would have
strengthened the Law by Prerogative, always making good the Prerogative by Law;
some there complained to him of the Kings Government, and he told them, They
complained of the Laws; adding, That the little Finger of the Law (if not
moderated by the Kings Clemency) would be heavier than the Kings Loins. He
endeavored to indear his Majesty's Government to his best Subjects, and render
it dreadful to the worst. Parts and Merits employed against the Government by
mistake, he informed, and encouraged to better Employment; but Parts and Merits
poisoned by Pride and Ambition, he suppressed and slighted; saying, He loved
not a man of large Parts, and a narrow and selfish Spirit. He had Worth that
was sure to raise Envy, and a Prudence to allay it, moderating the power he had
himself, and maintaining that of other Magistrates, who might be his Skreen:
Who, as he engrossed not Business to exercise his Power; so he entangled it not
to raise a suspicion of his Cunning; carrying things on in a plain and open,
rather than a private and close way; not that he feared the effects of Envy on

[t^ey are the words of a great Lord, then trusted with the Crown of that

perhaps incline to make choice of another King. This ^rogress, by taking in the
most popular and great Noblemen of the North to attend His Majesty, he managed
with a noble Conduct, advancing all along the Kings Majesty's Interest and
Honor; of such mighty consequence it is how a Prince appears to his people.

When he had composed the Affairs of Scotland, some defects appearing by daily
Tumults and Commotions in the Government of Ireland, The Earl is made L. L. of
Ireland, 1633
this accomplished Person in the Affairs of Rule, discovering daily greater and
greater Abilities, equal to a Minister of State, (after he had brought my Lord
of Holland to a Submission at the Council Table, and in some measure reduced
the Factions that broke out daily at Court; where, to use his dear Friend
Archbishop Land's words, Private Ends appeared every day more and more ^o the
prejudice of the public Service) was entreated to the Supreme Care [under His
Majesty] of that Kingdom; a Trust he managed so well, That 1. he discharged
Fourscore thousand Pounds the King owed, and raised Twenty thousand men, and as
many thousand Pounds that the King wanted in the year 1634. 2. Reduced the
Popish and Protestant Parties to so even a temper, that upon some Disorders
that year, he was able to summon such a Parliament as was able to allay, and
fix the several Factions to a due temperament, guiding the zeal of each Party
by such Rules of Moderation, as were ever observed most effectual to preserve,
and restore the health of all States and Kingdoms. 3. Prevailed with the Church
of Ireland to admit of the 39 Articles of the Church of England; that as he
would say, They that agreed for the main in the truth of Gods Holy Word, might
keep the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of Peace: It being a sad thing in his
opinion, that three Christian and Protestant Kingdoms, under one Christian and
Protestant King, should have three several Confessions of Faith. 4. Abolished
several idle and barbarous Customs, putting the Natives upon ingenious ways of
Improving that rich Land, by Flax, Hemp, etc. infinitely to the Advantage of
the King and Kingdom. 5. Recovering near upon 40000 l. per year to the Church;
which by ungodly Alienations was made, says a Bishop of their own, as low as
Poverty it self; bringing over with him as great Affections for the Church and
all Public Interests, as he had Abilities to serve them. 6. Put Ireland Anno
1639. in three months, by a Parliament he got together in that short time,
into such a posture for Men and Money, as was a Pattern to the following
Parliament of England; which resented that Service so much, that the House of
Commons gave him the Thanks of the Kingdom in their own House, and waited
upon him [two of their most eminent Members supporting him] to his place in the
House of Lords. In fine, he wrought that wild and loose people to such a
degree of Peace, Plenty and Security, as it had never been since it was annexed
to this Crown, and made it pay for the Charges of its own Government, which
before was deducted out of the English Treasury.

Their Peace and Laws now opening accesses to Plenty, and Trade, he remitted
indeed nothing of that Authority, Strictness, Discipline, or Grandieur, that
might advance the Interest or Honor of his Master; yet he admitted so much
moderation into his Counsels and Proceedings, as that Despair added to former
Discontents, and the Fears of utter Extirpation to their wonted Pressures,
should not provoke to an open Rebellion, a people prone enough to break out to
all exorbitant Violence, both by some principles of their Religion, and the
natural desires of Liberty; both to exempt themselves from their present
restraints, and prevent after-rigors.

And when the Tumults of Scotland, His C^unsels ^o the King ^bou^ the Scottish,
and English tumults.
and the Discontents of England called for the same Counsel here, that he had
with success applied to the distempers of Ireland, how clearly did he see
through the Mutinies and Pretenses of the Multitude, into the long-contrived
Conspiracies and Designs of several orders of more dangerous men, whose
Covetousness and Ambition would digest, as he foresaw, the rash Tumults, into
a more sober and solemn Rebellion. How happily did he divine that the Affronts
offered the Kings Authority on the score of Superstition, Tyranny, Idolatry,
Maladministration, Liberty, (words as little understood by the Vulgar, as the
Design that lay under them) were no other than Essays made by certain
sacrilegious and needy men, to confirm the Rapines upon Church and State they
had made in Scotland, and to open a door to the same practices in England, to
try how the King, who had already ordered a Revocation of all such Usurpations
in Scotland, and had a great mind to do the like in England, would bear their
rude and insolent Attempts, whether he would consult his Power, or his
Goodness; assert his Majesty, or yield to their importunity.

How nimbly did he meet with the Faction, by a Protestation he gained from all
the Scots in England and Ireland, against the Covenant of their Brethren in
Scotland, Lysunach^^ N^cano^s u^^ying of the Knot.
at the same time in several Books he caused to be printed, discovering that
the Scottish Faction that so much abhorred Popery, proceeded in this Sedition
upon the worst of Popish principles and practices. And that this Godly League
which was so much applauded by the people, was a Combination of men acting over
those Traiterous, Bloody, and Jesuitical Maxims of Mariana, Suarez, Sa,
Bellarmine, which all good people abhorred; Adding that those very persons that
instructed the poor populary to quarrel with their Sovereign about Liberty,
should (as it followed afterward) lay a more unsupportable slavery upon them,
than their most impious slanders could form in the imagination of the
Credulous, that they might fear from the King.

The power God had invested him with, he entreated the King to own, and the
ways the Laws of God, and the Land allowed him, to maintain, that power to make
use of, employing all the able men that pretended to skill, either in Law, or
Government, to see if Prerogative had any way yet left to save an unwilling
People; for knowing how prevailing the Seditious were always to disturb the
Counsels of the Parliament, he feared that from their proceedings the common
Enemies would be encouraged (as formerly) to higher Insolences, and the
envious Demagogues would contemn their own safety, to ruin the Kings Honor:
therefore giving vigorous Orders for raising the Ship Money, and a great
Example toward Advancing a Benevolence, subscribing himself 20000 l. and
procuring the Subscription of 500000 l. from the Church, the Court, the City,
and Country, besides some thousands by Compositions with Papists, especially
in Staffordshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire, etc. and by Forfeitures observed by
him in By the Londoners.
London Derry, and other places, held by Patent from His Majesty.

When he saw a Faction (by the diligence of the Kings enemies, and the Security
and Treason of his pretended Friends, who made it their business to persuade
His Majesty that there was no danger, so long until there was no safety) formed
into Councels, and drawn up into Armies, when he saw one Kingdom acting in open
Rebellion, and another countenancing and inclining to it: when he discovered a
Correspondence between the Conclave By Barbarino's means Protector of the
English.
of Rome, and the Cardinal See the Letter between them in our Chronicles.
of France; between the King of France and the Rebels of Scotland; between the
Leaders of the Scottish Sedition, and the Agents of the English Faction, [one
Pickering, Laurence Hampden, Fines, etc. being observed then to pass to and fro
between the English and the Scottish Brethren] and saw Letters signed with the
Names (though as some of them alleged since, without the consent) of the Five
Members, etc. when the Government in Church and State was altered, the Kings
Ships, Magazines, Revenue, Forts, and faithful Servants were seized on; the
Orders of State, and Worship of God were affronted by a barbarous multitude,
that with sticks, stools, and such other instruments of Fury as were present,
disturbed all religious and civil Conventions: and the Kings Agents, Hamilton,
Traquair and Roxborough, pleased no doubt with the Commotions they at first
raised, and by new, though secret seed of Discontents improved, increased the
Tumults by a faint Opposition, which they might have allayed by vigorous
punishments; all the Declarations that were drawn in the Kings Name being
contrived so, as to overthrow his Affairs.

In a word, when he saw that the Traitors were got into the Kings Bedchamber,
Cabinets, Pockets, and Bosom, and by false representation of things, had got
time to consolidate their Conspiracy, and that the Kings Concessions to their
bold Petition (about the Liturgy, the High Commission, the Book of Canons, and
the ^ive Articles of Perth) were but Encouragements to put up bolder; finding
that Force could obtain that which Modesty and Submission had never compassed;
and imputing all kindness to the Kings Weakness rather than Goodness. His
apprehensions in that affairs were (as they were taken at Councel-Table-Debates
about that business to this purpose.)

In general, after the Delivery of a Paper consisting of twenty seven Heads,
See the sho^ Notes of the Lord Lieutenant, Lord Archbishop, Co^ting, etc. in
Hist. King Charles l. page 310. Sanders
at Council Board. Dec. 5. 1639. against the Kings Indulgence to them, he
voted, that they were to be Reduced by force, being a people as his Majesty
observed of them, lost by favors, and won by punishments) in an Offensive War,
that would (he would pawn his head on it) put a period to all the Troubles in
five months, whereas a Defensive War will linger many years.

In particular, Advising the setting up of the Commission of Array, and
Amassing a gallant Army for Honor and Service, consisting of 24000 Foot 12000
Horse, and 2000 Volunteers, Lords and Gentlemen, that brought the Scots to a
Submission and Pacification, such as it was; which the Scots falsifying, and
breaking, obtruding false Articles, and observing none of the true ones; he
considering that they who had broken the Peace out of a desire of War, would
never leave the War out of a desire of Peace; but would have if not rendered
unable as well as unwilling) as constant fits of Rebellion, as they had of
lusts or want, advised the calling of a Parliament, The Earls ^ank Advice about
a Parliament.
the most Authentic way of managing the Government. Freeely saying in Council,
That he knew a Parliament, if but rightly tempered, was so able to settle these
Distractions, that if he were sure to be the first man that should be ruined by
it, he would advice the Calling of it. Altered the Model of the Army,
discharging the Hunting Lords, as they were then called, and recommending the
Right Honorable and Well-beloved Earl of Northumberland General, himself
undertaking the place of Lieutenant General, not doubting to chase the Rebels
[to use his own words] in two months, had not the Lord Conway [whether out of
design or weakness, not yet decided] disheartened the Army, by the
unsuccessfulness and indiscretion of his first Encounter, and the English Lords
prevented the Victory by a Petition for Peace and a Parliament, to the King;
whose tenderness of his Subjects blood, and prudence not to sully his glory
with an unequal Combat, would not permit him to fight, when the gains of a
Victory could not balance the hazard of attempting it.

His Advices against the Faction were prudent, and the Remedies seasonable. 1.
The exploding of their Doctrine, when urged by some men, whose compliance with
the factious way, was called Moderation in their own: and the discovering of
their practices in the Examen Conjurationis Scoticae: Or, The ungirding of the
Scots Armor; the Author his servant; and the thing his design to let the world
see, what it afterward felt. 2. Bringing all the Scots in Ireland to declare
against the dangerous Covenant of Scotland. 3. Making the loyal and ready
Assistance of the Parliament of Ireland in 39. a president for that of England
in 40. 4. And returning as seasonably to lay open their pretenses, and obviate
their reaches in Treaties, as he had done their Plot in Parliaments; willing
enough to hear of a present Peace, but more willing to provide a future
Security; saying, He could pardon, but not trust a Scot. He managed his Army as
Lieutenant General, as if he had been ready to fight them: and yet he ordered
his Advices, as if he were willing to close with them. As they judged it their
best way to ask with their Sword in their hands, so thought he it the most
expedient method to answer them so. Since, though God never entrusted Subjects
with the Sword, to obtain their privileges; yet he did Kings with it to awe to
duty. He knew what he did when he commanded the Governors of Barwick and
Carlisle, to watch the Invaders on the Borders, at the same time that he looked
to them in Councels, where he was resolved they should not obtain that by a
Pacification, that they could not hope for by a Battle; persuading His Majesty
to examine the Conspiracy to the bottom, before he composed it, lest the
skinned Sore might rankle: To which purpose he would deal with the Tumult not
jointly and all together, where they were bold and reserved, but singly, and
one by one; for in that capacity Rebels are fearful and open, though it was not
then possibly so advised a saying, yet it has appeared since to be a very
faithful and useful one; that he hasting into England out of Ireland, as they
did out of Scotland, should say upon the Delivery of his Sword, If ever I
return to this Honorable Sword, I shall not leave of the Scots Faction neither
Root nor Branch. As Sylla said of Caesar, there are many Marius'es in that Boy,
so he would say of this Conspiracy when low, there are many Villainies in this
Plot.

He could endure as little the petulancy of the Scots, as they could his
prudence and Government: When they having leavied Men and Money, seized the
Kings Magazines and strong Holds; raised Forts, begirt his Castles, affronted
his Proclamations, summoned Assemblies, proclaimed Fasts, deprived and
excommunicated Bishops, abolished Episcopacy; issued out Warrants to choose
Parliament Commissioners, appealed from the King to the people, trampled on
Acts of Parliament, discharged Counselors and Judges of their Allegiance,
confirmed all this by a League and Covenant, swearing to do what otherwise they
would not have done, that their consciences might oblige them to do that,
because they had sworn; which because not lawful to be done, was not lawful to
be sworn.

He leavied Men and Money, disarmed the Irish and Scots, secured his Garrisons
and Ports, had an Army ready to serve His Majesty, and five Subsidies to
maintain it, and confirmed all with an Oath imposed to abjure that Covenant. He
returns in 39. after five months absence, having done as much as had been done
in five score years before, toward the reducing of the Natives of Ireland, to
the civility, trade, and plenty of England, and disposing their Revenue so, as
to repay England the charge it had been at with Ireland, when Walsingham wished
it one great Bogge. And therefore the Scots accuse him for pref^rring Bp.
Bramhal, Bp. Chapel.
Neither was he less careful of the Churches Doctrine than Discipline,
forbidding the Primate's obtruding the Calvinists School points, for Articles
of Faith; and in stead of the Polemick Articles of the Church of Ireland, to
recieve the positive, plain, and orthodox Articles of the Church of England;
neither admitting high Questions, nor countenancing the men that promoted them,
aiming at a Religion that should make men serious, rather than curious; honest,
rather than subtle; and men lived high, but did not talk so: equally disliking
the Trent Faith consisting of Canons, Councels, Fathers, etc. that would become
a Library rather than a Catechism, and the Scots Confessions consisting of such
School Niceties, as would fill a man's large Table Book and Commonplace, rather
than his heart. Julius Caesar said other men's wives should not be loose, but
his should not be suspected. And this great Lord advised the Primate of
Ireland, that as no Clergy man should be in reality guilty of compliance with a
Schism, so should not he in appearance. Adding, when the Primate urged the
dangers on all sides, as Caesar once said, You are too old to fear, and I too
sickly. A true saying, since upon the opening of his Body, it was found that he
could not have lived, according to the course of Nature, six months longer
than he did by the malice of his Enemies, his own Diseases having determined
his life about the same period that the Nations distemper did; and his
Adversaries having prevailed nothing, but that that death which he just paying
as a debt to Nature, should be in the instant hallowed to a Sacrifice for
Allegiance; and he that was dying, must be martyred, and just when he put off
his Coronet, Put on a Crown.

Philip the I. of Spain said, he could not compass his design as long as Lerma
lived; nor the Scots theirs as long as Strafford acts, and with his own single
worth bears up against the Plot of three Kingdoms, like Sceva, in the breach,
with his single resolution duelling the whole Conspiracy.

That now being resolved into two Committees, the one of Scots, the other of
English, first impeach him December. 17. of High Treason in the House of Lords;
though so Innocent, and so well satisfied in his own present integrity, that
when he might have kept with an Army that loved him well at York, to give Law
to those conspitors, he came to receive Law from them; and when he might have
been secure in his Government, and in the Head of an Army in Ireland, he came
to give an account of that Government, and Army in England; laying down his own
Sword to be subject to others, and teaching how well he could Govern, by
showing how well he could obey; yea, when he might have retired and charged his
Adversaries (as Bristow did Buckingham) with that conspiracy for the overthrow
of Government wherewith they charged him. He being able to prove how P. H. H.
K. S. H. S. that thirst most for his blood, had correspondence with, and gave
counsel to the Kings Enemies in Scotland, and Ireland, and England; when they
could prove no more for the alteration of the Law against him, than that he
gave advice to the King according to his place to support them, yet he tamely
yielded his whole life to be scanned by those that could not be safe, but when
he was dead; and having managed the great trust reposed in him, by the Laws of
Ancient Parliaments, was not afraid to submit himself to the censure of this.
Rather than hide his head in some Foreign Nation that offered him Sanctuary;
(saying, That England had but one good head, and that was to be Cut off,
meaning His) he would loose in his own, scorning for services done his own
King, to beg protection of another.

The brave man judging that he deserved death, that minute he feared it, and
that he was fit to be Condemned that day he refused to be Tried, appeared in
Parliament, and Counsel with that resolution, that afterward he appeared at
the Bar with, till the Scots thinking their guilt could not be pardoned till
his Innocence was Impeached, and that their vast Accounts amounting to 514128l.
9s. could not pass, till he was laid up, to give up his, as he was in December.
1640 and the Scots going with the English, first Impeached, and afwards, Ian.
30. completed their Charge against him; which drawn up in two hundred sheets
of paper, was brought to the Peers by Pym, and [how Sir Henry V. short Notes
multiplied,] were read Feb. 24. to the Peers before the King, and Feb. 25. to
the Commons, consisting of 28. Articles, to which having Counsel allowed him in
matter of Law after three days debate about it, and they allowed to plead, but
in matters they were restrained to by the House; he answered in
Westminster Hall before the King, Queen, the Prince, and Courtiers, in an
apartment by themselves, and the whole Parliament, an Audience equal to the
greatness of the Earls Person, and the Earl of Lindsey, being Lord High
Constable for the day, the Earl of Arundel Lord High Steward on the 22. of
March, as to matter of Fact in general; and the Court adjourning to the next
day, then in particular to 13 Articles put to him of a sudden, as first that
he had withdrawn 24000l. out of Exchequer of Ireland, for his own use:
Secondly, That the Irish Garrisons had in the years 1635, 1636. etc. been
maintained with English Treasure. Thirdly, That he had preferred infamous, and
Popish persons, such as the Bishop of Waterford, etc. in the Irish Church.

To which (notwithstanding the surprise of a Vote wherein the Parliament of
Ireland charged him of High Treason) a Copy whereof was delivered sealed to the
Lords at that very instant, with purpose to discompose him, (An emergency that
transported him indeed to say in passion) That there was a Conspiracy against
him; which when the Faction aggravated as if he charged with High Treason by
both Houses of Parliaments, should charge both Parliaments with a Conspiracy,
though he execused it, as meant of particular and private persons, ^raving
pardon for the inconsiderateness of the expression. He answered with an
undaunted Presence of spirit, with firm Reason, and powerful Eloquence to this
purpose, that the Money he had taken for himself, was no other than what Money
he had paid for the King before. Secondly, That he had eased the Kingdom of
those Garrisons wherewith it had been burdened, during his Predecessors time.
Thirdly, That the Bishop of Waterford, had deceived him, and satisfied the Law;
and the next day after, March^ 24. to these Articles [all the forementioned 28.
Articles being (...) urged] he replied thus,

The First Article insisted on, That 31. A^^^^s ^^33. he being Lord President
of the North, For which his Commission was dated the 21 M^^^^h, 163^.
and Justice of Peace publicly at the York A^^^zes, declared that some
Justices were all for Law, but they should find that the Kings little singer
should be heavier than the loins of the Law, testified by Sir David Fowls, etc.

The Earls Reply.
That Sir David Fowls was his professed Enemy, that his words were clearly
inverted, that his expression was, That the little ^inger of the Law (if not
moderated by the Kings gracious Clemency) was heavier then the Kings loins.
That these were his words, he verified; First by the occasion of them, they
being spoken to some whom the Kings favor had then enlarged from imprisonment
at York, as a motive to their thank fullness to his Majesty. Secondly, By Sir
William Pennyman a Member of the House, who was then present, and heard the
words; which Sir William declaring to be true, the House of Commons required
Justice of the Lords against him, because he had Voted the Articles as a Member
of the House, whereupon Sir William wept.

Secondly, That he should say at the Castle of Dublin, that Ireland was a
Conquered Nation, and that the King might do with them what he pleased; and
speaking of the Charters of that City, averred that their Charters were nothing
worth, and did bind the King no further than he pleased.

The Earls Reply.
That if he had been over liberal of his Tongue for want of discretion, yet
could not his words amount to Treason, unless they had been revealed within
fourteen days, as he was informed. As to the Charge, he said, True it is, he
said Ireland was a Conquered Nation, which no man can deny; and that the King
is the Lawgiver in matters not determined by Acts of Parliament, be conceived
all Loyal Subjects would grant.

3. That R. Earl of Cork, having sued out a Process in Course of Law, for
Recovery of possessions out of which he was put by an order of the Earl of
Strafford, and the Council of Ireland, the said Earl threatened to Imprison him,
if he did not surcease his suit, saying, That he would have neither Law nor
Lawyers dispute or question any of his Orders. And when the said Earl of Cork
said, that an Act of King James his Council there about a Lease of his, was of
no force; the Earl of Strafford replied, That he would make the said Earl know,
and all Ireland too, so long as he had the Government there, that any Act of
State there should be obeyed, as well as an Act of Parliament.

The Earls Reply.
It were hard measure for a Man to loose his Honor, and his Life, for an hasty
word; or because he is no wiser than God has made him. As for the words, he
confessed them to be true, and thought he said no more then what became him,
considering how much his Majesty's honor was concerned in him; that if a
proportionable obedience was not as well due to Acts of State, as to Acts of
Parliament, in vain did Councils sit. And that he had done no more, than what
former Deputies had done, and than what was agreeable to his Instructions from
the Council Table, which he produced; and that if those words were Treason,
they should have been revealed within fourteen days.

4. That the said Earl of Strafford, 12 December. 1635. in time of peace,
sentenced the Lord Mount-Norris (a Peer, Vice-Treasurer, Receiver-General,
Principal Secretary of State, and Keeper of the Privy Signet in Ireland) and
another to death by a Council of War without Law, or offense, deserving such
punishment.

The Earls Reply.
That there was then a standing Army in Ireland, and Armies cannot be governed
but by Martial Law: That it has been put in constant practice with former
Deputies; That had the sentence been unjustly given by him, the Crime could
amount but to Felony at most, for which he hoped he might as well expect from
his Majesty, as the Lord Conway, and Sir Jacob Astley had, for doing the like
in the late Northern Army. That he neither gave sentence, nor procured it
against the Lord Mount-Norris, but only desired Justice against the Lord, for
some affront done to him as he was Lord Deputy of Ireland. That the said Lord
was judged by a Council of War, wherein he sat bare all the time, and gave no
suffrage against him; that also to evidence himself a party, he caused his
Brother Sir George Wentworth, in regard of the nearness of Blood, to decline
all acting in the Procejs. Lastly, Though the Lord Mount-Norris justly deserved
to die, yet he obtained his Pardon from the King.

5. That he had upon a Paper-Petition of R. Rolstone, without any legal Trial
disseized the Lord Mount-Norris of a Freehold, whereof he was two years in
quiet possession.

The Earls Reply.
That he conceived the Lord Mount-Norris was legally divested of his
Possessions, there being a suit long depending in Chancery, and the Plaintiff
complaining of delay, he upon the Complainants Petition, called unto him the
Master of the Rolls, Lord Chancellor, and Lord Chief Justice of the
Common Pleas; and upon ^ roofs in Chancery, De^reed for the Plaintiff, wherein
he said he did no more then what other Deputies had done before him.

6. That a Case of Tenures upon defective Titles, was by him put to the Judges
of Ireland, and upon their opinion, the Lord Dillon and others, were
dispossessed of their Inheritances.

The Earls Reply.
That the Lord Dillon, with others, producing his Patent, according to a
Proclamation in the behalf of his Majesty, the said Patent was questionable;
upon which a Case was drawn and argued by Council, and the Judges delivered
their Opinions: But the Lord Dillon, or any other, was not bound thereby, nor
put out of their Possessions, but might have Traverst their Office, or
otherwise have Legally proceeded, notwithstanding the said Opinion.

8. That he, October 1635. upon Thomas ^Hibbots Petition to the Council, voted
against the Lady Hibbots, though the major part of the Council were for her,
and threatened her with 500l. Fine, and Imprisonment, if she disobeyed the
Council-Order entered against her, the Land being conveyed to Sir Robert
Meredith, for his use.

The Earls Reply.
That true it is, he had voted against the Lady Hibbots, and thought he had
reason so to do, the said Lady being discovered by fraud and Circumvention, to
have bargained for Lands of a great value, for a small Sum. And he denied that
the said Lands were after sold to his use, viz. That the major part of the
Council Board voted for the Lady; the contrary appearing by the Sentence under
the hand of the Clerk of the Counc^l; which being true, he might well threaten
her with Commitment, in case she disobeyed the said Order. Lastly, Were it true
that he were Criminal therein, yet were the Offense but a Misdemeanor, no
Treason.

9. That he granted Warrants to the Bishop of Down and Connor, and other
Bishops, their Chancellors and several Officers, to Attach such mean people,
who after citation refused either to appear, or undergo, or perform such Orders
as were enjoined.

The Earls Reply.
That such Writs had been usually granted by former Deputies to Bishops in
Ireland, nevertheless, being not fully satisfied with the convenience thereof,
he was sparing in granting them, until being informed that diverse in the
Diocese of Down, were somewhat refractory; he granted Warrants to that Bishop,
and hearing of some disorders in the execution, he called them in again.

10. That he having Farmed the Customs of Imported and exported merchandise,
Inhanced the prices of the Native commodities of Ireland, and caused them to be
rated in the Book of Rates for the Customs; according to which, the Customs
were gathered five times more than they were worth.

The Earls Reply.
That his interest in the Customs of Ireland accrewed to him by the
Assignation of a Lease from the Duchess of Buckingham: That the Book of Rates,
by which the Customs were gathered, was the same which was established by the
Lord Deputy Faulkland, Anno. 1628. some years before he was employed thither:
That as he has been just and faithful to his Master the King by increasing his
Revenue, so has he also much bettered the Trade, and Shipping of that Kingdom.

11. That he prohibited the exportation of some Native Commodities, as
Pipe-staves, etc. and then required great sums of money for license to export
them, to the Inhansing of the prices of those Commodities half in half.

The Earls Reply.
That Pipe-staves were prohibited in King James his time, and not exported but
by License, paying six shillings eight pence a thousand; and that he had not
raised so much thereby to himself, as his Predecessors had done for such
Licenses.

12. That the said Earl to regulate the Trade of Tobacco, prohibited the
Importing of it without License. In the mean time taking up, and buying it at
his own rate to his own use, and forbidding others to sell any Tobacco by
wholesale, but what was made up in Rolls, and sealed at both ends by himself:
Besides other Monopolies of Starch, Iron, Pots, which they said, brought the
Earl in 100000l. sterling. besides, that though he inhanced the Customs in
general, yet he drew down the Imposts on Tobacco from 6d. to 3d. in the pound.

The Earls Reply.
That before his time, the King had but ten or twenty pounds per annum for that
Custom, which now yielded twenty thousand pounds. For the Proclamation, it was
not set out by his means principally, or for his private benefit, but by
consent of the whole Council. The prices of Tobacco not exceeding two shillings
in the pound. And this he conceives cannot be made Treason, were all the
Articles granted, but only a Monopoly; for which he was to be Fined.

13. That Flax being the Native Commodity of Ireland, and he having much of it
growing on his own ground, or at his command, ordered by Proclamation that none
should be vented upon pain of forfeiting it, but what was wrought into Yarn and
Thread; a way not used in Ireland, whereby he had the sole sale of that
Commodity.

The Earls Reply.
That he did endeavor to advance the Manufacture of Linen, rather then of
Woollen, because the last would be the greater detriment to England. That the
Primate of Ireland, the Archbishop of Dublin, Chancellor Loftus, and the Lord
Mount-Norris, all of the Council, and Subscribers of the Proclamation, were as
liable to the Charge as himself. That the reducing of that Nation, by Orders of
the Council Board, to the English Customs, from their more savage usages, as
drawing Horses by their Tails, etc. had been of former practice: That the
Project was of so ill avail to him, as he was the worse for the Manufacture
thirty thousand pounds at least, by the Loom he had set up at his own Charge.

12. That the said Earl did in a Warlike manner, by Soldiers execute his
severest Orders and Warrants in Ireland, dispossessing se veral persons by
force of Arms in a time of peace, of their houses and estates, raising taxes,
and quartering Soldiers upon those that disobeyed his Orders, so leavying War
against his Majesty's Liege people in that Realm, Testified Sergeant Savil.

The Earls Reply.
That nothing has been more ordinary in Ireland, than for the Governors to
put all manner of Sentences in execution by the help of Soldiers: that
Grandison, Faulkland, Chichester, and other Deputies frequently did it: (Sir
Arthur Teningham, to this point deposed, that in Faulklands time he knew twenty
Soldiers assessed upon one man, for re^using to pay sixteen shillings:) That
his instruction for executing his Commission was the same with those formerly
given to the Lord Faulkland, and that in both there is express warrant for it:
That no Testimony produced against him does evidently prove he gave any Warrant
to that effect; and that Sergeant Savil showed only a Copy of a Warrant, not
the Original it self, which he conceived could not make Faith in Case of life
and death in that High Court, especially it being not averred upon Oath to
agree with the Original, which should be upon Record: That he conceived he was
for an Irish Custom, to be Tried by the Peers of that Kingdom.

13. That he obtained an Order of his Majesty, That none should complain of any
Oppression or Injustice in Ireland, before the King or Council in England,
unless first the party made his address to him, using to all his Actions, his
Majesty's Authority and Name; yet to prevent any from coming over to Appeal to
his Majesty, or to complain, he by Proclamation, bearing date September. 17.
1636. Commanded all Nobility, Undertakers, and others, that held Offices in the
said Kingdom of Ireland, to make their residence there, not departing thence
without License, seconding that Proclamation with Fines, Imprisonments, etc.
upon such as disobeyed it, as on one Parry, etc. Testified by the Earl of
Desmond, the Lord Roch, Marcattee, and Parry.

The Earls Reply.
That the Deputy Faulkland had set out the same Proclamation; That the same
Restraint was contained in the Statute of 25. Henry 6. upon which the
Proclamation was founded; That he had the Kings express Warrant for the
Proclamation; That he had also power to do it by the Commission granted him,
and that the Lords of the Council and their Justices, not only yielded, but
pressed him unto it; That it was done upon just cause; for had the Ports been
open, diverse would have taken liberty to go to Spain, Doway, Rheimes, or St.
Omers, which might have proved of mischievous Consequence to the State: That
the Earl of Desmond stood, at the time of his restraint, Charged with Treason
before the Council of Ireland, for practicing against the Life of one Valentine
Coke. That the Lord Roch was then a Prisoner for Debt in the Castle of Dublin,
and therefore incapable of License. That Parry was not fined for not coming
without License, but for several contempts against the Council Board in
Ireland; and that in his Sentence he had but only a casting Voice, as the Lord
Keeper in the Star Chamber.

14. That having done such things as aforesaid, in his Majesty's Name, he
framed by his own Authority an unusual Oath, whereby among other things, people
were to Swear, That they would not protest against any of his Majesty's Royal
Commands, but submit themselves in all Obedience thereunto: An Oath which he
Imposed on several Scots in Ireland (designing it indeed against the Scottish
Covenant) on pain of great Fines, as H. Steward 5000 l. etc. Exile, and
Imprisonment, etc.

The Earls Reply.
That the Oath was not violently enjoined by him upon the Irish Scots, but
framed in Compliance with their own express Petition; which Petition is owned
in the Proclamation, as the main Impulsive to it. That the same Oath not long
after, was prescribed by the Council of England: That he had a Letter under his
Majesty's own hand, ordering it to be prescribed as a Touchstone of their
Fidelity. As to the greatness of the Fine imposed upon Steward, and others, he
conceived it was not more then the hainousness of their Offenses deserved; yet
had they Petitioned, and submitted the next day, it would wholly have been
remitted.

15. That he persuaded his Majesty to an offensive War against the Scots,
declaring that the Demands made by the Scots this Parliament, was a sufficient
Cause of a War, besides that on the 10th of October. 1640. he said, That the
Nation of Scots were Rebels, and Traitors; adding, that if it pleased his
Master to send him back again (as he was going to England) he would leave the
Scottish Nation neither Root nor Branch, excepting those that took the
aforesaid Oath.

The Earls Reply.
That he called all the Scottish Nation Traitors, and Rebels, no one Proof is
produced; and though he is hasty in speech, yet was he never so defective of
his reason, as to speak so like a mad Man; for he knew well his Majesty was a
Native of that Kingdom, and was confident many of that Nation were of as
Heriock Spirits, and as Faithful and Loyal Subjects as any the King had. As to
the other words of his rooting out the Scots Root and Branch, he conceives a
short Reply may serve, they being proved by a single Testimony only, which can
make no sufficient faith in case of life: Again, the witness was very much
mistaken, if not worse; for he deposes that these words were spoken the tenth
day of October in Ireland, whereas he was able to evidence, he was at that time
in England, and had been so near a month before.

18. That when the Parliament 13 April, 1640. entered upon the Grievances in
Church and State; the Earl (to whom with the Arch Bishop of Canterbury, the
King referred the business of that Parliament) advised his Majesty to press the
Commons to supply his Majesty's occasions against the Scots, before they
Redressed any Grievances. And when they were in debate about the Supplies,
persuaded his Majesty to dissolve them, by telling him they had denied to
supply him: Adding, after the dissolution of that Parliament, that the King
having tried the Affections of his people, he was loosed, and absolved from all
Rules of Government, and was to do every thing that Power would admit: and that
since his Majesty had tried all ways, and was refused, he should be Acquitted
both by God and Man; and that he had an Army in Ireland, which he might employ,
to reduce this Kingdom to obedience.

The Earls Reply.
That he was not the Principal Cause of Dissolving the last Parliament; for
before he came to the Council Table, it was Voted by the Lords, to Demand
twelve Subsidies, and that Henry Vane was Ordered to Demand no less. But he
coming in the interim, he persuades the Lords to Vote it again, Declaring to
his Majesty (then present) and them, the danger of the Breach of Parliament:
Whereupon it was Voted, that if the Parliament would not grant twelve
Subsidies, Sir Henry Vane would descend to eight, and rather than fail, to six.
But Sir Henry not observing his Instructions, demanded twelve only without
abatement or going lower: That the height of this Demand, urged the Parliament
to deny, and their denial moved his Majesty to Dissolve the Parliament; so that
the chief occasion of the Breach thereof, `was, as he conceived, Sir Henry
Vane. He confesses, that at the Council Table, he Advised the King to an
Offensive War against the Scots; but it was not, until all fair means to
prevent a War had been first attempted. Again, others were as much for a
Defensive War, and it might be as free to Vote one as the other. Lastly, Votes
at a Council Board are but bare Opinions, and Opinions, if pertinaciously
maintained, may make an Heretic, but cannot a Traitor. And to Sir Henry Vanes
Deposition, he said, it was only a single testimony, and contradicted by four
Lords of the Iunto-tables depositions, viz. The Earl of Northumberland, the
Marquess of Hamilton, the Bishop of London, and the Lord Cottington; who all
affirmed, that there was no question made of this Kingdom, which was then in
obedience, but of Scotland that was in Rebellion. And Sir Henry Vane, being
twice Examined upon Oath, could not remember whether he said this or that
Kingdom, and the Notes after offered for more proof, were but the same thing,
and added nothing to the Evidence, to make it a double Testimony, or to make a
Privy-councellors Opinion, in a Debate at Council, High Treason.

19. That after the Dissolution of the Parliament April 5. 1640. The said Earl
Advised the King to go on vigorously to Levy Shipmoney, and other Illegal
Payments, suing in Star Chamber, and Imprisoning several that neglected, either
to gather or pay those Levies: Particularly the Londoners, who for not
Collecting the Shipmoney, so vigorously as they should have done, and refusing
to give in the names of such Citizens as were able to Lend Money^ upon the Loan
of an 100000l. demanded of them, were threatened by him at the Council Table.

That they deserved to be put to Fine and Ransom; and that no good would be
done with them, till an Example were made of them, till they were laid by the
Heels, and some of the Aldermen Hanged up.

The Earls Reply.
That there was a present necessity for Money, that all the Council Board had
Voted with, yea, before him. That there was then a Sentence in Star Chamber,
upon the Opinion of all the Judges, for the Legality of the Tax of Ship Money,
and he thought he might advice the King to take what the Judges had declared
was by Law his own. He consessed, that upon the Refusal of so just a Service,
the better to quicken the Citizen^ to the Payment of Ship Money, he said, They
deserved to be Fined; Which words, perhaps, might be circumspectly delivered,
but (conceives) cannot be a motive to Treason, especially, when no ill
consequence followed upon them: And it would render Men in a sad condition, if
for every hasty Word, or Opinion given in Council, they should be Sentenced as
Traitors. But that he said, It were well for the Kings Service, if some of the
Aldermen were hanged up, he utterly denies. Nor is it proved by any, but
Alderman Garway, who is at best but a single Testimony, and therefore no
sufficient Evidence in Case of Life.

20. That he had Advised the King to seize upon the Bullion in the Mint, and
when the Merchants, whose Bullion was seized on to the value of 50000l. waited
upon him at his house, to represent to him the consequence of discrediting the
Mint, and hindering the Importance of Bullion. Answered them, that it was the
course of other Princes in those exigencies, to which the undutifulness of
London [kinder to the Rebels than to his Majesty] had reduced the King: And
that he had directed the Imfusing of money with Brass. Alleging to the
Officers of the Mint, when they represented to him the Inconvenience of that
Project, that the French King had an Army of horse to Levy his Taxes, and
search men's Estates; and telling my Lord Cottington that stood by, that that
was a point worth his consideration.

The Earls Reply.
That he expected some proof to evidence the two first particulars, but he
hears of none. For the following words he confessed, probably, they might
escape the Door of his Lips, nor did he think it much amiss, considering the
present posture, to call that Faction, Rebels. As for the last words objected
against him in that Article, he said, that being in conference with some of the
Londoners, there came to his hands at that present, a Letter from the Earl of
Lichester, then in Paris, wherein were the Gazettes enclosed, relating that the
Cardinal had given order to ^evy Money by Soldiers. This he only told the
Lord Cottington standing by, but he made not the least Application thereof to
the English affairs.

21. That being Lieutenant General of the Northern Forces against the Scots,
1639. he Imposed 6d. per diem, on the Inhabitants of Yorkshire, for the
maintenance of Trained Bands by his own Authority, threatening them that refused
with imprisonment, and other penalties, little below those inflicted for
High Treason.

The Earls Reply.
That his Majesty coming to York, it was thought necessary, in regard the Enemy
was upon the Borders, to keep the Trained-bands on foot, for the defense of the
Country; and therefore the King directed him to Write to the Freeholders in
Yorkshire, to declare, what they would do for their own defense; that they
freely offered a months pay, nor did any man grudge against it. Again, it was
twice propounded to the great Council of Pe^rs at York, that the King approved
it as a just and necessary act, and none of the Council contradicted it, which
he conceived seemed a tacit allowance of it. That though his Majesty had not
given him special Order therein, nor the Gentry had desired it; yet, he
conceived, he had power enough to Impose that Tax, by Virtue of his Commission.
But he never said, that the Refusers should he guilty of little less than
High-^reason; which being proved by Sir William Ingram, he was but a single
Testimony, and one who had formerly mistaken himself in what he had deposed.

22. That he being Lieutenant General against the Scots, suffered New Castle to
be Lost to them, with design to incense the English against the Scots: And that
he ordered my Lord Conway to Fight them upon disadvantage, [the said Lord
having satisfied him, that his Forces were not equal to the Scots] out of a
malicious desire to Engage the two Kingdoms in a National and Bloody War.

The Earls Reply.
That he admired how in the third Article, he being charged as an Incendiary
against the Scots, is now in this Article made their Confederate, by Betraying
New Castle into their hands. But to answer more particularly, he said, That
there were at New Castle the 24. of August, ten or twelve thousand Foot, and
two thousand Horse, under the Command of the Lord Conway, and Sir Jacob Ashley,
and that Sir Jacob had writ to him concerning the Town of New Castle, that it
was Fortified, which also was under his particular Care; and for the passage
over the River of Tine, His Majesty sent special direction to the Lord Conway
to secure it; and therefore that Lord is more (as he conceives) responsible for
that miscarriage, than himself.

These replies were so satisfactory in themselves, and so nobly managed by him,
that they exceeded the expectation of the Earls Friends, and defeated that of
his Enemies: Insomuch, that finding both the number and the weight of their
former Articles ineffectual (their multitude being not, as they designed, able
to hide their weakness) they would needs force him the next day
(notwithstanding a ^it of the Stone, that made it as much as his life was worth
to stir abroad, which though testified by the Leiutenant of the Tower, they
measuring the Earls great spirit, that scorned to owe his brave Life to
ignoble Acts, by their own mean one, believed not; and when convinced, aiming
at his ruin, rather than trial, regarded not) to answer others, I mean, those
obscure Notes that Sir Henry Vane (whose covetousness having as great a mind to
a part of the Earls Estate, as others ambition had to the snips of his Power,
betrayed his trust and honor to satisfy his malice) took under his Hat at
Council Board [May 5. 1040. the day the last Parliament was Dissolved]
treacherously, laid up in his Closet maliciously, and by his own Son Harry (who
must be pretended, forsooth, as false to the Father, as ever the Father had
been to his Master; and when sent to one Closet, finding a little Key there, to
have ransacked another, where these Notes lay) conveyed to Master Pym slyly; by
Master Pym and the Commons [who would needs have a conference with the Lords
that very afternoon] urged so vehemently, that the Lords, who thought it
reasonable, that the Earls Evidence might be heard, as well as his
Adversaries, were bassled to a compliance with the Commons in this Vote, that
the Earl should appear, April 13th. as he did. And when these Notes were Read,
viz.

No danger of a War with Scotland, if Offensive, not Defensive. Sir Harry
V^n^'s Notes against the Earl of Strafford, that ruined him.


K. C. H. How can we undertake an Offensive War, if we have no money?

L. L. Ir. Borrow of the City an hundred thousand pounds, go on vigorously to
Levy Ship Money, your Majesty having tried the affections of your People, you
are absolved, and loose from all Rules of Government, and to do what Power will
admit. Your Majesty has tried all ways, and being refused, shall be Acquitted
before God and Man. And you have an Army in Ireland, that you may Employ to
reduce this Kingdom to obedience; for, I am confident, the Scots cannot hold
out five months:

The Town is full of Lords, put the Commission of Array on foot; and if any of
them stir, we will make them smart.

Answered thus calmly and clearly (his nature being not overcome, nor his
temper altered, The Earls full and notable Answer to those Notes^
by the arts of his Adversaries.)

That being a Privy Counselor, he conceived he might have the freedom to Vote
with others his opinion; being as the exigent required. It would be hard
measure, for Opinions, Resulting from such Debates, to be prosecuted under the
notion of Treason. And for the main Hint suggested from these words. -- The
King had an Army in Ireland, which he might Employ here to reduce this Kingdom;
he Answers,

That it is proved by the single Testimony of one man [Secretary Van^] not
being of validity in Law to create faith in a Case of Debt, much less in Life
and Death. That the Secretaries Deposition was very dubious: For upon two
Examinations, he could not Remember any such words. And the third time his
Testimony was various; but that I should speak such words, and the like. And
words may be very like in Sound, and differ in Sense; as in the words of my
charge here for there; and that for this, puts an end to the Controversy.

There were present at this Debate, but eight Privy Counselors in all; two are
not to be produced, the Archbishop, and Windebanke. Sir Henry Vane affirms
the words. I deny them: then there remain four for further Evidence, viz. The
Marquess Hamilton, the Earl of Northumberland, the Lord Treasurer, and the Lord
Cottington, who have all declared upon their honor, that they never heard me
speak those words, nay, nor the like. Lastly suppose [though I granted it not]
that I spoke those words, yet cannot the word this rationally imply England,
because the Debate was concerning Scotland, as is yielded on all hands, because
England was not out of the way of obedience, as the Earl of Clare observed
well; and, because there was never the least intention of Landing the Irish
Army in England, as the foresaid Lords of the Privy Council are able to attest.

Concluding his defense with a sinewy summary, and a close recapitulation of
what he had said, and a gallant Speech to this purpose:

My Lords,
THere yet remains another Treason, that I should be guilty of; The
endeavoring to subvert the Fundamental Laws of the Land: That they should now
be Treason together, that is not Treason in any one part of Treason
Accumulative, that so, when all will not do, it is woven up with others, it
should seem very strange.

Under favor, my Lords, I do not conceive that there is either Statute Law, or
Common Law, that does declare the endeavoring to subvert the Fundamental Laws
to be High Treason.

For neither Statute Law, nor Common Law written, that ever I could hear off,
declares it so.

And yet I have been diligent to enquire (as, I believe, you think it does
concern me to do.)

It is hard to be questioned for Life and Honor, upon a Law that cannot be
shown.

There is a Rule I have learned from Sir Edward Cook, De non apparentibus, and
non existentibus eadem ratio: (Jesus) Where has this fire lain all this while,
so many hundreds of years, without any smoke to discover it, till it thus burnt
out to consume me, and my Children; extreme hard, in my opinion, that
punishment should proceed promulgation of Laws, punishment by a Law, subsequent
to the acts done.

Take it into your consideration: For certainly it is now better to be under no
Law at all, but the will of men; than to conform our selves under the
protection of a Law as we think, and then be punished for a Crime that does
proceed the Law: What man can be safe, if that be once admitted?

My Lords, It is hard in another respect, that there should be no Token set
upon this Offense, by which we should know it; no Admonition, by which we
should be aware of it.

If a man pass down the Thames in a Boat, and it be Split upon an Anchor, and
no Buoy be set, as a token, that there is an Anchor there; that party that owes
the Anchor, by the Maritine Laws, shall give satisfaction for the damage done;
but if it were mark^ out, I must come upon my own peril.

Now where is a mark upon this crime, where is the token this is High Treason?

If it be under water, and not above water, no humane providence can avail, nor
prevent my destruction.

Lay aside all humane wisdom, and let us rest upon Divine Revelation, if you
will condemn me before you forewarn the danger.

Oh, my Lords! May your Lordships be pleased to give regard unto the presage of
England, as never to suffer our selves to be put on those nice points, upon
such contractive interpretations; and these are where Laws are not clear or
known. If there must be trials of Wits, I do humbly beseech you, the subject
and matter may be somewhat else, than the lives and honors of Peers.

My Lords, We find that the Primitive times, in the progression of the plain
Doctrine of the Apostles, they brought the Books of Curious Arts, and burned
them. And so likewise, as I conceive, it will be wisdom and providence in your
Lordships, for your posterity and the whole Kingdoms, to cast from you into
the fire, those bloody and most misterious Volumes of constructive and
arbitrary Treasons; and to betake your selves to the plain letters of the Law
and Statute, that tells us where the crime is, and by telling what is, and
what is not, shows us how to avoid it. And let us not be ambitious, to be more
wise and learned in the killing arts, than our forefathers were.

It is now full two hundred and forty years, since ever any man was touched for
this alleged crime (to this height) before my self; we have lived happily to
our selves at home, and we have lived gloriously to the world abroad.

Let us rest contented with that our fathers have left us, and not awaken th^se
sleepy Lions to our own destructions; by taking up a few musty Records, that
have lain so many Ages by the Walls, quite forgotten and neglected.

May your Lordships be nobly pleased, to add this to those other misfortunes
befallen me for my Sins, not for my Treasons, that a President should be
derived from me of that disadvantage (as this will be in the consequent to the
whole Kingdom.) I beseech you seriously to consider it, and let not my
particular cause be looked upon as you do, though you wound me in my interest
in the Commonwealth; and therefore those Gentlemen say, that they speak for the
Commonwealth, yet, in this particular, I indeed speak for it, and the
inconveniences and mischiefs that will heavily fall upon us. For as it is in
the first of King Henry the fourth, no man will after know what to do, or say
for fear.

Do not put, My Lords, so great difficulties upon the Ministers of State, that
men of wisdom, honor and virtue, may not with cheerfulness and safety be
employed for the public. If you weigh and measure them by Grains and Scruples,
the public affairs of the Kingdom will be laid waste, and no man will meddle
with them, that has honors, issues, or any fortunes to loose.

MY Lords, I have now troubled you longer than I should have done, were it not
for the interest of those dear pledges a Saint in Heaven left me; I should be
loath, my Lords, (there he stopped.)

What I forfeit for my self, it is nothing, but that my Indiscretion should
forfeit for my Child, it even wounds me to the very soul.

You will pardon my infirmity: something I should have said, but I am not able
(and sighed) therefore, let it pass.

And now, my Lords, I have been, by the blessing of Almighty God, taught, that
the aff^iction of this life present, are not to be compared to the eternal
weight of that glory that shall be revealed to us hereafter.

And so, my Lords, even so, with tranquillity of mind, I do submit my self
freely and clearly to your Lordships judgments; and whether that righteous
Judgment shall be to life or death.

Te Deum Laudamus.
A defense every way so complete; The Earls gallant come off.
That he, whom English, Scots, and Irish combined against in their Testimonies,
[such English as cavied his virtues and power, such Scots as feared his wisdom
and council, such Irish as could not endure the strictness and civility of his
government. In fine, such whose frauds and force were met with by his prudence
and prowess] He whom three Kingdoms agreed against in their Faction, (indeed,
so excellent a Personage was not to be ruined, but by the pretended hatred of
the whole Empire.) He, whom the Mercenary Lawyers and Orators represented so
monstrously, appeared so innocent, that some of his very Enemies said [in much
anger, you may be sure] that their Charge of Misdemeanors, proved no other than
a Libel of Slanders; and the disingaged and honest part of the Nation (with as
much pleasure, to find so great faults) reflected on the unhappiness of great
Ministers, See Dr. P. life K. Chapter I. p. 23.
whose parts and trust must be their crimes, whose happy councils are envied,
and unsuccesseful, though prudent ones, severely accused: When they err, every
one condemns them; and their wise advices few praise: For those that are
benefited, envy; and such as are disappointed, hate those that gave them.

and run down by Master Lane, the Princes Atturneys Argument (for with much
ado) they allowed him Master Lane, Recorder Gardener, Master Lo, and Master
Lightfoot for Council, though in point of Law [in such matters, as they would
allow them to plead in] viz. That these words in the Statute of 25. Edw. 3.
Because particular Treasons could not be then defined, therefore, what the
Parliament shall declare to be Treason, in time to come should be punished as
Treason. -- being the words of a declarative and penal Statute, ought to be
understood literally; and that this Salvo was Repealed 6. Hen. 4. when it was
Enacted, that nothing shall be esteemed Treason, but what is literally
contained in the Statute 25. Edw. 3. drew up the Bill of Attainder (a Law after
the Fact, with a shameful Caution, that the unparalled thing should not be
drawn into a Precedent, so securing themselves, who really designed that
alteration of Government they falsely charged him with, from the return of the
same Injustice on themselves, The Bishops that were sent for were Dr. Usher A.

Poller Bishop of Carlisle, Dr. Williams Bishop of Lincoln, who told the King
that he need not scruple showing mercy.
which they Acted on him.) A Bill that they Passed in two days [so eager were
they of blood, and so fearful of delays and sober consideration]
notwithstanding the generous dissent of a fifth part of the Commons (men of
honest hopes, who disdained to administer to the lusts of the Faction, in the
blood of so much innocent Gallantry, though with the hazard of their lives,
being Posted and Marked out to the fury of the Rabble.

And by the Midwifery of a Tumult of 5 or 6000. people, instigated and directed
by unquiet Members of the House of Commons, that were seen amongst them, to the
great dishonor of their persons and places, forced upon as many of the Peers
as would or durst Sit, and that was scarce a third part, in whose thin house,
after the King had so frankly declared three things, May. 1. in the Earls
behalf, before both House, viz. 1. That he was never advised to bring the Irish
Army into England. 2. That no man ever durst create in him the least jealousy
of his English Subjects Loyalty. 3. That no man ever dared to move him to alter
the least, much less all the Laws of England. It scarcely Passed after so many
hideous Riots raised by the Pulpit Demagogues, Sunday May 2. by seven Voices.
-- And when brought to his Majesty (who had earnestly entreated them, by all
the Frank Concessions he had made to them, that Parliament not to press him in
so tender a point) and though the Tumults without, and the Solicitations
within (several Courtiers looking on the Earl, as the Herd does on an hurt
Deer, hoping his blood would be the lustration of the Court) ran high; the
Gracious King (being loath to leave so faithful and brave a man a Sacrifice to
popular rage) there stuck, until 1. The Judges (upon whose judgment the
Bishops, when sent for, advised his Majesty to rely in matter of Law, they
being sworn to declare the Law equally between the King and his People)
pronounced him guilty of Treason in the general, though they confessed he was
not so in any particulars [the point his Majesty pressed much upon them.] 2.
The Parliament, City and Country importuned him, his very followers tyring him
with that Maxim [the weakness whereof^ many of them lived to see and suffer.]
Some talk of a Paper-promise the King gave him, Some cunning persons suggest be
sent to the King, scorning to owe his life after so much service to a bare
promise.
wherein was write upon, Better one man perish, though unjustly, than the
people be displeased or destroyed. And the Parliament wearying him with that
clamor, rather than reason, that their Vote, though against his Judgment,
should satisfy his Conscience. 3. The Earl offered himself a Victime, like
Hurtius, for the Kingdoms Peace, and the Kings Safety, in this Letter to his
Majesty.

The Earl of Strafford's Letter to the King.
May it please your Majesty,
IT has been my greatest grief in all these troubles, The Earl of Straffords
remarkable Letter to the King.
to be taken as a person, who should endeavor to represent, and set things
amiss, between your Majesty and your People, and to give council, tending to
the disquiet of the three Kingdoms.

Most true it is, that mine own private condition considered, it had been a
great madness, since through your gracious favor, I was so provided, as not
to expect in any kind to mend my fortune, or please my mind more; than by
resting where your bounteous hand had placed me. Nay, it is most mightily
mistaken, for unto your Majesty is well known, my poor and humble advises
concluded still in this, that your Majesty, and your people could never be
happy, till there were a Right Understanding betwixt you and them; no other
means to effect, and settle this happiness, but by the counsel and assent of
the Parliament; or to prevent the growing evils upon this State, but by
entirely putting your self, in your last resort, upon the Loyalty and good
Affection of your English Subjects.

Yet, such is my misfortune, this truth finds little credit; the contrary
seems generally believed, and my self reputed, as something of separation,
between you and your people, under a heavier censure, than which, I am
persuaded, no Gentleman can suffer. Now, I understand, the minds of men are
more incensed against me, notwithstanding your Majesty has declared, that in
your Princely Opinion, I am not guilty of Treason, nor are you satisfied in
your Conscience to Pass the Bill.

This brings me into a very great straight, there is before me the ruin of my
Children and Family, hitherto untouched in all the branches of it, with any
foul Crimes. Here is before me the many Ills, which may befall your Sacred
Person, and the whole Kingdom, should your self, and the Parliament part less
satisfied one with another, than is necessary for the preservation of King, and
People. Here are before me the things most valued, most feared by mortal man,
Life or Death.

To say, Sir, that there has been no strife in me, were to make me less than
God knows I am, and mine infirmities give me.

And to call a destruction upon my self and young Children (where the
intentions of my heart have been innocent, at least, of this great offense) may
be believed will find no easy content to flesh and blood.

But with much sadness I am come to a resolution of that which I think best
becomes me, to look upon that which is most principal in its self, which
doubtless is the prosperity of your Sacred Person, and the Commonwealth,
infinitely beyond any private man's interest.

And therefore in few words, as I put my self wholly upon the honor and justice
of my Peers so clearly, as to beseech your Majesty might be pleased to have
spared that Declaration of yours on Saturday last, and entirely to have left me
to their Lordships: So now to set your Conscience at liberty, I do most humbly
beseech you, for the preventing of such mischief as may happen by your refusal
to Pass the Bill, by this means remove, I cannot say [praised be God] this
Accursed, but I confess, this Unfortunate thing out of the way, toward that
blessed Agreement, which God, I trust, will establish for ever between you and
your Subjects.

Sir, my Consent herein, shall more acquit you to God, than all the world can
do besides. To a willing man, there is no injury done. And as by God's grace, I
forgive all the world with all cheerfulness imaginable, in the just
acknowledgement of your exceeding Favors. And only Beg that in your
goodness, you would be pleased to cast your Gracious regard upon my poor Son,
and his Sisters, less or more, and no otherwise than their unfortunate Father,
shall appear more or less guilty of his death. God long preserve your Majesty.

for endeavoring to subvert the Ancient and Fundamental Laws and Government of

Arbitrary Government, against Law, into those Kingdoms; and for exercising a
Tyrannous, and Exorbitant Power, over and against the Laws of the said
Kingdoms, over the Liberties, Estates, and Lives of his Majesty's Subjects; and
likewise, for having, by his own Authority, commanded the Laying and Assessing
of Soldiers, upon his Majesty's Subjects in Ireland, against their Consent, to
Compel them to obey his unlawful Commands and Orders, made upon
Paper-Petitions, in Causes between Party and Party; which accordingly was
executed upon diverse of his Majesty's Subjects in a warlike manner, within the
said Realm of Ireland; and in so doing, did Levy War against the Kings Majesty,
and his Liege People in that Kingdom. And also, for that he, after the unhappy
Dissolution of the last Parliament, did slander the House of Commons to his
Majesty; and did Counsel and Advise his Majesty, That he was loose, and
absolved from Rules of Government, and that he had an Army in Ireland, etc. For

Rights, Titles, Interests, they did enjoy the first day of this Parliament. Any
thing herein Contained to the contrary notwithstanding. Provided, That the
Passing of this present Act, determine not this Session of Parliament, etc.

A Bill, 1. So false in the matter of it, grounded on the Evidence of Papists,
[sworn enemies to the English Name and State] that wanted only the death of
this great Instrument of Government, to commit those mischiefs they accused him
of, the Faction Carressing those very Rebels, to assist them in shedding my
Lord of Strafford's blood, that afterward imbrued their hands in the blood of
so many innocent Protestants in Ireland. 2. So shameful in the manner of it,
that as the Devil upbraids unhappy souls, with those very crimes they tempted
and betrayed them to; so those very men, made use of it, to pollute the King's
honor, that had even forced him to it; though the heaviest Censure was
himself, Who never left bewailing his Compliance, or Connivance with this
Murder, till the issue of his blood dried up those of his tears. A Bill, which
might well accompany the other Bill, about the Parliaments Sitting during
pleasure; this passing away the King's Honor, and the other, his Prerogative.

Neither was the Bill sooner Passed, than his Execution was Ordered. The King's
intercession, in a Letter sent by his own Son the Prince, for so much
intermixture of mercy, with the public Justice, as to permit the Earl, either
to live out his sad life in a close Imprisonment; or, at least, that his soul,
that found so much Injustice on earth, might have a Week, to prepare it is self

Persons. He was brought, with a strong and solemn Guard, to the Scaffold on
Tower Hill. (In his passage thither, he had a sight of the Archbishop of
Canterbury, whose prayers and blessings, he, with low obeisance, begged, and
the pious Prelate bestowed them with tears) having a little ( Weeping bitterly
before the King, when the Bill of Attainder Passed) before by Sir Dudley
Carleton been informed, what the Parliament demanded of the King, and what the
King had granted the Parliament. Information, that amazed him indeed at first,
but at last, made him infinitely willing to leave this sad world; and there
managed the last Scene of his life, with the same gallantry, that he had done
all the rest; looking death in the face, with the same presence of spirit, that
he had done his enemies. Being accompanied, besides his own Relations and
Servants, by the Primate of Armagh, who (however misrepresented in this
matter) was much afflicted, all along, for this incomparable person's hard
measure; who, among other his virtues, owned so singular a love, to this
Reverend and Learned Person, that taking his leave of Ireland, the last time he
was there, he begged his blessing on his Knees, and the last minute he was in
the world, desired him to accompany him with his Prayers: Addressing his last
Speech to him, Thus: My Lord Primate of Ireland,
IT is my very great comfort, The Earl of Strafford's Speech on the Scaffold.
I have your Lordship by me this day, in regard I have been known these many
years, and I do thank God, and your Lordship for it, that you are here; I
should be very glad to obtain so much silence, as to be heard a few words; but,
I doubt, I shall not, the noise is so great.

My Lords, I am come hither, by the good will and pleasure of Almighty God, to
pay that last debt I owe to sin, which is death; and by the blessing of that
God, to rise again, through the merits of Jesus Christ, to righteousness and
life eternal. [ Here he was a little interrupted.]

My Lords, I am come hither, to submit to that judgment which has Passed
against me; I do it with a very quiet and contented mind. I thank God, I do
freely forgive all the world, a forgiveness that is not spoken from the teeth
outward (as they say) but from the very heart: I speak in the presence of
Almighty God, before whom I stand, that there is not a displeasing thought
arising in me toward any man living. I thank God, I can say it, and truly
too, my Conscience bearing me witness, that in all my employment, since I had
the honor to serve his Majesty, I never had any thing, in the purpose of my
heart, but what tended to the joint and individual prosperity of King and
People; although it has been my ill fortune to be misconstrued.

I am not the first that has suffered in this kind: It is the common portion
of us all, while we are in this life, to err; we are very subject to be
mis-judged one of another. There is one thing I desire to free my self of, and
I am very confident (speaking it now with so much cheerfulness) that I shall
obtain your Christian charity in the belief of it. I was so far from being
against Parliaments, that I did always think the Parliaments of England, were
the most happy Constitutions, that any Kingdom or Nation lived under, and the
best means under God to make the King and People happy.

For my Death here, I acquit all the world, and beseech the God of heaven
heartily to forgive them that contrived it; though in the intentions and
purposes of my heart, I am not guilty of what I dye for: And my Lord Primate,
it is a great comfort to me, that his Majesty conceives me not meriting so
severe and heavy a punishment, as is the utmost Execution of this Sentence, I
do infinitely rejoice in this mercy of his, and I beseech God to return it into
his own bosom, that he may find mercy, when he stands in most need of it.

I wish this Kingdom all the prosperity and happiness in the world; I did it
living, and now dying it is my wish: I do most humbly recommend this to every
one who hears me, and desire they would lay their hands upon their hearts, and
consider seriously, whether the beginning of the Happiness and Reformation of a
Kingdom, should be written in Letters of Blood. Consider this when you are at
your houses, and let me never be so unhappy, as that the last of my blood,
should rise up in judgment against any one of you: But, I fear, you are in a
wrong way.

My Lords, I have but one word more, and with that I shall end. I profess, that
I dye, a true and obedient Son to the Church of England, wherein I was born,
and in which I was bred. Peace and prosperity be ever to it.

It has been objected (if it were an objection worth the answering) that I
have been inclined to Popery; but, I say, truly from my heart, that from the
time I was one and twenty years of age, to this present, going now upon forty
nine, I never had in my heart to doubt of this Religion of the Church of
England; nor ever had any man the boldness to suggest any such thing to me, to
the best of my remembrance. And so being reconciled by the merits of Jesus
Christ my Savior, into whose bosom, I hope, I shall shortly be gathered, to
those eternal happinesses which shall never have an end: I desire heartily the
forgiveness of every man, for any rash or unadvised words, or any thing done
amiss. And so my Lords and Gentlemen, farewell, farewell all the things of this
world.

I desire that you would be silent, and join with me in prayer, and I trust in
God, we shall all meet and live eternally in heaven, there to receive the
accomplishment of all happiness, where every tear shall be wiped away from our
eyes, and every sad thought from our hearts. And so God bless this Kingdom, and
Jesus have mercy upon my soul.



AN EPITAPH ON THE Earl of Strafford.
HEre lies wise and valiant Dust,
Huddled up 'twixt Fit and Just;
Strafford, who was hurried hence,
'Twixt Treason and Convenience:
He spent his time here in a mist,
A Papist, yet a Calvinist,
His Prince's nearest Joy and Grief,
He had, yet wanted all Relief:
The Prop and Ruin of the State,
The peoples violent Love and Hate.
One in extremes loved and abhorred,
Riddles lie here; and in a word,
Here lies Blood, and let it lie
Speechless still, and never cry.
Exu^ge cinis, tuumque, ^^us qui potis es, scribe Epitaphium,
Nequit Wentworthi non esse facundus, vel cinis.
Effare Marmor: and quem caepisti Comprehendere,
Macte and Exprimere.
Candidius meretur urna, quam quod rubris
Notatum est litteris, Elogium.
Atlas Regiminis Monarchichi hie jacet ^assus:
Secunda Orbis Britannici Intelligentia:
Rex Politiae, and Prorex Hiberniae;
Straffordii and virtutum Comes:
Men's Iovis, Mercurii ingenium and lingua Apollinis:
Cui Anglia Hiberniam debuit, seipsum Hibernia:
Sydus Aquilonicum; quo sub rubicunda vespera accidente,
Nox simul and dies visa est: dextroque oculo flevit,
Laevoque laetata est Anglia.
Theatrum Honoris, itemque scena calamitosa virtutis
Actoribus, morbo, morte, and invidia
Quae ternis animosa Regnis, non vicit tamen,
Sed oppressis.
Sic inclinavit Heroes (non minus) Caput
Belluae (vel sic) multorum Capitum.
Merces furoris Scotici praeter pecunias,
Erubuit ut tetigit securis.
Similem quippe nunquam degustavit sanguinem
Monstrum narro, fuit tam infensus legibus,
Ut prius legem quam nata foret, violavit.
Hunc tamen non sustulit Lex,
Verum necessitas, non habet Legem,
Abi viator, caetera memorabunt posteri.
THE Life and Death OF Sr. JOHN FINCH, Baron Foreditch, sometimes Lord Keeper
of the Great Seal of ENGLAND.
THE fall of the last great Man, so terrified the other Officers of State, that
the Lord High-treasurer resigned his Staff to the hands from whence he had it:
The Lord Cottington forsook the Master-ship of the Court of Wards; and the The
Right Honorable, the then Earl, now the Duke of Newcastle.
Guardian of the Prince returned him to the King. These Lords parting with their
Offices, like those that scatter their Jewels and Treasures in the way that
they might delude the violence of their greedy pursuers; a course, that if
speedily embraced, had not only saved them, but the Earl's too, so willing was
the Earl of B. to have been Lord Treasurer, Master Pym Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Earl of Essex Governor to the Prince, Master Hampden Tutor, my Lord
Say Master of the Wards, Master H. Principal Secretary, Earl of L. Deputy of
Ireland, and the Earl of W. Admiral, that the Historian writes, their Baffle
and disappointment in these expectations, rendered them Implacable to the Earl,
and Irreconcilable to any methods of peace and composure, Declaration Aug. 10.
and the King's Majesty Declares it. -- What overtures have been made by them,
(they are the words of the Declaration) with what importunities for Offices and
Preferments? what great Services should have been done for him? and what other
undertakings even to have saved the life of the Earl of Strafford! [so Cheap a
Rate it seems might have saved that excellent Personage.]

Others quitted their Country, finding the Faction as greedy of blood as of
preferment, and loath to trust themselves in that place, where reason was
guided by force, where Votes staid not the ripening, and season of Counsel in
the order, gravity and deliberateness, befitting a Parliament, but were
violently ripped up by barbarous cruelty, and forcibly cut out abortive by
Popular Riot and Impatience: Esteeming it a hardness beyond true valor, for a
wise man to set himself against the breaking in of the Sea, and which is as
dreadful, the madness of the people; which to resist at present, threatens
imminent danger, but to withdraw, gives it space to spread its fury, and gains
a fitter time to repair the breach. Of which honorable number, Sir John Finch
was one.

A Person born for Law and Courtship, being a Branch of that Family, which the
Spanish Ambassador, in a discourse with King James, styled the Gentile and
Obliging House; Their Ancient Surname is Herbert.
a Family that was enrolled Gentile, by the Commissioners appointed to that
purpose by King Henry the 6th. and which my Lord Bacon called the Lawer's Race.
At the same time, Sir Heneage Finch Recorder of London, Sir Henry Finch
Sergeant at Law to King James, and his Son Sir John Finch Attorney General to
Queen Mary, and Speaker to that curious, knowing, and rich Parliament; wherein
some have observed, though wide I suppose, that the House of Commons modestly
estimated [consisting of about 500.] could buy the House of Peers consisting of
118.) thrice over. Noremberge in Germany, and Florence in Italy, would not
admit any Learned Men into their Counsels; Because Learned Men (says the
Historian of those places) are perplexed to resolve upon Affairs, making many
doubts full of respects and imaginations. Semblably, this Parliament was too
rich and curious to do any good.

Sir John Finch was born September 6. 1582. about one a clock the same night
Plowden died [the setting of great Lights in one place, is their rising in
another] an observation as carefully Registered by his Father, as that is
superstitiously kept by the Catholics. That the same day Sir Thomas More died,
Thomas Stapleton was born: Mercury and Venus (presaging his two eminent
Accomplishments, a brave presence and happy eloquence, that Indeared and
Advanced him) being Ascendants in his Horoscope.

It is considerable in Sir John Fineaux, his Countryman, that he was 28.
years, before he Studied the Law, that he followed that profession 28. years,
before he was made a Judge; and continued a Judge 28. years before he died. And
it is remarkable in Sir John, that he was 12. years before [the sprightliness
of his temper, and the greatness of his spirit, stooping, with much ado, to the
Pedantry of Learning] he would learn to Read, 12. years before he Studied, 12.
years more before he either Minded the Law or Practiced it, his Genius leading
him to Converse, rather than Study; to Read Men rather than Books, more apt for
Business than Arguments; so much the less sollicitous for the learning of the
Law, as he was more able to supply the defect of the Pedantick part of it; with
his skill in the grounds and design of it, and to set off that skill with a
very plausible faculty of Address and Discourse. Those two Endowments, that
oblige and command the World, and have had a great stroke, in the erecting and
managing all of the Governments in it.

In the 11th year of his age [for men are curious to know even the most minute
passages of great and virtuous persons] his Father observing his make, fitted
rather for a Court than a College, brought him, in a Progress the last Queen
Elizabeth made that way, to Kiss her Majesty's Hand; with some thoughts of
Inrolling him among the Younger Attendants of her Majesty. The Address and
Complement he managed so gracefully above his years, and beyond expectation,
that the Gracious Queen (asking him, whether he was willing to wait upon Her,
in the capacity those Young Men he saw playing round about him, did? and he
replying, that he would never wait on any person, but a Queen; nor, on a Queen
only, to Play about her, but to serve her, that is, (as the Civil Audience,
that have always ready a charitable construction for youthful expression,
interpreted and raised his words) he would be an Instrument of State for her
Affairs, not only one of the number to fill her Retinue) commuted his
admission to a present Service, for his Education to future Employment, in
words to this effect. I have seen my Gardeners Setting, Watering, and
Cherishing Young Plants, which possibly may yield fruit and pleasure in the
next Age: And I love to cherish young ingenuity, whose proficiency I shall not
live to see, but my Successors shall make use of: Go, go be a man.

With this encouragement, and finding that it was behavior and discourse that
set off all the men in the world, when others conned their Parts, Lessons and
Lectures, he acted them, weighing little of any Author, but his Elegancies, and
most flouried Periods, and studying not only to observe and know those
Elegancies, but to manage them, being much affected with that Orator that
prescribed (upon a young Students request to know what rendered Men Eloquent)
Pronunciatio, Pronunciatio, Pronunciatio, Actio, Actio, Actio.

Two Studies took up most of his time: History, for the best Examples of
Actions; Speeches, for the best Patterns of Discourse. To propose to our selves
[saith Cicero] the most excellent example in our discourse and life, is a good
way to improvement, seeing that if we imitate the best, we shall not be the
meanest. Sir Henry Martin had, besides his own Collection weekly, transmitted
to him from some Proctors at Lambeth, the brief heads of the most important
Causes which were Tried in the High Commission; which, with some familiar
friends in that Faculty, he privately Pleaded, Acting in his Chamber, what was
done in the Court, he making it his work, and exceeding the rest in Amplifying
and Aggravating any Fault, to move anger and indignation against the Guilt
thereof; or else, in extenuating or excusing it to procure pity, obtain pardon,
or prevail at least for a lesser punishment. Whence no Cause came amiss to him
in the High Commission; for (says my Author) he was not to make now Armor, but
to put it on and buckle it; not to invent, but to apply Arguments to his
Clients. Sir John Finch, besides his own Observations, had most of the eminent
Speeches, Discourses, and Pleadings of the time, which he would perform with
friends in his own person; so that, upon all the great occasions he had
afterward to speak, his business was not so much to Compose, as to Recollect,
accommodating, rather than new-making his Harangues.

Thus accomplished for public Affairs, with a Generous Spirit, an Active Head,
a Charming Tongue, a Grave and Awing Aspect, an Obliging Converse, a Serious
Temper, a Competent Skill in such soft and severe Arts, as either Furnish and
Adorn the Gentry; a Happy Conduct, public thoughts with the Politure of the
University, and the Inns of Court. He was after some years practice and
converse, so much in Vogue in the Inns of Court, for his happy way of Managing
Business, that he was with the King's Particular Choice preferred the Queens
Attorney; and so much in Repute in the Country, that he was chosen
Parliament Man in that great Parliament. 1625, 1226, 1627. called, The
Parliaments of Kings: And so much in esteem in that Parliament 1627. as by the
Unanimous Vote of it to be chosen Speaker, as his Cozen Sir Heneage Finch the
Recorder was 1621. And when Speaker, his Integrity and Ability so Approved, in
that he was pitched upon as the great Mediator in most Cases, between the King
and his People, ever careful in his Messages of that which King James bid
Doctor Done be careful of in his Sermons, never to Exasperate the King against
his People, by too Rigid a Representation of their Carriage; nor stir up the
People against the King, by too captious an Account of his Commands: Having
what King James commended in my Lord Bacon, A peculiar way of handling Matters
after a mild and gentle manner. Until the Faction grew so Impudent, as being
Laymen, to question Divines, and state questions in Divinity, without either
the assistance or assent of Convocation, as in Doctor Mountague's Case and
Doctor Manwaring's. 2. To Limit his Majesty in his Ancient Right to Tonnage and
Pondage, so far as to deny it him, unless he would accept of it as their good
will, and only as Tenant at Will from Year to Year, by an Annual grant from
them. 3. To draw up Seditious Remonstrances of grievances, that they only
published to exasperate the People, never intending by redressing of them, to
ease them; when according to their Promise to Assist him in the War they
Engaged the King in, they should have presented him with their Subsidies and
Supplies. 4. To offer violence to their own Body, forcing the Solicitor to
keep the Chair one time, the Speaker another. 5. To create and spread fears and
jealousies by feigned Letters, and Discoveries. 6. To As one Dr. Tunter, and
one Clement Cook did.
speak Treason in the very Houses of Parliament. 7. To examine the Secretary of
States Letter and the King's, to search the Signet Office, etc. 8. To threaten
his Friends, and ruin his Favorites. 9. To Debate whether they should trust
the King on his Word, and upon Sir Edward Cook's Motion, to carry it in the
Negative. 10. To Condition with the King about Supplies, being resolved not to
Relieve his Necessities, unless he gratified their Humor. 11. To question the
Farmers of the King's Custom House, and most of the Officers of the Revenue:
This Party having designed that the King should neither Enjoy his own Revenue,
nor have any Relief from them. 12. To offer such Remonstrances in the House, as
neither the Speaker nor Clerks would Read.

I say, until the Conspiracy grew so bold, as to offer such affronts to Majesty
and Government, as not only diminished, but endangered them; for then indeed he
discoursed roundly, That not to Supply the King now Involved in a Foreign War,
was the greatest Grievance: A poor King, as Sir Robert Cotton used to say,
being the most dangerous thing in the world; This importing a Ruin, Denial of
Subsidies is increasing of Necessities, other Miscarriages only an
Inconvenience. That to raise Jealousies and Fears about Religion and
Government, answered not the end of their Convention. which were called to
Consult with the King about the great Affairs of the Kingdom, and not to
remonstrate Remonstrances, instead of remedying Grievances, do but aggravate
them, distracting the People whom they pretend to relieve, being Invectives
against Government, rather than any Reformation of it. That Mutual Confidence
was the happiest, because the most natural [for trust first made Kings]
accommodation between Prince and People.

That it was inhumane to grant a Gracious King Subsidies, at no lower Rate,
than the Price of his best Servants blood.

That the modesty of the Subject should comply with the goodness of the King,
striving to oblige, as the surest way to be obliged.

And when Speeches would not do, this Excellent Person finding the times (as
his Gracious Master intimated in the first words of his Speech, at the opening
of this Parliament) for actions, and not for words; and the Seditious made all
the civilities, and kindnesses showed them, to draw them off their old
dangerous Practices, Arguments and Encouragements to attempt new ones. When
they inveighed against my Lord Treasurer Weston, as they had done formerly
against the Duke of Buckingham, ( It appearing evidently, that not the persons
of men, but the King's Trust of them, was the object of their envy; and his
Favor, though never so virtuous, marked them out for ruin.) And the Invective
raised them to such a degree of heat, that fearing they should be Dissolved,
ere they had time to Vent their Passions, they began a violence upon their own
Body [an Example that lasted longer than the Cause, and at last produced the
overthrow of all their Priviledges] they Locked the Door of the House, kept the
Key thereof in one of their own Pockets, held him then Speaker by strong hands
in the Chair, till they had thundered out their Votes, like dreadful Anathemaes,
against those that should Levy, and (what was an higher Rant) those that should
willingly submit to pay it. When they check him for admitting the King's
Message, and move him to put it to the Vote, whether their undutiful and
ill-natured Declaration about Tunnage and Poundage, and what they called
Invasion, should be carried to the King, or no: He craved their Pardon, being
Ordered expressly by his Majesty to leave the House, when it was rather a
Hubbub than a Parliament, and by the Wherewithal Westminster rung.
noise they made at the close of each Factious Resolve, you would take it to be
a Moor-f^elds Tumult at a Wrestling, rather than a Sober Counsel at a Debate;
when they kept in the Sergeant of the Mace, locked the Door, shut out the
King's Messenger, and made a general Outcry against the Speaker, who, when the
Parliament was Dissolved, drew up such a Declaration, as satisfied the People,
that the ground of this Disturbance, was not in this, or that Statesman that
they complained, but in their own Burgesses, who upon removal of those
Statesmen, as Duke of B. etc. rather increased than abated their Disorders;
and such an account of the Seditious Party as vindicated the Honor of the
King: The Ringleaders of the Sedition, Protesting that they came into the
House with as much zeal as any others to serve his Majesty; yet finding his
Majesty offended, humbly desired, to be the subjects rather of his Majesty's
mercy, than of his power. And the wiser sort of their own side censuring them,
as Tacitus does Thraseas Paetus, as having used a needless, and therefore a
foolish Liberty of their Tongues, to no purpose: Sibi Periculum, nec aliis
Libertatem.

When he had done so much to assist the Government in Public Counsels, he was
not wanting to it in his Private Affairs; so obliging he was to the Country by
an extraordinary Hospitality; so serviceable to King and Country, by his quick
and expedite way in all the Commissions of the Peace, etc. he was entrusted
with: So happy and faithful in the management of the Queens Revenue; so zealous
for the promoting of any Design, that advanced either the King's Honor or
Service, that with the unanimous Choice of King and Kingdom (then agreeing in
few things else) he was preferred Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, in
place, beneath, in profit, above the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, by the
same token, that some out of design have quitted that, to accept of this:
amongst whom, was Sir Edward Mountague, in the Reign of King Hen. 8. who being
demanded of his Friends the reason of his self-degradation? I am now (says he)
an old man, and love the Kitchen above the Hall, the warmest place best suiting
my age: His Writ [so much the King confided in him] running not, Durante been
placito, but, Quam diu se been gesserit; and his Preferment owed to his Merit,
not his Purse, being the Judge [to use King James's speech of Judge Nichols]
that would give no money, because [they only buy justice, that intend to sell
it] he would take none.

In that Place he had two seemingly inconsistent qualities; a great deal of
Patience to attend the opening of a Cause [he would say, He had the most
wakening Evidence from the most dreaming speakers] and a quick dispatch of it,
when opened: Insomuch that some thought to see in his time in the Common Pleas,
and other Courts where he sat, what was seen in Sir Thomas Moore's in the
High-Court of Chancery, That the Courts should rise, because there were no more
Causes to be tried in them. He was very careful to declare the true grounds of
the Law to the King, and to dispense the exact Justice of it to the People: He
observed, that those who made Laws, not only desperate, but even opposite in
terms to Maxims of Government, were true friends neither to the Law nor
Government, Rules of State and Law in a well-ordered Commonwealth mutually
supporting each other.

One Palevizine, and Italian Gentleman, and Kinsman to Scaliger, had in one
night all his hair changed from black to gray: This Honorable Person
immediately upon his Public Employment, put on a public Aspect, such, as he
who saw him but once, might think him to be all pride, whilst they that saw him
often, knew him to have none.

So great a place must needs raise Envy; but withal, so great a spirit must
needs overcome it: Envy and Fame [neither his friend, neither his fear] being
compared by him to Scolds, which are silenced only with silence, being out of
breath by telling their own tales.

Seriously and studiously to confute Rumors, is to confirm them, and breed that
suspicion we would avoid, intimating that reality in the story we would deny.

His supposed Crimes when Chief Justice, as now, and upon my Lord Coventry's
death, when Lord Keeper, hear how satisfactorily he answers in a Speech he
made, after leave had to speak in the House of Commons in his own defense,
where indeed there is the account of his whole Life.

Mr. Speaker,
I Give you thanks, The Lord Finche; Speech in his own defense.
for granting me admittance to your presence; I come not to preserve my self
and fortunes, but your good Opinion of me: For I profess, I had rather beg my
bread from door to door with [ Date obolum Ballisario] your Favor, than be
never so high and honorable with your displeasure.

I came not hither to justify my Words, Actions or Opinions, but to open my
self freely, and then to leave my self to the House.

What disadvantage it is for a man to speak in his own Cause, you well know; I
had rather another should do it; but since this House is not taken with words,
but with truth, which I am best able to deliver, I presume to do it my self.

I come not with a set Speech, but with my heart, to open my self freely, and
then to leave it to the House; but do desire, if any word fall from me, that
shall be misconstrued; I may have leave to explain my self.

For my Religion, I hope no man doubts it, I being religiously Educated under
Chadderton in Emanuel College thirteen years; I have been in Grayes-Inn
thirteen years a Bencher, and a diligent Hearer of Doctor Sibbs, who, if he
were Living, would Testify that I had my chiefest encouragements from him; and
though I met with many oppositions from many in that house, ill-affected in
Religion, yet I was always supported by him.

Five years I have been of the King's Counsel, but no Actor, Avisor, or
Inventor of any Project: Two places I have been preferred unto, Chief Justice,
and Lord Keeper; not by any Suit or Merit of my own, but by his Majesty's free
gift: In the discharge of those places my hands have never touched, my eyes
have never been blinded with any Reward.

I never biased for friendship, nor diverted for hatred; for all that know me,
know I was not of a vindicative nature.

I do not know for what particulars, or by what means you are drawn into an ill
opinion of me, since I had the honor to sit in that place you sit in, Master
Speaker; in which I served you with all fidelity and candor: Many witnesses
there are of the good Offices I did you, and resumed expressions of
Thankfulness from this House for it; for the last day I had share in it, no man
expressed more symbols of sorrow than I did.

After three days Adjournment, the King desired me, it might be Adjourned for a
few days more; whether was it then in his Majesty, much less in me, to Dissolve
the House? But the King sent for me to Whitehall, and gave me a Message to the
House, and commanded me, when I had delivered the Message, forthwith to come to
him, and if a question was offered to be put, he charged me upon my Allegiance,
I should put none; I do not speak this as a thing I do now merit by, but it is
known to diverse men, and to some Gentlemen of this House. All that I say, is
but to beseech you to consider what you would have done in this strait, betwixt
the King my Master, and this Honorable House.

The Shipping business lies heavy upon me; I am far from justifying that my
opinion; if it be contrary to the Judgment of this House, I submit; I never
knew of it at the first, or ever advised any other.

I was made Chief Justice four days before the Writ went out for the Port, I
was sworn sixteen days after, and the Writs Issued forth without my privity.

The King Commanded the then Chief Justice, the now Chief Baron, and my self to
look on the Presidents, and to certify him our Opinions, what we thought of
it, That if the whole Kingdom were in danger, it was reasonable and fit to lay
the Charge for the Defense of it, upon the whole Kingdom, and not upon the Port
only. And Commanded the then Chief Justice, my self, and the now Chief Baron,
to return him our Opinions. Our Opinions were, and we thought it agreeable to
Law and Reason, That if the whole were in danger, the whole should contribute:
This was about June.

In Michaelmas following, the King [but by no Advice of mine] Commanded me to
go to all the Judges, for their Opinions upon the Case, and to Charge them upon
their Allegiance to deliver their Opinions; but this, not as a binding opinion
to themselves, but that upon better consideration or reason they might alter,
but only for his Majesty's satisfaction, and that he must keep it to his own
private use [as I conceive the Judges are bound by their Oaths to do] I
protest, I never used any promise or threats to any, but did only leave it to
the Law, and so did his Majesty desire, That no speech that way, might move us
to deliver any thing contrary to our Consciences.

There was no Judge that Subscribed, needed solicitations to it, there were
that Refused Hutton and Crook; Crook made no doubt of this thing, but of the
introduction, I am of opinion, that when the whole Kingdom is in danger,
whereof the King is Judge, the danger is to born by the whole Kingdom.

When the King would have sent to Hutton for his Opinion, the then Lord Keeper
desired to let him alone, and to leave him to himself: That was all the ill
office he did in that business.

February 26. upon command from his Majesty by the then Secretary of State, the
Judges did assemble in Sergeants-Inn, where then that opinion was delivered,
and afterward was enrolled in the Star Chamber and other Courts, at which time
I used the best arguments as I could; where at that time Crook and Hutton
differed in Opinion, not of the thing, but whether the King was sole Judge.

Fifteen months from the first they all Subscribed, and it was Registered in the
Star Chamber and other Courts. The reason why Crook and Hutton Subscribed was,
because they were overruled by the greater number. This was all I did, till I
came to my Argument in the Exchequer, where I argued the Case; I need not tell
you what my Arguments were, they are public about the Town.

I delivered my self then as free as any, that the King ought to Govern by the
positive Laws of the kingdom, and not alter, but by consent of the Parliament,
and that if he made use of it, as a Revenue or otherwise, that this judgment
could not hold him; but never declared that money should be raised.

I heard you had some hard opinion of me about this secret business; it was far
from my business and occasions, but in Mr. (...) absence, I went to the
Justice-seat, when I came there I did both King and Commonwealth good service,
which I did with extreme danger to my self and fortunes, left it a thing as
advantageous to the Commonwealth, as any thing else.

I never went about to overthrow the Charter of the Forest, but held it a
sacred thing, and ought to be maintained both for the King and People. Two
Judges then were, that held the King by the Common Law might make a Forest
where he would; when I came to be Judge, I declared my Opinion to the contrary,
that the King was restrained, and had no power to make a Forest, but in his
own Demesne lands.

I know that there is something laid upon me, touching the Declaration that
came out the last Parliament, it is the King's affair, and I am bound, without
his License, not to disclose it; but I hope I shall obtain leave of his
Majesty, and then I shall make it appear, that in this thing I have not
deserved your disfavours, and will give good satisfaction in any thing.

I know that you are wise, and that you will not strain things to the uttermost
sense to hurt me. God did not call David a man after his own heart, because he
had no failings, but because his heart was right with God. I conclude all this,
That if I must not live to serve you, I desire I may dye in your good opinion
and favor.

A Speech so franck and clear, that it might have removed all suspicion; so
pathetick, that it might have melted cruelty into compassion, so humbly and
submissively managed, that they could not but pity him, who were resolved to
destroy him; weeping at the pronouncing of it, and when it was over (Hyena and
Crocodile-like, shedding tears and blood in an instant) that day Voting the
Author a Traitor, and (without any regard to the honor of his place and trust,
the reverence of his years, the strictness of his profession and life, the many
services he did that party of whom he was reckoned one, and the many favors he
received from them; the extent of his charity, and the exemplariness of his
devotion) employ their common Messengers to take him, though he either upon his
friends intimation, or his own observation of the danger he was in, among those
who are prone to insult most, when they have objects and opportunities most
capable of their rudeness and petulancy, escaped in a disguise (wearing a
Vizard lawfully to save himself, as others did then to destroy him and the
kingdom) that night or next morning betimes in a Skuller [the Sea being less
tempestuous than the Law] to Holland, where he safely heard himself charged
with High Treason in four particulars.

1. For not Reading, as the Faction would have him, the Libell Sir John Clue
drew up against the Lord Treasurer Weston, in the Parliament 4. Caroli. 2. For
threatening the Judges in the matter of Ship Money. 3. For his judgment in the
Forest business, when he was Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. 4. For
drawing the Declaration after the Dissolution of the last Parliament.
And staid so long, until he saw. 1. The whole Plot he endeavored to obviate
in the buds of it, ripened to as horrid a Rebellion, as ever the Sun saw. 2.
The Charges against Buckingham, Weston, Strafford, himself, etc. ending in a
Charge against the King himself, whose Head [he would always affirm] was aimed
at through their sides. 3. The great grievance of an 120000l. in the legal way
of Ship Money, redressed and eased by being commuted for a burden of 60.
millions, paid in the Usurped ways of Assessements, Contribution, Loans,
Venturing, Public Faith, Weekly Meals, the Pay of the three Armies,
Sequestrations, Decimations, those Bells and Dragons of the Wealth, and plenty
of England, 4. The great fear, that the King would make a great part of the
kingdom Forests, turned into greater, that the Conspirators would have the
whole kingdom into a Wilderness. 5. And the Declaration he drew about the evil
Complexion of the last Parliament, made good with advantage by the unheard of
and horrid outrages of this. In a word, he lived to see the Seditious act far
worse things against the King and kingdom, than his very fear and foresight
suspected of them, though he gave shreud hints and guesses. And to see God do
more for the King and kingdom, than his hope could expect; for he saw the
horrid Murder of Charles I. and the happy Restoration of Charles II. enduring
eight years Banishment, several months Confinement and Compositions, amounting
to 7000l.

THE Life and Death OF Sr FRANCIS VVINDEBANK.
WHEN neither sincerity in Religion, which he observed severely in private, and
practiced exemplarily in public, nor good affections to the Liberties of the
Subject; in whose behalf he would ever and anon take occasion to Address
himself to his Majesty to this purpose. Your poor Subjects in all humbleness
assure your Majesty, In his Speeches 4. Car. 1.
that their greatest confidence is, and ever must be in your grace and
goodness, without which they well know, nothing that they can frame or desire
will be of safety or value to them: Therefore are all humble Suitors to your
Majesty, that your Royal heart will graciously accept and believe the truth of
theirs, which they humbly pretend as full of truth, and confidence in your
Royal Word and Promise, as ever People reposed in any of their best Kings.

Far from their intentions it is any way to incroach upon your Sovereignty or
Prerogative; nor have they the least thought of stretching or enlarging the
former Laws in any sort, by any new interpretations or additions; The bounds of
their desires extend no further than to some necessary explanation of that,
which is truly comprehended within the just sense and meaning of those Laws,
with some moderate provision for execution and performance, as in times past
upon like occasion has been used.

They humbly assure Your Majesty they will neither loose time, nor seek any
thing of your Majesty, but that they hope may be fit for dutyful and Loyal
Subjects to ask, and for a Gracious and Just King to grant. When neither the
Services he performed in public, not the Intercessions he made in private in
behalf of the People of England, could save so well-affected, religious, able,
active, publick-spirited, Created (...) April 7. 1640
charitable and munificent a Person as Sir John Finch, Baron Finch of Foreditch.

Its no wonder Sir Francis Windebank was loath to hazard his life in a scuffle
with an undisciplined Rabble, which he freely offered to be examined by any
free and impartial Courts of Justice, where the multitude should receive Laws,
and not give them, and reason should set bounds to passion, truth to pretenses,
Laws duly executed to disorders, and charity to fears and jealousies, when the
sacredness of some great Personages, and the honor of others, when the best
Protestants, and the best Subjects were equally obnoxious to the
undistinguished Tumults, which cried out against Popery and Ill-counsel, but
struck at all men in power and favor. Sir Francis rather ashamed than afraid,
to see the lives and honors of the most eminent persons in the Nation exposed
to those rude Assemblies, where not reason was used as to men, to persuade; but
force and terror, as to beasts to drive and compel, to whatsoever tumultuary
Patrons shall project, left the kingdom as unsafe, where Factions were more
powerful than Laws, and persons chose rather to hear than to see the miseries
and reproaches of their Country, waiting for an Ebb to follow that dreadful
and swelling Tide upon this Maxim, That the first indignation of a mutinous
multitude is most fierce, and a small delay breaks their consent, and innocence
would have a more candid censure, if at all, at distance. Leave he did his
place and preferment, like those that scatter their Treasure and Jewels in the
way, that they might delude the violence of their greedy pursuers, troubled for
nothing more than that the King was the while left naked of the faithful
ministry of his dearest Servants, and exposed to the infusions and informations
of those, who were either accomplices or mercenaries to the Faction, to whom they
discovered his most Private Counsels.

Those aspersions laid upon him, by those that spoke rather what they wished,
than what they believed or knew he would say, should like clouds vanish, while
his reputation, like the Sun a little muffled at present, recovered by degrees
its former and usual luster. Time [his common saying] sets all well again.

And time at last did make it evident to the world, that though he and others
might be subject to some miscarriages, yet such as were far more repairable by
second and better thoughts, than those enorminous extravagancies, wherewith
some men have now even wildred, and almost quite lost both Church and State.

The event of things at last demonstrating, that had the King followed the
worst counsels that could have been offered him, Church and State could not
have been brought into that condition they were presently, in upon the
pretended Reformation.

Among the many ill consequences, whereof this was not the least remarkable,
viz. that those very slanderers reputation and credit [I mean, that little they
had] with the people, were quite blasted by the breath of that same furnace of
popular obloquy and detraction, which they have studied to heat and inflame to
the highest degree of infamy, and wherein they thought to cast and consume
other men's names and honor.

In the mean time, his paticence better served him to bear, and charity to
forgive, than his leisure to answer the many false aspersions cast upon him,
and give the malice of some men the pleasure to see him take notice of, or
remember what they so rudely said, or barbarously objected against him.

Being conscious of his own good affections and inclinations for the public,
he could not suspect the affections of the public toward him, never [in
Foreign Parts, where the whole Nation lay under the imputation of the
miscarriages of the worst part of it] gratifying the sprightfulness of a few,
with any sinister thoughts of the civility of all, whereof many might be misled
by others that were inclined of themselves: His pity toward the errors of all,
being above his anger at the malice of any.

His greatest fault was; Ilis crim^s.
that he was promoted to that trust and honor he had by Archbishop Laud, as
the Archbishop's great crime was, that he was advanced by the King. It was
[saith the Historian] as fatal to be Sejanus friend at last, as it would have
been to his foe at first. It was thought offense enough to make up a branch of
that excellent person's Charge, as it should seem. p. 122. of the necessary
Introduction to his Trial. That it appeared out of his diary, His good
qualities ^or the Secretaries place.
that June 14. 1632. Master Windebank was made one of the Principal Secretaries
of State, by his procurement of these heinous words, being then Printed in
capital letters, June 15. Master Francis Windebank my old friend, was sworn
Secretary of State, which place I obtained of my Gracious Master King Charles
for him. And it would have been Plea enough against that Charge, to have taken
the reasons of this favor (a great piece of equity) as appears out of the
Bishops own mouth.

1. His Integrity and Faithfulness so singular, that he would lay aside all
obligations to please any one, to satisfy the great obligation that was upon
him of doing Justice. He himself having left behind him this Instance of his
Impartiallity. In this business [meaning the business between the new and old
Corporation of Sope-boilers,
Debated at the Council Board at Theobalds, July 12. 1635.] and some other of
great concernment, during the Commission for the Treasury, my old friend Sir F.
W. forsook me, and joined with the Lord Cottington, which put me to the
exercise of a great deal of patience. The Spaniard (while all other Nations are
Mercenary, and for money will serve on any side) will never fight against his
own King; nor would this Gentleman for any interest, engage against his two
great Sovereigns, as he called them, Conscience and Honesty.

2. His Lenity and Moderation, which was a hapyy mixture of discretion and good
nature, like the Silken-string, running through the Pearl-chain of all his
transactions, Si virtutum finis ille sit maximus, qui plurimorum spectat
profectum, moderatio omnium pulcherrima est, Ambrosius de Paenitent. contra
Novat. l. 1. c. 1. It was the honor of the Roman State, as yet being Pagan:
In hoc gloriari licet, nulli gentium mitiores placuisse paenas. Having this
peculiar commendation, That he punished not only offenders that were
discovered, but those that made it their business to lay snares to discover
them. It being as dangerous (as he observed) to take notice of all faults, as
of none at all, that involving the State in endless troubles and jealousies,
while this only made it obnoxious to some bold attempts, which all know it
could punish, though some presume, because it does connive.

Binding some of his own Pursevants ( Gray and Harwood by name) to their Good
Behavior, as well as their Prisoners, being not able to endure those
Hell Hounds, Horse-leaches that only sucked the corrupted blood of the Law. He
was very much pleased in applying a French Story to this purpose; Of one so
much delighted in troubling men, that when Lewis the French King offered to
ease him of a number of Suits, he earnestly besought his Highness to leave him
some 20, or 30 behind, whereby he might merrily pass away the time.

3. His Public Spirit, his friend the Archbishop being not readier to propose
public designs to him, than he to close with them; by the same Token, that a
D. H.
Great Man, upon the Rumor spread of his being a Papist [for all sober men in
their Wits were then Branded with the Nicknames of Papists, by those
Protestants, who King James said were frighed out of their wits] replied, That
he knew nothing he had of a Papist, but a very great Charity.

4. His Plain Dealing, a great Jewel in the Court of Princes, [ Quid omnia
possidentibus deest? [they are the words of the great Courtier Seneca] Ille qui
verum dicat.] And a resolution rather to displease, than betray his Sovereign.
Offering free, but humble Counsels, gilding and sweetning his whosesome Pills.

5. His Reservedness not so close, but that he imparted as much as might invite
others to open themselves, though so wary, as not to discover so much as might
give others a hank over him: his peculiar faculty was a vast gift of discerning
others, himself all the while unseen, walking as in Gyges his Ring.

But his great Charge urged against him in the House, November 12. 1640. and
December 1. was seventy four Letters of Grace to Recusants in four years, sixty
four Priests discharged by his Warrants, and twenty nine by his Verbal Order,
and twenty three by his Authority, under Master Reads hands. Father Joseph the
Capuchine of Paris, thanks to him for his Favors and Civilities; to which,
though he dyrst not himself, yet ot^ers durst for him, offer these satisfactory
Answers.

1. That what he did, he did by his Majesty's direction, the Kings Majesty
declaring, that the favors vouchsafed the Roman Catholics, had been performed
by special Command and Order given to him in that behalf, without any advice or
original motion of him, who has only moved herein, as he has been from time
to time Commanded. [ They are the King's own words.]

2. That that favor which he showed Catholics here, was to procure the
Protestants favor abroad. Allegations so reasonable, that he desired but the
favor to have his Charge set down in Writing, and liberty to answer thereunto,
in a Letter sent from Callis, December 6. 1640.

Although yet all his Letters carried that respect to his Majesty, that he
declared, He would not allege his Majesty's authority any further than his
Majesty would be pleased to give him leave, being willing rather to perish [
they are his own words] than discover any thing to the prejudice of his
Majesty's affairs.

And besides, none were by him discharged without Bonds and Security for their
behaving themselves according to Law. And this whole affair was no new thing,
but the practice of the wise and religious King James, who understood the
interest of the Protestant Religion, as well as any Prince in the world, and
promoted the concerns of it, more ways than any man in England, in whose Reign
Anno 1622. this Letter was sent to the Judges.

After my hearty Commendations to you.
HIs Majesty having resolved [out of deep reasons of State, and in expectation
of the like correspondence from Foreign Princes, to the Profession of our
Religion] to grant some Grace and Connivance to the Imprisoned Papists in this
kingdom, has Commanded me to Issue out some Writs under the Broad Seal to that
purpose, etc. I am to give you to understand [from his Majesty] how his
Majesty's Royal Pleasure is, That upon receipt of these Writs, you shall make
no niceness nor difficulty, to extend that his Princely Favor to all such
Papists, as are Prisoners upon the concerns of Religion only, and not matters
of State.

Westminster College. August 2. 1622. Your loving friend, JO. LINCOLN.


The clearness of this honest, but unfortunate Gentleman's Proceedings, gave so
much reputation to him abroad, even in his lowest condition [wherein great men,
like Dyals, are not looked on, because the Sun is off of them] as that the
Governor of Callice, Le Comte de Charra^ offered him his Coach to Paris, with
many other unusual Civilities, Mounsieur de Chavigny not only commanded License
for his departure from Callice, but expressed great respect to his person, and
gave order for his accommodation with any thing that that place could afford;
Cardinal Richlieu invited him to his Ballet, with order to Mounsieur Chavigni,
to bring him to his Eminence, and assurance of welcome, and an exceeding good
Reception, as he had March 12. 1640. The Cardinal, after extraordinary
Civilities, bringing him from his own Chamber into the next, giving him the
upper hand, and holding him by the hands. Yea, the King and Queen of France
admitted him to a very great motion of familiarity with them respectively, and
upon Mounsieur Senetens ordered a Privilege to be drawn up, in as large and as
ample manner as he could contrive it, to free him and the other English that
were Exiles there, on the account of their Loyalty, from that Confiscation of
Estates after their deaths, to which other Aliens are obnoxious by the Laws of
that Kingdom. Upon all which favors, he makes this reflection in a letter to
his Son. So as though in mine own Country it be accounted a Crime to me, to be
her Majesty's Servant, yet here I shall have Reputation, and receive much
Honor by it. As not only he did in France, but likewise his Son in Rome, where
Cardinal Barharino treats him at a very high rate of kindness and civility. ^
remember it was wondered at much by some, that a person rendered so odious,
should escape so well, as to enjoy his life and estate, and more by others,
that so worthy a man, that with his Father, [these are his own words] had
served the Crown near fourscore years, and had the honor to be employed by the
late Queen Elizabeth, King James, and his now Majesty, in businesses of great
trust, should be outed his Secretaries Place, and Banished his Country for
obeying his Master's Command, and that sometimes, much against his own mind and
opinion, insomuch that Master Read protests he did many of them with a very ill
will: His rule was to be constant, but not obstinate in his opinions he was of;
and when he had proper and secret motions of his own, yet to yield [as the Orbs
do for the order of the Universe] to the way of the first Mover. Especially
since he desired that his Secretary Master Read should come over, and give an
account of the grounds and reasons of all those transactions wherein he had
been ministerial, so confident was he of his integrity. And after such a fair
examination of his Services, he requested only the favor of a charitable
construction, if his Services, wherein he said he had no ill intention, nor had
offended willingly or maliciously; and permission to return in safety to
England, to pass that little time which remained of his life privately in
peace, and [mark these expressions] in the Church of England, His Petition to
the Parliament.
whereof [these are the very syllables of his Petition] he will in Life and
Death continue a true Member, and in which he desires to bestow the rest of
his time in devotion for the prosperity thereof. So modest were his
expectations.

It was pity he was forced to live and dye among strangers, more kind to him
than his own Nation, who while they persuaded the world he was a Papist, had
without God's special grace made him so, by the unkindness of some Protestants,
who dressed him and others with Nicknames of Popery, as the Heathens did the
Martyrs in Beasts Skins, that they might first expose, and afterward beat
them. Only he was happy in this, that the Faction did not persecute him so
rigidly, as all the Court loved him entirely, those very Lords that favored
the Conspiracy, being very careful of him, who lived to see them repent more of
their Compliance, than he had occasion to do of his Loyalty, though his little
state [the argument of his honesty and generosity] was broken, his Relations
distressed, his Son Thomas of the Privy-chamber to the King displaced; and what
was sadder then all this, one of his young Sons, commonly called Colonel
Windebank, Shot to Death at Oxford, for Delivering up Blechingdon-house to
Cromwell's Horse (upon first Summons, there being no Foot near, whatever
Cromwell threatened) so much to the disadvantage of Oxford. A wonderful passage,
had it happened in any other age, but that wherein men admired nothing, not so
much from any knowledge they attained in the causes of things, as from the
multitude of strange effect.

Some Venison there is not fit for food when first killed, till it is a while
buried underground: Some Men's Memories do not relish so well till a while
after their Interment. Of this unfortunate Statesmen, I may say what a wise
man said of another.

THE Life and Death OF Dr THOMAS IACKSON, President of Corpus Christi College
in Oxford.
IT is true, this Excellent Person died just when the Rebellion began to offer
violence to others, yet dying then, he could not escape from the violence of it
himself. Peter Martyrs wife, P. Fagius, and Martin Bu^^rs are reckoned a sort
of Queen Mary's Martyrs (though they dyed before) because their bodies were
then dug from their Graves, and buried in a Dunghill. And this great man
claims justly a place in the Catalogue of Loyal Martyrs, because though dying
Anno 1640. yet was afterward fetched out of the Bed of Honor, in which the
Church had laid him, and his Grave made among Heretics and Pestilent Fellows.

It was one Branch of Archbishop Laud's Charge, that he preferred this
Professed Arminian to be President of a College in the University, C. C. Oxon.
Peterburgh.
Dean of a Cathedral in the Church. And he could not have escaped that accepted
these preferments. He was reckoned a good man of old, that new hated. And you
shall see from a sober person, to whom we owe this relation, what a good man
this is whom the Conspiracy reviled. Reviled indeed, but basely, for when the
Archbishop answered, That he thought Doctor Jackson Learned, Honest and
Orthodox: It was replied, That though Learned and Honest, he was an Arminian.
Bonus vir, Cajus sejus in hoc tantum malus quod Christianus. A man you will
see, of whom that Age was not worthy.

He was descended from a very worthy Family, in the Bishopric of Durham, his
life seemed to be Consecrated to Virtue and Liberal Arts, from his very
Childhood: He had a natural propensity ^o Learning, from which no other
recreation or employment could divert him, he was first designed (by his
Parents) to be a Merchant in New Castle, where many of his near Friends and
Aliance, lived in great wealth and prosperity; but neither could that
temptation lay hold upon him.

Therefore (at the instance of a Noble Lord, the Load Eure) he was sent to the
University of Oxford, for which highly esteemed favors he returns his solemn
thanks in the very first words, and entrance of one of his books: He was first
planted in Queens College, under the Care and Tuition of the propound Doctor
Grakanthorn^ and from thence removed to Corpus Christi College, who although
he had no notice of the Vacancy of the Place, till the day before the Election,
yet he answered with so much readiness and applause, that he gained the
Admiration, as well as the Suffrages of the Electors, and was Chosen with full
consent, although they had received Letters of Favor from great Men to another
Scholar. A sure and honorable argument of the incorruptedness of that place,
when the peremptory Mandamus of the pious Founder, nec prece, nec pretio,
presented with the merits of a young man and stranger, shall prevail more then
all other solicitations and partialities whatsoever: This resolution has been
often assured unto me from one of the Electors (yet living) Master John Hoar of
West-hendred, a man of reverend years and goodness. There was now a welcome
necessity laid upon him, to preserve the high opinion which was conceived of
him, which he did in a studious and exemplary life, not subject to the usual
intemperance of that age. Certainly the Devil could not find him idle, nor at
leisure to have the suggestions of Vice whispered into his Ear. And although
many in their youthful times have their deviations and exorbitances, which
afterward prove reformed, and excellent men; yet it pleased God to keep him in
a constant path of virtue and piety. He had not been long admitted into this
place, but that he was made more precious, and better estimated by all that
knew him, by the very danger that they were in suddenly to part with him; For
walking out with others of the younger company to wash himself, he was in
eminent peril of being drowned. The depth closed him round about, the weeds
were wrapped about his Head. He went down to the bottom of the mountains, the
Earth with her Bars was about him for ever, yet God brought his soul from
corruption, Jonah 2. 5, ^. That (like Moses from the Flags) for the future good
of the Church^ and government of the College where he lived, there might be
preserved the meekest man alive, or (like Jonas) There might be a Prophet
revived (as afterward he proved) to forewarn the people of ensuing
destruction, if peradventure they might repent, and God might revoke the
judgments pronounced against them, and spare this great and sinful Nation. It
was a long (and almost incredible) space of time wherein he lay under water,
and before a Boat could be procured, which was sent for, rather to take out his
Body (before it floated) for a decent Funeral, then out of hopes of recovery of
Life. The Boat-man discerning where he was by the Bubling of the Water (the
last signs of a man expiring) thrust down his hook at that very moment, which
by happy providence (at the first essay) lighted under his arm, and brought him
up into the Boat. All the parts of his body were swollen to a vast proportion;
and though by holding his head downward they let forth much water, yet no hopes
of life appeared. Therefore they brought him to the land, and lapped him up in
the Gowns of his Fellow-Students, the best Shroud that Love or Necessity could
provide.

After some warmth, and former means renewed, they perceived that life was yet
within him, conveyed him to the College, and commended him to the skill of
Doctor Channel, an eminent Physician of the same House, where, with much care,
time, and difficulty, he recovered, to the equal joy and wonder of the whole
Society. All men concluded him to be reserved for high and admirable purposes.
His grateful Acknowledgments toward the Fisherman and his Servants that took
him up, knew no limits, being a constant Revenue to them while he lived. For
his thankfulness to Almighty God, no heart could conceive, nor tongue express
it but his own, often commemorating the miracle of Divine Mercy in his
deliverances, and resolving hereafter not to live to himself, but to God that
raises the dead. Neither did he serve God with that which cost him nothing; I
must rank his abundant Charity, and riches of his Liberalities amongst the
Virtues of his first years, as if he would strive with his Friends, Patron, and
Benefactors, Vtruum illi largiendo, an ipse dispergendo vinceret, whether they
shall be more bountiful in giving, or he in dispersing; or, that he was
resolved to pay the ransom of his life into God's Exchecquer, which is the
bodies of the poor. His heart was so free and enlarged in this kind, that very
often his Alms-deed made him more rich that received, than it left him that
gave it. His progress in the study of Divinity was something early, because (as
he well considered) the journey that he intended was very far, yet not without
large and good provisions for the way. No man made better use of Humane
Knowledge, in subserviency to the Eternal Truths of God, produced more
testimonies of Heathens to convert themselves, and make them submit the rich
Presents of their Wisemen, to the Cradle and Cross of Christ. He was furnished
with all the learned Languages, Arts, and Sciences, as the praevious
dispositions, or beautiful Gate which led him to the Temple; but especially
Metaphysics, as the next in attendance, and most necessary handmaid to
Divinity, which was the Mistress where all his thoughts were fixed, being
wholly taken up with the love and admiration of Jesus Christ, and him
crucified. The reading to younger Scholars, and some Employments imposed by the
Founder, were rather recreations and assistances, than divertisements from that
intended work. The Offices which (out of duty, not desire) were never the most
profitable, but the most ingenuous, not such as might fill his purse, but
increase his knowledge. It was no small accession of respect unto him (or
rather a consequent of the good repute which he had already gained) that those
two Noble Hostages (Mr. Edward, and Mr. Richard Spencers, Sons to the Right
Honorable Robert, Lord Spencer, Baron of Wormleighton) were commended to his
charge, whom he restored fully instructed with all good Literature, the glory
of learned and religious Nobility, and the very Ornaments of the Country where
they lived; for which faithful discharge of his great trust, he (and his
Memory) were ever in singular veneration with that whole Family, and their
Alliances. His Discourse was very facetious (without offense) when time and
place, and equality of persons permitted it. He was entregent (as our
neighbors speak it) a man (upon occasions offered) of Universal Conversation.
When he was chosen into Office, the Governor of the College was wont to give
this testimony of him, That he was a man most sincere in Elections: and that in
a dubious victory of younger wits, it was the safest experiment for an happy
choice, to follow the Omen of his Judgment. He read a Lecture of Divinity in
the College every Sunday morning, and another day of the week at Pembroke
College (then newly erected) by the instance of the Master, and Fellows there.
He was chosen Vice President for many years together, who by his place was to
moderate the Disputations in Divinity. In all these he demeaned himself with
great depth of Learning, far from that knowledge which puffs up, but
accompanied with all gentleness, courtesy, humility, and moderation. From the
College, he was preferred to a Living in the Bishopric of Durham (in their
Donation) and from thence (with consent from the same College obtained, where
no request could be denied him) removed to the Vicarage of Newcastle, a very
populous Town, furnished with multitudes of men, and no small variety of
opinions. It was a difficult task (and only worthy of so pious an Undertaker)
so to become all things to all men, that by all means he might gain some. This
was the place where he was appointed by his Friends to be a Merchant, but he
chose rather to be a Factor for Heaven. One precious soul refined, pollished,
and fitted for his Masters use, presented by him, was of more value to him,
than all other purchases whatsoever. He adorned the Doctrine of the Gospel
(which he preached and professed) with a suitable Life and Conversation,
manifesting the signs of a true Apostle; in all things showing himself a
pattern of good works; in Doctrine, incorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound
speech that cannot be condemned, that they which were of the contrary part
might be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of him, Titus 2. 7, 8.

I lately received Letters (says the worthy Compiler of his Life) from a
Gentleman, who lived there at the same time with him, who gave this Testimony
of him, He was a man very studious, humble, courteous, and charitable. At
Newcastle (when he went out) what money he had, he usually gave to the Poor,
who at length flocked so unto him, that his Servant took care that he had not
too much in his pocket. At a certain time Doctor Henderson, the Town's
Physician, his neighbor and intimate acquaintance (having made a Purchase)
sitting sad by him, and fetching a sigh, he demanded what was the reason; he
said, that he had a payment to make, and wanted Money: Doctor Iackson bade him
be of a good cheer, for he would furnish him; and calling for his Servant, told
him the Physician's need, and asked what money he had. The man stepping back
silent, the Doctor bid's him speak; at length the man said, forty shillings;
he bade him fetch it, for Master Henderson should have it all: at which Master
Henderson turned his sadness into laughter. Doctor Iackson demanded his reason;
he said he had need of 400 or 500 pound. Doctor Iackson answered, that he
thought forty shillings to be a great sum, and that he should have it, and
more also if he had had it. Thus in a place of busy Trade and Commerce, his
mind was intent upon better things, willing to spend and to be spent for them,
not seeking theirs, but them. After some years of his continuance in this Town,
he was invited back again to the University by the death of the President of
the same College, being chosen in his absence at so great a distance, so
unexpectedly without any suit or petition upon his part, for he knew nothing of
the vacancy of the Place, but by the same Letters that informed him that it was
conferred upon himself: A preferment of so good account, that it has been much
desired, and eagerly sought after by many eminent men, but never before went so
far to be accepted of. Upon his return to Oxford, and admission to his
Government, they found no alteration by his long absence, and more converse
with the world, but that he appeared yet more humble in his elder times; and
this not out of coldness and admission of spirit, but from a prudent choice and
experience of a better way: not without a great example of Paul the aged, who
when he had Authority to command that which is convenient (yet for love's sake)
chose rather to beseech, Epistle to Philemon. He ruled in a most obliging
manner, the Fellows, Scholars, Servants, Tenants, Nemo ab eo tristis discessit,
no man departed from him with a sad heart, excepting in this particular, that
by some misdemeanour, or willing error, they had created trouble, or given any
offense unto him. He used the Friends, as well as the Memory of his
Predecessors fairly. He was Presidents pacificus, a lover and maker of peace.
He silenced and composed all differences, displeasures, and animosities, by a
prudent impartiality, and the example of his own sweet disposition. All men
taking notice that nothing was more hateful than hatred it self, nothing more
offensive to his body and mind, it was a shame and cruelty (as well as
presumption) to afflict his peaceable spirit. It is a new and peculiar Art of
Discipline, but successfully practiced by him, that those under his Authority
were kept within bounds and order, not so much out of fear of the penalty, as
out of love to the Governor. He took notice of that which was good in the
worst men, and made that an occasion to commend them for the good sake; and
living himself, tanquam nemini ignosceret, as if he were so severe, that he
could forgive no man, yet he reserved large pardons for the imperfections of
others. His nature was wholly composed of the properties of Charity it self.
Charity suffers long, and is kind, bears all things, believes all things,
hops all things, endures all things. I can truly avouch this Testimony
concerning him, That living in the same College with him more than twenty
years (partly when he was Fellow, and partly when he returned President) I
never heard (to my best remembrance) one word of anger, or dislike against him.
I have often resembled him in my thoughts (with favor of that Honorable
Person) to him (whose name sounds very near him) who being placed in the upper
part of the World, carried on his Dignity with that justice, modesty,
integrity, fidelity, and other gracious plausibilities, that in a place of
trust, he contented those whom he could not satisfy; and in a place of envy,
procured the love of them who emulated his Greatness, and by his example,
showed the pre-eminence and security of true Christian Wisdom, before all
sleights of humane policy, that in a busy time no man was found to accuse him;
so this good man (in that inferior Orb which God had placed him) demeaned
himself with that Christian clemency, candor, wisdom, and modesty, that malice
it self was more wary than to cast any aspersions upon him. I shall willingly
associate him to those other Worthies his Predecessors in the same College
(all living at the same time) to the invaluable Bishop Jewel, Theologorum quas
Orbis Christianus per aliquot annorum Centenario produxit maximo, as grave
Bishop Goodwin has described him, The greatest Divine that for some former
Centuries of years the Christian World has produced. To the famous Master
Hooker, who for his solid Writings was surnamed The Judicious, and entitled by
the same, Theologorum Oxonium, the Oxford of Divines, as one calls Athens, The
Greece of Greece it self. To the learned Dr. Reynolds, who managed the
Government of the same College, with the like care, honor, and integrity,
although not with the same austerities. He willingly admitted (and was much
delighted in) acquaintance and familiarity of hopeful young Divines, not
despising their Youth, but accounting them as Sons and Brethren, encouraging
and advising them what Books to read, and with what holy preparations, lending
them such Books as they have need of, and hoping withal, that (considering the
brevity of his own life) some of them might live to finish that Work upon the
Creed, which he had happily begun unto them. This was one of the special
Advices and Directions which he commanded to young men, Hear the dictates of
your own Conscience; Quod dubitas ne feceris, making this the Comment upon that
of Syracides, In all thy matters trust (or believe) thine own soul, and bear it
not down by impetuous and contradictuous lusts, etc. He was as diffusive of his
knowledge, counsel, and advice, as of any other his works of mercy.

In all the Histories of Learned, Pious and Devout Men, you shall scarcely meet
with one that disdained the world more generously; not out of ignorance of it,
as one brought up in cells and darkness, for he was known and endeared to men
of the most resplendent fortunes, nor out of melancholy disposition; for he was
cheerful and content in all estates, but out of a due and deliberate scorn,
knowing the true value, that is, the vanity of it. As preferments were heaped
upon him without his suit or knowledge, so there was nothing in his power to
give, which he was not ready and willing to part withal, to the deserving and
indigent man. His Vicarage of Saint Nicholas Church in New Castle, he gave to
Master Alveye of Trinity College, upon no other relation, but out of the good
opinion which he conceived of his merits. The Vicarage of Wetney near Oxford,
after he had been at much pains, travail and expense, to clear the Title of the
Rectory to all succeeding Ministers, when he had made a portion fitting either
to give or keep, he freely bestowed it upon the worthy Master Thomas White,
then Proctor of the University, late Chaplain to the College, and now
incumbent upon the Rectory. A College Lea^^, of a place called Lie in
Gloucestershire, presented to him as a Gratuity by the Fellows, he made over to
a third (late Fellow there) merely upon a plea of poverty, and whereas they
that first offered it unto him, were unwilling that he should relinquish it,
and held out for a long time in a dutiful opposition, he used all his power,
friendship and importunity with them, till at length he prevailed to surrender
it.

Many of his necessary friends and attendants have professed, that they have
made several journeys, and employed all powerful mediation with the Bishop,
that he might not be suffered to resign his Prebendship of Winchester to a
fourth; and upon acknowledge (that by their continuance he was disappointed of
his resolution herein) he was much offended that the Manus mortua, or Law of
Mortmain should be imposed upon him, whereby in former days they restrained the
liberality of devout men toward the Colleges, and the Clergy. But this was
interpreted as a discourtesie and dis-service unto him, who knew it was a more
blessed thing to give than to receive. But that which remained unto him, was
dispersed unto the poor, to whom he was faithful dispenser^ in all places of
his abode, distributing unto them with a Free Heart, a Bountiful Hand, a
Comfortable Speech, and a Cheerful Eye.

How dis-respectful was he of Mammon, the God of this World, the Golden Image
which Kings and Potentates have set up? before whom the Trumpets play for War
and Slaughter, and Nations and Languages fall down and worship, besides all
other kind of Music for jollity and delight, to drown (if it were possible)
the noise of blood, which is most audiable, and cries loudest in the ears of
the Almighty. How easily could he cast that away, for which others throw away
their lives and salvation, running headlong into the place of eternal
skreekings, weeping and gnashing of teeth. If it were not for this spirit of
covetousness, all the world would be at quiet. Certainly (although the nature
of man be an apt soil for sin to flourish in, yet) if the love of money be the
root of all evil, it could not grow up in him, because it had no root: And if
it be so hard to a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God, and the Narrow
Gate which leads unto life; then he that stooped so low, by humbleness of mind,
and emptied himself so nearly by mercifulness unto the poor, must needs find an
easier passage; doubtless, they that say and do these things, show plainly that
they seek another Country, that is, an Heavenly; for if they had been mindful
of this, they might have taken opportunity to have used it more advantageously.

His devotions toward God were assiduous and exemplary, both in public and
private. He was a diligent frequenter of the public service in the Chapel,
very early in the morning and at evening, except some urgent occasions of
infirmity did excuse him. His private conferences with God by prayer and
meditations, were never omitted upon any occasion whatsoever.

When he went the yearly Progress to view the College Lands, and came into the
Tenants houses, it was his constant custom (before any other business,
discourse, or care of himself, were he never so wet or weary) to call for a
retire Room to pour out his soul unto God, who led him safely in his journey.
And this he did not out of any specious pretense of holiness, to devour a
Widows House with more facility, Rack their Rents, or Change their Fines; for
excepting the constant Revenue to the Founder (to whom he was a strict
accountant) no man ever did more for them, or less for himself. For thirty
years together he used this following Anthem, and Confession of the holy and
undivided Trinity. Salva nos, libera nos, vivifica nos, Obeat a Trinit as: Save
us, deliver us, quicken us, Oblessed Trinity. Let us praise God the Father, and
the Son, with the Holy Spirit; let us praise and super-exalt his name for ever.
Almighty and everlasting God, which have given us, thy Servants, grace by the
confession of a true faith, to acknowledge the glory of the Holy Trinity, and
in the power of the Divine Majesty to worship the Unity: We beseech thee, that
through the stedfastness of this faith, we may evermore be defended from all
adversity, which live and raignest, etc.

This he did perform, not only as a sacred Injunction of the Founder (upon him
and all the Society) but he received a great delight in the performance of it.
No man ever wrote more highly of the Attributes of God than he, and yet he
professes that he always took more comfort in admiring, than in disputing, and
in praying to, and acknowledging the Majesty and Glory of the blessed ^rinity,
than by too curiously prying into the Mystery. He composed a book of Private
Devotions, which some judicious men (having perused the same) much extolled and
admired, as being replenished with holy truths and divine meditations, which
(if it be not already annexed to this book) I hope the Reader will shortly
enjoy in a portable Volumn by it self.

Thus have many Scholars and Polemical men (in their elder times) betaken
themselves to Catechizing and Devotion, as Pareus, Bishop Andrews, Bishop
Usher; and Bellarmin himself seems to prefer this Book, De ascensione mentis ad
Deum, Of the ascension of the soul to God, before any other parts of his works.
Books (says he) are not to be estimated, Ex multitudine folliorum, sed ex
fructibus, By the multitudes of the leaves, but the fruit. My other books I
read only upon necessity, but this I have willingly read over three or four
times, and resolve to read it more often; whether it be (says he) that the
love toward it be greater than the merit, because (like another Benjamin) it
was the Son of mine old age.

He seemed to be very Prophetical of the ensuing times of Trouble, as may
evidently appear by his Sermons before the King, and Appendix about the signs
of the times, or divine fore-warnings therewith Printed some years before,
touching the great tempest of wind, which fell upon the Eve of the fifth of
November 1636. He was much astonished at it, and what apprehension he had of it
appears by his words. -- This mighty wind was more then a sign of the time; the
very time it self was a sign, and portends thus much, that though we of this
kingdom were in firm league with all Nations, yet it is still in God's power,
we may fear, in his purpose to plague this kingdom, by this or like tempests,
more grievcously then he has done at any time by Famine, Sword or Pestilence,
to bury many living souls, as well of superior as inferior rank, in the ruin
of their stately Houses or meaner Cottages, etc.

Which was observed by many, but signally by the Preface to Master Herberts
Remains; I shall not prevent the Reader, or detain him so long from the
original of that book, as to repeat Elogies, which are there conferred upon
him. I cannot forbear one passage in that Preface, wherein he made this
profession; I speak it in the presence of God, I have not read so hearty,
vigorous a Champion against Rome (amongst our Writers in this rank) so
convincing and demonstrative as Dr. Jackson is. I bless God for the
confirmation he has given me in the Christian religion against the Atheist,
Jew and Socinian, and in the Protestant, against Rome.

As he was always a reconciler of differences in the private government, so he
seriously lamented the public breaches of the kingdom: for the divisions of
Reuben he had great thoughts of heart. At the first entrance of the Scots into
England, he had much compassion for his Countrymen, although that were but the
beginning of their sorrows. He well knew that war was commonly attended with
ruin and calamity, especially to Church and Churches, and therefore that prayer
was necessary and becoming of them, Da pacem Domine in diebus nostris, etc,
Give peace in our time, O Lord, because there is none other that fights for
us, but only thou, O God. One drop of Christian blood (though never so cheaply
spilt by others, like water upon the ground) was a deep corrosive to his tender
heart. Like Rachel weeping for her children, he could not be comforted: his
body grew weak, the cheerful hue of his countenance was empaled and
discolored, and he walked like a dying mourner in the streets. But God took
him from the evil to come, it was a sufficient degree of punishment to him to
see it; it had been more than a thousand deaths unto him to have beheld it with
his eyes.

When his death was now approaching, being in the Chamber with many others, I
overheard him with a soft voice repeating to himself these and the like
ejaculations. I wait for the Lord, my soul does wait, and in his word do I
hope; my soul wai^eth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning.
As for me, I will behold thy face in right cousness, I shall be satisfied when
I awake with thy likeness. And he ended with this Cygnean caution, Psalm. 116.
5, 6, 7. Cracious is the Lord and righteous, yea, our God is merciful. The Lord
preserves the simple, I was brought low and he helped me. Return unto thy
rest, O my soul, for the Lord has dealt bountifully with thee. And having thus
spoken, soon after he surrendered up his spirit to him that gave it.

If you shall enquire what this charitable man left in Legacy at his Death, I
must needs answer: That giving all in his life time, as he owed nothing but
love, so he left nothing when he dyed. The poor was his heir, and he was the
administrator of his own goods; or (to use his own expression in one of his
last Dedications) he had little else to leave his Executors, but his Pape^
only, which the Bishop of Armagh (being at his Funeral) much desired might be
carefully preserved. This was that which he left to posterity in pios usus, for
the furtherance of piety and godliness, in perpetuam Eleemosynam, for a
perpetual deed of Charity, which I hope the Reader will advance to the utmost
improvement.

He that reads this, will find his learning Christeni^^ him The Divine, and his
life witnessing him a man of God, a ^^^^^^er of righteousness, and I might add,
a Prophet of things to (...) they that read those qualifications which he in
his second (...) ^rd book requires, in them which hope to understand the Scri^
(...) right, and see how great an insight he had into them, and now many hid
mysteries he lately unfolded to this age, will say his life was good,
Superlatively good. The Reader may easily perceive, that he had no designs in
his opinions, no hopes but that of wealth, nor affection of popularity, should
ever draw him from writing this subject, for which no man so fit as he, because
(to use his own divine and high Apothegm) no man could write of justifying
faith, but he that was equally affected to death and honor.

THE Life and Death OF FRANCIS Lord COTTINGTON.
SIR Francis Cottington being bred a youth under under Sir Stafford, lived so
long in Spain, till he made the garb and gravity of that Nation become his, and
become him too. He raised himself by his natural strength, without any
artificial advantage; having his parts above his learning, his experience, and
(some will say) his success above all; so that at last he became Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Baron of Hanworth in Middlesex, Constable of the Tower, 1640:
and (upon the resignation of Doctor Iuxon) Lord Treasurer of England, gaining
also a very great estate.

Very reserved he was in his temper, and very slow in his proceedings, sticking
to some private principles in both, and aiming at certain rules in all things:
A temper that endeared him as much to his Master, Prince Charles his Person, as
his integrity did to his Service; nor to his Service only, but to that of the
whole Nation; in the merchandise whereof he was well versed, to the trade
whereof he was very serviceable many ways, but eminently, in that he negotiated
that the Spanish Treasure, which was used to be sent to Flanders by the way of
Genoa, might be sent in English Bottoms, exceedingly enriched England for the
time, and had it continued, it had made her the greatest Bank and Mart for Gold
and Silver, of any Commonwealth in Europe.

Indeed, the advantage of his Education, the different Nations and Factions
that he had to deal with, the direst opposition of enemies, the treachery of
friends, the contracts of Statesmen, the variety and force of experience from
the chief Ministers of State, with their Intrigues of Government, made him so
expert, that the Earl of Bristol and Sir Walter Aston could do nothing without
him, and he only could finish the Treaty, which they had for many years spun
out.

Men take several ways for the ends they propose themselves, some, that of
confidence; others, that of respect and caution, etc. when indeed the main
business is, to suit our selves with our own times, which this Lord did, and no
man better, until looking into the depths of the late Faction, he declared at
the Council Table, 1639. That they aimed at the ruin of Church and State. And
viewing the state of the kingdom, he advised; That Leagues might be made
abroad; and, that in this inevitable necessity, all ways to raise money should
be used that were lawful. Wherefore he was one of those few that excluded the
Indemnity by the Faction, and had the honor to dye Banished for the best
Cause and Master, in those Foreign Countries; where he suffered as nobly for
the Crown of England in his latter days, as he had acted honorably for it in
his former. When he never came off better than in satisfying the Spaniards
about Tolleration, reducing the whole of that affair to these two Maxims.

1. That Consciences were not to be forced, but to be won and reduced by the
evidence of truth, with the aid of Reason, and in the use of all good means of
Instruction and Persuasion.

2. That the causes of Conscience, wherein they exceed their bounds, and grow
to matter of Faction, lose their nature: and that Sovereign Princes ought
diligently to punish those foul practices, though over-laid with the fairer
pretenses of Conscience and Religion.

One of his Maxims for Treaty, I think remarkable, viz. That kingdoms are more
subject to fear than hope, and that it is safer working upon them by a power
that may awe the one, than by advantages that may excite the other. Since it is
another rule, That States have no affection but interest, and that all
kindnesses and civilities in those cases, are but oversights and weakness.

Another of his rules of Life I judge useful, viz. That since no man is
absolute in all points, and since men are more naturally inclined out of envy
to observe men's infirmities, than out of ingenuity to acknowledge their merit;
he discovers his abilities most, that least discovers himself. To which I
may add another, viz. That it is not only our known duty, but our visible
advantage, to ascribe our most eminent performances to Providence, since it not
only takes off the edge of envy, but improves the reason of admiration. None
being less maliced, or more applauded than he, who is thought rather happy,
than able; blessed, than active; and fortunate, than cunning.

Though yet all the caution of his life could not avoid the envy of his
advancement, from so mean a beginning to so great honors; notwithstanding that
it is no disparagement to any to give place to fresh Nobility, who ascend the
same steps with those before them. New being only a term, says one, only
respecting us, not the world; for what is, was before us, and will be when we
are no more: And indeed this personage considering the vanity and inconstancy
of common applause or affronts, improved the one, and checked the other, by a
constant neglect of both.

Three things enraged the Faction against him. 1. His attendance on his Majesty
when Prince, as his Secretary in his Journey to Spain. 2. His activity in
promoting the King's Revenue and Trade. And 3. His great insight into the
bottom of their Confederacy. In the first, whereof he acted only as a discreet
Minister, observing more Intrigues, and offering several Considerations,
especially of address, formality and caution, that escaped greater persons: In
the second, as a faithful Counselor, by the same token, that he had the fairer
quarter of some adversaries, because in the management of the Revenue, and the
vacancy between the Lord Treasurer Weston's death, and the Lord Treasurer
Iuxon's advancement to that trust, he had some misunderstanding with my Lord
Archbishop of Canterbury. And the King in an Express to the Queen, Ian. 23.
1642. speaking of competitions for Offices, has these gracious syllables in
behalf of this Lord: Digby and Dunsmore look for the Captainship of the
Pensioners; Hertford once looked after it, but now I believe he expects either
to be Treasurer, or of my Bedchamber; I incline rather to the later, if thou
like it, for I absolutely hold Cottington the fittest man for the other. And in
a third, as a wise Statesman, that was not to be abused with umbrages. When
the Rebellion seized on other men's Estates, it looked for a greater Treasure
with my Lord Cottington's A B C, and Sir F. W. taking all their Papers.

Indeed this Lord sent such a Reply to some harangues of the House of Commons
against him, as could not be Answered, but by suppressing both their Charge and
his Answer: an essay of the Spartanes valor, who being struck down with a
mortal blow, used to stop their mouths with earth, that they might not be heard
to quetch or groan, thereby to affright their fellows, or animate their
enemies. And to prepare the way for his ruin, the most opprobrious parts of his
accusation were first whispered among the populacy; That by this seeming
suppression, men impatient of secrecy, might more eagerly divulge them, and the
danger appear greater by an affected silence: Besides, the calumnies, and the
suspicions were so contrived, as might force him and others to some course in
their own defense, which they hitherto forbore; and by securing themselves to
increase the public fears. For the slanders fixed upon the King's Party, were
designed rather to provoke than to amend them, that being provoked, they might
think rather to provide for their security, than to adjust their actions, in a
time when the most innocent man living was not safe, if either wise or honest.

Indeed he sat among the Faction at Westminster, so long as he had any hope of
keeping them within any reasonable terms of moderation, until he and others
saw that their longer continuance amongst them, might countenance their
confederacy, but neither prevent, nor so much as allay their practices; And
therefore among many eminent examples of loyalty and virtue of the noblest
extracts and fairest estates in England, of which they could not easily suspect
to be divested without an absolute overthrow of all the Laws of right and
wrong, which was to be feared only by their Invasion on the Kings most
undoubted Rights: (for when Majesty it self is assaulted, there can be no
security for private fortunes; and those that decline upon design from the
paths of equity, will never rest till they come to the extremity of injustice.)
We find him with the King at York, where the King declares, that he will not
require any obedience from them, but by the Law of the Land. That he will
Protect them from any illegal Impositions in the profession of the true
Protestant Religion, the just Liberty of the Subject, and the undoubted
Privilege of the three Estates of Parliament. That he will not Engage them in
any War, except for necessary defense against such as invade him, on them. And
he with others subscribing a Protestation to live and dye with the King,
according to their Allegiance, in defense of Religion and Laws, together with
the prosperity and peace of the kingdom.

But this Resolution without treasure would not take effect, and therefore the
Nobility, Gentry, Clergy, and both Universities, furnished his Majesty with
treasure, choosing rather to lay out then estates for the supply of his Majesty,
than expose them to the lusts and usurpations of a Conspiracy. And yet treasure
without a Treasurer could not at that time be either preserved or managed. and
my Lord Cottington had been so good a husband for himself, that he was looked
on in a time when his Majesty's occasions were so craving, and suppy so
uncertain, as the fittest Steward for his Sovereign. Being so rich, that he
would not abuse his Majesty himself, and so knowing, that he would not suffer
others to do it. The Soldiery would have their flings at him for being so
close in his advises, and wary in his place at Oxford: But he understood that
in vain do the Brows beat and frown, the Eyes sparkle, the Tongue rant, the
Fist bend, and the Arm swing, except care be taken that the Belly be fed. But
when it pleased God that the best Cause had the worst success, and his Sacred
Majesty more solicitous for his friends safety than his own, choosing to venture
himself upon further hazzards, rather than expose their resolute Loyalty to all
extremities, directed his followers to make as good terms of peace as they
could, since it was in vain to linger out the war; This Lord, among others
(whom when fortune failed, their courage stood to) had the contrivance first,
and afterward the benefit of the Oxford Articles, so far as the forfeiture of
all his estate, (most part whereof came to Bradshaw's share) perpetual
Banishment, but withal an opportunity to serve his Gracious Master in his old
capacity, of Ambassador to the Court of Spain, in Joint Commission with Sir
Edward Hyde, since the Right Honorable the Earl of Clarendon, and Lord
High-Chancellor of England. Two persons, whose abilities and experience could
have done more than they did, had not interest been more with Princes, than
honor; and present accommodations beyond future advantages: Considerations
that made it more advisable for this ancient Lord, Cum satis naturae, satisque
patriae, and gloriae vixisset; to prepare himself rather to dye in peace with
God, than to concern himself in the affairs of men; of which he said (as it is
reported) when some English Mercuries were offered him, that he would peruse,
and reflect on them, when he could find some of the Rabbines hours which
belonged neither to day nor night. So much longed he for the grave, where the
weary are at rest, and that world where all are at peace. What point of time,
about 165^. he died, in what particular manner he was buried, what suitable
Monument and Memory he has, has not come to my knowledge, and need not come
to the Readers. This Lord himself could not endure a discourse that ran into
frivolous particulars: And it is Lipsius his censure of Francis Guicciardines
history; Minutissima quaeque narrat parum ex lege aut dignitate historiae.

Thy want of Tomb's an Ep'taph, thou wants a Grave
Cottington, with more glory than others have.
The Sun 's Rise and Fall 's no more Spain's host,
Since this Lord 's morn and night was within that Coast.
THE Life and Death OF Sir JOHN BRAMSTON.
SIR John Bramston Knight, was born at Maldon in Essex, bred up in the Middle.
Temple, in the Study of the Common Law, wherein he attained to such eminency,
that he was by King Charles made Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench.

One of Deep Learning, Solid Judgment, Integrity of Life, Gravity of
Behavior, above the Envy of his own Age, and the^ candal of Posterity. One
instance of his I must not forget, writes the Historian effectually, relating
to the Foundation wherein I was bred. Sergeant Bruerton by Will bequeathed to
Sidney College, well nigh three thousand pounds, but (for haste, or some other
accident) it was so imperfectly done, that (as Doctor Samuel Ward informed me)
it was invalid in the rigor of the Law. Now Judge Bramston, who married the
Serjeant's Widow, gave himself much trouble (gave himself indeed, doing all
things gratis) for the speedy payment of the money to a farthing, and the legal
settling thereof on the College, according to the true intention of the dead.
He deserved to live in better times. The delivering his judgment on the King's
side, in the case of Ship Money, cost him much trouble, and brought him much
honor, as who understood the consequence of that Maxim, Salus populi suprema
lex; and that Ship Money was thought legal by the best Lawyers, Voted down
Arbitrarily by the worst Parliament, they hearing no Council for it, though the
King heard all men willingly against it. Yea, that Parliament thought
themselves not secure from it, unless the King renounced his right to it by a
new Act of his own. Men have a touchstone to try gold, and gold is the
touchstone to try men. Sir William Noy's gratuity showed, that this Judges
inclination was as much above corruption, as his fortune; and that he would
not, as well he needed not, be base. Equally intent was he upon the Interest of
State and Maxims of Law, as which mutually supported each other. He would never
have a witness interrupted, or helped, but have the patience to hear a naked,
though a tedious truth; the best Gold lies in the most Ore, and the clearest
truth in the most simple discourse. When he put on his Robes, he put off
respects; his private affections being swallowed up in the public service.
This was the Judge whom Popularity could never flatter to any thing unsafe, nor
Favor oblige to any thing unjust. Therefore he died in peace 1645, when all
others were engaged in a War, and shall have the reward of his integrity of the
Judge of Judges, at the great Assize of the World.

Having lived, Admin. Card. de Rich. P. 283.
as well as read Justinian 's Maxim to the Praetor of Laconia; All things which
appertain to the well-government of a State, are ordered by the Constitution of
Kings, that give life and vigor to the Law; Whereupon who so would walk
wisely, shall never fail, if he propose them both for the rule of his actions;
For, a King is the living Law of his Country.

Nothing troubled him so much as (shall I call it) the shame, or the fear of
the consequence of the unhappy Contest between His Excellent Majesty and his
meaner Subjects in the foresaid case of Ship Money; No enemy being contemptible
enough to be despised, since the most despicable command greater strength,
wisdom, and interest, than their own, to the designs of malice, or mischief. A
great man managed a quarrel with Archee the King's Fool; but by endeavoring to
explode him the Court, rendered him at last so considerable, by calling the
enemies of that person (who were not a few) to his rescue, as the fellow was
not only able to continue the dispute for diverse years, but received such
encouragement from standers by (the instrument of whose malice he was) as he
often broke out into such reproaches, as neither the Dignity of that excellent
person's Calling, nor the greatness of his Parts, could in reason or manners
admit. F. O. p. 12.
But that the wise man discerned, that all the Fool did, was but a symptom of
the strong and inveterate distemper raised long since in the hearts of his
Countrymen against the great man's Person and Function.

This Reverend Judge, who when Reader of the Temple, carried away the title of
the best Lawyer of his time in England, and when made Sergeant with fifteen
more (of whom the Lord Keeper Williams said, That he reckoned it one of the
Honors of his time, that he had passed Writs for the advancement of so many
excellent persons.) Anno 29. Iac. Termino Michaelii, had the character of The
fairest pleader in England. Westminster Hall was much envied by the Faction
upon the same ground that Scaevola was quarrelled with by Fimbria, even because
totum telum in se recipere, he did not give malice a free scope and advantage
against him; who when the Writ for Ship Money (grounded upon unquestionable
Presidents and Records for levying Naval Aids by the King's sole Authority)
were put in execution, and Hambden and Say went to Law with the King, the one
for four pound two shillings, the other for three pound five shilling: The
inconsiderable sums they were assessed at to the Aid aforesaid, went no
further than upon this Case put by the King.

Charles Rex.

WHen the good and safety of the kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole
kingdom in danger; whether may not the King by Writ under the Great Seal of
England, Command all his Subjects in the kingdom, at their Charge, to provide
and furnish such number of Ships, with Men, Victuals, and Ammunition, and for
such time as he shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the kingdom,
from such danger and peril, and by Law compel the doing thereof, in case of
refusal or refractoriness? and whether in such cases is not the King the sole
Judge both of the danger, and when, and how the same is to be prevented and
avoided?


To declare his opinion thus:
MAy it please your most Excellent Majesty, we have according to your Majesty's
Command, severally, and every man by himself, and all of us together, taken
into our serious consideration the Case and Questions Signed by your Majesty,
and enclosed in your Letter: And we are of opinion, That when the good and
safety of the kingdom in general is concerned, and the whole kingdom in danger,
your Majesty may by Writ, under your Great Seal of England, Command all the
Subjects of this your kingdom, at their Charge, to provide and furnish such
number of Ships, with Men, Victual, Munition, and for such time as your Majesty
shall think fit, for the defense and safeguard of the kingdom, from such peril
and danger, and that by Law your Majesty may compel the doing thereof, in case
of refusal or refractoriness. And we are also of opinion, that in such case
your Majesty is the sole Judge both of the danger, and when, and how the same
is to be prevented and avoided.

And afterward in the Lord Says Case, Ter. Hill. Anno 14. Car. Regis in Banco
regis, with Jones and Berkley, to declare, That [the foresaid Writ being
allowed legal] the judgment of the Judges upon it consisting of four branches.
First, That the Writ was legal by the King's Prerogative or at leastwise by his
Regal power. Secondly, That the Sheriff by himself, without any Jury, may make
the Assessement. Thirdly, That the Inland Counties ought to do it at their own
Charge, and to find Men, and Victuals out of their Counties for the time in
the Writ mentioned. Fourthly, That the sum Assessed was a Duty, and (ought to
be Assessed, and may be Levied) ought to stand, until it were reversed in
Parliament, and until then, none ought to dispute against it. And when the
Parliament afterward declared themselves, Hill. Term Anno 16. C. R. in B. R. he
was of opinion [in Chambers his Case against Sir Edward Brumfield, late Lord
Mayor of London] that the Court ought no longer to dispute of it. And yet in
July 1641. there was a Charge brought against him for his Extra-judicial
opinion for Levying of Ship Money; to which he made such a Rejoinder, as though
for malice they could not acquit, yet for shame they did not condemn him,
especially, since there were but few injured, as they pretended, by that his
opinion, and the whole kingdom the better for his exact Justice; which was so
effectual, that had he lived a few years longer, there would have been not a
Robber from one end of the kingdom to the other, but such as took the Highway
by authority.

Large were the Harangues made against him and his brethren. But as Bees are
sometimes drowned in their Honey, so were their Logic in their Rhetoric; the
body of their proofs brings as poor and lean, as the garnish of their words
gaudy; the stuff as mean as the dressing rich. After the affront of an Arrest,
the trouble and disgrace of an Imprisonment, and the charge of a Fine, or at
least a Gratuity, they thought it enough to have terrified, and so proceeded no
farther to ruin this good man, that was the honor, and would have been, if ill
treated, the disgrace of his Nation. Eccius is much censured by Divines,
because he said in his Chrysopas that he entreated of Reprobation as a fit
subject, In quo Iuveniles Calores exerceret. Young Lawyers were much blamed by
our ancient Judge, for choosing the deep and intricate points of Prerogative and
Liberty, to be the matter of their young and undigested Discourses; who while
they engage against the old Laws and Maxims of Government, notwithstanding all
their bustle and ratlings, yet are discerned by impartial and judicious men,
like that Goth in Procopius, who though he fought fiercely, had the mortal
Arrows sticking in his Helmet, whereof he soon after fell.

He died, as a Bishop of Oxford is said to do, at a time when he had rather
give an account of his Judges-place at the Tribunal of God, than exercise it on
a Bench awed by men. Since he could not keep on the Robes of his Office with
comfort, he put off those of his Mortality with peace; being ashamed to live,
as he would say, when it was not safe to speak either law or reason, and
reckoning it seasonable to dye when all things perished by him, and he had
nothing left him to do honestly, but to dye.

THE Life and Death OF Mr. JOHN GREGORY.
IT is not the least argument that we are Immortal, that we naturally desire to
be so; and that there is in every man implanted with his soul a generous
ambition of Conveighing his being to a fair Eternity, eithey by a Ae^ernitas
nodosa puster^ta
successive Posterity as Ara^^c. C^t. Bodl. ^. 24 25.
Noah, or by a lasting Monument as 2 Samuel 18. 18.
Absalom, or by an universal Fame as Plutarch.
Cato, or by Heroic undertakings as this Gentleman, the Astonishment of his
own Age, and the Wonder of the next, for a capacious Nature and a vast Industry.

His Birth.
An Industry, that finding little advantage in his Parentage, whose character
amounts to no more than that they were mean and honest, less in the place of
his Birth [Agmondsham in Buckinghamshire] ennobled only with his single worth,
least of all in the time of it [ November. 10. 1607.] when learning was at its
fatal height, and the ordinary methods of it but a meaness; when great souls
must trace untrodden paths for Eminence and a Name.

His Education.
In this Age he was very happy in Doctor Crook the Rector of Agmondsham's
Neighborhood, who respecting his Parents Piety and Poverty, and observing his
Hopefulness, admitted him to his Family, among those noble and excellent
Personages then under his Care; upon two whereof, Sir William Drake and Sir
Robert Crook, he waited to Christ-Church in Oxford; where he was more happy in
the excellent Doctor Morley (since successively Dean of that place, Lord Bishop
of Worcester and Winchester) his exact directions, and impressive
encouragements, that quickly advanced his Studies above a Tutor's care, and
most of all in the Learned Exercises, the Ingenious Converse, the Exquisite
Parts, which in that renowned College awaked his large Faculties to sixteen
hours Study every day for many years together, until his indefatigable way
attained a learned elegance in English, Latin and Greek, an exact skill in
Hebrew, Syriack, Chaldee, Arabic, Aethiopick, etc. an useful command of Saxon,
French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch; a deep insight to Philosophy, a curious
faculty in Astronomy, Geometry and Arithmetic, a familiar acquaintance with
the Jewish Rabbines, the Ancient Fathers, the Modern Critics and Commentators,
a general History and Chronology, and indeed an Universal Learning.

His Works.
His smart Sermons (whereof that of the Resurrection is a Specimen) speak his
Rhetoric, his Translation of M. S. in Arch. Baror. Bibl. Bod l. 12. (...).
Io. Antiochenus his Melala Chronography, his Latin; his Notes upon the same
Author, his Greek; his Aki^la or Discourse of Eastward Adoration, his Church
History; his excellent Comment upon Doctor Ridleyes excellent book (the first
testimony of his pregnancy, when but twenty six) his Civil, Historical, Ritual,
Ecclesiastical and Oriental Learning; his Observation on P^olomy and Euclid,
with his King Henry's Scheme and Discourse against Cardan of our Saviors
Nativity, his Ancient and Modern Astrology; his Epochae, his Globe, his His
Account of the 70 Translation.
Seventy, his His discourse of the ^lonument at Salisbury of a little Boy
habited in Episcopal Robes.
Episcopus puerorum, his Assyrian Monarchy, his Chronology, his Optic History,
Geography and Policy, and his (...) with his other unusual observations on the
(...) and hard places of Scripture (wherein he mentions no Modern Authors
[and none of note escaped him] but with design to enlarge, clear up, or correct
their Annotations) twice Printed in English, and now Translated to Latin, to
be a noble part of that grand Collection, called Critica Sacra, the depth of
his Rabbinical and Talmudical reading, the breadth of his Eastern and Western
Antiquities, his perusal of all Councils, his command of all Scholiasts, his
comprehension of all Architecture, Magic, Chimistry, Modes, Coins, Measures,
Weights, Customs, Proverbs, etc. and whatever else can properly come under a
great Schollar's cognizance, that aimed not at the empty and floating notions
of Surface-learning, but at Omne Scibile, A complete Scheme, Frame, and Idea
within himself, proportionable in all things to the order and method of being
without him, drawing his Intellectual Circle of Arts and Sciences in no
narrower compass, than that real one of things in the Universe. Insomuch, that
I cannot believe (as one suggesteth) he lived to the twenty fourth year of his
age, before he could buy Books, and but to the thirty ninth of it to read them;
unless I admit what is more strange, but affirmed by another, That his Candle
was not out one night for eleven of those years.

His Preferment.
This industry, this Proficiency escaped not the observation of the Reverend
Doctor Duppa, then Dean of Christ-Church, since successively Lord Bishop of
Chichester, Salisbury and Winchester, as great a Patron of ingenuity in others,
as Master of it in himself; who admitted him first to his favor, next to his
service, wherein he was first Chaplain of Christ-Church, and next to that
Prebendary of Chichester and Sarum, no Preferment compatible with his Age,
being above his Deserts. His Desigr, and the disposal of his Study.
For which Preferment in gratitude to his Master and the Church, he dedicated
Ridleyes View of the Civil Law to him, and his life in clearing up the
Scripture difficulties in that method he had begun to it: For when his Lord
called upon him to Preach and exercise his Ministerial Function; He said, The
Harvest is confessedly great, Epist. Dedit. to the Bishop of Salisbury.
but then the Laborers are not few; and if while so many are thus excellently
employed about the rest of the Building, some one or other do, as well as he
can, toward the making good of the Groundwork; I think he may be let alone at
least. The hopes of the Superstruction, depends upon the assurance of the
Foundation. I shall give them leave to be Pillars, this I am sure is the
Cornerstone, and I need not not tell you how rejected, I mean, not of all, but
of the Common Builders. And in this course of Study, he intended to spend the
rest of his life.

His Patrons and Acquaintance.
Neither did the vigilant Doctor Duppa alone take notice of this deserving
Person. For, 1. The blessed Archbishop Laud, now intent upon the Recovery of
Primitive Christianity, the Restoration of Ancient Learning, and the
Settlement of a Flourishing Church, In his Review of his M. SS.
employed and encouraged this great Master of the two first, and as great
ornament of the third. 2. The public spirited Bishop Linsey, designing his
excellent Edition of Theodoret, repaired to this great Transcript of that and
all other Fathers. 3. Great Seldom (...) confessed this Gentleman a confutation
of his opprobrious Preface against the Clergy in his Book of Tithes, sending no
less than eighty seven doubts, in several sorts of learning, to be resolved by
him. 4. The learned Bishop Mountague meditating a Church History, equal to, if
not above that of Baronius, consulted this great Antiquary; the familiarity
between them, when Master Gregory was but thirty years old, you have in his own
words, about the occasion of his Tract called, Episcopus puerorum in die
Innocentium. Having Consulted with the most likely men I knew (where about I
then was) to what Moment of Antiquity this (speaking of the Monument before
mentioned in the Margin at Salisbury) could refer: The Answer was, They could
not tell; so, the late learned Bishop Mountague, who also earnestly appointed
me to make further enquiry after the thing, not doubting but that there would
be something in the matter, at least of curious, if not substantial
observation. 5. There was a Club of great wits at Oxford, that met twice a week
to consult this Oracle, than whom none communicated his Notions more readily,
none expressed himself more satisfactorily; wherefore the most learned Jews and
Christians, Protestants and Papists, kept correspondence with him, and an
Armenian Priest lodged with him some time at the College, by the same Token
that he says himself, He had occasion to show this Priest the Chapel, and
perceiving him to cast his Eye upon the Organ, he asked whether there were any
such sight to be seen in their Churches? he answered, No such matter, neither
did he know, till it was told him, what to call them; yet this man had lived
fourteen years under two Patriarchs, Constantinople and Alexandria. And in the
Greek Liturgy we read of Music enough. And to close this Album Amicorum, he
traveled through twelve Languages without any guide, except Mr. Dod the
Decalogist, whose Society and Directions for the Hebrew Tongue he enjoyed one
Vacation near Banbury; for which Courtesy he gratefull^ remembered him, as a
man of great Piety, Learning, Gravity and Modesty: of which Graces also this
Personage was as great a possessor as admirer.

His Death.
But this height of worth and honor must, by the method of sublunary things,
be attended with its fall. This great height of our Church is now in its
meridian, and it must Set. One dismal cloud overwhelming Religion, Learning,
and his great Spirit, the Repository of both: for immoderate study, an
hereditary Gout of twenty years continuance (which his poor Parents were rich
enough to bequeath him) and heart-sorrow, brings him to his Grave, Marck 13.
1646. with Ichabod in his mouth, Ah, the glory is departed! yet not as one
without; hope for he concludes a Dedication to the Lord Bishop of Salisbury,

and his life with these words, The great Genius of this place must now burn a
while, like those subterraneous Olibian Lamps under the Earth, we shall behold
it, but not now; we shall behold it, but not nigh. Which those about him heard
not uttered then with more grief, than we after him see now fulfilled with joy.

His Character.
By this time your expectation is raised concerning the great particulars that
made up this Eminent Person. In a word, a Memory Strong and Active, containing
not a confused Heap, but a rational Coherence of Notions, an Imagination Quick
and Regular, a Judgment Deep and Searching, an Apprehension Ready and Natural
Bacon Aug Scient. p. 2.
(such a readiness to take flame and blaze from the least occasion presented,
or the least Sparks of another knowledge delivered, as is very discernable to
those that intently observe the little occasions he takes from one observation
to make another) a Patience Invincible, that never rested in its unconfined
enquiries of any difficulty, but at the bottom of it; a Good Nature Composed
and Settled, a Communicativeness that Exercised and Improved him, an Obliging
Carriage, that gave Access to the meanest Scholar, and had it of the greatest;
a Distinct Understanding, that could as well Touch and Apprehend the least
matters, as Compass and Comprehend the greatest; a Downright, Plain and Honest
Temper, and what crowned all, a Serious and Holy Frame of Spirit, discovering
its self in his Life and his Writing, where you will meet with such expressions
as these. 1. His sayings of Preaching.
When I am indeed able for these things [speaking of Preaching] I doubt not to
have him with my mouth, because I mean to leave my self out. I have thus much
left to wish [and I hope I do it well] to his Book [meaning the Scripture] that
it might be read (as far as this is possible) in a full and fixed Translation,
2. Of the Interpretation of Scripture.
and upon that, a clear and disingaged Commentary: The way to do this, will not
be to do the work a great, and undertake the whole, or any considerable part of
the Book by one man, if he could live one Age. He that goes upon this with any
interest about him, let him do otherwise never so admirably, he does indeed but

to gain the World. One asked him, whether the Alcoran had any thing in it that
could work upon a Rational Belief? He answered, That that which is every where
called Religion, has more of Interest, and the strong impressions of
Education, than perhaps we consider of.

His Burial.
There is no Scholar that would not know where lies the Remains of this great
man.

Christ-Church has his Body, He died at Kidlington, and was buried at
Christ-Church.
the Church of England his Heart, whose Religion he designed to clear up in
life, and sealed with his death; a death that was so much more a Martyrdom in
his Bed, than others were upon the Scaffold; as it is a more exquisite misery
to dye daily with grief, than once by an Executioner. His honest Epitaph is
this.

THE Life and Death OF JOHN BARNSTON Doctor of Divinity.
THE greatest parts was not protection enough, you observe in the last
Instance, against the Barbarism of that Age, nor yet the best nature any
security, as you may perceive by this, against the inhumanity of it; For there
was one John Barnston D. D. born of an ancient Family in Cheshire, his birth
deserved civility, bred Fellow of Brazen-Nose College in Oxford, his education
pleaded for favor, Chaplain to Chancellor Egerton, and Residentiary of
Salisbury; his preferments should have gained him respect, a peaceable and good
Disposition, whereof take this eminent instance.

He sat Judge in the Consistory, when a Churchwarden, out of whose house a
Chalice was stolen, was Sued by the Parish to make it good to them, because not
taken out of the Churchchest (where it ought to be reposited) but out of his
private house. The Churchwarden Pleaded, That he took it home only to Scour
it; which proving in-effectual, he retained it till next morning, to Boil out
the in-laid Rust thereof.

Well (said the Doctor) I am sorry that the Cup of Union and Communion should
be the cause of difference and discord between you. Go home, and live lovingly
together, and I doubt not, but that either the Thief out of remorse will
restore the same, or some charity come to pass accordingly. He Founded an
Hebrew Lecture in Brazen-Nose College, a piece of charity this, that should
have covered a multitude of offenses!

Hospitality, they say, has slept since 1572. in the Grave of Edward Earl of
Derby, this Gentleman's Father's Master, and was a little awaked by this
Gentleman, his Sons Chaplain and Friend from the year 1620. to the year 1640.
carrying with him that genius of Cheshire Hospitality, and free to his own
Family, which is Generosity; to Strangers, which is Courtesy; and to the Poor,
which is Charity.

A Native of Northamptonshire observes, that all the Rivers of that County
are bred in it, besides those [Ouse and Charwell] it lends unto other Shires:
So this good Housekeeper had provisions arising from his own grounds, both to
serve himself and to supply others, who, if poor, were in his house, as in
their own.

The peculiar grace of his charity, was that with the good man in Plutarch, he
would sometimes steal Largesses under the Pillows of Ingenious Men, who
otherwise might refuse them, relieving so at once as well the modesty as the
poverty of his Clients; not expecting, but preventing their request. God forbid
the Heavens should never Rain, till the Earth first opens her Mouth, seeing
some grounds will sooner burn than chap.

It was the Right Honorable the Earl of Clarendon's observation, in his
excellent Speech October. 13. 1660. before the King's Majesty and both Houses of
Parliament. That good Nature was a virtue so peculiar unto us, and so
appropriated by Almighty God to this Nation, that it can be translated into no
other Language, and hardly practiced by any other People. This good nature was
the praedominant temper of this good man, appearing in the cheerfulness of his
spirit, the openness and freedom of his converse, and his right English
inclination, so that the spirit of fears and jealousies [that spiritus
Calvinianus, spiritus Melancholicus] that prevailed in the beginning of these
times [like the louring of the Sky before a Storm] was as inconsistent with his
temper and spirit, as it was contrary to other sober persons opinion and
interest. His first disturbance was by some Croaking Lectures [the Product of
the extraordinary heat of that time out of the mud of Mankind] who vied with
him in long and thin discourses, in reference to whom he would apply a Story he
took much pleasure in.

When a Nobleman of this Nation, had a controversy in, Law with a Brewer, A
comparison between the despised pains of worthy men, and the admired nothing of
the unworthy.
who had a Garden and a Dwelling House bordering upon his: The Brewer gave it
in charge to his Servant, to put in so many Hogsheads of Water more into all
his Brewings than he was wont to do, telling him, that such a supply would bear
the charge of his Suit with his Adversary; which being overheard by the
Nobleman, he sent presently to the Brewer, resolving he would no longer go to
Law with him, who upon such easy and cheap terms could manage his part of the
Suit. And when some ill-minded people thought to disturb the peace of his soul,
by the confluence that attended his Neighbor's Ministry, and the solitude of
his, he would at once please himself and displease them with this Repartee,
That to one Customer you will see in a substantial Whole-saleman's Warehouse,
you will meet with twenty in a pedling Retailer of Small-wares Shop.

A man would wonder how so good a nature could have an enemy, but that, as
Culpitius Severus notes of Ithacius, that he so hated Priscillian, that the
very Habit which good men used, if it were such as Priscillian had used, made
him hate them also; so it was observed in those times, that any thing that was
Episcopal was so odious, that some men, whose Callings were much indeared by
the excellent endowments of their persons, had yet their persons much
disrespected by the common prejudices against their Callings. Ah, shall I be so
happy, as to be taken away from the evil to come! [They are his dying words] as
Augustine before the taking of Hippopareus before the Siege of Heidelbergh, and
the good Christians before the Siege of Jerusalem! Shall I go [as old Gryneus
said] ubi Lutherus cum Zwinglio optime jam convenit. If they knew what it was
to dye, they would not live so! When Bees Swarm, a little dust thrown in the
Air setleth them, and when People are out of order, a little thought of their
mortality would compose them: And since they are mortal, their hatred would not
be immortal. O set bounds to our zeal, by discretion; to tumults, by law; to
errors, by truth; to passion, by reason; and to divisions, by charity. And so
this good man went up to that place that is made up of his Temper: Mirth and
peace.

THE Life and Death OF Sir ROBERT BERKLEY.
THE two great Boundaries that stood in the way of the late Sedition, were
Religion and Law, which guide and regulate the main Springs that move and
govern the affections of reclaimed nature, Conscience and Fear; by the first of
which, we are obliged as we live in the communion of those that hope for
another world; And by the second, as we live in society with those that keep in
order this. Ministers and Lawyers are the Oracles we depend upon for Counsel
and Instruction in both those Grand Concerns, so far as that we think it our
duty to submit to the reason of the one, and to believe the doctrine of the
other, without scruple or argument, unless in matters most notoriously
repugnant to the Elements of Policy and Religion. These two professions the
Conspiracy endeavored to make sure of, either by cajoling or persecuting,
drawing the one half of them to sin with them, [oh what a case the Nation was
in, when Juglers and Impostors took up its Benches and Pulpits] and marking out
the other half for persecution by them: [miserable kingdom, where the Law is
Treason, and Gospel a Misdemeanor!] One of those that could better endure the
Injuries, than the Ways of the Faction, was Sir Robert Berkley, a person whose
worth was set in his Pedigree, as a rich diamond in a fair Ring; his extraction
not so much honoring his parts, as his parts did illustrate his extraction.
When a Pippin is planted on a Pippin-stock, there grows a delicious fruit
upon it, called a Renate. When eminent abilities meet with an eminent person,
the product of that happy concurrence is noble and generous. The Heveninghams
of Suffolk reckon twenty five Knights of their Family; the Tilneys of Norfolk
are not a little famous for sixteen Knights successively in that House, and the
Nauntons have made a great noise in history; seven hundred pounds a year they
have enjoyed ever since, or even before the Conquest. And this person took a
great pleasure in reflecting on the eight Lords, forty two Knights, besides a
great number of Gentlemen, that amongst them, possess nine thousand pounds a
year, for five hundred years together. When he came to Study the Law, he knew
that though to have an Estate be a sure First, yet to have Learning is a sure
Second, skill being no burden to the greatest men; that being often in his
mouth in effect, which I find in another Judges Book in express terms: Haec
studia adolescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectunt, secundas res ornant, adversis
persugium praebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris: pernoctant nobiscum,
Peregrinantur, Rusticantur. He observed it a great happiness that he fixed on a
profession, that was as Aristotle says among the (...) suited to his genius
and inclination.

The reason of his considerable proficiency in his Profession, being judged the
greatest Master of Maxims in his time, and therefore his only fault was, that
being made Sergeant 3. Caroli with great Solemnity, and at the same Term sworn
the King's Majesty's Sergeant at Law, he argued against the factious Members of
the Parliament 4. Caroli, Sir John Aliot, etc. so shrewdly, that Sir G. C. said
of him, Prerogative and Law will not be overrun while Sergeant Berkley lives.
A testimony of him suitable to the inscription on his ring when made Sergeant,
Lege Deus, and Rex. Two things he abhorred. 1. The impudence of those men that
by misconstruction of Laws, misapplying of Presidents, torturing or embezzeling
of Records, turn the point of the Law upon its self; Wounding the Eagle with a
feather from his own wing, and overthrowing the power of Princes by their
authority. 2. The uncharitableness of others void of the ingenuity, either of
Scholars, or indeed of men, who charged him and others with opinions which they
heartily disclaimed, merely because they think such an opinion flowed from his
Principles; an uncharitableness that has widened the breach irreconcilably
among both Lawyers and Divines in this Nation. This was the reason, why when
the other Judges were Charged with Misdeamenors [when the Parliament was upon
the business of Ship-money] this Judge was Accused of Treason; and why when his
fellows got off with a check and a small Fine, he suffered three years
Imprisonment, and afterward was released upon no lower terms, than a Fine of
two thousand pounds, an incapacity of any Dignity or Office in the Common^
wealth, and to be a Prisoner at large during pleasure.

After having been eleven years a good Justice in the Kings bench, he died
heart-broken with grief Anno 1649. Aetatis 63.

Hard indeed were this Gentleman's Arguments against the times, but soft his
words, often relating, and its seems always reflecting on Mnemon's discipline,
who hearing a mercenary Soldier with many bold and impure reports exclaiming
against Alexander, lent him a blow with his Lance, saying, That he had hired
him to Fight against Alexander, and not to Rail. Only he would innocently say
sometimes, that he would make bold to deal with the wild and skittish
multitude, that would not endure their Riders, but rushed like the horse to the
battle, as Alexander did with his Buc^phalus, take them a little by the Bridle,
and turn them to the Sun and light. Two things rendered his enemies willing, if
it had been possible, to oblige him, Cum talis sit, utinam noster esset, and
when that would not be, resolved to ruin him. [For it was a Maxim then, a
godly and good Malignant, was the most dangerous Malignant. I remember the
Waldenses are set for the greatest enemies to Rome, upon three accounts. 1.
Because they were ancient. 2. Because they were Scripture-skilled. 3. Because
they were very godly.] 1. His Religion practiced to as great a height by him,
as it was pretended by them. 2. His Charity (his Hands being every day his
Executors, and his Eyes his Overseers) that relieved poor people as fast, as
the Conspiracy made them so: his goodness finding as many ways to exercise his
charity, as the men [who destroyed Hospitals, and made men poor] had to make
objects of it, they not undoing men as fast as he succored them; especially,
with his counsel to poor Loyalty, which carried Fee enough in its very looks to
him, who thought it honor enough to be Advocate to the King of Heaven, as he
had been to his dread Sovereign, and so bound ex officio to be of Counsel.
Whence (besides the common blessing of good Lawyers, That they seldom dye
without an Heir, or making a Will) there accrewed, I cannot tell whether more
comfort to himself, more honor to his afflicted cause, or more shame to his
malicious adversaries; who to use Gregory Nazianzen's words when they
persecuted him, persecuted virtue it self, which with his unconfined Soul
making the man, he might be Imprisoned, but not Restrained; or if Restrained,
Cloistered rather than Imprisoned; as an holy Anchorite, rather than an
Offender, retiring from a sad world, and not forced from it; where when alone,
never less alone, not the suffering, but the cause making the punishment, as
well as the Martyr; he thought his body always a streighter prison to his soul,
than any prison could be to his body. In fine, he commended his prison for the
same reason that Sir John Fortescue commended the Inns of Court, Quod
confluentium turba [studentis, meditantis] quietem perturbare non possit.

But I will cloth his free thoughts in the closest restraint, with the
generous Expressions of a worthy Personage that suffered deeply in those times,
and injoys only the conscience of having so suffered in these.

BEat on proud Billows, Boreas blow,
Swell curled Waves, high as Jove's roof,
Your incivility does show,
That Innocence is tempest proof.
Though surly Nereus frown, my Thoughts are calm,
Then strike Affliction, for thy wounds are balm.
That which the World miscalls a Goal,
A Private Closet is to me,
Whilst a good Conscience is my Bail,
And Innocence my Liberty:
Locks, Bars and Solitudes together met,
Make me no Prisoner, but an Anchorit.
I whilst I wished to be retired,
Into this Private Room was turned;
As if their Wisdoms had Conspired,
The Salamander should be Burned.
The Cynick hugs his Poverty,
The Pelican her Wilderness,
And it is the Indian's Pride to be
Naked on Frozen Cancasus.
Contentment cannot smart, Stoics we see
Make Torments easy to their Apathy.
These Menacles upon my Arm,
I as my Mistris's favors wear;
And for to keep my Ankles warm,
I have some Iron Shackles there.
These Walls are but my Garrison; this Cell
Which men call Goal, does prove my Citadel.
So he that struck at Iason's Life,
Thinking he had his purpose sure:
By a malicious friendly Knife,
Did only wound him to a Cure.
Malice I see wants wit, for what is meant,
Mischief, often times proves favor by the event.
I Am in this Cabinet locked up,
Like some High Prized Margaret,
Or like some great Mogul Or Pope,
Am Cloystered up from public sight.
Retirement is a piece of Majesty,
And thus proud Sultan, I Am as great as thee.
Here Sin for want of Food must starve,
Where tempting Objects are not seen;
And these Strong Walls do only serve,
To keep Vice out, and keep Me in.
Malice of late's grown Charitable sure,
I Am not Committed, but I Am kept Secure.
When once my Prince Affliction has,
Prosperity does Treason seem;
And to make smooth so tough a Path,
I can learn Patience from him.
Now not to suffer, shows no Loyal Heart,
When Kings want Ease, Subjects must bear a Part.
Have you not seen the Nightingale,
A Pilgrim koopt into a Cage;
How does she Chant her wonted Tale,
In that her Narrow Hermitage,
Even then her Charming Melody does prove,
That all her Boughs are Trees, her Cage a Grove.
My Soul is free as the Ambient Air,
Although my Baser Part's Immured;
Whilst Loyal Thoughts do still repair,
TO Accompany my Solitude.
And though Immured, yet I can Chirp and Sing,
Disgrace to Rebels, Glory to my King.
What though I cannot see my King,
Neither in his Person or his Coin;
Yet contemplation is a Thing,
That renders what I have not, Mine.
My King from me what Adamant can part,
Whom I do wear Engraven on my Heart.
I am that Bird whom they Combine,
Thus to deprive of Liberty;
But though they do my Corpse confine,
Yet maugre Hate, my Soul is Free.
Although Rebellion do my Body Bind,
My King can only Captivate my Mind.
OF THE LOYAL FAMILY OF THE BERKLEYS. JOHN Lord BERKLEY.
IT is reported of the Roman Fabii, no less numerous than valiant, [three
hundred and sixty Patricians flourishing of them at once] that they were all
engaged in one Battle, one only excepted, who being under age to bear arms,
was absent.

It is recorded of the Family of the Hayes in Scotland (in Edward the First's
time) that they were all in the Battle at Duplin-Castle, except a Child then in
his Mothers womb. Let it pass to Posterity, that the whole Family of the
Berkleys were sooner or later involved with his Sacred Majesty in the miseries
of the late times; and therefore with reason do many of them partake in the
happiness of these.

For, besides the foresaid Judge, there were several other Honorable Persons
of this Name, who descended from Kings [for their first Ancestor was Son to
Harding King of Denmark, whence Fitz-Harding the ancient Surname of all the
Family formerly, and the Title of Honor to a Noble Branch of it now:] and
therefore were resolved to hazard all in the Cause of the best King. In the
List of whose faithful followers, as few of more ancient Nobility, Robert
Harding their Ancestor, being made Baron Berkley by King Henry the Second, so
few of more untainted Loyalty; As, 1. Sir John Berkley, since Lord Berkley,
much he did by his Interest in Somersetshire and Devon-shire, more in Person,
most by his Care and Discipline; two things he had a special care of, Pay and
Law; his word was, Pay them well, and hang them well. All he had himself was
bestowed on the quarrel, he judging it madness to keep an Estate with the
hazard of that Cause; which if miscarrying, all miscarried with it; if
succeeding, all was wrapped up in it. In all meetings about the King's Affairs
where he met with scruples, he pressed the doing, and not the disputing of the
King's Commands; because otherwise Kings before they leavie an Army of
Soldiers, they must leavie an Army of Casuists and Confessors, to satisfy
each scrupulous Soldier in the perplexed and complicated grounds of War, and
that to little purpose too; the men of scruples being generally the most
cowardly withal. This Gentleman having an excellent rule, viz. That the
Commands of Majesty, if not immediately (without any tedious inferences)
contrary to the Law of God and Nature, were not to be disputed: A Rule that
quickly satisfied all honest men, and as quickly silenced those that were
otherwise inclined.

He behaved himself in the West, 1. Keeping the Country from Free Quarter. 2.
Stopping the Inroads of the Parliaments Forces thither. 3. Keeping open their
Trade. 4. Keeping a good correspondence among their Gentry, that September. 4.
1643. when Exeter was delivered up to Prince Maurice, he was made Governor of
it; keeping it, and the Country round about it, in a very remarkable degree of
quietness and subjection, and easily advancing for three years 50000 l. a year
for the King's Service; until it pleased God in wrath to the King's enemies to
ruin the King's Cause, and leave them who had been happy if reduced to a
subjection under him, to be undone among themselves; and Fairfax having
defeated almost all the King's Army in the field, Ian. 25. 1645. made his way
as far as Porthrane, a Fort within three miles of Exeter, whence Iun. 17. he
summoneth Sir John Berkley, with Conditions to himself, his Officers, Citizens,
and Soldiers, who having maintained the Garrison so long and so well, that it
was looked on as the safest place for the Queen to lie in with the most
Illustrious Princess Henrietta Maria, now Duchess of Orleans, as the
Honourablest place for that Princess to continue in during the War, as she did
with the Honorable the Lady Dalkeith: And, as the greatest refuge for
distressed Cavaliers in England, returns this generous Answer; viz. That his
Trust was delivered to him from His Majesty, which he would discharge to his
power; That they have no reason to distrust a blessing from God in delivering
that Garrison, who is able to deliver them, and may be so pleased without a
miracle; the Prince having so considerable a Force at so near a distance to
them; That if all actions of their lives, were as innocent as their hands, of
the blood that has, or shall be spilt in defense of their Righteous Cause,
they shall in all events rest in perfect peace of mind, and will not despair.
At which brave Reply, the General being rather pleased than provoked, makes not
an angry, but a civil and ingenious (though ineffectual) Retortion, and having
raised two Bridges over the River Ex, blocked up the City on all sides, and
drawn up within Musketshot of it, leaves the Siege to Sir Hardress Waller,
going in person against the Prince to the West, till the third of April, when
being distressed beyond all relief, they agreed that Commissioners should
treat, as they did ten days (a long time to the impatient Soldiers, who
complained that they had to do with long-tongued Lawyers) concluding upon the
most honorable Terms ( Fairfax and Cromwell upon some particular policy of
their own, never offered any other;) That the Princess Henrietta should depart
any whither in England or Wales, until His Majesty should give order for her
disposal. 2. Neither the Cathedral nor Churches to be defaced. 3. That the
Garrison should march out according to the most honorable custom of War, and
to have free quarter all the way; and not be compelled to march above ten miles
a day, and with their Arms to the places agreed on. The composition of persons
of quality should not exceed two years purchase. That all persons comprised
within these Articles, should quietly and peacerbly enjoy all their Goods,
debts, and movables, during the space of four months next ensuing; and be
free from all covenants, oaths, and protestations, and have liberty within the
said four months, in case they shall not make their compositions with the
Parliament, and shall be resolved to go beyond Sea (for which they shall have
passes) to dispose their said Goods, debts, and movables allowed by these
Articles, etc.

Articles and a Surrendry so honorable, that they were the Rule and Copy of
all the following good Articles which the Army made; but their masters kept not
perhaps their design in granting so good Conditions in all places surrendered to
them, was to raise themselves a reputation able to give Law to the Parliament,
that should lose its self in breaking of them.

I must not forget three things remarkable concerning this Siege, 1. A strange
providence of God: For when this place was so closely besieged, that only the
South Side thereof toward the Sea was open unto it, incredible number of
Laches were found in that open quarter; for multitude [saith an eye and a
mouth-witness] like the Quails in the Wilderness [though blessed be God] unlike
them both in cause and effect, as not desired with man's destruction, nor sent
with God's anger, as appeared by their safe digestion into wholesome
nourishment: they were as fat as plentiful, so that being sold for twopence a
dozen and under, [the poor who could have no cheaper, as the rich no better
meat] used to make pottage of them, boiling them down therein. Several Natural
causes were assigned hereof, 1. That these Fowl frighted with much shooting on
the Land, retreated to the Seaside for their refuge. 2. That it is familiar
with them in cold Winters [such as that was] to shelter themselves in the most
Southern coasts. 3. That some sort of seed was lately sown in those parts,
which invited them thither for their own repasts; however, says our Author,
the cause of causes was Divine providence, thereby providing a feast for many
poor people, who otherwise had been pinched for provision. 2. The faithfulness
of the place, eminent now for a pair-Royal of extraordinary services to the
Crown When besieged by Perkin Warbeck, in Hen. 7. time. The Western Rebels,
under Edw. 6. Parliament Forces, in King Charles the First's Reign.

Their Spirit and Conduct being admirable in the two first, and their
Allegiance unstained in the last. 3. The peculiar Gift of the Governor, 1. In
Watchfulness, both in looking to his own charge, and in taking advantages of
his enemies. 2. In an obliging address, going as far sometimes with fair
language and good words, as others did with money. 3. In encouraging the
Soldiers labors with his own, managing his command over them the better, by
making himself equal with them. When the English at the Spanish Fleet's
approach in 88, drew their Ships out of Plymouth Haven, Cambden attributes
their success to the Lord Admiral Howard's towing a Cable in his own person,
the least joint of whose exemplary hand drew more than twenty men besides. 4.
By observing as well as commanding them, and orderly preferring them, as well
as observing them, neither disheartning nor exasperating true Valor. 5. By
sharing with his Soldiers in their wants as well as in their other hardships,
indigency is an honor, when it is the chief Commanders condition: Two words to
his Soldiers did a brave Prince good service once in a straight, I am your
fellow-commoner, and your fellow laborer. 6. By understanding well the defects
and failings of the Garrison, as well as its accommodation.

It Is a very remarkable passage, that (when my Lord Fairfax made three
approaches upon three great, though not commonly observed, disadvantages of the
Garrison) he charmed the Council of War to an opinion of a noble surrender with
this Story: A man with an Ulcer on his face, passed over a Bridge, where the
passengers were to pay a certain piece of money for every malady of body found
about them, and was required to pay the accustomed Tribute for the Ulcer in his
face: But he refusing to pay it, the Officer pull's off his hat, intending to
keep it for a pawn; his hat being taken off, another malady appears in his bald
head: Now Sir (said the Officer) I must have a double Tribute of you: Nay,
says the Traveller, that ye shall not, and begins to struggle with the
Officer; who being too strong for him, gave him a foil, by means whereof there
was a Rupture perceived under his coat. The more we strive with these people,
the more we discover our infirmities.

This Trust he managed so well, that the Queens Majesty interposed earnestly
for his preferment in these very expressions in a Letter dated March 13. 1644.
Farewell my Dear Heart: Behold the mark which you desire to have to know when I
desire any thing in earnest*. I pray begin to remember what I spoke to you
concerning Jache Berkley for Master of the Wards. And the King in his
confinement was very earnest for his company, making use of him in all his
transactions with the Parliament and Army, especially in that fatal escape from
Hampton Court, where the Army observing how the King was caressed from all
parts of the Kingdom, buzzed up and down a jealousy among the Kings followers,
that he should be assaslinated, that he might fly out of the place where he
was most secure (being near his friends, the City and Parliament, then well
inclined toward him) to a place where he was most in danger, being far off;
the Faction having forecast, that the King in the perplexity of his affairs
would cast himself, when in danger of his life, upon Col. Hammond [for his
relation to Dr. Hammond his Majesty's beloved Chaplain] for that very purpose
not long before made Governor of the Isle of Wight, as he did in the company
of Sir John Berkley, Col. Io. Ashburnam, and Col. Will. Leg, who smelt the
Plot by the slightness of the Guards, that dark and tempestuous Night, and a
whispering that there was of the King's going to the Isle of Wight in the Army
a Fort-night before, and therefore Sir John was for going to Iersey; especially
when he considered, that most of the Advices given the King to escape,
proceeded from Whaley, and those of the Army, especially the Letter of
Intelligence (which he would take upon his Oath was feigned) mentioned by Sir
W. S. p. 1018. if any where; the Advice being to have staid there, and cast no
fears, jealousies or new disputes, which the Army aimed at, among an already
distracted people. But as God would have it, that his Majesty should not escape
those greatest trials, and most glorious acts of patience he had designed him;
for Hammond, to whom they went with the hazard of their lives, could be wrought
to nothing, but some formal civilities, and yet they being so far gone into the
Net, must be trusted to, though with the King's extraordinary Regret: Sir John
Berkley offering then a desperate attempt for the King's escape at last cast,
though the King refused it, saying, That he would always humble himself to Gods
good pleasure. Nay, which was more, Sir John would have been taken to let the
King escape. Therefore the Parliament so strictly enquired after him, although
his own friends censured him, so interpreting this action by the success, not
considering the numerous difficulties in forming any resolution, nor the
fallacious representation of affairs to him (by those that contrived this whole
Plot, to take the Parliament off from the King by his disturst of them, and
confidence in the Army) but only looked on his improsperous services, according
to the fate of unhappy Counsels, which is, To have that Condemned, which is put
in Execution; and that Practiced as best, which was never Tried.

1. The King was no sooner in the Isle of Wight, than the Faction let loose
their fury upon the Gentlemen that attended him, commanding Hammond to send
them up to London to be proceeded against; which he refused, pretending, First,
The just offense thereby given the King in removing his only Friends and
Familiars, then his honor engaged, as he said, for their Indemnity: The King
himself likewise Interposing, that if those Gentlemen were taken away, and
punished as evil doers, for counselling him not not to go out of the kingdom,
but rather to come to the place where he now is, for the ends aforesaid, and
for their endeavors accordingly to attend him thither, he cannot but expect to
be dealt with accordingly, his case being the same. Sir John escaping the
danger of this fatal piece of service, addressed himself to more, in the way of
Intelligence and Correspondence between the King and the West, between the West
and the North, and between all these Parts and France (where the Queen kept up
the King her husband's Reputation, and promoted his Interest) until being
forced from the King, he and Colonel Walter Slingsby, were secured Anno 1648.
at Colonel Trevanions house in Cornwall, and underwent all the sad effects of
the Tyrannies acted here for twelve years together, without any other comfort,
than some opportunities of serving his Sacred Majesty with better Intention
than Success, using means, and leaving events to God; being resolved to win the
Roman Consul's Elogy, who was commended for not despairing of the Commonwealth;
his spirit being above his own Fortune, and his Enemies too; who indeed had put
an end to the War, yet could not find the way to Peace; their souls being
unequal to their victory, and not able to temper their success, but turning
those arts and arms wherewith they had prevailed against their Sovereign [so
true is that of Seneca, Scelera dissident] against one another, until they
ruined themselves, as well as his Majesty, and made way for that settlement
which they had overthrown, wherein this Noble Person had as large a share of
his Majesty's favors in England and Ireland, when restored, as he had of his
afflictions, when banish^ed; as had his elder Brother Sir Charles Berkley, Lord
Fitz-harding, not short of him in Integrity and Loyalty, though not so much
engaged in Action. They say, that though busling times are best for the Writer,
yet quiet times are best for the Liver; so though stirring men afford more
matter of discourse to Authors, yet calm spirits and peaceable men yield most
matter of peace and satisfaction to themselves; the deep waters are still too:
lighter passions have a loud voice, but the greatest are usually silent, and
actions of a lesser dimension have a great mention, while noble and great
actions, exceeding Historians expressions, exercise their modesty. The inward
Wheels that set the Engine on work, are less observed, though of more
consequence, than those parts that move most visible.

He that made Interests, kept Correspondence, engaged Parties, sent and
procured Supplies, disposed of Commissions, managed the Designs for the
Restoration of his Majesty, though the most secret, yet was the most effectual
Instrument of the great mercy vouchsafed to this Nation. Such as this
honorable person was, who (when more than 50000 Englishmen were corrupted by
the arts and success of the Faction, and their own covetousness, weakness, and
ambition to a partnership in their guilt) in the midst of the cruelties and
victories of the Conspiracy, that amazed most part of Mankind, taught the
unskillful the method of Confederacy and Design, and in spite of the vigilant,
because fearful Parricides, opened opportunities, both of Correspondence with
his Majesty, and with all true-hearted Englishmen, who communicated Counsels,
gave mutual Encouragements, raised Supplies, and kindled Flames that might have
devoured the Juncto, had it not pleased God, that he and Sir Henry Slingsby
should be taken, and so forced to exchange his Services for Sufferings, from
Prison to Sequestration, from Sequestration to Prison, from thence to
Decimation. For as in the Primitive times, when any Calamity happened, the
Heathens cried, Christiani ad Leones; so when the least toy took the Christians
frighted out of their senses, in the head, they cried, Secure the Cavaliers,
Secure the Cavaliers, and that so long, until (as the sufferings of the Martyrs
converted the world, so the generously born afflictions of Loyalty reduced the
kingdom) it became necessary for them to secure the whole Nation, who as one
man, as acted by one common Genius, like the spirits of the world, wrought its
way into that settlement by a general consent, which could not be attained to
by any particular combination; in which settlement, this excellent Person not
only enjoyed a freedom from his pressures, but a reward for them, being made
upon the King's Return Comptroller of the Household, one of his Majesty's most
Honorable Privy Council, Treasurer of the Household, Governor of in Ireland,
and of great trust about his Highness the Duke of York; in which capacities he
looks not to what he might do, but what he should, measuring his actions by
justice and expedience: If any person would know more of him, let him make his
Address to him, and he shall find him Courteous; let him Petition him, and he
shall find him extraordinarily Charitable; let him go to his Table, and he
shall find him Hospitable; let him Converse with him, and he shall find him
Exact and Punctual: In a word, a perfect Country Gentleman at Court, one whose
very nature is in pay and service to his Majesty, gaining him by his Civilities
more Hearts, than either Laws or Armies can gain Subjects. Every time my Lord
Fitz-harding smiles, the King of England gains one. The Roman Lady, when asked
where her Jewels were? brought out her Children, and answered, These are my
Treasures. This honorable Person, if demanded where are his Services, besides
those in his own person, formerly in times of war, and now in times of peace;
particularly his good husbandry for his Majesty, his faithfulness, his place,
and the obligingness of his behavior, he can show his Sons, and say, These are
my Services; of whom, besides Sir Maurice Berkley Vice President of the
foresaid Province in Ireland, two lately lost their lives with as much honor as
they enjoyed them, viz.

FIRST THE EARL OF FALMOUTH.
AS Treason taints the blood, so Loyalty ennobleth it; the one deriving honor
as effectually, as the other does guilt. This personage inherited his Fathers
Services as well as his Spirit, being an early confessor of Allegiance, and
taught to suffer with Majesty, as soon as to live; he had the advantage of most
other Gentlemen, that he begun, and spent some years of discretion in the
experience of troubles, and exercise of patience, wherein all virtues moral and
political, are commonly better planted to a thriving, as Trees set in Winter,
than in the warmth, and serenity of times, or amidst those delights which
usually attend Princes Courts, in the midst of peace and plenty; which are
prone either to root up all plants of true virtue and honor, or to be contented
only with some leaves and withering formalities of them, without any real
fruits, such as tend to the public good; for which Gentlemen should always
remember they are born, and by providence designed. Besides the intimacy of
converse between his Sacred Majesty (the most condescending Prince in the
world) and him in their tender years, for which King Edward 6. loved
Fitz-patriche so well, as to have some thoughts of marrying him to his Sister,
and advancing him to the kingdom; besides the sympathy of their spirits,
visible in the exact symmetry of their persons, which indeared Charles Brandon
Duke of Suffolk so much to Hen. 8. that he was the only person that lived and
dyed in the full Favor of that Prince: Of whom it is observed, That they who
were highest in his Favor, had their Heads nearest danger. There were these
remarkable things that recommended this young Gentleman to his Majesty's Favor.

1. His Happiness of Address, much advantaged by the Eminency of his Person,
the Smoothness of his Voice, the Sweetness of his Temper, and the Neatness of
his Fancy. True is that observation of a great Statesman, if a man mark it
well, it is in praise and commendation of men, as it is in gettings and gains:
For the Proverb is true, That light gains, makes heavy purses; for light gains
come thick, whereas great come now and then: So it is true, that small matters
win great commendation, because they are continually in use and in note;
whereas the occasion of any great virtue comes but on Festivals; therefore it
does much add to a man's Reputation, and is [as Queen Isabella said] like
perpetual Letters Commendatory to have good forms. And therefore, besides
several other Messages of Consequence, he had the Management of a Complement of
very great consequence to the French King; for his Conduct in which, he was not
only nobly presented by that Prince, but highly valued by his own Sovereign.

2. His Integrity and Faithfulness in performing Trusts and keeping Secrets,
whereof several instances of Importance in Holland, France and Flanders,
qualities that capacitated him not only for the service, but the friendship of
his Master; who with the wisest Princes in the world, considering the natural
distance between them and their Subjects, deny them the common comforts of
intimate friends and familiars, raise some tried persons to the intimacy of
companions (under the name with us of Favorites, among the Romans of
Participes Curarum) in whose Breasts they may lay their Heads, and in whose
Bosoms they may ease their griefs, joys, fears, hopes, suspicions, counsels,
and whatsoever lies upon them, and would otherwise eat the Heart, to oppress
it in a civil kind of shrift or confession. Friendship calming the Affections
from storm and tempest, and clearing the Understanding out of darkness and
confusion of thoughts; for whosoever has his Mind fraught with many thoughts,
his Wits and Understanding do clarify and break up in the communicating and
discoursing with another, though he be not able to discourse again; so much is
gained by tossing the thoughts more easily, by marshalling them more orderly,
and seeing how they look when they are clothed with words, that whets, that
cuts not. It Is my Lord Bacons opinion, That a man had better relate himself to
a Statue or Picture, than to suffer his thoughts to perplex himself.

3. Activity and Dispatch. The Spartans loved four sorts of Statesmen. 1. They
that performed business reservedly, to prevent noise. 2. Effectually, avoiding
after-claps. 3. Sweetly and oblgingly, raising no discontents. And 4. Quickly,
affecting not delays.

4. And all this wrapped in a good Nature, that made it its business to oblige
others to his Master, as much as he was obliged himself. Some Druggs are very
wholesome, but very bitter; good in the Operation, but unkind in the Palate:
And some persons are very useful in their services, but so morose in their
expressions of them, that Masters are afraid of their duties. This honorable
person was as affable to others, as he found his Master was to him; his
performances being not like Pills that must be wrapped in something else before
they could be swallowed, but the candor and sereness of his disposition made
his employment as amiable as it was serviceable. He [all sweetness, all Balsom,
healing and helping] translated into English the Roman Character, Neminem
unquam demisit tristem.

But neither did he esteem these happy qualities of his Person, nor the former
instances of his Service, any way answering the great favors of his Sovereign,
without some new attempt, as much beyond common performances, as his
obligations were beyond common kindnesses. It was not enough to discharge his
several Trusts faithfully, to wear his Honor and his Grandieur becommingly,
Manage Affairs usefully, to accommoda^e all Interests prudently; these are too
common returns of favor.

When the same Royal person was to adventure himself to secure our happiness,
who was himself a great part of it, when his Highness the Duke of York was
resolved to hazard that dear life for his Brother and his Country, that he had
ventured for other Princes and mere Honor, when all the hopes and concernments
of the Nation were wrapped up in the Admiral, and the Engagement, neither the
entreaties of his Friends, nor the tears of his Spouse, beseeching him by the
Pledges of his Love, one in her Arms, the other in her Womb, could diswade him
(though in no command, save as he said, the Commissions of Allegiance and
Gratitude) from attending that brave Prince in his dangers, that he had waited
on in affliction; to whose quarrel every true Englishman owed a life, it being
the three Nations Engagement, and to whose family he owed Estate, Honor, and
every thing he had to loose but a life, they being the effects of Royal bounty,
when he knew he had the prayers of three Nations along with him while he lived
with his Highness, and their sorrows if he should have dyed with him. Whom he
had the honor to divertise with his Ingenuity, to assist with his Counsel, and
as it were to redeem, with his Death, (Those several Noblemen with his
Highness, being like the several king like persons, about Richard III. to amuse
fate, and receive those dreadful Shots aimed at him in their own persons.) A
death he would have undergone ten times over to save that life that was worth
three kingdoms, which since the Heroic Duke would not save alone by
withdrawing, he should not loose alone in Fight: but as the kindest Wifes in
Aethiopia will needs be buried with their Husbands alive; so his dearest
friends would needs perish with him; congratulating their new honors for this
reason, that they might [like the Sacrifice that is first crowned and then
offered] fall more Nobly and becoming a Princes companions and their blood,
though it might dash, might not stain their Royal Master.

June the 2. 1665 (coming to wait on the Duke, with his Sovereigns love in the
one hand, and his own life in the other, but a little before the Fight] he fell
with two honorable persons, one on the one hand, and another on the other, so
near the Duke that his Brains dashed on his Clothes: The brave Prince no doubt
reflecting on his friend, as Sir Francis Drake did on his, when he said, Ah
Dear -- I could grieve for thee, but is is no time to let down my spirits. And
(the proper bemoaning of a friends death in War, being to revenge it) resolving
to appease his Ghost with Opdams blood, who attended him immediately to the
other world, with all those terrors about him, that shall destroy this to have
Victory bleeding by him; a Prince in the same danger with him, a Sovereign
bemoaning him, none envying, all pitying, is a happy way of dying, that all
men may wish, few men obtain: When Sejanus lived so much in the Emperors
favor, as that they two were reckoned and termed friends (the Emperor writing
to Sejanus thus in a Letter Haec pro amicitia non occultavi) the whole Senate
dedicated an Altar to the Goddess Friendship. When a person shall be so happy,
as to enjoy his Princes favor; so grateful, as to be ambitious of dangers to
deserve it; so innocent, as not to wrong the meanest person by it [being great
only, that he might be able to be good] yet so unhappy, as to dye the very
beginning of it.

It is very fit we should Erect a Tomb to Friendship, with this Inscription, P.
M. S.

Sir EDWARD BERKLEY.
WE read Genesis 30. 11. the Leah said, A Troop comes, and she called the name
of the Child, Gad. When I have spied out but a Berkley in the Catalogue, either
of Loyal Commanders, or Compounders: I find a great throng following, for
besides another Sir Henry Berkley (as we suppose) of whom we have this Note

Sir Henry Berkley per William Cradock 0300 00 00

Sir Edward Berkley that honest Gentleman, that was neither Sued, nor did Sue
in his life, so willing he was to live in private peace, and thence it is
easily guessed how unwilling he was to engage in public quarrels, until he saw
there was no hope of any tolerable Peace, but from the success of a just War.

A Farmer rented a Grange, generally reported to be haunted by Fairies; and
paid a shrewd Rent for the same at each half years end. Now a Gentleman asked
him how he durst be so hardy as to live in the house, and whether no spirits
troubled him. Truth (said the Farmer) there be two Saints in Heaven vex me
worse than all the Devils in Hell, namely, the Virgin Mary, and Michael the
Archangel, on which days he paid his Rent. This was none of Sir Edwards
Tenants, who were so kindly treated, that he would not receive his Rents, until
he had seen what his Tenants had got; and when he took them, he would choose
rather to take them in work which his Tenants could do, or in commodities which
they had to sell, then in moneys; which he knewthey could not spare, and he did
not want.

Now those poor people that he used so tenderly himself, he was loath should be
oppressed by others, and that the estates they had got under him, should be a
Prey to those who aimed at a Tyranny over the Nation, from which he knew no way
to secure them but to stand by his Prince, in whose just authority was lodged
the estates and liberties of all his Subjects; and there was not a more
effectual way to secure poor people in their enjoyments, than to support that
Sovereignty that had the care of all their interests, and would not permit
others to wrong them, as he could keep them from usurping upon him.

He did not fight (indeed it could not be expected from his years, of which he
would say, That though he could not lift up a hand against the Rebels in the
Field, yet he would lift up both for his Majesty in his Closet. He would
assault Heaven, and besiege the Throne of Grace) but he Contributed; he handled
not Steel, but he laid out Silver and Gold; and what was more, gave
Intelligence. It was Scipio Affricanus his great honor, he condescended to
serve under his younger Brother: it was this Gentleman's remarkable character
that what he could not do himself, he assisted his meaner Relations to do as
long as he lived, and bequeathed to them his Loyalty and Estate when he died
165... Aetatis 64.

After a Composition for 0784 l. 00 00

Leaving behind him the character of a good husband, being, as he would say,
never reconciled to his Wife, because never at distance with her; a good
Father, intending the education more than the pleasing of his Children, by the
same token, that he was very careful what Schoolmasters settled near him; the
Jews not more mischievously poisoning Springs in England, formerly, as they
were charged, than Schoolmasters mis-principling Youth, the Wellhead of a
Nations hope, as they were complained of. A good Churchman abhorring the
laziness of those, that as Cicero said, never see the Sun either rising or
setting; and the Indevotion of those that come neither at the beginning of
Prayer, nor have the patience to stay till the end, himself professing that the
most concerning part of Divine Service, is the Concession and Absolution that
commenceth it, and the Blessing that concludes it. A good friend, choice in his
acquaintance, firm to his friendship, clear and plain in his dealing, free in
his erogations, studious in contriving ways to do good, A liberal man, that
devised liberal things: In fine

A good man whom Nero hated. Sir WILLIAM BERKLEY.
PHilip de Commines tells us of a Noble Family in Flandert, that generally
they lost their lives in the Service of their Prince: And we find in our own
Chronicles, that Edmund Duke of Somerset lost his life in the first battle of
Saint Albans, Duke Henry following him, taken in the battle of Hexan, and so
beheaded: a second Duke Edmund, and the Lord John of Somerset, going the same
way in the battle of Teuxbury, all of them fighing in the behalf of King Henry,
and the House of Lancaster; but then they heaped not Funeral upon Funeral, in
so short a time as this honorable Family did; in which respect, as those of the
House of Somerset exceeded the House of Flanders, so the House of the Berkleys
exceeded the House of Somerset; the Earl of Falmouth, the elder Brother, Keeper
of his Majesty's Privy Purse, and Captain of his Highness Regiment of Gaurds,
fell the first year of our war with the Dutch. Sir William Berkley (the younger
Brother) Governor of Portsmouth, and Vice Admiral of the White in the last
years Expedition, in the second; one sad messenger following another with
disconsolate ^idings, that as waves following waves had swallowed up that good
Family; parallel to that which the Historian calls the Mourning Family in
Italy, did not the same consideration buoy up them that supported the other,
that these hopeful Personages died in that service for which they were born [
Patriae geniti, and toti nati mundo] the honor of their Sovereign, and the good
of their Country. Nature that made one industry was to make all these Brothers
Heirs: One of the younger Brothers gives, as the Heralds observe, a Martlet for
the difference of his Arms; a Bird observed to build either in Castles,
Steeples, or Ships, showing, says our Author, that the Bearer thereof, being
to cut out his own fortune, must seek by War, Learning, or Merchandise to
advance his estate.

This Gentleman being Bound to a Merchant [trade has raised many families, and
restored more, and Apprentiship does neither extinguish native Gentility, nor
disinable to acquisitive) is presumed to have behaved himself as a good
Servant, because that was the way to be a happy Master; for we learn to command
by obeying, and to know what we should exact from others, by what we have
performed our selves; besides, a great Fortune, like great Buildings, must have
low and humble Foundations.

When the Dutch Encroachments allowed our Merchants no more Trade than they
tought for, Master Berkley, as willingly served the King to vindicate and
recover Trade, as he had done his Master to understand it. What was
extravagancy in the young Merchant, becomes courage and resolution in the
Seamen and Soldiers; war and public affairs exercising that spirit that was
too big for soft peace, and private business. He was content to go first a
Volunteer, to observe the Conduct and Discipline of others; and after evident
trials of his personal valor, to set out as Captain, to exercise his own;
though yet not taking notice so much, that he was advanced by his Princes
favor to be a Captain over his men, as that he was in his Service a
Fellow-souldier with them. The Conqueror, when he first Landed his Forces in
this Nation, burnt all his Ships, that despair to return might make his men the
more valiant. Younger Brothers (they are the words of an ingenious Author)
being cut off at home from all hopes, are more zealous to purchase an honorable
support abroad; their small arteries with great spirits have wrought miracles,
and their resolution has driven success before it. When the Orator was asked,
What was that that made an Orator successful? He answered, Action. What next?
Action. What next again? Action. Wonderful like (says the Lord Verulam) is the
case of boldness in Sea-affairs: What first? Boldness. What second and third?
Boldness. Though he never tempted dangers, yet he never avoided them, witness
the Streights Expedition, wherein, though expectation commonly out-doeth
ordinary performances, yet he out-did expectation its self; resolving not to
Yield, even when it was impossible to Overcome; and when Stiffled rather than
Mastered, he might have had Quarter with more honor, than his enemies could
give it; yet Antaeus like, taking courage from his misfortunes, his courage
whetted with anger and revenge, not only fills up the great breach made in the
Ship, by the loss of an excellent Commander, but managed it too with such a
present courage, as not only out-faced danger, but even commanded and
disciplined it too, scattering a new vigor upon his new Command, here then on
this, on that side his examples; quickening his authority so, that his very
Conqueror became his Prize, when he had men enough left to master the Ship, and
yet not enough without some more assistance to Man it, winning on the enemy,
even when he seemed to have lost himself.

Great was the value others put on the Prizes now, and at other times taken by
him; greater the esteem he had of the actions themselves, which at Court
deserved a Knighthood, an Honor (that by an overvalue of themselves make some
fearful of those services that gained them that value) yet raised rather than
abated his resolution; as well remembering the custom which is used at the
Creation of some Knights, wherein the Kings Master-Cook comes forth, and
presents his great Knife to the new made Knights, admonishing them to be
faithful and valiant, otherwise he threatens them, that that very Knife is
prepared to cut off their Spurs. And in the Fleet gained a Vice-Admirals
Command, a power the greater it was, the more careful he was not to abuse it,
managing his authority at Sea, as if [what Sea-Captains seldom do] he should
give an account of it at Land. None so wary in Council, none so bold in
Execution. Valor in acting does well in him that is under the direction of
others, prudence in advising becomes him who is to guide; the ones excellency
lying in not seeing dangers, the others in seeing them. His goodness sweetened
his greatness, and the best metal and blade is that which bends; and his
industry and patience set off his goodness, pains having knit the joints of his
Soul, and made them more solid and compacted, and his piety both of them,
seeing so much of God in the deep, he saw the proper reason of that common
Proverb, He that cannot pray, let him go to Sea. And understanding himself so
well, that he was none of those Seamen, who [as if their hearts were made of
those Rocks they Sail by] are so always in death, that they never think of it.

Most young men, when advanced, are transported with the Footboys fancy in
Huartus, that thought himself a Monarch, and the Doctor in Acosta that
apprehended himself King and Pope: so apt is height to turn the brain. This
Gentleman was of the Nobleman in Laurentius his temper, that though otherwise
very sensible, yet was persuaded that he was Glass: so much affected was he
with the consideration of his frailty and mortality. In all his great actions,
you might spy in his looks that he had a Monitor like the Emperors Boy
following him with a Memento te esse mortalem.

In this capacity he rides in the Fleet under the command of Prince Rupert and
the Duke of Albemarle; when June 2. 1665. the Engagement between the Dutch and
the English began, wherein his place was ordered toward the Rear, though his
spirit made to the Front, had Discipline endured it; in reference to which, he
thought it greater service to submit to the command of Superiors, than to be
forward in the Engagement with his Enemies; lest otherwise he might be served
as the French Soldier was in Scotland about a hundred year ago, who first
mounted the Bulwark of a Fort besieged, whereupon ensued the gaining of the
Fort: But Marshal de Thermes the French General first Knighted him, and then
hanged him within an hour after, because he had done it without command. The
evil example out-weighed the good service. The posture was so unhappy, that he,
as well as Sir George Ascue his Admiral, were parted from the Fleet first, and
afterward from one another. [ Castor and Pollux asunder, betokened ill luck to
the Seamen,] and misfortunes following each other as waves do; Sir William was
divided from himself, some of his Officers not thinking fit to obey what he
thought fit to command, and their performances were like to succeed, when
neither would follow, and both could not handsomely go abreast. In this
condition he resolved his Valor should make amends for his misfortune, and
though he was unhappy, he would not be unworthy too, he had rather die ten
times than once survive his Credit. The sweetness of life being not able to
make him swallow down the bitterness of disgrace: He attempted a probability of
success, with a certainty of his own danger, not without reason, when the
ignominy of a quarter from the Enemy he had to deal with, was more intolerable
than the pains of a death; of which a Seaman thinks, that as it is far hotter
under the Tropic in the coming to the Line, than under the Line it self: so
the fear and fancy in preparing for death, is more terrible than death it self.
Berkley against the whole Fleet himself a Navy, yet carrying nothing about him
impenetrable but his mind. About six a clock he was shot in at his throat with
a Musket-bullet, and out at his back; whereof indeed he fell, but would not
die, until the Enemy over-powering his men (each of whom inspired by his
example now, as by his command before, was a Berkley: [the Sun setting, each
little star appears] and had, like him, the art of incountring, but not of
escaping) took the Ship, not till two hours after his fall; when his brave Soul
scorning to be a prisoner to the Dutch and to his own body too, left him just
as the Enemies came and took him. He never spoke after this unhappy shot, but
his look did; which from his eye dispersed as much valor as he did before with
his hand, fresh Orders issuing still from his aspect; which a man looked on,
and vowed either a brave revenge, or as brave a death; either what the dying
Captain aimed at, Victory, or what he enjoyed, Honor.

The Ship (the Swiftsure) with so many men and Guns, and so good a sailer as
she was of the second Rate, was a great prize to the Hollanders, but this
person a greater, though dead; the Honorable Carcass being of so great a value
(and if the Cabinet was so rich, what was the Jewel?) that the States paid for
it the old value of a Province, and thought to demand for it the liberty of a
whole Fleet of prisoners. Great was the respect they gave him, in their care to
embalm and lay him in State in the great Church at the Hague [proud it seems of
their enemy] where as many came to see him now dead, as feared him before; the
throng now standing before his corpse but tremblingly, as before they did before
his person. Greater was the Honor of their Reasons for that respect, viz. [to
use their own words] For the Dignity of his Person, the Greatness of his
Command, and the Renown of his Valor and Conduct. Greatest of all was the
esteem they seemed to have of him, when they thought him a present fit to
oblige His Majesty of Great Britain (at that time when they were most to seek
for some effectual way of addressing themselves to him in order to an
accommodation) as they sent him, Aug. 23. 1666.
with Honor enough certainly, since Sir William Berkley's Body was the
greatest Present the High and Mighty States could send, and the only kindness
the most Puissant and Sacred Majesty of the King of Great Britain would at
that time accept at their hands.

TO enbalm him then were vain, when spreading Fame
Supplies the want of Spices, where the name
Its self preserving, may for Ointment pass,
And he, still seen, lie coffined as in glass.
While thus his Bud's full Flower, and his sole
Beginning does reproach another whole,
Coming so perfect up, that there must needs
Have been found out new Titles for new Deeds;
Though Youth and Laws forbid, which will not let
Statues be raised, or he stand Brazen, yet
Our minds retain this Royalty of Kings,
Not to be bound to time, but Judge of things,
And worship as they merit; there we do
Place him at height, and he stands Golden too.
Sir HENRY BERKLEY.
THis Gentleman was well known for his Ancient and Honorable Family, his good
Education, his great Observations and Experience, his famous Hospitality, his
rich and happy Tenants and Dependants, whereof he carried 500 to the Kings
side; the orderly Government of his Family, where, as it is said of Theodosius,
his Court-Votaries themselves might learn Discipline; the exemplariness of his
Devotion, honoring God as sincerely, as God had graciously honored him; the
plainness of his temper, his word being parchment, and his very yea, an
obligation; the humility of spirit, which made him like a fixed Star, the
higher he was, the less he seemed; his Zeal for the Church, both as Patriot,
Patron, and Parishioner; his word was, All the service I can do, I will do for
Gods Church; for all the comfort I look for, I hope for in Gods Church; his
serviceableness in the Country in all public Capacity that found him out,
deciding an hundred controversies at a cheaper rate in his Hall, than one is
ended at Westminster; keep up he did indeed the Authority of the Law, Order,
and good Government, but cavils and brawls he discountenanced; that reputation
that was the result of all these Virtues, enabled him to do so much toward the
assistance of his Dread Sovereign, now cheated of all the Supports and
Ornaments of Government, but those Subjects hearts, who when the King had
yielded all that in reason could be expected from him, ventured Lives and
Fortunes, rather than he should do as Hampden said, when he was asked what they
would have the King do more, answered, Throw himself and all his concernments
upon our good affections. In good time! Kings are entrusted by the great
Governor of the World in a way of deputation, and by the Inhabitants of the
World in a way of consent, with the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of all their
Subjects: and those Kings shall entrust themselves and all their charge back
again with the worst of those Subjects, as with Sir John Stowel, Sir Ralph
Hopton, and the Lord Pawlet, to help the Marquess of Hertford to the first Army
that was able to face potent and successful Rebellion, and clear Somersetshire
and Dorset-shire of it; until the Loyal Party was besieged in Sherburne many
weeks; in which time (to borrow the words of their own Historian May) Many
Sallies were made out of that Garrison, and sharp Encounters performed with
great courage; the Parliament side, so he calls the Faction, being in firm
hope to have taken them at last; which was conceived a thing of great moment,
and advantage to their affairs, if they could have possessed the persons of so
many men considerable both in their Persons and Valor, and who (mark it)
proved afterward very strong and cruel Enemies; yet (says he) that hope was
frustrate: for about the beginning of October they all escaped out of
Sherburne: The Earl nevertheless pursued after them, and in the chase took Mr.
Pallart, Sir Henry, Sir John, and Sir Charles Berkley, Prisoners; and in them,
as they imagined, the strength of the Kings Cause in those parts.

The good old Gentleman Sir Henry being neither consined in his affections, nor
yet disabled in his Estate, attends that Cause with considerable supplies,
that he could not wait on in person, 1. With that zeal Amilcar made his son
Hannibal swear at thirteen, to be an irreconcilable enemy of Rome, engaging
all his sons to a constant service against the Conspiracy, upon the blessing of
a father, obliging them to serve the Father of their Country; usually saying,
That in vain did they look for an Estate from him, unless they could be
protected in that Estate by the King and the Laws. There was nothing more usual
since the faction raised tumults, and reduced and listed those tumults into
Armies, to force the King to that which they despaired with reason to convince
him of, but they endeavored to cant most of his Subjects out of their Loyalty;
and against that artifice, it was observable what advantage His Majesty had on
his side: for whereas the combination was forced to fly to the shifts of some
pretended fears, and wild fundamentals of State, with the impertinent as well
as dangerous allegation of self-defence, since they who should have been
Subjects, were manifestly the first assaulters of the King and the Laws, first
by unsuppressed tumults, and then by listed Forces. His Loyal Subjects had the
Word of God, the Laws of the Land, together with their own Oaths, requiring
obedience to the Kings just Command; but to none other under heaven, without or
against him, in the point of raising arms. And those that would not be juggled
out of their duty, they endeavored to disgrace out of a capacity of an
effectual performance of it, by a bold and notorious falsehood, viz. That there
was not one godly man with the King, and, as God would have it, most of the
eminent men in this County for his Majesty, were in as much repute with the
people before the war for their piety (by the same token, that notwithstanding
the partiality and the popular heats, wherewith the elections to that
Parliament 1640. were carried in many places, most of them were Members of that
Parliament) as they were after in disgrace with the Rabble for their Loyalty:
For to avoid a scandal upon the Kings government, and the individious
consequences of maintaining too stiffly, even a just Liberty upon the Lords
day. We find Orders drawn up, and sent in a Petition to the Kings Majesty, by
John Harrington Esquire. Custos Rotulorum, to be delivered by the Earl of Pembroke,
Lord Lieutenant of that County. To the first of which we find subscribed,
George Sydenam, Knight. Henry Berkley, Knight. And to the second.

John Lord Pawlet. John Stawell.

Ralph Hopton. Francis Doddington.

As severe, though not so fantastical in that point, as the very Precisians
themselves; for these are their words.

May it please your Majesty to grant us some particular Declaration against
unlawful Assemblies of Church-Ales, Clearks-Ales, and Bid-Ales, and other
intolerable disorders, to the great contempt of Authority, and to uphold civil
feasting between neighbor and neighbor in their houses, and the orderly and
seasonable use of manly exercises and activities, which we shall be most ready
to maintain, an even moderation between prophanness and nicety, between a
licentiousness to do any thing, and a liberty to do nothing at all.

In which temper, after unsufferable Imprisonments, rude Robberies (called
after the Germane Mode, Plunder, from planum facere, to level or plane all to
nothing, or pluming) unheard of Sequestrations, and at last, with much ado, a
Composition (or paying (as we do sometimes Highway-men) for his own estate)
which besides the vast charge he was at, to have the favor of that Oppression,
amounted to 1275 l. 00 00

For this is Recorded, Sir Henry Berkley of Tarlington in Sommersetshire. 1275

He died Anno Christi 165... Aetatis 7... Tyrannidis 4.

Being buried not without hope of his own, and his causes resurrection.

Hic Decios Agnosce tuos magnae aemula Romae,
Aut Prior hac, aut te his Scotia major adhuc.
Unus Turma fuit Barclaius, copia solus,
Una cum natis Agminis Instar erat.
Sir WILLIAM BERKLEY.
TO all these, I could add Sir William Berkley, whose Man was Governor of
Virginia in the late times (when Princes were forced to go a Foot, and Servants
Ride on Horseback) and he himself in these, when there have been made such
orders for the improvement of the Plantation, as are inferior only to the rules
given him for the first erection of it, which yet were none of the strictest;
for otherwise, as Infants must be swathed not laced, so young Plantations will
never grow, if straightened with as hard Laws as settled Commonwealths, though
they proved the most effectual: those people giving no reason for that bitter,
rather than false jest, spoken of one of our late Western Plantations
(consisting most of dissolute people, Christian Savages among the Pagan
Negroes) That it was very like unto England, as being spit out of the very
Mouth of it.

This Gentleman aiming at two things, that may do much good, and that is, 1.
Justice in Dealings, witness the brave Edicts made at a Convention there 1662.
That their dealings among the Negroes there, may be as naked as their going. 2.
A Sober Religion [that may bless the Christians there, and convert the Heathens
in one; of whom it is more to overcome Paganism, than to master an 100 Pagans]
witness the very reasonable Proposals, made both for the supporting and
propagating of Religion in that Country; for the maintenance of their
Ministers, and the discipline of their Church, to the Right Reverend Father in
God Gilbert then Lord Bishop of London, and since Lord Archbishop of
Canterbury, who encouraged the prudential part of their design, in a way of
great encouragement to the present generation, and of great blessing to
posterity.

Sir EDWARD BERKLEY.
ANd from him it were pity to part his inseparable companion in Loyalty and
Sufferings, Sir Edward Berkley, that living confutation of Machiavell (who
thought religion spoiled a generous person, as bad as a Shower of Rain does his
Plume of Feathers on a rainy day) being at once most pious, and most gallant,
of as much humble devotion, as generous and daring valor; as meek toward God
as he was brave toward an enemy; very well known for the hardness of his body,
and more honored for the generosity of his mind. First he learned to follow
others, and afterward to command himself, being so much the more happy in his
providence forward, as had he gone farther in his experience backward; being as
knowing himself, as he was happy in commanding others that were so. Extremely
careful of his first enterprises, knowing that a Commanders reputation once
raised, will keep its self up; like a round body, some force is required to set
it up, though when it is up, it will move its self. Three things he abhorred in
his followers. 1. Scoffing at Religion, a sin unusual, never a civil Nation in
the world being guilty of it. 2. Useless: for either the scoffer believes what
he scoffs at, and so he puts a great affront upon his conscience, or he does
not, and then its in vain to cry down that Religion with raillery, that is
supported so much by demonstration. And 3. Debauchery: being of Gustavus
Adolphus, that true Soldier, as well as great Kings, temper, Who when he first
entered Germany, and perceived how many women followed his Camp, some being
Wives, for which they wanted nothing but Marriage; others Laundresses, though
defiling more than they washed. At a Passage over a River, ordered the Bridge
to be taken down, that these feminine impediments might not follow as soon as
his Soldiers were over. Whereupon they made such pannick shreeks as seized the
Soldiers hearts on the other side the River, who vowed not to stir a foot,
except with these their Baggage; which the King was forced to wink at for the
present, smiling out his anger, and permitting now what he might, and did amend
afterward.

But greatest Piety, the best Cause, the strictest Discipline, the most
faithful Service may miscarry in this world, where we are sure no person can
discern either the love or the hatred of the great Governor of the world, by
any thing that is under the Sun. For he saw prosperous Villainy trampling on
unhappy Allegiance, the best King lying down under the stroke of the worst
Executioner; and himself forced to compound for his estate with those very
Rebels he now scorned, and formerly defied, overcome in all things but his
mind. For the note runs thus in that Record, which we are bound to forgive, but
History will not forget.

Sir Edward Berkley of Pull. Some. 0770 l. 00 00

In the primitive times, like these I write of, made up of suffering, when the
surviving Christians endeavored to preserve the memory of their Martyrs for
imitation, and those few that escaped persecution, advanced the honor of
Confessors for their encouragement; they had books called Dyptychs, because
filled on both sides with holy Names; on the one side, of those that died in
the great cause; on the other side, of those that suffered for it, being hardly
thought by that wicked world worthy to live, and yet not so happy as to be
suffered to dye.

I am sensible I could fill this Volume with those eminent Assertors of
Loyalty, that are still alive of this Family to serve the Sovereign they
suffered for, and the great Martyrs of it that sealed their Allegiance with
their blood: but foreseeing a fair opportunity elsewhere to do them the utmost
right I am able, that is, to give the world a faithful Narrative of their
exemplary virtues, which though they may often times tempt to the liberty of a
Panegyric, yet they still persuade, to as strict an observance of truth, as is
due to an History. For that Pen expresses good men most elegantly, that
draws their lives most faithfully.

In the mean time: Let the very names of these worthy persons be Histories,
their very mention carry with it a Chronicle.

Sir MAVRICE BERKLEK.
ALthough (as my Lord Bacon observes, De Augmentatione Scientiarum, l. 2. c.
13.) Nature has planted in all men fear, twisted together with the principles
of self-preservation, as the great instrument of it; and wariness, as the great
effect of fear. Although all things, as he says, be, if we should look into
them, full of Panick fear; nay, though retiredness added to caution,
studiousness to retiredness, simplicity and innocence of behavior added to
studiousness, might have excused this Gentleman from the noise, and much more
from the sufferings of the late times; yet the bare unhappiness of thinking
Rationally, of wishing Loyally, of relieving Charitably, of endeavoring to
keep the peace of his Country Prudently, cost him at Goldsmith-Hall, where lay
The Treasures of wickedness, One thousand three hundred seventy two pounds
deep, besides the several inroads made upon his Estate and Lands by the
Garrison of Glooester, to which he would not Contribute freely, he was forced
to submit patiently. And according to the method intimated in the Holy History,
that what the Catterpillar left, the Canker-worm destroyed; what Gloucester
left, Essex his Army swallowed; and what escaped them, Sequestration seized.

RICHARD BERKLEY, Esquire
THE elegant variety of beings in the world, does not more naturally conduce to
the service of the world, than the admirable diversity of men's gifts and
abilities does serve the necessities of those times, and places to which they
are appointed. The former Gentleman was so studious, that he might have been
served as Vlrick Fugger was (chief of the whole Family of the Fuggers in
Auspurgh) who was disinherited of a great Patrimony only for his studiousness,
and expensiveness in buying costly M. SS. and yet his very thoughts and
meditations served his Majesty, giving great satisfaction to those that
doubted, and as great directions and countenance to those that managed that
Cause, which he called, The Supporting of the government of the world.

This worthy personage was so active, that he would say often, That the
greatest trouble to him was, that he could not think; and yet as corrected
Quicksilver is very useful, so his reduced quickness became very serviceable
to balance that of the Gloucester Officers, who were at once the most
indefatigable at home, and the most troublesome abroad of any in England, and
never so well met with, as by the vigilance of this person, who would not be
surprised, and his industry that could not be quiet.

An un-experienced Sailer would think Ballast unnecessary, and Sails dangerous
to a Ship; and ordinary men judge so staid a man as Sir Maurice useless, and so
nimble a man as this Esquire, not safe in great trust, while wise men look on
an even lay of both as the best temper: but as some full word cannot be
delivered of all that notion and sense with which it is pregnant, without
variety of expressions; so this great spirit cannot be understood or made out,
without the large Paraphrase of such a multitude of excellent Instances, as
this place and method will not permit. Only according to the Spanish Proverb,
Yr a la soga, con el Calderin, Where goes the Buckle, there goes the Rope:
When his Master Set, it was Night with him; and when his Majesty laid down his
life, he was put to lay down for his livelihood, 0526 l. 00 00 As another of
his name did 0020 00 00 though yet all these three had wherewithal to promote
any Loyal Design that was offered, and to relieve any Cavalier that wanted,
(their Houses being the common Sanctuaries for distressed Loyalty) whom they
would see employed in a way suitable to their respective abilities, and
subservient to the public design; not enduring that their houses should be
Hospitals, or downright begging, a good Subjects calling. A Husbandman
pretended, and made out his relation to Robert Groasthead Bishop of Lincoln,
and thereupon was an humble Suitor to him for an Office about him: Cousin,
[saith the Bishop to him] If your Cart be broken, I Will mend it; if your Plough
old, I will give you a new one: But an Husbandman I found you, and an
Husbandman I Will leave you.

Neither must we omit Sir ROWLAND BERKLEY, of Cotheridge in the County of
Worcester,
OF whom, when he was pitched upon to manage a part of the Worcester
Association, we may say, as Puterculus did of another, Non quaerendus erat quem
eligerent, sed eligendus quis eminebat; being a steady man, that looked not at
few things, but saw through the whole Systheme of Designs, and comprehended all
the Aspects and Circumstances of it; putting Affairs, notwithstanding that they
ran sometimes against his Biass, by some rubs of unusual impediments, into an
easy and smooth course; using never one counsel any more than the Lord H.
would one Stratagem twice: being (it is Hannibal's character inverted)
excellent at using, keeping, and improving Advantages, as the foregoing
Gentleman was at gaining them: And never coming on the Stage to act any Part
but what he was so much Master of, as to come off with applause, as one that
understood as well his own defects as abilities. Upon all occasions of the
Kings Armies withdrawing from those parts, he kept all places in such
subjection to his Majesty, that at their return they found all things so well,
that they wondered to see themselves there when elsewhere; a constant awe and
love keeping those coasts loyal.

-- But it was so,
As clocks once set in motion, do yet go,
The hand being absent; or, as when the quill
Cease to strike, the string yet trembles still.
So grave and reserved a man might have escaped, but that the serious
combination measuring other people by themselves, looked on those men as most
dangerous that were most sober: His Estate indeed being so great, that it was
malignant too; and as once a merry servant of his said (and by the way, his
Service was such Preferment, and a Relation to him so much more than Wages from
others, that he had as many ingenious Gentlemen to wait upon him for his
divertisement, as others of his quality had meaner people for their service;)
If they could find nothing else against him, surely they would sequester him
for Original sin: At which, and his other vexations, being but a prisoner at
large all the while, he was resolved not to be at leisure to seem sorrowful,
that he might be the more serviceable; for though as the Tortoise keeps in his
shell all the winter, so he retired in the sharpness of the late times; yet he
had all occurrences waiting upon him, when he seemed not to take any notice of
them. One asked a grave Matron, how her Maids came by so good Husbands, when
they seldom went abroad? O, said she, good Husbands come home to them.

That Text of Solomon, Fear God and the King, and meddle not with them that are
given to change, cost him, they said, three thousand four hundred sixty odd
pounds, blessing God for the benefits he hoped the Kings good Subjects should
receive from their bitter usage, which might prove wholesome Physic, God
sanctifying the malice of enemies [the Serpents poison may be used as an
Antidote] to do the office of a friend: And supplying loyalty as freely as he
had paid for it; usually concluding his honest Discourses among friends, with
these two sayings: Nothing undoeth us but security; and We may well spare our
superfluities, to serve the Kings necessities. To conclude, a man this so happy
in his Invention, that in all his Loyal and Worthy Designs he was never at a
loss, but so projected all his courses, that a second began commonly where the
first failed, and he would fetch strength from that which succeeded not. A
great observer of common occurrences, the result of which enabled him to
Advise; and a religious one of extraordinary, especially, wonderful
emergencies; for he thought, that the ordinary course of things declared the
glory of God. The artificial mixture of them, was an instance of the art of God
and Men, managing the subtle engine of the Universe. The alteration of them,
as in a miracle, did discover the will of God, but the disturbance of nature,
as in Prodigies, proclaimed approaching judgments; which made him serious,
though not ensnared to those two credulous, and superstitious Principles, Fear
and Ignorance, which usually manage and deprave men's conclusions and affections.

Sir GEORGE BERKLEY.
IT is reported, that in the last battle against the Turks for the defense of
Christendom, there was such a slaughter of the French Gentry (engaged in that
war, upon the French Kings motion to them one day in his Palace, that it was
fitter they should appear in Arms against the enemies of Christendom, than in
their Silks and Feathers among their Ladies) that there was hardly throughout
all France a Family of quality that was not in Mourning.

Its certain, that in the late, and we hope the last, controversy between the
Government and the Faction, there fell such a share of the public calamities
upon this Name (involved therein by their own Consciences, that permitted them
not to sit down and enjoy their own Estates at home, while the State and Church
were in so much danger abroad) that I find but one person of any eminency (and
that is Alderman Berkley of London) of the name that suffered not, sooner or
later, on the Kings side. For not to mention Francis Berkley of London
Gentleman, who no doubt might answer, as the mannerly Gentleman did King James,
when he asked him, what Kin he was to such a Lord of his Name? Said, Please
your Majesty, my elder Brother is his Cousien Germane: And might be owned, as
once a Howard was by an honorable person of the name, under whom he was
impressed; his Father interceding for his release, the Lord asked for his name,
and when he replied, that his name was Howard (Said, That his Cousien Howards
Son should not be a Foot-souldier; adding, we are not all born to be rich,
though we are born to be great. This Gentleman, for his great happiness in
conveighing Intelligence from London to Oxford, traveling under the notions of
a Pedlar and Surgeon, for forming Combination here for his Majesty, under
the color of Trade; for securing and relieving his Majesty's friends, for
being one of them, that with Master John Fountain and others at London, who
when they were demanded what they would be pleased to lend for the carrying on
of the war? Answered, That it was against the Petition of Right to answer, Yea
or Nay (whereupon Master Fountain was by the House committed to the Gate House,
declaring, forsooth, against his judgment, lest it should draw on others to the
like honest error) for endeavoring to publish every where the Kings Papers and
Declarations, to disabuse his Majesty's good Subjects. He was sixteen times
Imprisoned, thrice Plundered, twice Banished, and glad to Compound for the poor
remainder of his Estate, five hundred sixty two pounds four shillings and two
pence. Nor Thomas Berkley of Worcester Gentleman, one of those happy men that
are only to be found in England, living in the temperate Zone, between
Greatness and Want ( France and Italy, being in this case like a False Dye,
which has no points between Sink and Ace, Nobility and Peasantry) who deserved
so well of his Majesty in his Person, in his Relation, and in his Estate, that
he was forced, besides several irregular sums extorted from him, to lay down
for his Loyalty in the Corban of the conspiracy Goldsmiths-hall, four hundred
twenty six pounds fifteen shillings and six pence: A sum that deserves a
mention; for we are resolved none shall be denied admittance to the Temple of
Honor, who has been at so great a charge to go through the Temple of Virtue.
Nor Edmund Berkley of Hereford shire, the man that they said, wore Tinn in his
Buttons, and Silver in his Pocket; who would say to those that frequented his
hospitable Table, that he took care his meat should be good in its self, and
better by the welcome to it, who would not contribute to the Rebellion,
saying, His Purse should not bleed by every Mountebanks hand: And adding, that
he saw the King twice, prayed for him always, and did not see any reason to
fight against him, caring not whom he displeased, so he pleased his own
Conscience; he went far, and his credit in taking up necessaries for the Kings
occasions, farther; in so much, that those whose eyes were evil on him, because
his heart was good toward his Sovereign, besides the trouble they put him to,
raised from him first or last eleven hundred and odd pounds, as an atonement
for his Duty, and maintenance of their Treason. When they would needs raise the
Country about him to take arms, and so neglect their husbandry and business, he
put them in mind of the story in Plutarch (l. de virtutibus mulier:) A King
having discovered rich Mines in his Kingdom, employed all his people in digging
of them, whence tilling was wholly neglected, insomuch, that a great famine
insued. His Queen sensible of the calamities of the Country, invited the King
her husband to dinner, as he came home hungry from overseeing his Workmen in
the Mine. She so contrived it, that the bread and meat were most artificially
made of gold, and the King was much delighted with the conceit thereof, till at
last he called for real meat, to satisfy his more than imaginary hunger. Nay
(said the Queen, if you employ all your Subjects in your Mines, you must expect
to feed upon gold, for nothing else can your kingdom afford.)

Nor Francis Berkley Gentleman, the Roscius of his time for imitation, being
able to personate any man to the life, as to make any part become him, whereby
he had a great advantage to disguise himself to serve his Majesty, as
effectually as others did themselves to fight against him; he being, as King
James said to Sir Henry Wotton (who had adventured to him to Scotland from the
Duke of Tuscany disguised, with a Message about some Councils at Rome that
concerned his life) upon his address to him, when he came to the Crown of
England, The honestest hypocrite, and dissembling actor in the world. He could
out-act others at any time, but in one instance he out-acted himself; for
putting on the vizard of an ingenuous poor man, he insinuated himself into the
service of a Nothern Postmaster, as dexterously as he had done himself to a
Southern Committee; in which capacity he had a peculiar faculty of opening and
sealing letters, and imitating any hand without being discovered. An honest
sleight of hand, that got the Kings party at times, as he reckoned, four
thousand pounds, and twenty considerable advantages against the enemy in those
parts, who thought that was conjuring, which was only dexterity; crying out
that they were bewitched, when they were only outwitted. For these services he
had the applause of his friends, and for others of less consequence, but more
notoriety, he lost a third part of his estate, amounting to 900 l. to those
people to whom his Master lost three kingdoms, giving the rest to pious uses,
upon a sad accident that befell him, or not so much him, as his Pistol, which
being laid on a Table, by chance went off and killed a Gentlewoman; whereupon,
O the difference of diverse men in the tenderness of their consciences! some are
scarce touched with a wound, whilst others are wounded with a touch therein,
he was so troubled, though it was done so much against his will, that it was
without his knowledge, that, as his estate came in as long as he lived, he
posted in his blew Wast-coat with a round sum to his Ghostly Father, being in
pain till it was piously disposed, and taking the good course to make his own
Eyes his Overseers, and his own Hands Executors, that as he had been by
accident the occasion of the death of one person, he might be by choice an
instrument of giving a comfortable living to many.

I say, not to mention these and many more inferior persons of this Loyal name,
that with young David, were ambitious of engaging in that cause with integrity,
wherein the elder branches were involved with honor, the meanest of them
carrying the Spaniards Motto, That they would be Slaves to None, and Subject
only to their own Prince; being of an innocent temper, and an independent
condition, the two felicities that concur in the making of a brave spirit,
that need not ask leave to be honest.

Sir George Berkley, than whom few that lived so many pious, lived withal so
many sad days, having his life equally divided between his own and the Nations
calamities, in which (being too serious and thoughtful a man to preserve his
safety with the price of his conscience, and being better able to suffer than
to fear) he was engaged first in his Vote and Suffrage, as one that dared to
stand to his reason against his interest, more tender of the least trouble in
his breast and conscience, than concerned in the greatest Tumults in the Street
and City. Next, in his Withdrawing, leaving the House when the House forgot,
and left that for which they were called together, designing to discountenance
those practices with his absence, that he could not restrain by his presence;
and after that in his contributions, supporting that Cause in the Field with
his estate, that he had in vain endeavored to have kept up in the Councils by
his argument. He was able to maintain it with his purse, when he could not with
his advice; and when he had opportunity with his personal service, both in
raising men to serve his Majesty by reputation, and in disposing them
advantageously by his prudence: He commanded but a little of the Army he was
in, but all the Country he was of; having been a good Patriot, though not
pretending to be a good Soldier; the greatest service he could do the King,
was by the exemplariness of his conversation, which those of his own side might
imitate, as they of the other side did envy, looking upon a godly Cavalier as a
dangerous person; who confuted their slanders, and out-did in reality as much
as they could pretend to, having the best way of honoring the King by fearing
God, and being of opinion that they could not be faithful Subjects to the one,
that were not conscientious Servants to the other; being so serious, that he
was seldom seen to laugh, an observation made of his Savior; and so solid,
that he did as seldom dream, a remarkable note in the character of Bishop Lake.

There is Village (called Charleton) in Leichestershire, where the Inhabitants
could not pronounce; there was a great Scholar in Cambridge (Master Mede It was
Demosthenes his case about the letter P. Mr. Mede could not for his life
pronounce Carolus Rex Britannicae. saying, that he made up that in hearty
prayers, that he wante^ in plain prenunciation.
by name) whose great abilities durst not adventure on; and another in the same
University, who in a long Oration used not one R: Now the letter R is called
the dogged and snarling letter. This person could not endure a base and
unworthy expression of the worst-deserving of all the adversaries, because,
though it became them well to hear ill, yet it did not become the other side to
speak so; it being below a good cause to be defended by evil speaking, which
might anger, but not convince; and discover the ill spirit of the party that
managed the cause, instead of keeping up the merit of the cause that was
managed.

He was sad all his time, but grew melancholy in the latter end of it
(conscience speaking than loudest, when men are able to speak least, and all
sores paining most near night) (when he was not of Edward the II. mind, who
looked upon all those as enemies to his Person, who reproved his Vices; but of
Henry V. who favored those most; when in years, and a King, that dealt most
freely with him when young and a Prince.) A melancholy that was rather serious
than sad, rather consideration than a grief; and his preparation for death,
rather than his disease leading to it; wherein his losses were his greatest
satisfaction, and his sufferings his most considerable comfort. Being
infinitely pleased with two things, King Charles the Martyrs rational and
heroic management of his Cause and Sufferings, and the Peoples being more in
love with him and his cause since it miscarried, than when it prevailed^ an
argument he thought that it was reason and not power, something that convinced
the conscience, and not something that men's estates or persons, that was both
the ornament and the strength of the Kings side; the reason he cheerfully paid
three thousand five hundred and forty pounds for his Allegiance, as he had
cheerfully kept to it; the only two instances of his life that pleased him. If
any body demand, how he could suffer so much as he did at last, and do as much
as he did at first; and how he could lay out so much to pious uses, whom it had
cost so dear to be a good subject? The Spanish Proverb must satisfy him; That
which comes from above, let no man question. Though indeed he was so innocent
in that age, that he could not be rich; and of the same temper and equal
fortune with Judge Cateline (that Judge in Queen Elizabeth's time, that had a
fancy full of prejudice against any man that writ his name with an alias, and
took exception against one on this very account, saying, That no honest man had
a double name, or came in with an alias. And the party asked him (as Cambden
tells the story in his Remains) What exception his Lordship could take against
Jesus Christ, alias Jesus of Nazareth.) A kinsman of whom having a cause in the
King's Bench, where he had been Lord Chief Justice, was told by the then Lord
Chief Justice, That his kinsman was his predecessor in that Court, and a great
Lawyer. And answered by the Gentleman thus, My Lord, he was a very honest man,
for he left a small estate.

There is one more of this name, Sir George Berkley too, who as it was his
policy, that in all discourses and debates he desired to speak last, because he
might have the advantage to sum up all the preceding discouses, discover their
failures, and leave the impression of his own upon the Auditory. So it shall be
his place to be the last in this short mention; in reference to whom,
remembering the old saying, Praestat nulla, quam pauca dicere de Carthagine.
Being not able to say much, I will not say little of him, this Gentleman's
virtue forbidding a short and lame account of him: as severely as Johannes
Passeravicius Morositis in Thuanus (a good conceited Poet, and strangely
conceited Latin Professor in Paris.
man) allowed not under the great curse, that his Hearse should be burdened with
bad funeral verses.

Sir George Berkley of Benton in the County of Sommerset 450 l. 00 00 With 60
l. per annum settled.

Only it will not be amiss to insert an honorable Person in this place, who
though he appeared not with his Majesty so openly at first, yet acted cordially
and suffered patiently for him to the last, I mean the Right Honorable,

GEORGE Lord BERKLEY. Baron of Berkley, Mowgray, and Seagrave.
ONe of those honest persons, that though ashamed of the Kings usage in London,
were sorry for the necessity of his removal out of it, which left the City
liable to the impostures and practices, and his friends there obnoxious to the
fallacies and violences of a Faction, that had all along abused, and now awed
the Kings liege people, that could not before, by reason of their pretenses,
discern what was right, nor now by reason of their power, own it. This noble
person did not think it advisable to go from Westminster, because his estate
lay near the City, yet he served the King there, because his inclination
(especially when he was disabused) was for Oxford. He was of his Majesty's
opinion at the first Sitting of the Long Parliament, that to comply with the
Parliament in some reasonable and moderate demands, was the way to prevent them
from running into any immoderate and unreasonable. The stream that is yielded
to run smoothly, if it be stopped, it fometh and rages; but his honest nature
being deceived in the confidence he had in others, whom he measured by himself
(that is, the advantage the cunning man has over the honest) pitied their
unreasonableness, rather than repented of his own charity and hope; and ever
after went along with them in accommodations for peace, but by no means
concurred in any preparations for war; insomuch, that when he despaired of
reason from the Houses, he was contented to deal with the particular Members of
them, being willing to hearken to Master Waller, and some others Proposal,
about letting in the King to the City, by an Army to be raised there, according
to the Commissions brought to Town by the Lady Aubigney, when he could not open
his way by the arguments used by him and others in the Convention. Being a
plain and honest man, the factious papers and discourses took not with him,
they were so forced, dark, canting and wrested. The Kings Declaration being
embraced, and as far as he durst, published and communicated by him, because
clear, rational and honest. He might possibly sit so long at Westminster as to
be suspected and blamed for adhering to the Rebellion, but he was really with
the Earls of Suffolk, Lincoln, Middlesex; the Lords Willoughby, Hunsdon and
Maynard, impeached at Westminster of High Treason, in the name of the Commons
of England, for levying war against the King, Parliament and Kingdom. It may be
thought a fault, that he vouchsafed the Juncto his company, when they debated
any overtures of peace; but it was his commendation that he retired, when the
Earl of Essex was Voted General, the King, the Bishops and Delinquents lands
seized on, the New Seal made, the War prosecuted, etc. And appeared only to
balance the Faction in such times as he might hope, either to bring things to
some composure, or keep them from confusion; offering expedients, and
protesting against extravagancies, especially in the two cases of declaring
those that endeavored the Restitution of the Kings Majesty 1647, 1648.
Traitors, and in the Vote That the Earl of Warwick should fight the Prince.
These passages cost him a long Imprisonment under the Black-Rod, Sequestration
from the House, and what he bewailed more, an utter incapacity of serving his
Majesty, which he was very much afraid of ever since they had suffered the new
model of the Army, the greatest error since the first of raising it: For ever
after he lived to bewail the mischiefs of a Civil War, but not to see any hope
of remedy. Most Children are notified by their Parents, yet some Fathers are
made eminent by their Children, as Simon of Cyrene is known by this Character,
the Father of Alexander and Rufus; and this honorable person by this happy
Remarque, that he was Father to the Right Honorable George Lord Berkley, who
has been as bountiful to the Church of England, and its suffering Members of
late (witness Doctor Pearson, Doctor Fuller, etc.) as his Honorable Ancestors
were to the same Church and its devout Members formerly; when there were twelve
Abbeys of their erection, which enjoyed twenty eight Knights-fees of their
donation: That Noble Family now, as well as then, deserving to wear an Abbots
Mitre for the Crest of their Arms, so loving they have been always to the
Clergy, and so ready to build them Synagogues, and endow them, not only with
worthy maintenance, but with eminent Incumbents, such whose gifts the Church
wanted more than they its Incomes: Honest men in the worst of times, finding
him their Patron; and ingenious men in the best of times, enjoying him at once
their encouragement; and their example, being happy to a great degree in that
ingenuity himself, that he does so much promote in others. May there never want
Worthy Men, that may deserve such a Noble Patron; and may Noble Persons never
be wanting, that may encourage such Worthy Men.

To conclude this honorable Name, whose Elogies grow upon our affectionate
Pens, well may this faithful Family fill their Coat (that was Originally, as is
conceived, a plain, and therefore noble Cheveren) with ten Crosses Patle Or: As
well in memory of their faithful service in the last Just War here at home, as
for the memorial of their Ancestors Achievements in the old Holy War in
Palestine (where Harding the Progenitor relieved the Christians at Ioppa
against the Turks, with as much resolution and integrity, as they did the
Protestants here against those which were so much worse than Infidels, as they
pretended to be better than Christians) or their patronage of afflicted virtue
and goodness, in that which some called peace, but was indeed a solitude and
devastation in England: For but observe this remarkable passage, I know not [it
is a Paragraph of the Church Historian] which more to admire [speaking of John
Trevisa's Translation] his ability that he could, his courage that he durst, or
his industry that he did perform so difficult and dangerous a task, having no
other Commission than the command of his Patron Thomas Lord Berkley; which Lord
(as the said Trevisa observes) had the Apocalypse in Latin and French (then
generally understood by the better sort) as well as English, written on the
Roof and Walls of his Chapel at Berkley, and which not long since (viz. Anno
1622.) so remained, as not much defaced. Whereby we may observe, that midnight
being past, some early Risers, even then began to strike fire and enlighten
themselves from the Scriptures.

It may seem a miracle, that the Bishops being thus busy in persecuting Gods
Servants, and Trevisa so obnoxious to them for this Translation, that he lived
and died without any molestation. Yet other of his Speeches, That he had read
how Christ had sent Apostles and Priests into the world, but never any Monks or
begging Friars. But whether it was out of respect to his own aged gravity, or
respect to his Patrons greatness, he died full of honor, quiet, and age;
blessing the noble Family (as Ockam said to Frederick Duke of Saxony) with his
works, and the good they did in the world, as it protected him with its power
in the good it did to him.

THE Life and Death OF Mr. JOHN DOD.
AFTER so many honorable persons that could do so much for his Majesty, here is
a Reverend Person that could suffer for him; one that was not over-fond of the
Government when it prospered, but faithful to it when it suffered, declaring as
zealously against the scandalous Rebellion of the Puritans, as he had done for
their pretended Religion, the Nonconformist Cavalier. One that bewailed his
own scruples, and persuaded all men to have a care of them. Insomuch, as that
when Bishop Brownrigge in his younger days went to him for his advice, he
wished him, and other hopeful men, not to ensnare themselves into uselesseness.

In the midst of troublesome times, he quietly withdrew himself to heaven. He
was born at Shotledge in Cheshire (the youngest of seventeen Children) bred in
Westchester, and Jesus College in Cambridge. At a Disputation at one
Commencement he was so facetiously solid (wild, yet sweet fruits which the
stock brought forth before grafted with grace) that Oxford-men there present,
courted him home with them, and would have planted him in their University,
save that he declined it.

He was a Passive Nonconformist, not loving any one the worse for difference
in judgment about Ceremonies, the better for their unity of affections in Grace
and Goodness: He used to retrench some hot spirits when envying against
Bishops, telling them how God under that government had given a mavelous
increase to the Gospel, and that godly men might comfortably comport therewith,
under which Learning and Religion had so manifest an improvement. He was a good
Decalogist, and to his dying day (how roughly soever used) stuck to his own
judgment, of what he had written on the fifth Commandment, of obedience to
lawful Authority.

Some riotous Gentlemen, casually coming to the Table of Sir Anthony Cope in
Hanwell, were half-starved in the midst of a Feast, because refraining from
Swearing (meat and drink to them) in the presence of Master Dod; of these, one
after dinner ingeniously professed, that he thought it had been impossible for
himself to forbear Oaths so long a time. Here at Mr. Dod (the stame of whose
zeal turned all accidents into fuel) fell into a pertinent and seasonable
discourse (as more better at occasionals) of what power men have more than they
know of themselves to refrain from sin, and how active Gods restraining grace
would be in us to bridle us from wickedness, were we not wanting to our selves.

Being stricken in years, he used to compare himself to Sampson when his hair
was cut off. I rise, says he, in the morning as Sampson did, and think, I will
go out as at other times, Go, Watch, Walk, Work, Study, Ride, as when a young
man; but alas! he quickly found an alteration, and so do I, who must stoop to
age, which has clip't my hair, and taken my strength away.

Being at Holdenby, and invited by an honorable Person to see that stately
house, built by Sir Christopher Hatton (the Masterpiece of English
Architecture in that age) he desired to be excused, and to sit still, looking
on a flower which he had in his hand. In this flower (says he) I can see more
of God, than in all the beautiful buildings in the word. And at this day, as
his flower is long since withered, that magnificent pile (that fair flower of
art) is altogether blasted and destroyed.

It is reported, he was but coursly used by the Soldiers, who (they say)
plundered him of his Linen and Household Stuff, (though as some tell me) if so
disposed, he might have redeemed all for a very small matter. However the good
man still remembered his old Maxim, Sanctified afflictions are good promotions.
And I have been credibly informed, that when the Soldiers brought down his
Sheets out of the Chamber, into the Room where Mr. Dod sat by the fireside, he
(in their absence to search after more) took one pair, and clapped them under his
Cushion whereon he sat, much pleasing himself after their departure that he had
(as he said) Plundered the Plunderers, and by a lawful felony saved so much of
his own to himself.

This good man, whom Nature made a witty, Industry a learned, and Grace a godly
Divine, was first wrought to a seriousness, by a false charge upon him by the
College Bowcer, that ^e owed for some of his Pupils Quarteridge, what he had
truly paid; a charge that put him to a Fever (and with the consideration of
that passage Romans 7. the Law is spiritual, and I am carnal, sold under sin; and
that (as he said) he neither did, nor knew how to pray) brought him to a sense
of his sin and state, and after much humiliation, to a comfortable adherence to
God in the Lord Jesus, according to the sure mercies of the Covenant of grace:
And when his ways pleased the Lord, this adversary desired to be admitted to
peace with him, recollecting the payment of the money, and proving ever after
the most faithful friend he had in all the College. And afterward improved to
an Eminence, by assisting Dr. Fulke, Dr. Whitacre, and Mr. Chadderton in an
Analysis and Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and other the hardest
portions of Scripture; and after a nonplus in his first Sermon at St. Mary's,
by tying himself to Words and Phrases, by observing this Method, viz.

I. Analizing his Text, and observing, 1. The Author. 2. The occasion. 3. The
Coherence. 4. The Scope, Design and Circumstances; which he said was a great
help to avoid confusion, to prevent impertinence, and to remedy the weakness of
capacity and memory in Preachers and Hearers, provided the division of the
words were according to his direction. 1. Agreeable to the main drift of the
words. 2. Into but three or four parts at the most. 3. Yet taking in the whole
Text. 4. And that so, that each part may depend upon, be linked to another. 5.
Avoiding subdivisions. And 6. Expressing the parts more or less in clear and
popular terms.

II. Opening it with these rules. 1. That there is but one litteral sense of
the Scripture. 2. That if there were no peculiarity in the Phrase, a short
Paraphrase was best. 3. That the Text is to be first accurately divided, and
then clearly explicated. 4. That the Doctrine should be raised from each head
as it was explained. And that either, 1. Grammatically, by either having
recourse to the Originals, or observing the Synonimous expressions: Or, 2.
Rhetorical, by reducing improper expressions to a proper signification: Or 3.
Logical, by distinguishing doubtful expressions, and defining the obscure. And
all, 1. With a respect to the Analogy of faith in the Lords Prayer, the
Decalogue, the Apostles Creed, and the Doctrine of the Sacraments. 2. Reduceing
each observation to a certain head or common place of Divinity. 3. Keeping to
the primary scope and mind of the spirit in the place. 4. Comparing spiritual
things with spiritual, and one place of Scripture with another, like or unlike
it; but always the more obscure by the more perspicuous. 5. Keeping an eye upon
the context and the circumstances thereof. And taking in 6. The consentient
Interpretation of the Catholic Church, and the most eminent men that were
acquainted with Gods will in it, seldom perplexing the people with variety of
Expositions of the same Text.

III. Drawing out the several Doctrines of the Text, either directly from the
express words of the Text, or indirectly, 1. From the Coherence. 2. The
Occasion. 3. The Principal Scope. 4. The Form. 5. The Order. 6. The Connection.
7. The Variety of the words signification. 8. The Matter, whether
Ecclesiastical, Aeconomical, or Political. 9. The Similitute, Gal. 4. 12. 10.
From Allegorical Proportions which are to be used. 1. Soberly and sparingly. 2.
Not far fetched, but proper. 3. Briefly. 4. Rather for the reforming of the
life, than the proving of any Article of Faith. 5. And after the genuine sense
of the word be first sincerely given. 11. From the Circumstance of Time,
Person, Place. 12. From Examples wherein it must be observed.

1. That Examples are in their kinds, Rules, 1 Cor. 10. 11. Romans 4. 18, 23. 2.
That whatever good men did as Christians, or Saints, we are bound to do. 3.
That whatever they did, as endued with a special calling or a peculiar gift,
all persons called to the same calling, and blessed with the same gift, are
bound to do. 4. That whatever good men did ordinarily, must be imitated
ordinarily, and what upon especial occasions must be followed upon those
special occasions.
IV. Handling the Doctrines so drawn out. 1. By way of probation; and that,

1. By testimonies of Scripture and other Authors; in reference to which he
practiced these Rules: 1. Each Doctrine was grounded on two Scripture
testimonies at least, which he opened and applied. 2. Each Quotation was well
studied. 3. And produced in the Scripture phrase, and therefore read out of the
Bible. 4. Choice, and clear. 5. One out of the Old Testament, another out of
the New, seldom out of the Apocrypha, unless for institution of manners. 6.
With a Preface, showing the end of each Quotation. 7. The Quotation of Fathers,
Philosophers, Schoolmen, Historians, was choice and sparing, only when there
might be such an Emphasis in the place, as might touch and work upon the
conscience, by reasons which he urged (not in respect of the matter to be
proved, for that stood firm enough upon Gods testimony, but of the Auditors
weakness, whose faith was to be established) some concluding, others only
illustrating, all grounded on the Scripture, and applied distinctly to the
respective members of the Doctrine.


V. How artificially would he intimate his Observations in his Expositions! How
orderly would he dispose of them according to the respective Members of his
Divisions! How pithily would he dispatch his less principal Points; which he
showed his people he observed, but could not handle; discoursing his more
Principal ones in the order he raised them, and dispatching one before he
meddled with the other! How solidly, pithily, and prudently, he deduced his
Proposition (waving all vain, tedious, or controverted subjects) in clear
Scripture-expression! How sweetly would he paraphrase, and insinuate them to
the Auditors! How seasonably would he insist upon the Points most agreeable to
the present time and place! Being thus furnished, this excellent Person first
bestowed his pains weekly among the good People of Ely; then, upon his great
success there, he was recommended by Mr. Chadderton (who kept an Office as it
were for the supply of Patrons, Schools, and other places with hopeful young
men) to Mr. Cope, afterward Sir Anthony, at Hanwell in Oxfordshire; and after
twenty years continuance there (where, upon his seven first Sermons, he was
with the joint consent of Bishop, Patron, and People, legally established)
preaching constantly every Lords day in the morning, catechizing in the
afternoon, keeping hospitality Sundays and Wednesdays, giving himself much to
fasting and prayer; and upon his Father-in-law Greenham's advice to him (when
he went to complain of the opposition he met with) viz. Queting for it 1 Pet 1.
7. (...) which he c^nceived to signify affliction that tries says; saying,
that the word especially should be rendered exploratorum rather th^^ explora^^,
Son, Son, when affliction lies heavy, sin lies light; a saying Mr. Dod made
use of to his dying day, professing that it did him a great deal of good,
bearing afflictions patiently; being wont to say, that sanctified afflictions
are great promotions. He removed to Fenny-Compton in Warwickshire; and thence,
upon some discontent between him and Bishop Neal, to Cannons-Ashbie in
Northamptonshire, where he obliged most of the Gentry of that greatest County
of Gentlemen in England; and thence he was invited by Mr. Richard Knightley to
Tansley in the same County, where his Hospitality and Charity grew so with his
Estate, that there was not a poor body left in his Neighborhood, he having set
them all in a way to live.

A Father (who shall pass nameless) is censured by some for his over-curiosity
in his conceit, rather than Comment, Matthew. 5. 2. And he opened his mouth, and
taught them; for Christ (says he) taught them often when he opened not his
mouth, by his example, miracles, etc. Here I am sure, according to Mr. Dod,
when his mouth was shut (prohibited preaching) instructed almost as much as
before, by his holy demeanor, and pious discourse. A good Chimist, who could
extract Gold out of other men's lead; and how loose soever the promises of other
men's discourse, piety was always his natural and unforced conclusion inferred
thereupon. He had much employment in comforting such as were wounded in their
spirits; being sent for not only nigh at home, but also into remote Countries.

There was a Gentlewoman who had a great worldly Estate, and a loving Husband,
but she was so sadly assaulted with tentations, that she often attempted to
make away her self. Mr. Dod was sent for to come to her, and the Lord so
blessed his Counsels, Exhortations, and Prayers, that she did not only recover
out of her anguish of spirit, but she was afterward taken notice of for her
singular piety; and the Lord so ordered, that this affliction was not only the
means of her conversion, but also of her Husbands; so that both of them were a
great mercy in the Country where they lived, promoting Religion according to
their power, and entertaining and cherishing godly people: She lived diverse
years quieted in her heart, and being rich in good works; and when she lay on
her deathbed, Mr. Dod was sent for to her again, who spoke of Heaven, and to
fit her for that Glory: She told him, that she felt the comforts of God, and
that she could as hardly at that time forbear singing, as formerly in
childbearing she could forbear crying; and shortly after she died.

There was a Gentleman related to a Noble Family, so perplexed in his mind,
that he has been known in hard frosts to go barefooted, that the pain of his
feet might divert his thoughts. Master Dod was sent for to him, who was his
spiritual Physician to heal him.

He always expected troubles, and prepared himself for them; and put this
difference between the affliction for which we are provided, and others; that
the one are but blows on the harness, but the other are blows on the flesh.

Upon a time when an affliction was upon him, which went to his very heart, and
in the expectation whereof he wept; yet when he saw that it was the will of God
that it should be so, he said to one whom he loved, I will go and bless God,
for I believe this shall be for my good.

He gave himself much to fasting and prayer; and when he fasted, his custom
was to abstain from the dinner of the day before, to the supper of the day
after, his diseases being mostly Fevers; in one of which, when his Physician
Dr. Oxenbridge said to him, Well, now I have hope of your recovery; he
answered, You think to comfort me by this, but you make my heart sad; it is, as
you should tell one who had been sore weather-beaten on the Sea, and conceiving
that he was arrived at the Haven where his soul longed to be, that he must come
back again to be tossed with new winds and waves. In his greater health and
prosperity, he would speak how he desired to be dissolved: Upon a time a
Gentleman blamed him for it; saying, He liked not servants who would have their
wages before they had done their work; But he seemed to be constant in this
desire, alleging these reasons among others, That God had given him a settled
assurance of Heaven, and a sight of the excellency of Heaven; and that the
Earth was but a prison, and Heaven the Palace; and there was perfect holiness
and happiness.

He took all occasions to do good when he was in company, by godly speeches
seasoning those which came to him, that unless it were their own fault, they
might be the better for him.

Being invited to a great Feast, where there were sundry Gentlemen, and some of
them began to swear, he stopped them by discoursing of the greatness of that sin;
and that he might not burden their memories, he quoted three Chapters, every
one was the first; as, the first of Zachary, the first of Matthew, and the
first of James; and he opened those Scriptures in such sort, that they were all
hushed, and did not again offend in that kind while he was present amongst them.

The Word of God was his great delight, his meditation was of it in the night,
and his discourse in the day. When those that were with him were speaking of
earthly things, he would find out some way to bring in Heavenly. When he could
not sleep in the night, he would say, That the meditation of the Word was
sweeter to him than sleep. When he had preached twice on the Sabbath, and was a
weary, yet to those that came to him, he would go on afresh in holy Discourses;
and the comforts which he found in his soul, made him sometimes forget his
body, that he has been speaking till he was ready to faint.

His eminency was in frequency, aptness, freeness, and largeness of godly
discourse; in which respect it may be said of him, that in the Country where
he lived, none were known who therein were equal to him. But he was, Mi cans
inter omnes, velut inter ignes luna minores.

He was very merciful himself, and to move Parents that were rich to mercy, he
would say thus: You are caring and contriving to lay up for your children; but
lay up for your selves a good foundation against the time to come, being rich
in good works; you will lay up treasure in the earth, which is an unsafe place,
lay up treasure in Heaven, that is the sure and safe place.

Master Throgmorton, an approved good man, dying the same year of a
Consumption, came to Asby, not far from Tansley, to have the help of Master
Dod's comforts and counsels; he was oppressed with melancholy, and a little
before he gave up his soul to Christ, What can ye say of him that is going out
of the world, and can find no comfort? To whom he answered, What will you say
of our Savior Christ, who when he was going out of the world found no comfort,
but cried out, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? This speech refreshed
Master Throgmorton, and within a little space of time after this, he went to
his heavenly Inheritance.

Master Dod, as he was of a weaned disposition from the World himself: so he
labored to wean others. He put this difference between rich Christians and
poor, That for poor Christians their Father kept the purse; but the rich
Christians keep the purse in their own hands: But it might oftener fall out, and
did, and therefore the purse was better in the Fathers hand than in the
Christians. He was wont to compare wicked men to waves of the Sea; those which
were of a great Estate, were great waves; those which were of small estate,
were small waves; but all were restless as waves.

To a friend of his, that raised from a mean estate to worldly greatness, he
sent word, That this was but as if he should go out of a Boat into a Barge or
Ship, but there ought to be a serious and godly remembrance, that while we are
in this world we are upon the sea. He often repeated this, That nothing could
hurt us but our own sins, and they should not hurt us, if we truly repented for
them; and nothing could do us good but Gods favor, and that we should be sure
of, if we unfeignedly sought it. Speaking of David's penning the 51. Psalm,
after his murder and adultery, put this gloss upon it, That hearty and true
repentance shall have cause to praise the Lord for his pardoning mercy.

He said, Afflictions were Gods Potions, he might sweeten by faith and faithful
prayer; but we for the most part made them bitter, putting into Gods cup the ill
ingredients of our own impatience and unbelief. He gave this reason why many of
Gods people lived uncomfortably, for that they shut their ear against what God
said, where they should open it; and they opened their ear to what their carnal
reason, and Satan, and the world said, where they should shut it: but (said he)
the Psalmist was wiser, Psalm. 85. 8. he would hear none of them all, I will
hear what the Lord God will speak.

His Preaching was searching, and when some did suppose that he had Informers
and Spies, because he came so close to them; he answered, That the Word of God
was searching, and that if he was shut up in a dark Vault, where none could
come at him; yet allow him but a Bible and a Candle, and he should Preach as he
did.

He had an excellent gift in similitudes, which did flow freely and frequently
from him, as all those knew, who either heard him Preach publicly, or
discourse privately. He called Death the friend of Grace, though it were the
enemy of Nature, and whereas the Word, and Sacraments, and Prayer, do but
weaken sin, death builds it. Speaking of prayer, he said, a man was never in a
hard condition, unless he had a hard heart, and could not pray.

Having Preached out of that Text, O woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee
even as thou will. He invited some women to Dinner, and told them it was a
usual saying, Let a Woman have her will, and then she shall be quiet. Now the
way for a woman to have her will, is to have a strong faith, and to pray as
that woman in the Gospel did.

Upon a time, when he had Preached long, so that it was somewhat late before he
went to dinner, he said, You shall have some Gentlemen will follow Hounds from
seven in the morning, till four or five in the afternoon, because they love the
cry of Dogs, which to me was unpleasant hearing. So if we love the Word, we
should be content, though the Minister stood above his hour. And he added, me
thinks it much better to hear a Minister preach, than a Kennel of Hounds to
bark. Speaking of recreation, he said, he marvelled what the vocation of many
was, who were so eager for recreation. And if we should come into a house, and
see many Physick-boxes and Glasses, we would conclude some body is sick. So
when we see Hounds, and Hawks, and Cards, and Dice, we may fear there is some
sick soul in that Family. He told some friends, that if he were to pass
sentence who was a rich man, he would not look into his Purse or Chest, how
much gold he had laid up, but look into his heart, what promises were treasured
up there. For we count him rich that is rich in bonds, and the pleading of the
promises in prayer, is suing of the bonds.

Speaking to a Minister, who was to go to a place where there was but small
means, he told him, That his care was to Preach, and do God service, and then
God would provide for him. When he preached at Fausley, and was much resorted
unto, he told a godly man of his acquaintance, that if the Country knew so much
by him, as he knew by himself, they would not have him in so much admiration.

Speaking about going to Law, his opinion was, that it was better to buy Love
than Law; for one might have a great deal of Love for a little, whereas he
could have but a little Law for a great deal. He would frequently say, that was
not well, which ended everlastingly ill, and that a man was never undone till
he was in hell.

This was a Speech which he often used, that if it were lawful to envy any, he
would envy those that turned to God in youth, whereby they escape much sin and
sorrow, and were like unto Jacob, that stole the blessing betimes. He died
(praying heartily for the King, and declaiming as heartily against the
Rebellion, that would make such a breach in this State; and be such a scandal
to this Church, as the Child unborn should rue and bewail.

THE Life and Death OF BARON TREVOR:
WE remember, when Oratory and Faction had attained here the same height that
a Learned Man observes, they had attained at Rome together, (for Speeches and
Sedition are inseparable companions.) It was reckoned a quaint strain upon Mr.
Prynne, Bastwick, and Burtons sufferings to say, History of Parliament. p. 79.
That it seemed to many Gentlemen, a spectacle no less strange than sad, to see
three of several professions, the noblest in the kingdom, Divinity, Law, and
Physic, exposed at one time to such ignominious punishment, forsooth: And
truly we are at present under a great doubt, whether it was a more sad, or a
more pleasant sight, to see so many eminent men, of all these and other
ingenious professions, act so cheerfully, and suffer so patiently for that
Government, which those beforementioned, endeavored first to disgrace, and at
last to overthrow. First, debauching men from their love and reverence to
Superiors, by exposing them to scorn and contempt; and next, from their duty to
them, by opposing and fighting them.

There went immediately before, a very Reverend Divine, that in the midst of
many discouragements, zealously discried the resistance of the Supreme and
Lawful power, as against Conscience: And now he is followed by a worthy Lawyer,
that eagerly opposed any thing that tended to it, as against Law.

Sir Thomas Trevor was born July the 6. 1586. (a day memorable in that Family
for the birth of six successives principal branches of it, born upon it) with
this remarkable occurrence, That whereas most other Children are born to this
sad world crying, he was observed to smile almost as soon as born, an argument
of the cheerful temper he was of, until he died. His Temper lead him to the
active ways of a Soldier, or a Courtier, but his judgment carried him to the
more studious employment of a Lawyer, wherein he promised great proficiency
from that towardliness at School, that never deserved correction, and success
in the University, that never failed of applause; in both such strong parts,
that his Master would say of him, This Boy has not the patience to stay at the
words in Authors, he is so inquisitive after the thing. And his Tutor, That he
had a strange Natural Logic.

Saint Rumbald [I write what I read, not what I believe] as soon as he came out
of his Mothers womb falling into the Churches bosom, cried three times the
first minute of his life, I am a Christian; made a confession of his Faith,
desired to be Baptized, chose his Godfathers, his Name, and his Font. This the
fable, the moral shall be the early seriousness of this person; seriousness and
devotion, being of Vives his opinion, that a pious Youth resisting its own
temptations, and allaying its own heat, makes a comfortable and a serviceable
Age, neither sad with a man's own remembrances of younger follies, nor useless
by the disgrace of others observing of them.

Many men are lost in their more reduced years, by reason of the scandal of
their younger ones. Though the light when grown, pours fuller streams, its yet
more precious in its virgin beams; and though the third and fourth may do the
cure, the eldest tear of the Balsome is most pure. One of Seneca's few men you
have here, Qui consilio se suaque disponunt, caeteri eorum more qui fluminibus
innatant, non eunt, sed feruntur. And the rather was he pious, because he would
say often that sentence of Cicero, Pietas justitia quaedam est adversus deos,
pietate sublata, fides etiam, societas humani generis, and una excellentissima
virtus justitia imo omnis probitas tollitur. And because he observed that the
difficulties of this study was not to be overcome without the quietness of
heart, and composedness and calmness of mind, that all men aim at, and good men
only enjoy.

Happy was the mixture of heat and moisture in his head; the later serving his
memory and judgment, and the former his apprehension and fancy, that at once
pierced into the depth, and look round all the little circumstance of Cases; to
which his wary distrust, patient consideration, and slow conclusion and
determination, contributed much; being used to say, That we could not have too
little faith as to any thing proposed to us in this world, nor too much for the
things offered us in reference to another World: Comparing the failures of his
memory to the fluxes of his body, both arguing the weakness of the retentive
faculty; there being seldom a discourse wherein, with Curio the Orator in
Tully, he either added not some head he had not thought on, or omitted a point
he had: he finding true that passage of Seneca; Res est ex omnibus partibus
maxim delicata memoria in quam primum senectus incurrit, frigido jam
incalescente, and exarescente cerebro. His smooth contexture of Discourse and
flowing speech; his command of himself and temper, seldom either disordering
himself, or disturbing his Argument with perturbation of mind, although
disturbance would heat him sometimes to an improvement of his Eloquence;
insomuch, that (as it was reported of Severus Cassius, that would do best ex
tempore) his Antagonists were afraid to anger him who had most wit in his
anger, as much as Aristotle observes, others designed to provoke their
Adversaries, that they might interrupt them. So weighty, though not bold, his
Assertions; so choice, though not nice, his Speech; for the niceness of words
breaks the weight of Verborum minutiae rerum frangunt pendera. A. Gel.
Arguments; so plain his dealing; so becoming and grave his Carriage and
Address, and so entire his Reputation, that besides several reposed in him by
several Noblemen, he was made Solicitor to King Charles the I. when King; by
the wise King James, upon the Earl of Pembroke and Bishop Williams
recommendation, and in the first year of the said King, made Sergeant, and
preferred Kings Sergeant (Sir John Walter then and he giving Rings with this
Inscription, Regi Legi servire Libertas;) and the same year one of the Barons
of the Exchequer; in which place he was tender of two things, the Churches, and
the Kings Rights; having never (as we heard) taken Fee, when a Pleader either
of an Orthodox Minister, or of a Kings Servant. The first Books of the Law he
would recommend to young Students, was the Historical, as the years and terms
of Common Law, permitting Finch, Dodderidge, Fortescue, Fulbeck and others,
that writ of the nature of the Law; among which Books, the Called Registrum
Cancellariae.
Register is authentic, Speculum Iustitiariorum is full and satisfactory,
Glanvill de Legibus and consuetudinibus Regni Angliae, is useful and practical,
the Old Tenures tried and approved, Bracton methodical, rational and complete;
Britton learned and exact, though his Law in some cases be obsolete and out of
date; Fleta, deep and comprehensive; Fortescue, sinewy and curious; Stuthams
Abridgement, well contrived, and of ready use; Littletons Tenures, sound,
exact, and the same thing to us Common Lawyers, that Justinians Institutes is
to Civil Lawyers (Littleton being deservedly said not to be the name of a
Lawyer, but of the Law it self;) Fitz-Herberts Abridgement, and Natum brevium,
Vide Epist. Coci. and Commeatar, in Littlen on, Ploydens Comment. 5. 8. 6
elaborate and well-digested Collections; Doctor and Student: A good account of
the nature, grounds, and variety of Laws; Stamfords Pleas of the Crown and
Prerogative, weighty smart, and methodical: Rastals Book of Entries, and the
Lord Brooks's Abridgement, commended by my Lord Cook as good repertories of the
year-books of the Law; Theobalds Book of Writs, sound and full; the next
explanatory Books were the next; in which kind, Institutes, Exposition of Magna
Charta, and other Ancient Statutes, Pleas of the Crown, Jurisdiction of Courts,
Books of Entry and Reports Books of which it might be said, ^s it was said of
Plutarch in another respect, that if all Law were lost, it might be found in
him.
Cooks Works, and Ploydens Commentaries pass for Oracles, and Mr. Lambards
Books for the most exquisite Antiquities; and in the third place, Reports;
among which, those of Cook and Crook, are profound, fundamental, and material;
those of Popham, Hobart, Owen, Hutton, Winch, Lea, Hetley, Leonard Brownlow,
Bulstrode, Yelverton, Bridgeman, are sinewy, clear, pertinent, useful and
approved; and especially a man must have the Year-books and Statutes. His
Counsel to the King was with the like freedom as these directions to the young
Gentlemen; and his Judgment on the Bench, with as much faithfulness as either.

The English in a year of great mortality amongst them, had their children born
without their cheek-teeth: This Judge especially in sad times, and in a sad
case, would have all Pleadings without biting; his Nature was pitiful and
ingenuous; insomuch, that he might be called, as Tostanus was, The Patron of
Infirmities. His Discourse was always charitable, either to excuse their
failings, or mitigate their punishments. The favor he showed others, he found
not himself: His concurring with his Brethren about Shipmoney, being aggravated
with the most odious circumstances, and punished with the severe usage of a
Prison, a Fine, and the loosing of his Place; a great argument certainly of his
Integrity, that in a searching Age, he that had been Judge near upon twenty
years, could be found guilty of no fault, but avowing the Law according to his
Judgment, and being of opinion, That the King, in case of danger, whereof he
was Judge, might tax the Nation to secure its self. An opinion so innocent,
that Justice Hutton himself, who went to his grave with the reputation of an
honest Judge, would protest he could heartily wish true, it being as much for
the Interest of the Nation, as it seemed to him against the Law of it: So
legal, that Baron Denham, though he was sick and could not debate it with his
Brethren, and something scrupulous that if he had been there, he could not have
agreed with them: yet it appears his dissent was not from his apprehension of
the injustice of the Tax, called Shipmoney, in general, but from some
particular irregularity in the proceeding with Mr. Hampden in particular; as
appears from this Certificate, dated May 26. 1638. directed to the Lord Chief
Justice Brampston.

May it please your Lordship,
I Had provided my self to have made a short Argument, and to have delivered my
Opinion with the Reasons; but by reason of want of rest this last night (my old
Disease being upon me) my sickness and weakness greatly increased, insomuch as
I cannot attend the business as I desire; and if my opinion be desired, it is
for the Plaintiff, John Denham: And this reason added to it, That he thought
His Majesty could not seize on any Subjects Goods, without a Court-Record, etc.
And so harmless, that it was but twenty shillings that Hampden paid with all
this ado, after Monarchy and Liberty was brought to plead at the Bar. And Judge
Crook himself (who was one that dissented from his Brethrens opinions about
Shipmoney, though he had once subscribed it, by the same token that the People
would say at that time, That Ship Money might be had by Hook, it should never
be had by Crook) would say of Hampden, That he was a dangerous man, and that
men had best take heed of him.

Remarkable here the difference between His Majesty's temper and the
Parliaments; they punished five of the Judges (for that very liberty of opinion
which they themselves asserted under the notion of Liberty of Conscience) that
voted against their Sentiments, severely: The King entertained those two that
voted against his Judgment and Interest too with respect, the one dying with a
Character from his Master, of an upright man; and the other being dismissed
upon his own earnest Petition, with the honor of having been a good Servant;
as is evident from this humble Petition of his to His Majesty.


To the Kings Most Excellent Majesty: The humble Petition of Your Majesty's
humble Servant George Crook, Knight, one of the Justices of Your Bench;
Humbly ^heweth,
THat he having by the Gracious Favor of Your Majesty's late Father of blessed
Memory, and of Your Majesty, served Your Majesty, and your said late Father, as
a Judge of Your Majesty's Court of Common Pleas, and of Your Highness Court
called the King's Bench, above this sixteen years, is now become very old, being
above the age of 80 years: and by reason of his said age, and dullness of
hearing, and other infirmities, whereby it has pleased God to visit him, he
finds himself disabled any longer to do that Service in your Courts, which
the Place requires, and he desires to perform; yet is desirous to live and
die in your Majesty's Favor: His most humble Suit is, That your Majesty will
be pleased to dispense with his further Attendance in any your Majesty's
Courts; that so he may retire himself, and expect Gods good pleasure: And
during that little remainder of his life, pray for your Majesty's long Life,
and happy Reign.

George Crook.

And this Gracious Answer of his Majesty to him.

The KINGS Answer.
UPon the humble Address, by the humble Petition of Sir George Crook Knight,
who after many years Service done both to Our deceased Father, and Our Self, as
Our said Fathers Sergeant at Law; and one of His, and Our Judges of Our Benches
at Westminster, has humbly besought Us, by reason of the Infirmity of his old
Age, (which disableth him to continue to perform Us such service, as he much
desires to have, according to his duty, done) his further Attendance might be
by Us in Our Grace dispensed with; To the end all Our loving Subjects who have,
and shall faithfully serve Us (as We declare this Our Servant has done) may
know, That as We shall never expect, much less require, or exact from them
performances beyond what their healths and years shall enable them; so We shall
not dismiss them without an Approbation of their Service, when We find they
shall have deserved it, much less expose them in their old Age to neglect. As
Our Princely Testimony therefore, that the said Sir George Crooks being
dispensed withal, proceeds from Us at the humble Request of the said Sir George
Crook (which We have cause, and do take well, that he is rather willing to
acknowledge his Infirmity by his great Age occasioned, than that by concealing
of the same any want of Justice should be to Our People) and not out of any Our
least displeasure conceived against him; Do hereby Declare Our Royal Pleasure,
That We are graciously pleased, and do hereby dispense with the said Sir George
Crook's further Attendance in the said Courts, or in any Our Circuits. And as a
Token of Our Acceptance of his former good and acceptable Service by the said
Sir George Crook done to Our deceased Father, and Our Self, do yet continue him
one of Our Judges of Our said Bench; And hereby Declare Our further Will and
Pleasure to be, That during his the said Sir George Crook's life, there shall
be continued and paid by Us to him, the like Fee and Fees as was to him, or is,
or shall be by Us paid to any other of Our Judges of Our said Bench at
Westminster; and all Fees and Duties, saving the Allowance by Us to Our Judges
for their Circuits only.

After which Honorable Discharge from his Service at Court, God gave him a
Quietus est from this Life at Waterstock in Oxfordshire, Anno Christi 1641.
Aetatis 82. Caroli I. 17.



When he lived to see the New Canons made 1640. so much aggravated by others,
yet so much admired by him, that upon the sight of them, he blessed God that he
lived to see so much good by a Convocation.

There passes a pleasant Tradition in Cornwall, how there stands a man of
great strength and stature, with a Black in his hand at Polston Bridge, (the
first Entrance into Cornwall as you pass toward Launceston where the Assizes
are holden) ready to knock down all the Lawyers that should offer to plant
themselves in that County. This man was brought to Westminster Hall door Anno
1641. no honest or able Lawyer daring to appear there upon pain of forfeiting
either his Conscience, in complying with the Tumult; or his Estate, Liberty,
yea and Life too in dissenting from it. Otherwise our Judge deserved to be
Comes Imperii primi Ordinis, according to the Constitution of Theodosius the
Emperor, allowing that honor to Lawyers, Cum ad viginti annos observatione Iugi
ac sedulo docendi labor pervenerint.

Having been twenty years a Judge, that would hear patiently, help Witnesses
laboring in their Delivery condescendingly, check forward Speakers gravely,
dealt impartially his private Inclinations, being swallowed up in the common
Concern, as Rivers loose their names in the Ocean. Cut off Delays and
impertinent Controversies discreetly; was zealous of kindness, because fearful
of Bribes: Great obligations upon persons in Place, like wandering Preachers
Sermons, end in begging; merciful in his Judgment. A Butcher may not be of the
Jury, much less should he be a Judge. Being outed his Place with as much honor,
as others are advanced, glorying in that, though the Parliament could make him
no Judge, they could not make him no upright Judge. He lived privately the rest
of his days, having besides the estate got by his Practice, no mean estate by
his Birth, and by his Marriage; having little reflection on his own condition,
he was so taken up with the sad condition of the whole Kingdom. Vitae est
avidus quisquis non vult mundo secum pereunte mori.

And thus we leave our Judge to receive a just reward of his Integrity from the
Judge of Judges, as well as from the King of kings at the great Assize of the
world.

Plinic reports it as worthy a Chronicle, that Chrispinus H^llarus with open
ostentation, sacrificed in the Capitol seventy four of his children, and
childrens children attending on him; this Reverend Person sacrificed to
Allegiance himself, attended with many well resolved Relations round about him.
For it is fit posterity should hear of Col. Mark Trevor, since deservedly
ennobled in Ireland for Valor, that feared no dangers; Activity that went
through all hardships; Integrity that was proof against all corruptions.

John Trevor, a Person that suffered not his parts to be depressed by his
fortune; but to make his mind the more proportionable, he made it his business
to be as able in Prudence and Knowledge, as he was in Estate, for which he
suffered twice severely; that Party being of the Miller of Matlocks mind, of
whom we read this pretty Story: Molendarius de Matlocki tollavit bis eo quod
ipse audivit Rectorem de eadem villa dicere in Dominica Ram. Palm. Toll,
toll: That is, the Miller of Matlock took Toll twice, because he heard the
Rector of the Parish read on Palm Sunday, Toll, toll, that is, Crucify,
crucify him. There was

ARTHVR TREVOR Esquire
A Lawyer of the Temple, that died lately and suddenly, a Passage others may
censure, we must pity; since sudden and rash Judgment is always sinful, but
sudden and unexpected death is not always penal: Nothing so certain as that we
shall die, nothing so uncertain as how we shall die; Therefore Life should be
in our apprehension, what it was in the Philosophers definition, a Constant
Meditation of Death. Epiminondas came to a careless Soldier that was asleep
when he should watch, and run him through, saying, Sleeping I found thee,
sleeping I leave thee. And God sometime surprizeth a loose man that lives
carelessly, with a Careless I found thee, and careless I leave thee for ever.

A man that lives as if he had only a body, desires to die so too, and
therefore wishes to depart without delay, that he may go without pain; being
of Caesar's mind, who was not afraid of death, but of dying. But the man that
makes so much use of his soul, that he knows he has one, desires rather to
be taken, than snatched out of the world ut sentiat se mori; and (to use the
words of Judicious Mr. Hooker, in defense of that necessary Prayer in our
Liturgy, which no devout man would leave out, From sudden death (against which
we have not prepared our selves, and which allows us no respite for
preparation) good Lord deliver us) for virtuous considerations, is prevailed
upon by wisdom to desire as slow and deliberate death, against the stream of
sensual in clination, content to endure the longer grief and bodily pain, that
the Soul may have time to call its self to a just account of all things past,
by means whereof repentance is perfected, patience is exercised, the Joys of
Heaven are leisurely represented; the pleasures of sin, and the vanities of the
world are with sound judgment censured; Charity has time to look out fit
objects, and Prudence to dispose of a man's Estate: besides that, the nearer we
draw to God, the more we are oftentimes enlightened with the shining beams of
his glorious Presence, as being then even almost in sight; a leisurable
departure may in that case bring forth for the good of them that are present,
that which will cause them for ever after, from the bottom of their hearts to
pray, Oh let us die the death of the Righteous, and let our last end be like
theirs: (...), i. e. that is, We must all the days of our appointed time wait,
until our change shall come according to Tertullians Character of the
Christians in his time, who says they were expeditum morti genus: It was a
good resolution of the holy man that was resolved to repent a day before he
died; and because he was uncertain when he should die, repented every day.

It is reported of Archias by Plutarch, that having by fraudulent and unjust
courses, at length compassed the Government of Thebes; he with his Accomplices
kept a riotous Feast, when in the midst of his Intemperance a Messenger comes
to him with a Letter from a Friend, importuning him speedily to peruse it, and
he slighting the Admonition, and putting it under his Pillow, said, (...),
Serious things to morrow, when as the thing which the Letter concerned was
effected that night, viz. he died in the midst of his cups. It was the policy
of Julius Caesar never to acquaint his Army beforehand with the time of their
march, ut paratum exercitum momenti omnibus quo vellet educeret. We suppose
this Gentleman who has given occasion for this meditation, is the Arthur
Trevor of the Inner Temple, Esquire that Compounded for 05461. 09s. 08d.

They are golden words of a precious man, Mentis aureae verba Bracteato: I have
often prayed that on my side might join true Piety with the sense of their
Loyalty, and be as faithful to God, and their own souls, as they were to me;
that the effects of one might not blast the endeavor of the other.

Sir RICHARD WESTON.
TO Baron Trevor, we might add Baron Weston, who was inseparable from him in
opinion, and would have been so in suffering, but that he was called to give an
account of himself to God, when others were so haled to give an account of
themselves to men. When we read that Sir Richard Weston died in Trinity Term,
the fourteenth year of King Charles the First's Reign, 1638/9. with the
Character (in a grave Reporter) of a very Learned, Judicious, Courageous, and
Patient man in all his Proceedings; and afterward read in the Chronicle of
Articles and Impeachment, against Sir John Brampston, Sir Humphrey Davenport,
Sir Thomas Trevor, Sir Francis Crawley, and Sir Richard Weston in Easter Term,
17 Carol. I. 1641. We are put in mind of one Archbishop, six Bishops, and
eight Doctors, going solemnly to Cambridge, to excommunicate the bones of an
Heretic that dyed some years before; malice would not end where life does but
extend its self to the grave, and reach to the other world.

There were three famous Men of this Name, whereof one read as much as the
other two. remembered practiced

Sir Francis Weston (who preceded him in qualification, as well as in place)
and he had a good Rule, viz. That private men should take care to do no wrong
themselves; but public men, that others under them should do none.

We have done with our Judges, save one, we mean Sir Francis Crawley, who is
reserved for his proper place, where we hope the Reader shall find an exact
account of him from his reverend Son Dr. Crawley the learned, meek, charitable,
bountiful, and religious Rector of Agmondsham in Buckingham-shire, who quitted
his Fellowship at Trinity for his Allegiance, as his Father quitted his Office;
only be it remembered, that what these Confessors for Law lost by refusing to
continue under an usurped Power on the Bench, they gained by private Practice
in their Chambers; the people willingly trusting their Estates in those Worthy
Persons hands, with whom the King had instrusted the Law; being confident of
their faithfulness to them, who had approved themselves so faithful to their
Sovereign. And that they would not wrest the Law, who suffered so much rather
than betray it.

It is observed, that when Sir John Carry, Chief Baron of the Exchequer in
Richard the Seconds time, lost his estate, for being that unfortunate Kings
Champion at Law; his Son, Sir Robert Carry, had it entirely restored to him, for
being King Henry the Fifths Champion at Arms. For a Knight Errant of Arragon
coming into England, challenging any to Tilt with him, was undertaken by this
Sir Robert, and overcome; for which Sir Robert had that Estate from Henry the
Fifth, which his Father was adjudged to have forfeited to Henry the Fourth.

And its observable, that whatever any of these Judges lost to the Parliament,
their Sons and Relations repaired again with the King, the Sword making amends
for the damages of the Gown; the Young Set of Loyalists fighting against that
phrenzy, which the Elder in vain pleaded against.

But we had almost forgot Sir Humphrey Davenport, that man of memory, who to
his dying day had the old Year-books and Reports ad ungues, but remembered no
new ones; as Beza, when above fourscore, could perfectly say by heart any Greek
Chapter in St. Paul's Epistles, or any thing which he had learned long before,
but forgot whatsoever was newly told him: His memory like an Inn retaining Old
Guests, but affording no room to entertain New. It is pity, that he that kept
the exact date of every eminent Lawyer in his own time, should want an exact
account of his own. He was Born in Cheshire (where are 1. The Most, 2. The most
Ancient, 3. The most Loyal, 4. The most Hospitable Gentry in England) July 7.
1584. the same day that his Father and Mother died both together within a
quarter of one another. When my Father and my Mother forsake me, for want of
natural affection to pity me; for want of wisdom not knowing what to do with
me, for want of power not able to help me, or by death being forced to leave
me. The gracious God, that when a Father forgets his bowels cannot forget his
love which is his own nature: The All-wise God, that when we are at a loss
orders all things by the eternal Counsel of his Will. The Almighty God, that
when we are weak does whatsoever he pleases in Heaven and Earth. The Immortal
God that Inhabiteth Eternity, that when Friends are gone will never leave us,
never forsake us: This Lord will take us up, then the Lord took him up, not
immediately, Miracles being ceased, but in, and by the hands, 1. Of Generous
and Noble Guardians, that much improved his Estate as well as himself. 2. Of
two Excellent Schoolmasters and Tutors, in Memory of whom he kept his own
Birthday, as the Athenians did that of Theseus, doing always some thing in
Memory of his Teachers; as they sacrificed a Ram in Memory of his, having
designed (we know not whether performed) the endowment of a School, where
because 1. Raw Youths took Sanctuary in this Profession, furnished only with a
Rod and a Serida. 2. Hopeful men slur it over in their way to a more profitable
Employment. 3. Indiscreet men meddle with this that understand Books, but not
Tempers well. 4. Men undertake it against their Genius, neither with delight
nor dexterity, who had as lieve be Schoolboys as Schoolmasters; being ticed
to the School, as Coopers Dictionary, or Scapulaes Lexicon is chained to the
Desk; or if good Schoolmasters, they grow Rich and neglect it; or if poor,
they are Masters to the Children, and slaves to their Parents: He intended an
able, discreet, grave, and dexterous man should be competently encouraged while
he was able, and provided for when not able to follow the School at the place
either where he was born, or which he valued more, at the place where he was
bred.

He would bless God that he had staid so long at the Gate of Wisdom, supported
like Wisdoms House in the Scripture, by seven Pillars, meaning the seven
Liberal Sciences, before he entered the Temple of it; meaning the Profession of
the Law: That he might not be reckoned among those, Sir John Dodderidge
calls, Doctum quoddam Indoctorum hominum genus, natural abilities have gone
far, but Ingenious Education goes further to understand our Law; of which Sir
Henry Finch observes, That the sparks of all other Sciences in the world are
raked up under the ashes of the Law; Which when admitted at the Temple, he
plied with 1. Reading. 2. Hearing. 3. Conference. 4. Meditation. 5.
Recollection, and 6. A good Commonplace of Axioms, Principles, Rules, and
Aphorisms; ( Apes debemus Imitori quae ut vagantur, and flores ad mel

favos digerunt; Ita debemus quaecunque ex diversa Lectione congestimus
separare, melius enim distinct a servantur. Sen. Epist.) until his Countryman
Sir Randolph Crew, and the great observer of Young men, took special notice of
him. And likewise adorned with a grave Aspect, ( vultu non destruens verba) not
contradicting that to the subtle eyes of those that dwell on Faces, and from
the workings of the Countenance, discern the Intrigues of the mind) which he
spoke to the Judicious Ear; A sober and patient temper, a reserved mind,
Modestus Incestus, and compositus, ac probus vultus, and conveniens prudenti

that he had insinuated himself into the best acquaintance, and most profitable
practices of his time, having been Steward to sixteen several Persons of
Quality, Executor to above three hundred Wills, Feoffee in trust for fifty
several considerable Estates, Guardian to forty three several Orphans, twice

in their Wills, being observed many of them to have wept their Common Prayers
left behind in their Closets into bluts and blots all over.

THE Life and Death OF Sir GEORGE RATCLIFFE.
THIS Gentleman might say as one of the foregoing Judges did, That he had been
a very happy man, had it not been for that he was born in that age, wherein it
was fatal to give good counsel. He was Born Anno 1587. at... in Yorkshire,
most of his relation taking to the Sword that gives laws (whereof 3. slain at
Museleburgh-field, 2. died in the suppression of the Northern Rebellion 63 in
88. and 2. (whereof that excellent person Sir John Ratcliffe, who when with Sir
Charles Rich being sick, and desired by the Duke of Buckingham to retire into
the Ships, returned, No, they came to fight; and leaning on their Pikes
challenged death its self) at the Isle of Rhee. He was bred to the Laws that
were made by the Sword, so earnest was he in the behalf of those laws, when
there was a suspicion that they should be made void by an Arbitrary power and
Prerogative, that I find Sir Thomas Wentworth removed from Yorkshire to Essex,
and Sir George Ratcliffe to Hertford-shire, to be confined for stickling in the
Parliaments, Anno 1625, 1626. and yet so zealous he was for the Kings
Prerogative and just Power, when it was in a real hazard to be overborn with
tumults and combinations, in the behalf of pretended Laws, that I find Sir
George Ratcliffe involved in all the Earl of Straffords troubles. None will
question his worth, that considers him as the great Consident of that Earl in
his affairs; and all persons must needs confess his faithfulness that observes
him that excellent persons companion in all his sufferings. The Lord Viscount
Wentworth understood men and therefore when he was advanced President in the
North, he made him Attorney General at York, and he was so sensible of
serviceableness there, that when he was called to the Leiutenancy of Ireland,
he carried him as his chief favorite over thither. Where his contrivance was
so good, that Cardinal Mazarine gave 10000. Pistols for a Copy of a model,
pretended to be Sir George Ratcliffes, Entitled A model for the improvement
and safeguard of Ireland. So happy his faculty of persuading, that it was said
of his Speeches, as it was of Ciceroes, That the longest was the best. And so
nimble his activity, that (though sometimes he permitted a design to be matter
of discourse before it was finished, to see how it relished with the vulgar,
and try how it appeared to the wise) generally he thought not an affair well
done, unless it was done before others thought of it. So subtle his wit, that
a Reverend Judge upon his proceeding Barrister in the Inns of Court,
Pronounced, Likely to prove either the best or the worst Instrument in the
Commonwealth. And that he would see through and unravil the intrigues of the
most entangled business, or the most reserved man that he had to do with. And
of so comprehensive a brain, that besides the Customs, the Manufactue, the
Products, and the Trade of Ireland, wherein he had a great share. He managed 4.
of the 25 Cole-mines, 6. of the 86. Mills, and had in his hand 12. of the 275.
Woods in Yorkshire (that Country of which Hoornuis reports its bigger than his
Masters seven Provinces, and as much under Gods blessing, though not so much
under the warm Sun, as other parts of England; by the same token, that when the
Earl of Crawford looked upon it as the Garden of Britain, the Earl of
Traquaire answered, It might be a Garden, but that it was too far from the
House, meaning London.) The Gagites is a precious stone to be found only in the
Eagles nest, and this Gentleman was a man of such choice parts, as could be
expected only in the sharp-sighted Earl of Straffords Cabinet; who would not
entertain your fine, but useless wits, which he compared to Jet, the Northern
Commodity, that could draw straw to it only, having no power over more weighty
bodies. But liked this person the better for another quality; It is remarkable,
that hardships raised his spirit, as water inflames Jet; and easiness allayed
it, as oil quenches that. When Sir Thomas Challoner (Tutor to Prince Henry) had
found Alum near Gesburgh in this County; On this occasion, they are the words
of an eyewitness, transcribed by my worthy friend, he observed the leaves of
trees thereabouts more deeply green, than elsewhere, the Oaks broad-spreading,
but not deep rooted, with much strength, but little sap; the earth clayish,
variously colored; here white, there yellow, there blew, and the ways therein,
in a clear night, glistering like glass; symptoms which first suggested unto
him the presumption of Minerals, and of Alum most properly. Some Gentlemen of
the neighborhood burying their estates under the earth before they could get
any Alum above ground, until Sir George contrived the bringing over of foreign
Workmen (in Hogsheads, to prevent discovery) from Rochel in France, which
advanced the discovery to a Mine Royal, Rented by Sir Paul Pinder, who paid
yearly To the King 12500 the Earl of Mulgrave 01640 to Sir William Pennyman
c0600

Besides a constant salary to 800 Men at a time, until the good people at
Westminster, that were designing one Monopoly of three kingdoms to themselves,
were pleased to Vote this, and above 40. more of this Gentleman's pulblick
discoveries, Monopolies to the respective Proprietors.

As he noted of his beloved Horses (for plenty and excellency of which he and
his Country were both very eminent) that they had a mediocrity of necessary
properties, being neither so Slight as the Barbe, nor so Slovenly as the
Flemming, nor so Fiery as the Hungarian, nor so Aeiry as the Spanish Gennets,
nor so Earthy and heavy as the German-horse, (these are his words transcribed
by another Author without any thanks to him) so I may character him, not so
Nimble as a Frenchman, not so Slow as a Spaniard, not so Reserved and
Observant as the Italian, not so Fierce as a German, not so Patient as a
Dutchman, but a collection of all indowments into one man, like that of all
the beauties of Greece to form one Venus.

Sir George was hugely pleased to reflect, that as those (they are Melchior
Canus his words) who out of curiosity and novelty oppose antiquity, teach
posterity how they may contradict them: So those that were so perverse in
disparaging the actions of their Superiors, did but chalk out the way for their
inferiors to disparage theirs; especially, since it was too obvious, how easily
the people might be exasperated against them whom they had raised against
others. The (...), the many running into opinions of men and things, as
Calderinus in Lud. Vives did to Mass, Eamus ergo (said he) quia sic placet in
communes errores. And that he thought it not more unpardonable in him to
dissent from them, than it was in them to differ from their Superiors and
Ancestors. (...), Arist. Eth. 1. 6.) The one rendering him only (...)
ingeniously bold, the other them (...) audaciously presumptuous: Refreshing
himself with that of Mimnermus, (...)
(...).


In that time which he might call infoelix seculum, as well as Bellarmine
calls that Age between 900, and 1100. when men of the same character that
Vives gives James Archbishop of Genoa, commonly called James de Voragine, for
devouring books as these people did men; Homines ferres oris and plumbis cordis
of three Nations, conspired the ruin of one man, of whom we may say as Claudian
did of Ruffinus (offensis Ruffinus divide terris) though all that they could do
was to charge him home, and Calumniari fortiter, that something might stick,
though his Litchfield Adversary, like a Coventry-man, did his best (worst) at
first, for the Earl of Strafford his Patron, since he settled a perplexed
conveiance for him at London, acquainted him with so many serviceable men that
were at his devotion in the North; (for the observing of and acquainting
himself with choice men was his peculiar faculty) and was so active both on the
Popular and the Royal account, being Charged November 13.

Sir George Ratcliffe was sent for the same day by a Sergeant at Arms
dispatched into Ireland, who accordingly December 4. came in, and yielded
himself to the Speaker, from whence he was Committed to Custody, and an
Impeachment drawn up against him, consisting of these Articles:

First, That he had conspired and joined with the Earl of Strafford, to bring
into Ireland an Arbitrary Government, and to subvert the Fundamental Laws.

Secondly, That he had endeavored to bring in an Army from Ireland, to subdue
the Subjects of England.

Thirdly, That he joined with the Earl to use Regal Power, and to deprive
Subjects of their Liberty and Property.

Fourthly, That he joined with him to take out forty thousand pounds out of the
Exchequer of Ireland, and bought Tobacco therewith, and converted the profit
thereof to their own uses.

Fifthly, That he has traitorously Confederated with the Earl to countenance
Papists, and built Monasteries, to alienate the affections of the Irish
Subjects from the subjection of England.

Sixthly, That they had agreed together to draw away the Subjects of Scotland
from the King.

Seventhly, That to preserve himself, and the said Earl, he had labored to
subvert the Liberties and Privileges of Parliament in Ireland.

An Impeachment they drew, that they might confine him; but prosecuted not,
lest they should shame themselves, but permitting him to go whither he would;
they waited the event of things, and when that fell out much beyond their
expectation, they adventured to condemn him unheard: In all their Treaties with
his Majesty, inserting Sir George Ratcliffe (that Mr. Hampden said, was one of
the most dangerous men that adhered to the King) for one that they would have
utterly excluded Pardon. The main instance whereby they intended to render him
odious, was doubtless his severity to the Children and Relations of those that
came under the lash, as disaffected to the Government; but since Proles est
pars parentis, and one part of the body suffers for the offenses of the
other, (the hand steals, the feet are stocked; the tongue forswears, the ears
are cut off) it is thought con^istent with Divine Justice, and necessary for
humane prudence, to correct the Children with the Parents, that those people
that are so hardy as to adventure their own Concerns for the disturbance of the
Public, may yet be fearful of troublesome practices, with regard to the
Interest of their Innocent Children; those Pledges Commonwealths have that men
will be quiet. When he had privately detected the Conspiracious, laid open the
Plots, and taken off many Instruments of the Faction, he died Anno 165....
Leaving these remarques behind him, 1. That with Tamerlain, he never bestowed
place on a man that was over-ambitious for it. 2. That he feared more the
committing, than the discovery of an Irregularity; That he gave away to
Charitable Uses a tenth of what he got, that he loved a Grave rather than a
gaudy Religion; often using Tully's saying of the Roman Lady, (in reference
some practices of the Roman Church) that she danced better than became a modest
Woman: Being dead in the lower part of his body of a Palsy, as we are
informed, his Soul retired to the (...), the Upper-room of his Clay Cottage, as
much employed in Contemplation the latter end of his Life, as he had been in
action in the beginning.

THE Life and Death OF DOCTOR POTTER, Lord Bishop of Carlisle.
IN a time when this Kingdom flourished with Magnificent Edifices, the Trade of
the Nation had brought the Wealth of the Indies to our doors; Learning and all
good Sciences were so cherished, that they grew to Admiration, and many Arts of
the Ancients buried and forgotten by time, were revived again; no Subjects
happier, though none less sensible of their Happiness. Security increasing the
Husband man's stock, and Justice preserved his Life; the poor might Reverence,
but needed not fear the Great; and the Great though he might despise, yet could
not injure his more obscure Neighbor; and all things were so administered, that
they seemed to conspire to the Public good; except that they made our
Happiness too much the cause of our Civil Commotions, and brought our Felicity
to that height, that by the necessity of humane Affairs, that has placed all
things in motion, it must necessarily decline. At this happy time, thus happily
expressed by Dr. Perrinchiefe, and Dr. Bates, it was that I will not say the
City of London, for the better part of it abhorred it, but to phrase the Men
the Lord Digby's way, I know not what, 15000 Londoners, all that could be got
to subscribe, complained in a Petition that Trade was obstructed, Grievances
increased, Patents and Monopolies multiplied merely because of the Bishops, who
were looked upon as the Great Grievance of the Kingdom; in so much that this
Doctor who was born in a Puritan place at Westmester within the Barony of
Kendal in Westmerland, in Puritan times, when that party guided Affairs 1578.
Bred under a Puritan Schoolmaster, one Mr. Maxwell at School in the place
where he was born, and under a Puritan Tutor in Queens College in Oxford; and
looked upon as so great a Puritan in King James his time, that they would say
in jest, that the noise of an Organ would blow him out the Church; and
therefore he was called tho Puritanical Bishop, (though his love to Music no
doubt was as great as his Skill, and his Skill so good that he could bear a
part in it) yet because he was a Bishop, he was slighted when he came to London
as Iuke warm, and forsaken as Popish, that had been so followed formerly as the
most godly and powerful Preacher: He had been a great Tutor at Queens, where he
had learned to train others by the Discipline he had undergone himself;
insomuch that when Bishop, 33 Eminent Divines, Lawyers, Physicians and
Statesmen, formerly his Pupils, waited on him together for his blessing: He
managed prudently (as he was chosen into it unexpectedly and unanimously when
an hundred miles off) the Government and Provostship of that College, Vbi se
ferebat Patrem-familia providum, (...), nec Collegio gravis fuit aut onerosus.

He resigned it self-denyingly, judging that his Northern charge had more need
of him as an able and skilful Minister, than Queens College as a Provost.

The meek and humble man looked not for Preferment, yea, avoided it with an
hearty, nolo Episcopari: And his gracious Master King Charles unexpectedly when
he was buried in his Living, and resolvedly when there was a considerable
Competition, and not an inconsiderable opposition, saying, He And when others
pressed for the place, the King said Perempt^rily that Potte^ should have it,
this was 1628
would consider his old Servant, and the good man, whom he liked the better for
being a man of few words, but a sweet Preacher, called at Court The Ponetential
Preacher; for being peaceable in his practice, though singular in his Opinion;
and being not humorsome, though precise, having the severe strictness, though
not the sower leaven of the Pharisees: His gracious Master not so much honoring
him, as he did the Function, and that age in the freedom of his Noble and
unsought for choice. The man being so exemplary in his carriage, that several
Recusants that could not go with him to Church, yet conversed much with him,
Because said they, they would go with him to Heaven: So good a Master of his
Family, that his House was a Church, where Family Duties, (constant Prayers,
Catechizing, reading Scriptures, Expounding, godly Conference, speaking to one
another in Psalms and Spiritual Hymns) were performed so regularly and so
constantly, that hundreds left their distant Habitations to be near him, though
all accommodations about him were so much the dearer, as his Neighborhood was
the more precious. It was as great a happiness to be his Servant, as his
Neighbor: England, they say, is a Purgatory of Servants, but his House was a
Heaven for them, where their particular Calling helped forward their general
one, and the subjection to their Master occasioned their freedom from sin; the
condition of their persons breaking off the slavery of their Souls, his service
as well as Gods, his Masters, (who might, he said often, have set him in the
Stable, and his Servant in the Palace) being perfect freedom; neither did they
thrive in their Estates under him less than they did in their Souls, many able
men in that Country owing their plentiful Estates to Gods blessing upon that
Praying Family, as it was called, and his saving rule, that grace was thrifty
and Christianity the best Husbandry; for Godliness and Religion have no idle
expenses; So useful a Member of Parliament, that as he spoke not much himself,
so he was the cause others spoke not so much as they intended, awing the zeal
of the most unruly to a moderation, by the discretion, good advice, and
excellent management of his own.

King Charles, I. knew well the Import of that passage in Seneca, (when with a
design to heal the Distempers of those times, he restored the grave
Archbishop, and raised this moderate Bishop to Supreme Council.) Lib. Epist.
1. Ep. 11. Aliquis vir bonus nobis eligendus est, and semper ante oculos
habendus ut sic tanquam illo spect ante vivamus, and omnia tanquum illo vidento
faciamus. Elige itaque Catonem; si hic videtur tibi nimis rigidus Elige
Remissioris animi virum Lalium, etc.

And in the same moderate way did he guide the Clergy, both of his acquaintance
and Diocese, insisting much upon this sad observation, that Jealousies and
Animosities were easier raised than allayed, and that it was not so obvious a
matter to retreat from violent Engagements, as to Engage in them; that which
has in it any thing of Equity, being not to be disparaged by mannaging it with
undutifulness and pertinacy.

Though his Complexion was melancholy, he loved not a morose Religion; and
though he was lean with study, he would chide men that were so with Envy; his
constitution indeed was weak, but his Spirit vigorous, and good natured; he
that had been the support of moderate and sober Preachers, lived to see himself
despised by those he had countenanced: He that was so indulgent to
tender-consciences, was hardly suffered to enjoy his own: But seeing pretenses
of Conscience end in unconscionable practices, scruples turned into tumults,
and Liberty prove Licentiousness, heart-broken with the consequences of these
sad premises, he died 1642. and was buried by a great Man of the other side,
who braged that he had buried a Bishop, and was answered, That it was hoped
that he buried him in sure and certain hope of the Resurrection.

There need no more added to his Life, or written on his Grave, than that this
was the man, 1. That had been a constant Preacher, and repented at his Death
that he had not been a more constant Catechist. 2. That interceded for Liberty
of Conscience so long for Non-conformists with the King, till he saw neither
the King nor himself could enjoy their own Consciences; that feared the
pretense of Religion would overthrow the reality of it, and that the Divisions
in his age, would breed Atheism in the next.

How this Person in so great Esteem with that party, when he was able to
protect them, could do so little to suppress them, is not to be expressed any
other way than King James in the Conference at Hampton Court, upon occasion of
a needless exception taken by Dr. Reynolds, at a passage in Ecclesiasticus,
expressed himself; What trow ye make these men (said the King) so angry with
Ecclesiasticus: By my sal I think he was a Bishop, or else they would never use
him so.

One that a great while followed him, but afterward unworthily set up a
Gallery in Mr. C. Church (demonstrating that he attended not the Preacher but
Interest, for he was, he said, the same man still, but they had not the same
design; and Young men were fittest to make use of to trouble or over-turn a
State, as Old men were fittest to settle it) complained that once he personally
inveighed against him, whereunto a grave Gentleman, not so Great, but more
Honorable than he, returned: Truly, I thought it meant me, for it touched my
heart; Good men make Sermons, it is guilty hearts make Invectives. When the
Whirl-pool of the giddy times drew in those that went with the stream, it could
not swallow him that kept above it; Long did he strive to bring off Stroud and
others his Hearers to him and reason. In vain did they strive with him to bring
him to them and Faction: as long as it was to any purpose, he Preached to them
their duty, and when that would not succeed, he constantly avoided their sins;
neither reading their Declarations, nor observing their Fasts, nor complying
with their Festivals; Insomuch that a leading man that had been of his
Congregation upon a long Letter, he sent to him containing an account of
himself and his proceedings since the troublesome times, expressed himself in
the House to this purpose, That he could not tell what they should do with the
good old Puritans; whose misguided zeal should do the Cause more harm, than all
their Young Friends pains could do it good.

He preached for the King as long as he could, and when he could not, by reason
of infirmities and grief, he prayed for him as long as he lived; keeping honest
men, that were turned out of their own Churches, to preach in his, until he
went out of the world. Alleging to those that liked not that way, that in
times of persecution, the Council of Carthage enjoined all Clergymen that had
Churches, to offer their Desks and their Altars to them that had none. As he
preached not common-places of things to which he wrested the Scripture, but
went through the Scriptures (as Genesis 12, 13, 14, 15, Whereof the 16th is in
Print.
16, 17, 18, etc. Chapters, the Plagues of Egypt in Exodus, the 16. of St.
Luke, the Beatitudes, etc.) drawing from them genuinely Divine Truths; so
advised those about him not to follow men that set up notions of their own, and
then serve some Scriptures to make Affidavit for them; but those that opened
the Scriptures most skilfully, and deduced obvious, proper, and clear
conclusions out of them most faithfully. This Primitive Man's gifts, were like
the Primitive Christians goods, in common: Being above others alone, and above
himself in company; as Ambergreece is sweet in its self, but incomparable when
compounded. He was a good Pastor himself (most of the eminent, both Christians
and Ministers in London, having profited by his Ministry) and not jealous that
his memory might be out-shined by a brighter successor; nor willing that his
people should find his worth by the unworthiness of him that came after him,
prayed for a better. His Estate was more in blessing than in bulk, his richest
Legacies were his Precepts and his Example, and his best Monument the hearts of
his people, that will be his joy and crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord
Jesus.

THE Life and Death OF Sir JOHN SUCKLING.
THE last Bishop we mentioned, was the last that died with the honor of Voting
in Parliament, (that was not speechless before he departed.) This Gentleman was
the last Courtier that died at Court: Dying as he was born a Courtier, heir to
Sir John Suckling the Comptrollers estate, but not his temper, being as aerie
as the other was solid; this grave Family, like heavy bodies evaporating into
more aieral parts toward its dissolution.

There was an extraordinary Circumstance in his birth, that raised an unusual
expectation of his life, being born, as his Mother reckoned, the beginning of
the eleventh month. Now (...). Hypocrates allows, that the child born in the
seventh month, if well looked too, may live. Laurentius Professor of
Montpellier, in an admirable Treatise of Anatomy asserteth, that a child of
nine or ten months, which he calls Terminus Inter medius, seldom miscarrieth.
And Avicen, as he is quoted by Laurentius averreth, that a child born in the
eleventh month, which he expresses, Terminus ultimus quando nihil additur ad
perfectionem partis, sed ad perfectionem roboris; is vigorous and Athletique.
As Sir John Suckling, who did as Tiberius, vultu Principem (generosum)
praeferre, had a sprightly mind, that was an argument of a more sprightly soul,
which took in improvement faster than Tutors could suggest; speaking Latin as
early as Drusius his Son did Hebrew, that is, at five years of age; and
composing both in Latin and English for Princes, as soon as Grotius did, that
is, at nine years: being so soon a man, that like Who is supposed created, as
if he had been so.
Adam, we would think he was born so. The Arts were as closely united in him,
as they are in themselves, being competently seen in all of them, and yet
eminent in many, being able to look in the whole circle without a giddiness. He
had tongues enough to renew that good understanding among men, that was lost at
Babel; desiring not only to live in the world, but to understand it; and as
great reason (which we call Logic) to comprehend and discourse his notions, as
he had charms, which we call Rhetoric, to insinuate them; and what was more,
it was a question, whether he was more skilled in the Philosophy of the two
Globes, or in the History and Chronology of all times, he shooting through any
subject from one end of the world to the other, with the same activity that
spirits do, who do not discourse, but see. His soul almost as large as that
which some call (under the first being) the soul of the world. He died under
thirty, and was as old as the world, being able to treat of all those things
from books, which in twelve years time, that all the wisdom of the world could
insist on from experience in 5000 years; suffering himself to be no stranger to
Cosmography, or the account of the world in general, for his own satisfaction
as a Gentleman; to Choroghaphy, or the particularnature of each Province of the
world, for the service of his Country as an Englishman; to Topography, or an
inspection into the circumstances of each place, to qualify him for noble
employments and commands as a Soldier. And all these sweetened with the
softness of Poetry, that Music and Charm of the world in words, and with
Music, that Poetry in sound. Fancy being his predominant faculty, as the
sanguine complexion was his controlling temperament, was as restless and
ubiquitary in him, as it is defined in its self; creating and tempering the
Images and Ideas of things, with the same ease that the things themselves were
first made with. To lift too high is no fault in a young Nagg, and to fancy too
high was the greatest defect of this young Gentleman. Nimbleness is the
perfection of fancy, and levity the bane of it; when it whisks up and down to
so many objects, that it thoroughly understands or conceives none, unless hard
and knotty studies, such as Philosophy and Mathematics, that fix and settle
the soul.

Sir John Suckling, that was Knighted 1630. was Comptroller of the Kings-house,
and told this Gentleman, That he had no more to do but to comptrol and govern
himself, be being born before him. The height of his parts, he acknowledged
the effect of the discretion of his Tutor (of whom he would seldom speak
without this Note, That it was one thing to be discreet, and another thing to
be learned, the management and use of a man's notions being hardly consistent
with a heap and crowd of them, as a midling state makes a good Husband,) who
humored his disposition as much as some Boys are forced to humor their Masters;
and made as many Rules of his temper, as he found in his Grammar, being at once
so ingenuous and so pliable, that a frown was severe correction to him, and
shame whipped him more smartly than the Rod. He as solemnly honored his Masters
of all ingenuity, as Dr. Whitacre did his Tutor West; when being Regius
Professor, at his Tutors Commencing Doctor, publicly gave him thanks before
the University, for giving him correction when his young Scholar. But had most
regard to his Father, for he best bowls at the mark of perfection, who besides
the aim of his own eye, is directed by his Father, who is to give him the
ground; according to whose advice he traveled his own Country well first, and
then (in my Lord Burleighs method, who seldom licensed a man to travel abroad,
until he could give him a good account of the remarkables at home) went over
beyond Sea, to see how mankind managed those principles in their practice, that
they had drawn up in their writings; and observe how they lived and conversed,
as well as how they thought; making an honorable collection of the virtues of
each Nation, without any tincture of theirs, unless it were a little too much
of the French Air, which was indeed the fault of his complexion, rather than
his person. Though to correct it, he traveled from the softer dalliances of
that Nation, to the Wars and hardships, to knit as well as enlarge his soul,
and gain an Empire over his frailer self, with the same severity and
discipline, that Gustavus was like to gain one over Europe. With whom he run
the hazard of three battles, five sieges, and as many skirmishes, wherein he
saw much design and contrivance, so much conduct and manage, such activity and
industry in six months, as was not to be seen elsewhere in so many ages; there
being a concurrence of the excellencies, as well as of the men, of all Nations.
Insomuch, that though my Lord Goring would not admit Sir John Suckling into the
Secret Councils they held in the North, because he was too free and
open-hearted, yet the King gave him a Command there, because he was valiant and
experienced.

He raised a Troop of Horse, so richly accoutred, that it stood him in 12000 l.
bestowing the Horses, Arms and Clothes, upon each person that was Listed under
him; which puts me in mind of the Duke of Burgundy's rich preparations against
Swisse, of which Expedition it was said, The Enemy were not worth the Spurrs
they wore. And of his late Majesty's report, upon the bravery of his Northern
Army, That the Scots would sight stoutly, if it were but for the English- men's
fine clothes. And of another passage at Oxford, where the King in some
discourse of the Earl of Holland, and other Commanders in the first Expedition
against the Scots, was pleased to express himself to this purpose, That the
Army was not in earnest, which made him choose such Commanders in Chief.

But indeed it became him better to sit among a Club of Wits, or a Company of
Scholars, than to appear in an Army; for though he was active, he was soft and
sweet withal; insomuch, that Seldom went away with the character of Deep and
Learned, Hillingworth was reckoned Rational and Solid, Digby Reaching and
Vigorous Sands and Townsend Smooth and Delicate, Vaughan and Porter Pious and
Extatical, Ben. Johnson Commanding and Full, Carew Elaborate and Accurate,
Davenant High and Stately, Toby Whispering nothing in some ^^dies ear.
Mathewes Reserved and Politic, Walter Mountague Cohaerent and Strong,
Faulkland Grave, Flowing, and Steady, Hales Judicious and Severe; but Sir John
Suckling had the strange happiness (that another Great Man is eminent for) to
make whatsoever he did become him. His Poems being Clean, Sprightly, and
Natural; his Discourses, Full and Convincing; his Plays, Well-humored and
Taking; his Letters, Fragrant and Sparkling; only his Thoughts were not so
loose as his Expression (witness his excellent Discourse to my L. of Dorset
about Religion, that by the freedom of it, He might, as he writes to my Lord,
put the Lady into a cold sweat, and make him be thought an Atheist; yet he has
put wiser heads into a better temper, and procured him the reputation of one
that understood the Religion that he Professed among all persons, except those
that were rid by that fear of Socinianism, so that they suspected every man
that offered to give an account of his Religion, by reason, to have none at
all) nor his Life so Vain as his Thoughts, though we must allow to his sanguine
composition and young years, dying at 28. some thing that the thoughts and
discipline of time, experience, and severer years, might have corrected and
reduced, Amo in juvene quod amputem.

But his immature death by a Feavor, after a miscarriage in his Majesty's
service, which he laid to heart, may be a warning to young men of his quality
and condition, whose youth is vigorous, pleasures fresh, joints nimble, bodies
healthful, enjoyments great, to look on his ghastly face, his hollow eyes, his
mouldring body, his noisome dust, and to entertain but this one thought, that
what he was, they are, and what he is, they shall be; that they stand on his
Grave, as the Romans did on their Friends, with these words, Go, we shall
follow thee every one in his own order.

Rejoice, O young man, in the days of thy youth, but know that for all these
things God will bring thee to judgment. A Gallant would do well with the Noble
Joseph of The Earls are called (...) because they carry on their heads a
Corc^^t, the Emblem of Nobility; in the fashion of a Tomb, the Emblem of
Mortality.
Arimathea in their Gardens, and among their pleasures.

He died Anno 164... leaving behind him these thoughts of those times, to his
dear friend Mr. Iermin, since the Right Honorable Earl of St. Albans.

1. That it is fit the King should do something extraordinary at this present,
is not only the opinion of the wise, but their expectation. 2. Majesty in an
Eclips, is like the Sun most looked upon. 3. To lie still in times of danger,
is a calmness of mind, not a magnanimity; when to think well, is only to dream
well. 4. The King should do, before the People desire. 5. The Kings friends
have so much to do to consult their own safety, that they cannot advise his,
the most able being most obnoxious; and the rest give the King council by his
desires, and set the Sun, or interest that cannot err, by passions which may.
6. The Kings interest, is union with his People. 7. The People are not to be
satisfied by little Acts, but by Royal Resolutions. 9. There Is no dividing of a
Faction by particular obligations, when it is general; for you no sooner take
off one, but they set up another to guide them. 10. Commineus observes, That it
is fit Princes should make Acts of Grace peculiarly their own, because they
that have the art to please the people, have commonly the power to raise them.
11. The King must not only remove grievances by doing what is desired, but even
jealousies by doing something that is not expected; for when a King does more
than his people look for, he gives them reason to believe, that he is not sorry
for doing what they desired; otherwise a jealous people may not think it safe
enough only to limit the Kings power, unless they overthrow it. 12. The Queen
would do well to join with the King, not only to remove fears, especially since
she is generally believed to have a great interest in the Kings affection; but
to arrive beyond a private esteem and value, to an universal honor and love.
13. The conservation of the general should guide and command the particulars,
especially since the preferment of one suspected person is such a dash to all
obliging acts. 14. Q. Whether the Kings way to preserve his obnoxious friends,
is not to be right with his distempered people? 15. Q. Whether the way to
preserve power be not to part with it? the people of England, like wantons, not
knowing what to do with it, have pulled with some Princes, as Henry the Third,
King John, Edward the Second, for that power which they have thrown into the
hands of others, as Q. Elizabeth. 16. Q. Whether it be not dangerous to be
insensible of what is without, or too resolved from what is within?
And these Advises to his friends about him, at that time when he best
understood himself.

1. Do not ill for Company, Mr. Savage a person that was with him in his
sickness.
or good only for Company. 2. Shun jests in Holy things, and words in jest
which you must give an account of in earnest. 3. Detract from none but your
self, and when you cannot speak well of a man, say nothing. 4. Measure life not
by the hopes and enjoyments of this world, but by the preparation it makes for
another; looking forward what you shall be, rather than backward what you have
been. 5. Be readier to give, than to take applause; and neither to give, nor to
take exceptions. 6. Its as much more to forgive one injury, than to do many
courtesies, as it is to suffer once, than to do many times for a friend; he may
do what he will, that will do but what they may. 7. Its the ruin of many men,
that because they cannot be best, they will be none; and if they may not do as
well as they would, they will not do as well as they may. 9 Whiles wisdom makes
art the ape of nature, pride makes nature the ape of art. The proud man shapes
his body to his apparel, the wise man his apparel to his body; there is great
reason that we should be ashamed of our pride, no reason to be proud of that
which is only the covering of our shame. 10. Entertain no thoughts that will
blush in words. 11. Be in the company of those among whom thou may be wise,
rather than with those among whom thou may be accounted so. 12. In things
necessary go along with the ancient Church, in things indifferent with the
present. 13. Neither upbraid men with your own kindness, nor forget theirs. 14.
Be not constant against reason, nor change your mind without it. 15. Believe
not all you hear, nor speak all you believe. 16. Acknowledge ignorance, and
learn rather than pretend knowlegde, and be ignorant. 17. Do well to satisfy a
good Conscience, and you shall hear well by a good report. 18. Measure not your
self by other men's reports, nor others by your own thoughts. 19. Live as men
that shall dye, and prepare to dye as men that shall live for ever.

PASS now from a pretty Gentleman, that was all wit and festivity (time and
place making the connection) to a Reverend person, that was all gravity and
judgment; and sad certainly the Cause of the Faction, when the wittiest part of
mankind laughed at it, and the most judicious declined it, among whom, as none
more solid, so none more zealous than Dr. Samuel Ward, born at
Bishops-Middleham in the Bishopric of Durham, being a Gentleman of more
ancientry than estate; bred first Scholar of Christ's, then Fellow of Emanuel,
and afterward Master of Sidney-Colledge in Cambridge, and Margaret Professor
therein for above twenty years. His character, which one, who knew him as well
as most men, and could judge of him as well as any man, does bestow upon him,
is this:

AGe, perge, cathredam ornare (quod facis) sacram,
Subtilitate non levi, rapida, vaga,
Sed orthadoxa quam coronat veritas,
Et justa firmat solidit as, patiens librae:
Antiquitatis crypta tu penetras frequens,
Scholasticorum tu profundes vortices,
Te nulla fallit, nulla te scium latet
Distinctionum tela, rationum stropha
Tam perspicacem mente, judicio gravem;
Linguis peritum, tamque nervosum stylo,
His addo genium temperatum, animo,
Placidum, modestum, lite rixosa, procul.
GO to, go on, deck (as thou do) the Chair,
With subtilty not light, slight, Vageas Hair,
But such as truth does Crown, and standing sure,
Solidly fixed will weighing well endure.
Antiquities hid depths thou often do sound,
And School-mens Whirl-pools, which are so profound.
Distinctions threads none can so finely weave,
Or reason wrench, thy knowledge to deceive.
None thy Quick-sight, grave Judgment can beguile,
So skilled in Tongues, so sinewy in style;
Add to all these, that Peaceful Soul of thine,
Meek, modest, which all brawlings does decline.
He turned with the times, as a Rock rises with the Tide, and for his
uncomplying there with, was imprisoned in St. John's College. He was counted a
Puritan before these times, and Papish in these times; and yet being always
the same, was a true Protestant at all times. How many men suffered in this
one, 1. First, an exact Linguist, by the same token, that when toward the most
excellent and last Translation of the Bible in King James his time, the Prayer
of Manasseh, and the rest of the Apocrypha was committed to his trust among
Eight other Cambridge Men, when he was but Master of Arts of Emanuel College,
the Revisers never reviewed his performance, Dr. Smith, and Dr. Reynolds, who
were Entrusted with the last Revises, saying, We have heard of second thoughts
Correcting the first, but thought shall Correct the twentieth: And not many
passages cost him fewer; for he would say had never been a Scholar, but for a
habit of exactness which he got under an accurate Master; and there is no other
advantage in either going to good Schools, or continue in Universities, than to
keep the Soul from being unravelled and loose, by a constant acting of
thoughts, and expressions to the Rule of accuracy taught in those Schools, and
practiced in those Universities; whence by never missing exactness of thoughts,
seldom failed of hitting things; and his steady words seldom fell either
beyond, besides, or short of his thoughts.

2. A sound Scholar, and therefore by an Excellent Scholar as well as good man,
Bishop James Mountague, chosen Chaplain for his Family, and Assistant for his
Study.

3. A discreet man, and upon that score by the same Bishop chosen by him his
Notery; that is, his Eye and his Ear: For when Mr. Thrash the violent
Sabbatarian came to be Ordained, and it was a Question whether he had ever
sucked of the Breast of the Universities, or brought up by hand in some petty
School, Mr. Ward refused him, as altogether insufficient; however afterward he
crept into Christian Orders to broach Judaizing Doctrines by some rash hands,
which might wish with Martianus, a Bishop of Constantinople, who made Sabbatius
a Jew, and turbulent man Priest, they had been laid on Thorns and Briars, than
on such a man's head; upon a Certificate, which was then matter of Courtesy,
and not matter of Conscience, the good Bishop trusting to his own Eye for the
sufficiency, and to other men's hands for the carriage of the Man; an error in
the first concoction, is seldom corrected in the second, an unworthy, and
therefore turbulent man, (for worthless men must make up that in trouble, which
they lack in worth: Dwarfs are troublesome and peevish, and Children clamber
where they cannot reach) being not so easily got out of the Church by
suspension and deprivation, as might be kept out without Ordination, which does
perpetuate the Faction, and make the Party Immortal.

4. A grave governor and successeful, and therefore by the Honorable H. Lord
Gray, Earl of Kent, who has this Character in all the Cambd^ns Britannia's,
which escaped the Index Expurgatorius, that (for what reasons the Inquisitors
knew best) blotted these words out, Verae Nobilitalis Ornamentis vir long
Honoratissimus; and John Lord Harrington Executor to the Lady Francis Sidney,
Daughter of Sir Henry, Aunt of Sir Philip Sidney, Relict of Thomas Ratcliffe
the third Earl of Sussex, and Foundress of Sidney-Sussex College in Cambridge,
the third Master of that House, 1609. and by his Patron and Predecessor Bishop
Mountague, Archdeacon of Taunton, where so moderate and mild his Government,
that there was not in the first eight years of his Government a Negative voice
in any affair of the House; he taking care to beget a general understanding
about any matter in debate in private, before they sat upon it in public,
tuning each string before they set to a Consort; his Discipline so becoming and
exemplary, that Sir Francis Clerk of East-Soton in Bedfordshire coming
privately to Cambridge to see, unseen took notice of Dr. Wards daily Presence
in the Hall, with the Scholars Conformity in Caps, and diligent performance of
Exercises to so good purpose, (the careful observation of old Statutes, is the
best Loadstone to attract new Benefactors) that he augmented all the
Scholarships in the Foundation, Erected a new fair and firm Range of Building,
and Founded four new Fellowships; discovering by the way such skill in
Architecture and Arithmetic, that staying at home he did provide to a Brick
what was necessary for the finishing of the aforesaid Building.

5. Such his Reputation for deep skill in Divinity, that he with the Reverend
Dr. Davenant of Queens, Dr. Carleton Bishop of Chichester, Dr. Hall Dean of
Worcester, was sent from the Church of England by King James to the Synod at
Dort, to assist the Dutch Churches in the five Controversies of Predestination
and Reprobation, of the extent of Christ's death; of the power of man's free will
both before and after his Conversion, and of the Elects perseverance; and to
that purpose with Dr. Davenant, sent for by that Learned and deep-sighted
Prince to Royston, October. 8. 1618. where His Majesty vouchsafed his familiar
Discourse with them for two hours together, commanding them to sit down by him
till he dismised them with this solemn Prayer (which the good man would
recollect with pleasure) That God would bless their endeavors.

At that Synod, besides the common Applause, he had with his Brethren testified
by the 10 l. a day allowed them there; the entertainments given them at the
Hague, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Vtrecht and Which said Sir Dudley Carleton in his
Spe^ch to the States, they saw only, being not much made of there.
Leiden, by the 200 l. the Meddals, and the Commendatory Letter sent with them
at parting; thence had they this peculiar Character, that he was slow but sure,
recompensing in the exactness of his notion, what he wanted in the quickness of
it, being but once contradicted, and that at the first opening of that middle
way, he and his good Friend Davenant opened to them, which surprised some in
the Synod at first, but reconciled the Synod to them, and to its self at last;
the moderate that cut the hair in a Controversy, like those that part a Fray,
meet with blows on both sides at first; but embraced by those very arms that
were lift upon them at last: Bishop Carleton came home with this Commendation
in the States public Letter to King James.

Dominus G. Landavensis Episcopus imago, and expressa virtutis Effigies; Dr.
Ward returned with these Testimonies from the most Eminent Scholars in those
Parts: Modestia ipsa quae plus celavit eruditionis quam alii habent Literarum
Abyssus taciturnus and profundus, qui quot verba tot expressit e sulco pectoris
or acula, etc. and among the rest, in iis eam eruditionem, pietatem, pacis

Majestatituae multum debeamus, (they are the States expressions to the King in
their foresaid Letter of thanks) Magna pars ipsius beneficii nobis videatur,
quod ipsi ad nos missi sun^; with which testimonial Letters they came over and
presented themselves to King James, who seeing them out at a window when first
entering the Court: Here comes, said he, my good Mourners, alluding to their
black habit, and the late death of Queen Anne. When he was to perform any
exercise as the part assigned him in the For our Di^ines managed their business

English College, which was generally to oppose, because of his acuteness and
variety of reading; or to give his weekly account to the King, as they all did
by turns, the expectation was great, especially in one respect, as King James
would say, that he would set down no idle or impertinent word.

6. So good a man that he was Tutor as well as Master to the whole College;
yea, kept almost as big a College by his goodness, as he governed by his
place; more depending upon him there and abroad as a Benefactor, than did as a
Governor. Being a great recommender as well as incourager of Worth, he used to
say that he knew nothing that Church and State suffered more by, than the want
of a due knowledge of those Worthy men that were peculiarly enabled and designed
to serve both: And, as another Argument of his goodness, he went always along
with the moderate in the censures of Preachers in the University, practices in
the Courts that were under his Jurisdiction: And in Opinions in the
Convocation, whereof he was a Member, much pleased with a modest soft way, that
might win the persons and smoother their errors, being much pleased with his
Friend Mr. Dods saying, that men should use soft words, and hard Arguments.

And this so much known to others, (though so little observed by him, this meek
and slow speeched Moses his face shining to all men but himself) that it
procured six or 7000 l. Improvement in his time to the College, besides the
Building of that Chapel which he Dedicated by his own burial, being the first
that was buried there: His Virgin body enjoying a Virgin grave, like that of
the Lord, wherein never man lay.

School-Divines had their Beds; and the modest man resting where that modest
order slept, who called themselves Minorites, from Jacobs words, Genesis 32. 10.
Sum minor omnibus beneficiis suis.

Yea his Adversaries themselves admiring him so far, that he was named one of
the Committee for Religion in the Jerusalem Chamber, 1642. whither he came with
hope that moderation and mutual compliance might find expedients to prevent,
if not the shaking, yet the overturning of Church and State; so the wary
Merchants throws somethings overboard to save the Ship, which escapes not by
struggling with the storm, but by yielding to it. And inserted one of their
Assembly, whither he came not, being not called by the King (one of the flowers
of whose Crown it is to call Assemblies, as appears by Bishop Andrews his
Learned Sermon of the Right of calling Assemblies on Numbers 10. 12.) nor
chosen by the Clergy; and because there was a legal Convocation in being, that
superseded this Illegal Assembly wherein it was in vain for few Oxthodox men to
appear, being overvoted by their numerous Antagonists.

But since he could not serve the King and Church with his parts, he did with
his Interest, cheerfully sending the College Plate to the King, and zealously
(when the Committee of the Eastern Association was settled there) protesting
against any Contribution to the Parliament, as against true Religion and a good
Conscience, for which he was At St. John's, and in his own College till he dyed.
Imprisoned, Plundered, and tormented; and as high winds bring some men to
sleep, so these storms brought this good Doctor to rest, whose dying words, (as
if the cause of his Martyrdom had been Engraven on his heart) breathed up with
his Divine Soul, Now God bless the King, though the worst word that came out of
his mouth was to Cromwell, That when they destroyed the Church Windows, you
might be better Employed.

A Pupil of his compares him and Dr. Collings Professor, to Peter and John
running to our Saviors Grave, in which race John came first, as the youngest
and swiftest, and Peter entered into the Grave. Dr. Collings had much the speed
of him in quickness of parts, the other pierces the deeper into underground,
and deep points of Divinity; neither was the Influence either of Loyalty or
Sufferings confined to his own Person, but was effectual upon all his
Relations; for we find Richard Ward of London Gentleman Compounding for 0234
l. 00 00 And Henry Ward, for 0105 l. 00 00 Besides Mr. Seth Ward, the Ornament
not only of his Family, but of his Country, expelled Sidney College for his
Loyalty, tossed up and down for his Allegiance, till his incomparable temper
and carriage recommended him to the Family of my Lord Weinman at Thame-Parke in
Oxfordshire: his great skill in Mathematics, opened his way in those sad
times, to the Astronomy Professorship in Oxford, (they thought there would be
no danger in his abstracted and unconcerned discourses of the Mathematics) his
extraordinary worth commanded Respect and Encouragement from Worthy men of all
persuasions, excepting O. C. who told him when he stood for the Principality of
Jesus College in Oxford, That he heard he was a deserving Person, but withal
a Malignant; his great Ability, especially for Discourse and Business,
commended him to the Deanery first, and afterward to the Bishopric of Exeter;
no Employment a Clergyman ever was capable of, being above his capacity, who
writes to the eternal honor of this Doctor his Uncle, in the Preface to his
Lectures, set out with Bishop Brownrigg's his Overseers consent, and Dr. Ward,
Mr. Hodges, Mr. Mathewes, and Mr. Gibsons pains, thus: Ille me puerum
quandeconnem a Schola privata (ubi me tune aegre habui) ad Academiam vocavit,
ille me valetudinarium recreare solitus est, and omni modo refocillore, ille
mihi animum ad studia (ad motis lenitur Calcaribus, praemiisque ante oculos
positis) accendere solebat, ille mihi Librorum usum suppeditavit, ille me in
Collegii Societatem (quam primum Licebat) cooplavit, ille mihi Magister unicus
erat, and Patronus, and Spes, and Ratio studiorum. With whole words we will
finish this poor account of him (whose worth might be guessed, by the method of
his Study, the exactness of his Diary, the excellency of his Lectures.) Novit
haec omnia Collegium Sidneianum, cui plus quam 30 annorum spatio summa cum

Here after these Noble and Loval Ushers, comes in the King himself, not the
exact time he was beheaded on, but yet the very minute he suffered; for though
Charles was Martyred 1648. the King was killed 1644. For it is not the last
blow that fells the Oak; besides, that the lifting up of some hands in the
Covenant now enforced, was to strike at his life, according to the most refined
sense of that solemn snare declared by Sir Henry Vane, who best understood it;
having been in Scotland at the contrivance of it, at his death, June 14. when
he was most likely to speak sincerely what he understood. His Person was in
danger when they aimed at his Prerogative; The Conclusion is to a discerning
person wrapped up in the premises, for I reckon his life was in danger when
their was nothing left him but his life to lose.

The Life, Reign, and Death, of the Glorious Martyr; CHARLES I. of Blessed
Memory.
I May Praeface this sad Solemnity, as the Romans did their more joyful ones,
that were to be seen but once in an hundred years; Come and see what none that
is alive ever saw, none that is alive is ever like to see again.

See a King, and all Government, falling at one stroke. A Prince once wished,
that his People had but one Neck, that he might cut them off at one blow; here
the People saw all Princes with one Neck, which they cut at one attempt: a
stroke levelled not at one King, but Monarchy; not at one Royal Person, but
Government.

See England, that boasted of the first Christian King, Lucius; the first
Christian Emperor, Constantine; the first Protestant Prince, Edw. 6. glories
now in the first Martyred King, Charles I. A Martyr to Religion and Government:
The Primitive Institutes of the first of which, and the generally owned
Principles of the second of which, other Princes have maintained with their
Subjects blood, he with his own: Others by Laws and Power kept up both these,
while they were able; he with his Life, when he was not able; supporting that
very Authority it self, that supports other Princes; throwing himself the great
Sacrifice into the breach made upon Power, to stop popular fury; and choosing
rather not to be himself in the World, than to yield that that World by his
consent should be Lawless or Profane.

A Martyr, who stood to the Peoples Liberty, though with his own Captivity:
that held up their Rights, with the loss of his own; had a care of their
Posterity, with the ruin of his own Family: that maintained the Law that
secures their lives, with his own: that could suffer others to distress him,
but not to oppress his People: that could yield to dye, but not to betray his
Subjects, either as Christians, or as Englishmen.

See the last Effort of Virtue, Reason, Discipline, Order, bearing up against
that of Villainy, Disorder, Licenciousness, and things not to be named among men.

glory and amazement of Mankind, for an Innocence that was most prudent, and a
Prudence that was most innocent. A King, that when most conquered, was more
than Conqueror over himself.

His Extraction and Birth.
A King, deriving more honor to, than he received from his British and Norman
Ancestors. Whose Daughter Ma^gare^ married J. 4 of Scotland.

Aethaling, etc. from whom he Aethaling 's Daughter married Malcolme Conmor K.

Scotland, and Anne of Denmark, to whom he was born Nov. 19. 1600. at

Christened privately. Providence (says the excellent Writer) seeming to
consecrate him to sufferings from the Womb, and to accustom him to exchange
the strictures of greatness, for clouds of tears. Though yet of such hopes,
that an old Scotchman, taking his leave of King James, upon his departure for
England, waving Prince Henry, after some sage advice to the King, hugged our
Martyr, than three years old, telling King James, who thought he mistook him
for the Prince, That it was this Child who should convey his memory to
succeeding Ages.

His Education and Hopes.
A King, that under the tuition of Sir Robert Caryes Lady, the first Messenger
of Q. Elizabeth's death; when the Scots thought the Q. would never dye, as long
as there was a majestic and well-habited old Woman left in England: And under
the Paedagogy of Mr. Thomas Murray, and the Lectures of King James himself,

the Parliament; and what a Mediator of service between them and the King! He,
in the Kings name, disposed them to seasonable supplies of his Majesty; and he,
in the Parliaments name, disposed him to a necessary War with Spain. How tender
were they of his honor, and how careful he of their Privileges! In a word,
when but young, he understood the Intrigues, Reserves, and Maxims that make up
what we call Reason of State, and when King, he tempered them with Justice and
Piety; none seeing further into the Intrigues of Enemies, none grasping more
surely the difficulties and expedients for his own design, none apprehending
more clearly the events of things, none dispatching more effectually any
business; insomuch, that when his Council and Secretaries had done, he would
take the Pen, and give more luster and advantage to VVritings, (saying, Come, I
am a good Cobbler) wherein he would strangely meet with all difficulties
imaginable; so that it was truly said of him, That had he been Privy
Counselor to any other Prince, he had been an Oracle; carrying, with H. 4.

His first Parliament.
His first Parliament, notwithstanding it was made up of soft Noble, and
troublesome Commons, both made perverse and wanton by long peace and plenty and
desire of change, of factious demagogues, whose humor men of boundless and
ambitious hopes made use of, he moderated with a clear account given of the
whole administration of Government, and a benign answer made to all their
Petitions, to a concession of a few subsidies, toward the War with Spain,
which they set him upon; and which, notwithstanding the disasters of his Navy

wasted; and the Plagues raging in London; ended in an honorable Peace.

His Coronation and Frugality.
His Coronation frugal, he reserving his Treasure for more necessary occasions
than Pomp; not out of his own inclination, for his repair of Paul's, his Navy,
and other instances, demonstrate him magnificent; but out of his fatherly
regard to the condition he found his Kingdoms Treasures in, drained by the
Scots, and not cheerfully supplied by the English, without harsh conditions: so
unwilling were we, when we knew not what to do with our Money, to secure the
whole of our Estates, by allowing him a part; and yet improved by him so far,
as to serve the majesty of the Crown for 15. Years; to support a War with two
of the greatest Potentates in Europe; to supply the King of Sweden, and bear
the charge of the first Scotch Expedition, without any considerable
contribution from the people. They that made him first Necessitous, in order to
the making of him Odious; decried him for covetous, because he rewarded not men
according to their boundless expectation, but according to their exact merit;
being liberal, not vain; and loving to do good to the whole Kingdom, rather
than to particular persons; as Steward of a public treasure, rather than a
Lord of his own; making his Virtue serve the necessities of the Realm, which
others Vices would not.

His second Parliament.
His second Parliament, notwistanding the contracts between Buckingham and
Bristol, the bitterness of the Remonstrators of the Lower House against him,
and his Instruments of State; yet he sweetened so far, he granting their
Petition of Right, they bestowing on him five Subsidies, that their modesty,
and his goodness, strived which should exceed each other.

The Benefits of his Government.
A King, ^^s dismission of the Insolent French.
Of so much honor, that when his French Subjects abused his Queen, he durst
bravely, yet liberally dismiss them, though he might look for a War to follow,
which he valued not, when by his Caresses he had melted, and obliged the Queen
to a contentment, choosing a foreign war rather than household broils. 2. Of so

estate was low, and his debts high, 400000l. upon the relief of the French
Protestants, in embassies of Peace, and designs of War, though both
unsuccessfull, the unhappiness of his Ministers, not any fault of his. 3. Of so
much prudent goodness as to restore Delinquents, such as A. B. Abbot, Lord Say
to favor; to prefer Wentworth, and Savile; to advance Dr. Potter, and other
moderate men: a course that if it did not oblige but encourage the faction,
finding such rewards for being troublesome, it was because they had but one
grievance really, however they pretended many, and that was Government it self.
4. Of so peaceable and good a nature, as to choose rather to settle peace at
home and abroad by prudence, rather than to finish war by violence; this the
way of bruits, more fashionable in the eye of the world; the other the way of
men, more satisfactory to his own breast. 5. Of so much Justice, that the
greatest, witness the Earl of Castlehaven was not secure if he offended the
Laws of God or Man, and of so In that trial of ^umb^^ which he jud^^d unlawful

abroad.
much clemency, that the worst (witness Hammilton, and the Lord Balmarino) was
safe if he did but offend him; he thinking a Kingdom was so troublesome, that
no man would sin either to enjoy or keep it. He subjected his L. Keeper C. and
a L. Treasurer to Trial for Bribery, yet would he hardly admit that his enemies
should be brought to trial for Treasons; he designed men no harm, and he
believed all good of them. Men in his time feared Laws not Men. He would say,
Let me stand or fall by my own Counsel, I will choose any misery rather than
Sin. His Acts were always vouched by his Judges and Divines lawful, before he
would allow them expedient: Nay, the World saw by his condescentions, that he
desired not a power to do harm, but that (as he proved once to a Lord of the
Faction) he thought, that if he had no power to do ill sometimes, he might not
have power when he needed to do good; and Subjects fears of mischief, may
destroy their hopes of benefit. His Prerogative, and his Peoples Liberty, which
made such a noise in the World, agreed well in his breast; the last being as
well his care, as the first. Of a strange counsel that a Lord was reported to
give him, he said, That none durst be so Impudent, as to give it him; For if
they had (said he) I should have set such a mark upon them, as that all
Posterity should have known my Intentions by it, which was ever to govern by
Law, and not otherwise. He was as faithful of his word to others (the reason
why he would not grant the Faction all they desired, as he was advised, because
he would make good to them what he granted) as it was his Interest others
should not be false to Which his Enemies knew so well, that it was b^^
effec^ing him Propo^ repugnant to his Conscience, and they need not fear a
Peace.
him. His great word being, Leave me to my Conscience and Honor, and let what
will befall me. Trouble not your selves (said he, when advised to escape from
Carisbrooke) I have the Parliaments honor pawned for my security, I will not
dishonor my self by my escape. Tell me not (were his heroique words, to a
faithful Counselor, advising him to Expedients to save his Life) what I may
do to save my Life, but what I may do with a safe Conscience: God forbid that
the safety or being of the Church should depend upon my Life, or any mortal
man's: And I thank God I have a Son, that I have reason to believe will love the
Church as well as I do. And being told his death was resolved on, he answered
like himself; I have done what I can to save my life, without losing of my
soul; I can do, I will do no more, Gods will be done.

The blessing of God (...) him and his fortun^.
A King so blessed, while left to his own Justice and Government; not only in
his Family, with a Son, born May 29. 1630. (when a new Star at Noon
congratulated his birth) the earnest of a more numerous Issue, those Props of
Empire, surer than Armies or Navies: but in his Realm, with such peace, plenty
and power, ar enabled him to check the greatness of Austria, and the insolent
Proposals of the King of Sweden: To reduce Ireland to such a condition of peace
and security, as that it paid the charges of its own Government, formerly
deducted out of the English Exchequer: To meditate the repair of St Paul's,
toward which he got together 146000l. To restore such Scottish Lands and
Tithes, as had been stolen from the Crown and Church, during K. James his
minority, to the Crown; with augmentation to the Clergy, and ease to the
People, held in vassalage by their new Landlords; reserving those Landlords
those Lands, to be held of the Crown at a moderate tent, and in spite of these
and other disaffected persons, to ratify such Laws for Church and State as
King James had established: To furnish out such a Navy as brought the
Hollanders (notwithstanding Grotius his Mare Librum, against which Seldom writ
Mare Clausum) to Caress the King and Queen with presents of Ambergreece, and to
crave a precarious use of our Seas, etc. and the Spaniard to coin all his
Bullion in our Mint: His own people could not wish for more happiness than
they enjoyed, unless it were the addition of grace to understand their
happiness grown to such a height, as by the necessity of nature, which put all
things in motion, must decline: Security increasing the trade, Many Arts

arts, glory, and plenty of the Nation, and Justice preserving them, the meaner
sort might Reverence, but need not fear the greatest, and the greatest might
despise, but durst not injure the meanest: All Pickaroons and Pirates were
forced to their nests and sneaking harbors: More Privileges were granted the
People than they had since the Conquests, as that they should part neither with
their money: nor lives, nor services, nor houses, without their own consent in
Parliament; that they should enjoy all the Rights and Liberties they ever had
since they were a People; that they should have a Parliament every three years;
that they should fear neither High Commission, Star Chamber, nor the disposal
of their Children and Estates in the Court of Wards: and more seeming gratitude
a while returned to him, than to any Prince before him: all his future
sufferings being only to set off his orient virtues, and to let the wanton
people know, what a sad thing it is to lose the best of Kings, and be given
over to the pride and violence of the basest of men; to punish our sins with
his patience; who had an (...), a constant course of prosperity in himself,
after a War and overthrow, to be judged by all men, to deserve that prosperity
he wanted; yea, and to have from God a constant assurance, that his prosperity
should be the more prosperous for his misfortunes: he asking Bishop Iuxon,
Whether the Blessed above knew any thing of what was done here upon Earth; and
(upon his reply with the Ancients, that it was probable they might) answering,
That then his sufferings would be sufficiently recompensed with the knowledge
he should have of his Sons prosperity. One Night a Wax Mortar, such as the King
had always by him in his Bedchamber, was, as he thought, quite extinguished
in the Night, yet in the Morning burned very clearly (to his Majesty, and the
Right Honorable the Earl of Southampton's wonder, that lay in the same
Chamber, (as Gentleman of the Bedchamber) that Night, knowing it was really
out, and that none could come in to light it) a presage he afterward applied
thus, That though God might suffer his light to be extinguished for a time, yet
he would at last lighten it again. Hear him himself thus discoursing on the
various events in his affairs, and his prospect of what was to come.

Upon the various Events of the War, Victories and Defeats.
THe various successes of this unhappy War have at least afforded the variety
of good meditations: Sometimes God was pleased to try me with Victory, by
worsting my Enemies, that I might know how with moderation and thanks to own
him and his power, who is the only true Lord of hosts; able when he pleases to
repress the confidence of those who fought against me with so great advantages
for power and number.

From small beginnings on my part, he let me see, that I was not wholly
forsaken by my Peoples love, or his protection. Other times God was pleased to
exercise my Patience, and teach me not to trust in the arm of flesh, but the
living God.

My sins sometimes prevailed against the Justice of my cause; and those that
were with me wanted not matter and occasion for his just chastisement both of
them and me: Nor were my Enemies less punished by that prosperity, which
hardened them to continue that injustice by open hostility, which was begun by
riotous and un-Parliamentary Tumults.

There is no doubt but personal and private sins may oft-times overbalance
the justice of public engagements; Nor does God account every gallant Man (in
the Worlds esteem) a fit instrument to assert in the way of War, a righteous
cause; The more men are prone to arrogate to their own skill, valor, and
strength, the less does God ordinarily work by them for his own glory.

I am sure the event or success can never state the justice of any cause, nor
place of men's Consciences, nor the eternal fate of their Souls.

Those with me had (I think) clearly and undoubtedly, for their justification
the Word of God, and the Laws of the Land, together with their own Oaths, all
requiring obedience to my just commands; but to none other under Heaven without
me, or against me, in the point of raising Arms.

Those on the other side are forced to fly to the shifts of their pretended
fear, and wild Fundamentalls of State (as they call them) which actually
overthrow the present Fabric both of Church and State; being such imaginary
Reasons for self-defence, as are most impertinent for those men to allege; who
being my Subjects, were manifestly the first assaulter of me and the Laws,
first by unsuppressed Tumults, after by listed Forces.

The same Allegations they use, will fit any Faction, that has but power and
confidence enough, to second with the sword, all their demands against the
present Laws and Governors; which can never be such, as some side or other
will not find fault with, so as to urge what they call a Reformation of them,
to a Rebellion against them: some parasitick Preachers have dared to call those
Martyrs, who dyed fighting against me, the Laws, their Oaths, and the Religion
established.

But sober Christians know, That glorious Title can with truth be applied only
to those, who sincerely preferred Gods truth, and their duty, in all these
particulars, before their lives, and all that was dear to them in this World;
who, having no advantageous designs, by any innovation, were religiously
sensible of those ties to God, the Church, and my self, which lay upon their
souls, both for obedience, and just assistance.

God could, and I doubt not but he did, through his mercy, crown many of them
with eternal life, whose were lost in so just a cause; the destruction of their
bodies being sanctified as a means to save their souls.

Their wounds, and temporal ruin, serving as a gracious opportunity for their
eternal health and happiness; while the evident approach of death, through Gods
grace, effectually disposing their hearts to such humility, faith, and
repentance, which, together with the rectitude of their present engagements,
would fully prepare them for a better life, than that which their enemies
brutish and disloyal fierceness could deprive them of, or without repentance
hope to enjoy.

They have often indeed had the better against my side in the field, but never,
I believe, at the bar of Gods tribunal, or their own Consciences, where they
are more afraid to encounter those many pregnant Reasons, both from Law,
Allegiance, and all true Christian grounds, which conflict with, and accuse
them in their own thoughts; than they often were, in a desperate bravery, to
fight against those forces, which sometimes God gave me.

Whose condition, conquered and dying, I make no question, but is infinitely
more to be chosen, by a sober man (that duly values his duty, his soul, and
eternity, beyond the enjoyments of this present life) than the most triumphant
glory, wherein their and mine enemies supervive; who can hardly avoid to be
daily tormented, by that horrid guilt, wherewith their suspicious, or now
convicted Consciences, do pursue them; especially since they, and all the World
have seen, how false and un-intended those pretensions were, which they first
set forth, as the only plausible (though not justifiable) grounds of raising a
War, and continuing it thus long, against me, and the Laws established; in
whose safety and preservation, all honest men think the welfare of their
Country does consist.

For and with all which, it is far more honorable and comfortable to suffer,
than to prosper in their ruin and subversion.

I have often prayed, that all on my side, might join true piety with the sense
of their loyalty: and be as faithful to God, and their own souls, as they were
to me; that the defects of one might blast the endeavors of the other.

Yet cannot think, that any shows or truth of piety, on the other side, were
sufficient to dispense with, or expiate the defects of their Duty and Loyalty
to me, which have so pregnant convictions on men's Consciences, that even
prophaner men are moved, by the sense of them, to venture their lives for me.

I never had any Victory, which was without my sorrow, because it was on mine
own subjects who, like Absalom, dyed, many of them, in their sins; And yet I
never suffered any Defeat, which made the despair of Gods mercy and defense.

I never desired such Victories, as might serve to conquer, but only restore
the Laws and Liberties of my People, which I saw were extremely oppressed;
together with my Rights, by those men, who were impatient of any just restraint.

When Providence gave me, or denied me Victory, my desire was, neither to boast
of my power, nor to charge God foolishly, who I believed at last would make all
things to work together for my good.

I wished no greater advantages by the War, than to bring my Enemies to
moderation, and my friends to peace.

I was afraid of the temptation of an absolute Conquest, and prayed for victory
over others, then over my self; when the first was denied, the second was
granted me, which God saw best for me.

The different events were but the method of Divine Justice, by contrary Winds
to winow us, that, by punishing our sins he might purge them from us, and by
deserting peace, he might prepare us more to prize, and better to use so great
a blessing.

My often Messages for peace showed, That I delighted not in War, as my former
concessions sufficiently testified, how willing I would have prevented is, and
my total unpreparedness for it, how little I intended it.

The Conscience of my Innocence forbad me to fear a War; but the Love of my
Kingdoms commanded me (if possible) to avoid it.

I am guilty of this War of nothing but this, That I gave such advantages to
some men by confirming their power, which knew not to use with that modesty,
and gratitude, which became their Loyalty, and my confidence.

Had I yielded less, I had been opposed less; had I denied more, I had been
more obeyed.

It Is now too late to review the occasions of War; I wish only a happy
conclusion of so unhappy beginnings: the inevitable fate of our sins was (no
doubt) such, as would no longer suffer the Divine Justice to be quiet, we
having conquered his patience, are condemned by mutual conquerings to destroy
one another: for the most prosperous successes on either side impair the
welfare of the whole.

Those Victories are still miserable, that leave our sins unsubdued, flushing
our pride, and animating to continue injuries.

Peace it self is not desirable, till Repentance have prepared us for it.

When we fight more against our selves, and less against God, we shall cease
fighting against one another: I pray God these may all meet in our hearts, and
so dispose us to a happy conclusion of these civil Wars, that I may know better
to obey God and Govern my People; and they may learn better to obey both God
and me: nor do I desire any man should be further subject to me, than all of us
may be subject to God.

His Mercy and Love to his People, Humi^ity and Patience.
A Prince so merciful, so loving to his people, and so humble and patient; that
though severe sometimes to Offenders against the public (and to punish the bad
is a mercy to the good) yet to amazement tender toward Offenders against
himself: No Man dyed in his Reign that he could save, being sparing of that
very blood that others were prodigal of against him: Always more ready to end
the War by a harmless and rational treaty, than by a bloody battle; grieving
when his pity or peaceableness could not save Offenders, of whom he was, as
appeared by Warrants after several battles, as careful as of his own friends,
always remembering with tenderness, that they were his Subjects, even when he was
forced to fight against them as Rebels, of whom (if he took them) he took no
other revenge, than to engage them to be no more deluded, and not to endeavor
his murder (as yet they did afterward) who saved their lives; and if they
must dye, taking care by instructing them, that they should go thither, where
they should sin no more. He reckoned himself never more in his Throne, than
when in the hearts of his people; and when he heard the Parliament gave him
Subsidies, none dissenting, he Wept for Joy, not for the Treasure he had, but
for the Mine he found, his Peoples love: He valued not three Kingdoms, nor his
own life, when to be bought with Propositions that ruined his Kingdoms, such as
the Army brought him the day before he dyed; At the reading of the first of
which, he threw them away, and smelling their design to ruin his honor, as
well as his person, said, I will suffer a thousand deaths, e're I will so
prostitute my Honor, or betray the Liberties of my People: and no wonder if he
would not redeem himself at the rate of a public ruin, when he would not do
it with the injury of any single person: for when the Noble Lady Newburgh
proposed to him a way to escape, when at her House, he refused it, saying, If I
should get away, they would cut you in pieces: a goodness extending to his very
enemies, of whom he said, that the faction he thought could not forgive him,
and (they are his own words) not to make my self a better Christian than I am,
I think I should not so easily forgive them were they Kings: but I tell thee,
Governor, I can forgive them with as good an appetite, as ever I eat my dinner
after a hunting; and that I Will assure you was not a small one.

So humble he was (Majesty being at the highest has no other way to increase
but to condescend) that (inviting persons to discourse with himself, not with
Majesty) he would always begin a discourse with a By your favor Sir; and when
in the Isle of wight recommended a poor old man to Sir Philip Warwick (who had
much of his trust and affection) and told him, he was a very honest fellow, and
had been his best companion for two months together: Not to mention his
condescension to Dr. Hammond when he had lost his voice to teach him himself,
and his care of young Gentlemen that were to travel, whom he would instruct,
among many other lessons, with this, Keep good company, and be always doing,
being as much pleased with the accomplishments of his subjects, as some Oliver,
they say, could not endure to hear a man speak sense. Plato was like to eye,
because he ^^med wiser than the Sicilian Tyrant.
poor spirited Tyrants are with the defects of theirs.

Besides these virtues, that patience, not usual to Kings (whose power bears
hardly the restraints of Equity, much less those of Injuries) that his Book and
Meditations breath throughout, which made him say, when his Guard would have
out a way to poor peoples detriment for him to avoid a shower, that as God had
given him affliction to exercise his patience, so he had given him patience to
bear his afflictions: Patience that managed the cross humors of his friends,
and overcame the malice of his enemies, breathing out with his Soul in Prayers
for them, and to make his mercy immortal, in a charge to his Son to forgive
them. Virtues for which he was always admired even by Foreigners, and at last
applauded even by his enemies, Being deluded, as he said, to unworthy thoughts
of him; but n^w convineed to a great reverence of him.
Mr. Vines saying, that he was sorry he understood not the King sooner, it
being our unexpressible happiness that we have such a Prince, and loss if we
should part with him. Foreigners apprehensions of him take in these words.

The King of Morocco's Letter to King Charles the First.
WHen these our Letters shall be so happy as to come to your Majesty's sight I
wish the spirit of the righteous God may so direct your mind, that you may
joyfully embrace the message I send; presenting to you the means of exalting
the Majesty of God, and your own reward amongst men: the legal power allotted
to us, make us common Servants to our Creator; then, of those people whom we
govern: So that observing the duties we owe to God, we deliver blessings to the
World; in providing for the public good of our States, we magnify the honor
of God like the Celestial bodies, which though they have much veneration, yet
serve only to the benefit of the World. It is the excellency of our bodies to
be instruments, whereby happiness is delivered unto the Nations. Pardon me Sir,
this is not to instruct, (for I know I speak to one of a more clear and quick
sight than my self) but I speak this, because God has been pleased to grant me
a happy Victory over some of those rebellious Pirates, that have so long
molested that peaceful Trade of Europe; and have presented further occasion to
root out the Generation of those, who have been so pernicious to the good of
our Nations: I mean, since it has pleased God to be so auspicious to our
beginnings in the conquest of Salla, that we might join and proceed, in hope of
like success, in the War against Tunis, Algier, and other places, (Dens and
Receptacles for the humane Villainies of those who abhor rule and government)
herein whilst we interrupt the corruption of maglinant spirits of the World, we
shall glorify the great God, and perform a duty that will shine as glorious as
the Sun and Moon, which all the Earth may see and reverence; A work that shall
ascend as sweet as the perfume of the most precious odours, in the Nostrils of
the Lord; A work happy and grateful to men; A work whose memory shall be
reverenced so long as there shall be any that delight to hear the actions of
Heroic and magnanimous spirits, that shall last as long as there be any
remaining amongst men that love and honor the piety and virtue of noble minds.
This action I willingly present to you, whose piety and virtues equal the
greatness of your power. That we who are the Servants to the great and mighty
God, may hand in hand triumph in the glory which this action presents unto us.
Now because the Islands which you govern have been very famous for the
unconquered strength of their shipping, I have sent this my trusty Servant and
Ambassador, to know whether in your Princely Wisdom you shall think fit to
assist me with such forces by Sea, as shall be answerable to those I provide by
Land, which if you please to grant, I doubt not but the Lord of Hosts will
protect and assist those that fight in so glorious a cause. Nor ought you to
think this strange, that I who much reverence the peace and accord of Nations,
should exhort to a War: Your great Prophet Christ Jesus was the Lion of the
Tribe of Judah, as well as the Lord and giver of Peace, must always appear with
the terror of his Sword, and wading through Seas of blood, must arrive to
tranquillity. This made James your Father, of glorious memory, so happily
renowned amongst all Nations. It was the noble fame of your Princely virtues,
which resounds to the utmost corners of the Earth, that persuaded me to invite
you to partake of that blessing, wherein I boast my self most happy. I wish God
may heap riches of his blessings on you, increase your happiness with your
days, and hereafter perpetuate the greatness of your name in all Ages.

Virtues that had they been sweetened with little circumstances such as theirs
are, who observe some minute ways of obliging, and not real, solid, and grand
actions, had pleased the world while he lived, as they astonished it since he
was dead; he aimed at the general good of the Commonwealth, and therefore he
was not careful to be plausible to particular persons, verifying that maxim,
That Ordinary Princes are applauded, but Heroic ones not understood. Virtues
that make it an Impertinence to tell the world that he was temperate, eating
for health, not luxury; and drinking wine mingled with water, excepting when he
eat Venison, concluding the greatest entertainment with a glass of water, beer,
and wine, seldom drinking between meals: that his Recreations were manly and
sober, Chesse, There are methodical and si^^wy extracts of his draw^^ out of
Bishop Laud, Mr. Hooker, and Bish Andrews, therein he draw together all the
arguments giving light and strength to them even while he ^^tomised them.
Books, Limning, excellent Discourse, and Hunting, being the most usual of
them; and that his private converse was free and ingenious, witness his answer
to a Presbiterian Minister who inquired for Captain Titus (a person very
well-deserving of him and his son) that he wondered after so unhappy a discourse
about Timothy he would look for Titus; these being the inconsiderable
Circumstances of his great goodness.

VIII. A King so religious, that his devotion in the Church when young was
equal to his gallantry at Court, his mind being no more softened and debauched
by his fortune, than his body; a devotion not Popular nor Pompous, but sollid
and secret, filling his Soul as God does the world silently, his Soul being
wrapped up in his Prayer not to be Witness his ^^um vednass at Prayer when ^he
sad News of the Duke of Buckinghams death was brought to him: bidding the
Chaplain go on, when he stopped at the disturbance.
disturbed either by the best or worst accident that could happen.

A Devotion to which he made his pleasure (witness his constant calling for
Prayers before Hunting, though before day) and his business, witness his
ordering of Prayers to be made to God, before he Engaged the Rebels at
Brentford (valuing his duty before his safety) whereupon his private Prayers in
restraint, were admired by his Enemies, and his constant attendance on, and
have to Divine Service wherever he was, by his friends. At Bishop Lauds
request he came to Church in the beginning of Divine Service to prevent any
interuption might happen in the public Devotion, and of his own accord he
continued to the end to avoid all Contempt of it. Where his eye was in the
beginning of Sermon, there it was in the end; his attendance edifying as much
by the Example, as the Preacher did by his Doctrine: The established way of the
Church of England was his profession, not so much by Education, as by Choice,
not as a profession he liked, but understood the best in the world: Nothing
more usual than to defame him and others for Inclination to Popery (for to the
great shame of our Profession, and honor of the Roman, all the Reason, Order,
Discipline, Laws and Religion that was in the world, was then reckoned Popish)
and yet nothing rendered him a more conspicuous Protestant than the late
Rebellion, wherein besides his Constancy in Spain against the temptations of
that Court, the solicitations of the Pope, and the restless Importunities of
Priests and Friars, he added these Arguments of his sincerity in Religion, viz.
That in his private Indearments to the Queen when he had most need of her
assistance, he says Religion was the only thing in difference between them;
And in his Legacy to his Children, he bequeatheth them not only Bishop Andrews
Sermons, and Mr. Hookers Policy that might confirm them in the Doctrine and
Discipline of our Church, but Archbishop Lauds book against Fisher the
greatest and strongest Argument and Antidote against the Romists, insomuch that
if the faction had not overthrown his Government, the Papists as appears by
Habernefields discovery had ruined his Person; as afterward many of them
obstructed his Restoration, and his Sons, for no other reason, but that he was
Heir of his Fathers Faith, as well as his Throne.

Religion had the whole power of his soul, as he should have had of his
subjects, whom he desired no further subject to him, than he was to God. How
tender his Conscience! that was resolved (as he enjoined the most Reverend
Father in God, G. now Archbishop of Canterbury, then his Chaplain, if ever he
saw him in prosperity, to put him in mind of it) to do public Penance, for
consenting to the E. of Strafford's death (a deep sense of which action went
with him to his grave) and to the injuries done the Church in England and
Scotland. How careful his heart! in that, when the Commissioners at the Isle of
Wight, urged him to allow the lesser Catechism of the Assembly, (that being,
they said, but a small matter) he said, Though it seem to you a small matter,
yet I had rather part with the choicest flower in my Crown, than permit your
Children to be corrupted in the least point of their Religion. How great his
Integrity! when the Commissioners urged the abolishing of Episcopacy in
England, because he had consented to the abolishing of it in Scotland; and it
was replied, That in Scotland, the Act made to that purpose, in the minority of
King James, was not repealed; and that his consenting to that, was only leaving
them where the Law left them: He said, That Reply was true, but it was not all,
for the truth is (they are his own words) and tell them so the next time they
urge that, When I did that in Scotland, I sinned against my Conscience, and I
have often repented of it, and I hope God has forgiven me that great sin; and
by Gods grace, for no consideration in the World, will I do so again. Neither
was he thus exceedingly religious as a man only, but as a King: Neither was
Religion only his private Devotion, but his public Government, wherein he
aimed at, 1. The peace of the Church, (wherein those parts and abilities that
he saw lost in malice and dissentions, might be very useful to the promoting of
Religion and Godliness) And 2. the honor, maintenance and splendor of the
Church: For the first of which, he consulted sufficiently, in his favors to
Archbishop Laud, Bishop Neile, Bishop Iuxon. For the second, by his endeavor
to recover the Patrimony of the Church in England, Ireland and Scotland, where
his religious intentions gave occasion to their rebellion, who, rather than
they would part with their private sacrileges, resolved on the public ruin.
And for the third, by his great charge in the repair of St. Paul's, and other
places. To say nothing of his godly resolution to buy all Lands and Tithes,
alienated from the Church, with his own Estate, by such degrees as his other
expenses would give him leave; the greatest testimonies of a design to make
Religion as universal of his Empire, next those from his own mouth.

First, Before God.

The Kings Protestation at Christ-Church, when he was to receive the Sacrament
at the Bishop of Armaghs hands.
MY Meaning the Bishop of Armagh.
Lord, I espy here many resolved Protestants, who may declare to the World the
resolution I now do make. I have to the utmost of my power prepared my Soul to
become a worthy receiver, and so may I receive comfort by the blessed
Sacrament, as I do intend the establishment of the true Protestant Religion, as
it stood in its beauty in the happy days of Queen Elizabeth, without any
connivance of Popery. I bless God that in the midst of these public
distractions, I have still liberty to communicate, and may this Sacrament be my
damnation, if my heart do not join with my lips in this protestation.

Secondly, Before the World.

The Kings Declaration to the Reformed Churches.
CHARLES, By the special providence of Almighty God, King of England, Scotland,
France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith; To all those who profess the true
Reformed Protestant Religion, of what Nation, condition and degree soever they
be, to whom this present Declaration shall come, Greeting. Whereas We are given
to understand, that many false rumors, and scandalous Letters, are spread up
and down amongst the Reformed Churches in foreign parts, by the politic, or
rather the pernicious industry of some ill affected persons, that We have an
inclination to recede from that Orthodox Religion, which We were born,
baptized, and bred in; and which We have firmly professed and practiced through
the whole course of Our Life to this moment: And that We intend to give way to
the introduction and public exercise of Popery again in Our Dominions: Which
conjecture, or rather most detestable calumny, being grounded upon no
imaginable, foundation, has raised these horrid Tumults, and more than
Barbarous Wars throughout these flourishing Islands, under a pretext of a kind
of Reformation, which would not prove only incongruous, but incompatible with
the Fundamental Laws and Government of this our Kingdom. We desire that the
whole Christian World should take notice, and rest assured, that we never
entertained in our imagination the least thought to attempt such a thing, or to
depart a jot from that Holy Religion; which when we received the Crown and
Scepter of this Kingdom, we took a most Solemn Sacramental Oath to Profess
and Protect. Nor does our most constant Practice, and daily visible Presence in
the Exercise of this sole Religion, with so many asseverations in the head of
our Armies, and in the public attestation of our Lords, with the
circumspection used in the education of our Royal Offspring, besides diverse
other undeniable arguments only demonstrate this, but also that happy Alliance
of Marriage we Contracted between our eldest Daughter, and the Illustrious
Prince of Aurange, most clearly confirms the realty of Our intentions herein;
by which Nuptial engagement it appears further, that Our endeavors are not
only to make a bare profession thereof in Our own Dominions, but to enlarge and
coroborate it abroad, as much as lies in Our power. This most holy Religion,
with the Hierarchy and Liturgy thereof, We solemnly protest, that by the help
of Almighty God, We will endeavor, to Our utmost power, and last period of Our
life, to keep entire and immovable; and will be careful, according to Our duty
to Heaven, and the tenor of the aforesaid most saCRed Oath at Our Coronation,
that all Our Ecclesiastics, in their several Stations and Incumbencies, shall
preach and practice the same.

Thirdly, Before the Kingdom.

The Kings Declaration and Protestation before the whole Kingdom.
I Do promise, in the presence of Almighty God, and as I hope for his blessing
and protection, (...)
that I will, to the utmost of my power, defend and maintain the true Reformed
and Protestant Religion, established in the Church of England; and by the grace
of God, in the same will live and dye.

I desire to govern by the known Laws of the Land, and that the liberty and
propriety of the Subject may be by them preserved, with the same care as mine
own just Rights. And if it please God, by his blessing upon this Army, raised
for my necessary defense, to preserve me from this Rebellion, I do solemnly and
faithfully promise, in the sight of God, to maintain the just privilege and
freedom of Parliament, and to govern by the known Laws of the Land, to my
utmost power, and particularly to observe inviolably the Laws consented unto by
me this Parliament.

In the mean while, if this time of War, and the great necessity and straits I
am now driven unto, beget any violation of these, I hope it shall be imputed by
God and man to the Authors of this War, and not to me, who have so earnestly
labored for the peace of this Kingdom. When I willingly fail in these
particulars, I will expect no aid or relief from any man, or protection from
Heaven. But in this resolution I hope for the cheerful assistance of all good
men, and am confident of Gods blessing. Sept. 19.

The Result of all which Holy Designs, was these his own brave words, viz.
Though I am sensible enough of the danger that attends my Care of the Church,
yet I am resolved to defend it, or make it my Tombestone.

His Valou^, Resolution, and Conduct.
A Prince of so much resolution and conduct that as he feared not a private
man, lodging Hamilton in his own Chamber all that time he was accused by Rey of
Treason, and saying to those that admired his confidence, That Hamilton should
know he as little feared his power, as he distrusted his Loyalty; and that he
durst not, notwithstanding the advantages of Night, and solitariness, attempt
his life, because he was resolved to sell it so dear. It was his goodness that
he desired not war, and his fortune that he prospered not in it; but his great
valor and conduct when the Militia, Navy, Treasure, Magazines, and
strongholds of the Kingdom were in the factious hands (who had at first more
Garrisons, Canons, and Troops, than he ^ad Families, Muskets, and
Common-Souldiers) that in a few months he raised a guard into an army, and made
his side the most glorious, though theirs were the more dreadful; and having
this glory, that he The Senate of Rome thanked a Consul, though he was beaten,
that he did not despair of the Commonwealth
never despaired of the Commonwealth: but having opportunities by his Progress
abroad among his Subjects to let them see that worth in him, that odious
aspersions had hitherto concealed from them; he was every where judged not only
worthy of their Reverence, but of their Lives and Fortunes, which the Nobility,
Gentry, Universities, ventured so far in his behalf, when they saw in him such
a conduct and prudence, as deserved prosperity, when it could so well manage
adversity; that when the Conspiracy thought he should have been deserted as a
Monster of Folly and Vice, (no man either of Honor, or Conscience, being
likely according to the Character they gave of him, to appear for him) he was
followed by the Noblest, the Greatest, Wisest, the most Learned, and the most
Honest Persons in the Kingdom; with whom, as soon as he saw the Enemy in a
body, and was Asked what he meant to do? he Answered (with a present Courage)
to give them Battle; It is the first time that I ever saw the Rebels in a Body,
God, and good men's Prayers to him, assist the Justice of my Cause. This was at
Edgehill, Oct. 13. 1641.
Where, great his Conduct in managing the fight, great his Valor in
approaching danger, and great his Patience in enduring hardship and pains,
Lying in his Coach all night, and much his Success in pursuing the Faction to
Brentford, where with the great horror of the whole Conspiracy and City, he
sunk their Canon, and took 500 Prisoners: and after a long treaty at Oxford
(when his moderation desired a Peace, and his fortitude had forced his Enemies
to sue for it) his Prudence was eminent in the great associations he made, and
his magnanimity as great in the great actions he performed at Newberry, his
great Armies he got together in the North and South; the seizure and securing
of 126 Garrisons in 8 months; the satisfying of all parts (notwithstanding the
strange stories they were possessed with) by Speeches and Declarations; with
unwearied Travels from place to place; his seasonable Overtures of Peace after
each Success, with assurance of pardon for all that was past; his forcing of
the Faction to beg terms of peace, though their own guilt durst not accept of
them when they had them; his keeping together so many Lords and Commons as he
did at Oxford, and managing the great variety of their humors in Parliament;
his diligent correspondence with Scotland and the City, the good terms he stood
in with the Dutch, the Dane, and the French, and the several Supplies he
procured from thence, wherewith the City it self is awed to a submission,
several Parliamentmen foresaw the ruin of the kingdom by a war, though yet
they that had a design to raise themselves by the overthrow of Government,
would not endure to hear of a peace, pretending (where the Faction was low,
that it was dangerous to be compelled to peace upon disadvantage; and when it
was high, that it was not fit to give away those privileges and immunities in
a Treaty which they had purchased with so much blood and treasure.) The Hothams
and other Criminals conscious of their miscarriage, began to relent, and offer
their services to his Majesty. Hampden and Pym dye, the great Boutfeous of the
Nation; Waller is Defeated, and Essex advises to a Peace, the Earls of Bedford
and Holland Revolt, Essex his Army is Reduced to the Kings Mercy; and if the
King had followed his own Counsels (all the kingdom being his from Cornwall to
Scotland) and instead of loosing time before Gloucester, but repaired
immediately to London, when the Juncto had not one entire Regiment to save
themselves, he had had the Heads of the Conspiracy at his mercy; and those that
he could not entreat to be happy, he could have forced to be so; and those that
were grown too wanton, under the blessed effects of his clemency and good,
would have grown wise upon the gracious condescentions of his power; a power
that should have done them more service than himself, and rendered them more
happy when conquered, than he could be when a Conqueror.

And yet when his Counsel was defeated, his spirit was not so; a spirit that
had the patience to endure miscarriages, and the valor to remedy them; plying
the Besieged at Gloucester hard by his Army, and the enemies insinuation as hard
by his Declaration, especially against the Solemn League and Covenant, an Oath
that Mr. Nigh himself confessed had no parallel. A confederacy of Protestants
like the In France
Guisian League among the Papists. A snare laid upon the people, to swear that
which was not lawful to do, much less to swear they would do against their
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy. The Conspiracy was reduced to such
streights, that as men used to do in weakness, suspect own another; Essex
himself being forced to Subscribe himself,

Your innocent, though suspected Servant. Waller, after a long march of eight
weeks, is beaten at Cropredy-Bridge, where he lost all his Ordinance, and his
General of the Artillery, Weemse the Scot, sworn Gunner to his Majesty; who
being asked why he used the guns the King paid him for against him? answered,
In good faith, his heart was always with his Majesty.

Essex was cooped up at Lethestiel so, as that he was feign to get away in a
Cock-boat, and leave 10000 Horse and Foot to the mercy of his Majesty, who did
them no more harm than to disarm, and engage them by oath to do no harm to
their fellow Subjects. King Henry the Fourth asked one that had been hired to
kill him, when he was discovered, why should he kill him who never had done him
or his any harm? And the man answered, Because of his Religion. Why look (said
the King) thy Religion does teach thee to murder me, who never did thee any
harm; and my Religion teaches me to pardon thee, who would thus have
murdered me. If a man should have asked these poor thousands thus deserted by
their Commanders, why do you fight against so gracious a Sovereign, that was so
far from wronging you while you behaved your selves like good Subjects, that he
cannot punish you now you are Traitors? They would answer, It is for Religion;
and all the world may judge between their Religion, who would needs fight their
Liege Sovereign, when he would do them more good than they were willing to
receive; and his who pardoned them when they had done all they could against
him. Hitherto in other places he conquered them, and here himself; and
satisfied the world that it must needs be nothing but peace, that he aimed at
by his Treaties; when it was nothing but peace, that he designed by his
Victories. He using this success to no other end than as earnestly to entreat
them himself, and all the Noblemen and Gentlemen in his Army as earnestly to
accept of peace, as if he had been conquered, he should have begged it. Willing
he was to settle peace at home, and yet scorned to accept of unhandsom terms
from abroad. All the world saw his Majesty's inclination to a peace, and the
Rebels implacable resolution to go on with the war. The Conspirators had need
of their Brethren the Scots, and the Scots, upon the refusal of his Majesty's
Propositions, were ashamed of them; whence, when they were not likely to be
assisted from abroad, they beg, but upon hard conditions, a peace at home.
Conditions that his Majesty would not yield to in his lowest condition, though
he would have done any thing but sin, to obtain peace at the highest. A peace
that they must have yielded to, had not they new-modelled their design and
their army, by a self-denying Ordinance, cashiering all Officers that retained
any degree of sobriety; and a new model, taking in all Sectaries, to enlarge
and make desperate their party.

Sad is the news the Rebels hear from all parts of England, but very good that
which his Majesty heard from Scotland; where his friends increased as much as
theirs decreased here, such moderate men as Essex, the Who had an honest design
to undo the whole Conspiracy.
Earl of Manchester, and Denbigh laying down their Commissions, when they saw
such taking Commission as had laid down all thoughts of peace. They were first
entertained, because a war could not be begun without the countenance of sober
men, but afterward they were laid aside by the politic self-denial Ordinance,
because the war would be no longer continued by such.

In a word, to such success had the conduct and magnanimity of his Majesty
arrived, that 1645. he writes to the Queen, That he might without being too
sanguine affirm, that since the Rebellion his affairs were never in so hopeful
a way. Not to mention his great personal valor at Naseby, a valor and conduct
that deserved success though at last it wanted it, the King having other
virtues that were to be rendered glorious by sufferings, as this had been by
actions; and therefore he was Betrayed, not Overcome; Sold, and not Conquered.
And yet as his great Spirit at his best fortune endeavored an honorable
Peace, so at his worse he would not admit of a dishonorable one; for measuring
his Propositions not by the event of affairs, but by his own Conscience, he
stands to the same terms when Defeated, as he did when Conqueror; never
betraying his Peoples Liberties to those Usurpers in hope of a Peace, in the
defense of which he thought fit to undertake a war. I know not which is most
magnanimous, that he should with so much hazard venture his Person so
resolutely, and manage his cause against their Politicians and Divines so
bravely, or that he should with so much honor correspond with the Parliament
in his own single Person, answering the arguments of the one, and the proud
messages of the other, and gaining that Conquest by his Pen, that he could not
by his Sword: He is contented to discharge all his Garrisons and Armies, and
that excellent Association in the West, formed by the Prince, with the
assistance of Sir Edward Hide, etc. being upon a design of overcoming his
Enemies, as he did Henderson, etc. and all that had the happiness to know him
by his own Person, and being likely to do more by a Peace, than either others,
or indeed he himself could do by a war, cutting those more than Gordian knots
with the sharpness of his own single reason, that could not be by the edge of
all Englands Sword; when the Scots after many debates with the English, had not
the courage to stand to their Promise, Oath, and Honor, in keeping the Kings
Person, he owned a magnanimity whereby he kept Free, even when delivered, his
own Conscience; they could not be true to duty, when tempted with 800000 ^. nor
he unworthy to his trust, though tempted with three Kingdoms: And now that King
that with his bare presence had raised an Army in the beginning of the war,
that gave a Cheque to Rebellion four years now by his own Conduct (when he had
not one (as they phrased it) Evil Counselor about him) and gallant
Sufferings, he raised the City, and all the Kingdom, to reduce the Rebels to
reason, there being in his lowest condition 54000 Men (and most of them such as
had Engaged against him) up in his defense in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and
England, and things were brought to that pass, by his excellent managery, that
the very Army that overcam^ him, did not think themselves safe, but under his
Protection, and therefore they ventured their Masters displeasure, to gain the
Kings Person, each Party thinking its self more or less considerable, as they
wanted or enjoyed him. The Parliament, as they call it, Voting his Concessions
Satisfactory, on the one hand, and the Army declaring their Propositions to the
King unreasonable: They that durst fight his Armies, yet so far Reverenced his
Person, that they did that to him in his lowest condition, that is usually done
to Princes in their highest, and that is Flatter him, the one saying that he
had done enough, and the other that he had done too much. What a brave sight it
was to see him able to manage his greatest misfortunes with Honor, and his
Enemies their greatest Victories with Confusions, the Army against the Houses,
the Commons against the Lords, yea one part against another, the City for and
against both, the Common Soldiers by a new way of Agitation, whereby they
could spread and manage any treason, sedition, intelligence, plot and design
throughout the Army in a moment, by two or three of the most active, or
desperate, in a Company or Regiment: And he all the while above all these
enjoying the calm that sits in the Upper Region; neither yielding to his
Enemies nor his misfortues; insomuch that when they were so barbarous as to let
him want Linen, he said, They had done so for two months, but he would not
afford them the pleasure of knowing that he wanted. Yea, and when some of them
were too saucy with him in private, he could, though their Prisoner, civillize
them with his look, and Cane. In a word, the Kings fortitude appeared as
eminent as his other vertures (though ecclypsed, as the Divine power is to some
men's apprehensions, by his mercy) in that he could say to the last, that he
should never think himself weakened, while he enjoyed the use of his reason, and
while God supplied with inward resolutions what he denied him in outward
strength, by which resolution he meant not a morosity to deny what is fit to be
granted, but a spirit not to grant what Religion and Justice denied.

I shall never think my self (they are his own Royal expressions) less than my
self, while I am able thus to preserve the integrity of my Conscience.

What great things the King granted, and did for the Nation, during the 23
years that he reigned.
A Prince thus excellent in himself, and choice in his Council, made up of
persons eminent for their services for or against him: for parts and abilities
he equally valued in his enemies and in his friends, and when he saw hopeful,
and accomplished persons lavishing their worth upon a faction, and a private
interest; if they were not of desperate principles, he would encourage them to
lay it out upon the government and the public good. A Prince that never
suffered a subject to go sad from him, never denied his people, but what they
have seen since that they could not saefly enjoy.

That Prince, who besides the great examples he gave them, and the great
intercessions and services he did for them, begun his Reign with the highest
Act of Grace that he could, or any King did in the World. I mean the granting
of the Petition of Right, wherein he secured his Peoples estates from Taxes
that are not given in Parliament, and their Lives, Liberties, and Estates, from
all Proceedings not agreeable to Law. A King that permitted his chief favorite
and Counselor, the D. of Buckingham, whose greatest fault was his Majesty's
favor; to satisfy the Kingdom, both in Parliament and Star Chamber, in the
way of a public Process. And gave up Mainwaring and Sibthorpe, both (as I take
it) his Chaplains, to answer for themselves in Parliament, saying, He that will
preach more than he can prove, Let him suffer: Yea and was contented to hold
some part of his Revenue, as Tunnage, Poundage, etc. which was derived to him
from his Ancestors by Inheritance, by gift from the Parliament. A Prince that
pardoned and preferred all his Enemies; that though accountable to none but
God, gave yet a just account of himself and treasures to the People, saving
them in two years from ordinary expenses 347264 l. 15s. 6d. and gaining them by
making London the bank for Spanish, Dutch, and Danish treasures 445981 l. 2s.
3d. that dashed most of the Projects that were proposed to him for raising
money, and punished the Projectors, that designed no worse things in Religion,
than Uniformity, Peace, Decency, Order, the rights and maintenance of the
Church, and the honor of Churchmen, and in the State no more than the
necessary defense of the Kingdom from dangers abroad, and disorders at home,
which he maintained several years at his own charge; that by destroying several
of the Dutch Herring Busses, and forcing the rest, with all Dutch Merchants, to
trade only by permission in the Narrow Seas, opened a brave trade to the
English Nation.

A King that took so much pains to oblige his Loving Subjects, going twice in
person as far as Scotland (though against the inclination of most of his
Counselors, who looked upon the Scotch Faction, as a sort of people, that
under the pretense of a specious way of plain speaking and dealing, concealed
the greatest animosities and reaches) and twice with an Army, rather to pacify
than overthrow the Rebels; treating with them as a Father of his Country, when,
in all probability, he might have ruined them, if he had proceeded against them
1639. and 1640. as a King, and not, in imitation of the Divine Majesty, wrapped
up the dreadful power he carried then with him, in gracious condescentions of
mercy. A King, that of 346. Libellers, seditious Writers, discovered
Conspirators against his Crown, Dignity and Authority in Church and State, put
none to death; and punished but five throughout his whole Reign.

A King, in whose Reign there were such good Canons made, that Judge Crook, a
Dissenter about Ship Money, blessed God when he read them, that he lived to see
such Canons made for the Church. A King, that publicly declared, That he was
rosolved to put himself freely upon the love and affections of his subjects.
One of the two Propositions he made the Parliament 1640. being to desire them
to propose their grievances, wherein he promised them to concur so heartily
and clearly with them, that all the World might see, That his intentions ever
have been, and are, to make this a glorious and flourishing Kingdom. And to
show his good inclination to Religion, married his eldest Daughter to an
ordinary Protestant Prince: And to the welfare of the Kingdom, he tied himself
to a Triennial Parliament, allowing this Parliament to sit as long as they
thought fit, and for a time to order the Militia; entreating them to set down,
what they thought necessary for him to grant, or them to enjoy; vacating for
their sake the Courts of Star Chamber, and High-Commissions; the Wards, the
Forests; the Court on the Marches of Wales, and the North, Monopolies, For
which the last Parliament would have given him 600000 l.
Ship Money, his haereditary right to Tunnage and Poundage, the Bishops Votes
in Parliament; and doing so much for peace, that one asking Mr. Hampden, a
leading Card amongst them, What they would have him do more? was answered,
That renouncing all his Authority, he should cast himself wholly on the
Parliament.

Yea, as if this had not been enough, A King that suffered all his Ministers of
State to clear their innocence before public Judicatures, in the face of the
World; and though accountable only to him for their actions, yet ready to
appeal to their very accusers themselves for their Integrity; And yet not so
willing to remit his friends to Justice, as his Enemies to favor, if either
they had hearkened to the re-iterated Proclamations of Pardon sent to them
during the War, or acquiesced in the At the Isle of Wight.
Amnesty offered to, and accepted by them; after it, an Amnesty that they might
have securely trusted to, when he bestowed upon them not only their lives, but
likewise for some years all the power over the Militia of the Kingdom to make
good that pardon by which they held their lives: neither had they only the
Sword in their hands to defend, but all places of trust, authority, and
Judicature to secure and enrich themselves; the King allowing them for so long
a time, not only to enjoy all their own places, but to dispose of all others;
adding this favor too, that they who grudged him a power to raise money to
supply his occasions, should have what power they pleased to raise money to
satisfy their own demands; and when he had confirmed the pardon of the Kingdom
in general, he offered the renovation of all Charters, and Corporation
Privileges in particular, denying nothing that their ambition or covetousness
could desire, or his Conscience grant; being willing to be no King himself,
that his people might be happy Subjects; and to accept of a titular Kingdom, on
condition they had a peaceable one. In Religion its self (wherein he denied
most, because he had less power to grant, those points being not his own
Prerogatives, but those of the King of Kings) he grants his Adversaries Liberty
of Conscience for themselves and their followers, on condition he might have
the same liberty to himself and his followers; desiring no more than to enjoy
that freedom as a Sovereign, that they claimed as Subjects. Any thing he
yielded they should take from his Clergy, but what God gave them; Concluding,
That he desired them to be subject to him, no further than that he and they
might be subject to God.

His Sufferings.
That a King that was and did so as he was and did, should be first suspected,
and then opposed, should be rendered ridiculous abroad, and odious at home,
should easier persuade his foreign enemies to a Peace, than his own subjects to
contribute to a War, and that of their own advising and persuading: That such a
King should first suffer in his prime Favorites and Ministers of State, and
then in his own Person: That such a King should be forced to sell his Crown
Lands; to defend and serve them, who would by no means yield any thing to
maintain him; yea, questioned Sr. John Wolstenhome, Mr. Dawes, and Mr.
Caermarthen, Farmers of the Custom House, for levying his ancient Revenue of
Tonnage and Poundage, unless he acknowledged that as their favor, which to
maintain Convoy and Trade, he enjoyed as an haereditary Right: That under such
a King, any should say as Cook and Turner did, That the People had better
perish by a foreign War, than by a domestique Oppresssion; and it should be a
capital offense to enjoy his favor: That one sort of subjects should invade,
and other abbet and libel him: That his ancient Kingdom of Scotland should
throw themselves upon the As appears by a Letter under Londons hand^ to desire
Protection of the French King.
French King, and the Kingdom of England upon French Counsels and Designs: That
so good a Master should be betrayed by his Servants, have his Pocket picked,
his Letters discovered, as Hamilton did Montross's, and the E. of H. And a

did the design against the five Members: That malapert Burgesses should bawl
out Remonstrances, and ^s Fulke and Ven did.
Citizens affronts against so great and so excellent a Majesty. It was
introllerable to frame Conventicles, Associations, and Conspiracies, against
his proceedings in Church and State; but horrid to do so against his Person.
That when they had stood out many years against allowing him any Taxes without
their consent, they shall seize his Crown and Dignity without his; that those
whom he had raised from the people, should adhere to the people against him;
and when they had corresponded with armies that are but tumults mustered in the
North, they should encourage tumults, which are but indisciplined armies in the
South; that the one might drive him out of his Kingdom for fear, and the other
out of the Royal City for shame; that the Scots should sight, and he not dare
to call them He called them Rebls in the first Speech Oct 3 1640. (...) was
forced to explain himself afterward.
Rebels; and his faithful Counselors should assist him, and he not dare to own
them as friends.

That such a King should be As he was to that first 1640. by Sir H V. who ex^

so occasioned their Dissolution. And to the Parliament of Scotland by H. and
Tra. who under the pretense of being Mediators and Commissioners, put the worse
constructions they could upon his actions to the Parliament, and upon theirs to
him.
abused to Parliaments by his servants, and to his people by Parliaments;
should be first entreated out of his Magazines, Castles, and whole Militia, and
then fought against with them; should be forced out of one Town, and shut out
of another; should see his Queen threatened with Articles at one time, and
(though she would not believe that, being loath to think, the English should do
her any ill offices, to whom she had done none but good) afterward impeached
(without any regard to Sex, Virtues, Birth, Allies, and Majesty, circumstances
that would have guarded her from the Barbarous) for no other fault, but for
owning that obedience to her Lord and Husband, which they had renounced to
their Sovereign.

That such a Prince should see his whole Court Voted and dealt with as
Traitors, his Estate Sequestered for Delinquency, his Clergy and Church (which
he was by oath obliged to defend and maintain in its due rights) ruined for
keeping the Fifth Commandment, and Romans 13. his Churches turned to Stables,
his Loyal Subjects Murdered, Plundered, Banished, and he not able to help
them, his Laws and Edicts overruled by, I know not what Orders and Ordinances,
his Seals and great Offices of State counterfeited, all the costly ornaments of
Religion ruined and defaced; Learning, that was his honor and his care,
trampled on, by its and his old enemies the Ignorant. These are things that the
world could never believe till it felt them, and will not believe when the
impressions of them are worn off.

This wise and good King, the same in all fortunes, was he that must pardon his
enemies, but must except his friends out of pardon; he that when all his
Subjects had sworn Oaths of Allegiance to him, must swear an oath devised by
his Subjects (called Covenant) against himself.

He, without whom no oath could he imposed upon the Subjects, has an oath
imposed upon him by his Subjects; and in that oath, must swear that government
in the Church Antichristian, which was the only Christian government for 1500
years. And when Divines dispute that and other points probably, the poor King
and his people must swear them peremptorily.

He that saw an army raised for the King (that is, himself) and Parliament
against himself; and the instruments of death levelled against his person in
his name. And heard the very people promise to make him a glorious King, who
murdered him.

He that a people complained to of grievances, that would not endure the
remedies; that complained that he made and continued a war, when they would not
endure a peace; and when they had voted his Concessions sufficient grounds to
proceed on to the settlement of the kingdom, and yet ruined it.

He that they declared against for raising a Guard at York, Nottingham, to
secure himself, etc. when they raised at Army at London to Take, Imprison, and
Murder him. That must be author of all the blood shed in the three Nations,
after all his Concessions, Messages, Declarations, Treaties, and Overtures, a
sea and mercy to 20000 Rebels to stanch it. And when all the blood that was
spilt before his death, was to rob him of his life and government, as appears
by the five times more blood that was spilt after his death, to make good that
robbery and murder.

He that saw a war begun to remove his evil Council, and ended in the taking
off his Head; and that was said to begin a war, when his first was dated the
very day his enemies army was mustered; the Faction having ordered an army to
take him, before he thought of one to save himself.

This is that Prince, that saw a people in the Name of God, lay hands on his
anointed, Preachers of the Gospel of peace trumpet it for war; Religion made an
argument against obedience, and the Holy Spirit urged against peace and love,
and the Text, He that resists the King, the Ordinance of God, resists to
his own damnation, understood thus: He that resists not shall be Sequestered;
and (that) Curse ye Meroz, that came not to help the Lord against the Mighty,
(thus) Curse ye all Englishmen, that help not the Rebellious against Gods
Anointed: And Fear God, Honor the King; into fear the Lord, and kill the King:
and that where the word of a King there is power, understood thus: The King
shall not have a Negative Voice.

A King that saw himself Engaged, Imprisoned, and Impeached for the peoples
sake, in spite of the peoples teeth, both those that were at first against
him, being undeceived, and those that were always for him, indeed the whole
Nations of England and Scotland venturing their lives to rescue the King, when
he was imprisoned in their name, accused for shedding their blood, when they
were killed by their fellow Subjects, because they desired to save his.

A King that saw a Parliament accuse him of Breach of Privileges, when he came
but to demand five men suspected for holding Intelligence with a Foreign
Nation, and yet the same Parliament suffer tamely its own Army to pull out by
the ears more than half of the best Members, that remained there for promoting
the peace of their, and Vote it the Privilege of the Subjects, to make tumults
from all parts of the kingdom about Westminster, to fright King and Bishops
from the Parliament, and a Breach of their Privilege for the same people in
throngs there from as many parts of the kingdom, to Petition the return of the
one and the other. He from whom they extorted so much liberty in pretense for
the Subject, had neither liberty for himself, being confined to hard Prisons,
and harder Limitations, and Propositions, nor for the Subjects; who had they
enjoyed their own freedom, had never endured his captivity.

He that could not deny the kingdom a Free-Parliament, consisting of above an
hundred Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and five hundred Commons, lived to see
that very Parliament Exclude all its Lords, and Reduce the five hundred Commons
to thirty; who in the name of the people, when there was not one in five
thousand of them but would have ventured his life against it, threaten his
life, whom they had sworn when they entered that House, to defend; prepare to
judge him, who called them there to consult with them; talk as if they would
put a period to his days, who gave them their being (little dreaming that while
they aimed at his Royal Neck, they cut off their own: for what is a Parliament
called to advise with the King, if there be no King to advise with?)

He must be tried in whose name all others are tried, by that Law himself has
made, by those people that had sworn, protested, and covenanted, with hands
lift up to the most high God in public, and pawned their souls and all that
they had, privately to restore him, whose only fault was, that he went from
that Parliament that murdered him, when he returned to them. Riddles! Cromwell,
Whaley, Ireton, etc. and the Army, weep and grieve (but the Hiena weeps when it
intends to devour) at the hard conditions the Houses put upon him; and the
Houses are displeased with the Armies hard usage of him, and yet both ruin him;
the one bringing him to the Block, and holding him there by the Hair of the
Head, and the other cutting off his Head. The Scots durst not trust the
Cavaliers with him, nor the Houses the Scots, nor the Army (a King at lowest
advances that party where he is, though a prisoner) the Houses, nor the Juncto
all the Army; nor N. the Juncto, being never safe till he put his finger into
the Royal Neck, to see after execution, whether the head were really severed
from the body? All the quarrel was, that the Cavaliers kept the King from the
Parliament, and the meaning of it, it seems was, That they kept him from the
Block.

A Prince, they destroyed that they durst not despise, all the Grandees in the
Army not daring to own the least murtherous thoughts toward him publicly,
when they set Who after the King, death, finding their Masters jugglers, would
have done in much for them as they had done for the King, until the Officers
would have laid them aside which they could not do till several of them were
executed.
Agitators, i. e. two active Soldiers out of every Regiment in the Army (now
modelled into such desparate Sects and Villainies) to consult about the horrid
Fact in private, and to draw a bloody Paper, as the Agreement of the people,
which was but a conspiracy of Traitors; Cromwell assuring the King, as he had a
soul, that he should be restored. And his Son Ireton at the same time Drawing
up a Remonstrance that he should dye. The Army treat him like a Prince (and
that they might deceive his devout soul the more securely, allow him the
service of his Chaplains, and the Liberty of his Conscience, the greatest
enjoyments left him in this world) with a design the more successfully to use
him like a Traitor. Ah brave Prince! that none durst have abused, had they
owned what they design, whom the Houses had saved, had they not been Cajoled by
the Army; and the Army, had it not been Cajoled by the Houses. The King granted
too much (says Sir H. V. to him at the Isle of Wight) and too little says the
same man to the Houses) and the King must dye, when whatsoever they asked, they
meant his life.

If the Tears, Prayers, Petitions, Treasures, or Blood of the Nation; if the
intercession of foreign Princes; if the importunity of all the good Relations
that these Regicides had, whereof one pressed hard on O. C. himself, though
without effect, whence ever after he disowned his Relation and Name; if the
endeavors of Loyal souls to do that justice upon the Traitors that durst judge
their King, as one Burghill on Bradshaw, as soon as he heard he was to be
President, who, if not betrayed by his friend Cook, had died the Villains robes

the Marquess of Hertford, to ransom their Sovereign, all ways imaginable, even

under him, so (he, as King, being capable of doing no wrong) they might suffer
all for him. If the horror that seized all Princes of the world, Turkish and
Heathenish, as well as Christian, upon the news of it, with the hatred and
scandal thence arising to the English Nation; if the dissent of the Lords, and
all other persons of any quality that went along with them till now, and had
never suffered this to have happened the King, but that (by the just hand of
God) as bad had happened them; that very Army that they employed to turn his
Majesty out of his just Power, pulled them out of their usurped one. If the
Declarations of their own Judges; if the strong Prayers and Sermons, that could
raise Armies against his Majesty, endeavoring to advance the like for him; if
the Rational, Pathetick, and Powerful Remonstrances from all parts of the
kingdom; if the pressing of their own Oaths, the scandal of Religion, the ruin
of the Nation; if any Laws or Presidents, had been of force to have prevented
this Crimen post homines natos inauditum, it had been only a Theory in some
malcontent Jesuits melancholy Chamber of Meditation, and not the subject of
this Book.

But stay Reader, and take that Treason in the retail of it, that thou art
amazed at in the gross: See a King, having treated at the Isle of Wight, upon
the faith of a kingdom, for his honor and life, in the face of that kingdom
bereaved of both. A King, that had the Oaths and Protestations of three
Kingdoms to secure his life, loosing it in one of them; where the the Rebels
(like the thieves that sat on Shuters-hill, upon the honest man for felony)
impeach him of that treason they themselves were guilty of. Fond men! that when

of Assassination laid about his doors and windows, could dispatch a Majesty,
that a great while they durst not, against so many obligations of heaven and
earth, put to death; and yet durst, against their own fears and guilt suffer to
live! They durst judge and condemn him, aggravating a horrid treason, with a
more horrid pretense: Hereby Law and Justice were forced (like Queen Anne
Bulloigns Father, being Judge at his Daughters death) to assist in a Parricide
against their own Father and Author. Why these ceremonies, formalities, and
circumstances of Villainy? why does Treason choose the Bench, rather than the
Vault? and to Sentence rather than to Blow up; but that the Traitors within
being more Villains than those without, had a design to render Justice it self
as ridiculous as the great Master of it; and assassinate Law it self, as well
as the Lawgiver.

First, they lay violent hands on themselves (threatening the Lords, they should
Sit no longer if they concurred not, and reducing the House of Commons to
forty, of the reproach of that Assembly) and then on his Majesty. It was
necessary first, that they should murder the Parliament, by excluding, vexing,
and abusing above four hundred of the Commons, and laying aside all the Lords,
before they could come at the King; and leave not a sober man in power, before
they robbed that good Man of his life.

This contemptible forty, of whom yet twenty dissented, Vote with their

they hoped to share in their spoils and power; no more Addresses to the King,
nor any more Peace, and what was more ridiculous, adjust their own Crimes by
their own Vote.

Votes so daringly overturning Foundations, that all men seeing all Law and
Government cut off by them at one blow, looked to their Throats, Estates, and
Children, when all that secured these was at one breath overturned. Here is a
power ascribed the people that they never owned, and a power derived from them
that they never granted; here are the People brought in to judge their King;
that abhorred it; and the King tried for war against his People, when all the
People were ready to lay down their lives in a war for him. Here are the
Commons of England pretended, when the whole House of Commons was almost
excluded, and none but such persons (as were known Adulterers, Cheats, two
Cobblers, one Brewer, one Goldsmith, one Indicted for Committing a Rape, another
for writing Blasphemy against the Trinity, another having said, that Diodorus
Seculus was a better Author than Moses,) first asserting to themselves this new
authority, and then exercising it. These that were to be brought to the Bar
themselves, bring the King, in whose name all Malefactors were tried, to the
Bar himself. Those that had been eight years endeavoring to murder the King in
a war, are made his Judges now that war is over. A pretty sight, to have seen
Clement, Ravillaic, Faux, Catesby, and Garnet, one day endeavoring to dispatch
a King, and the next advanced to be his Judges. After prayers and fasts (the
great forerunners of mischief) whereby they endeavored as impudently to
engage God in the villainy he forbid, as they had done the people (for the
Remonstrance framed by Ireton for questioning the King, was called the
Agreement of the people) in a Treason they all abhorred.

When all the Ministry of England, and indeed of the world, cried down the
bloody design, contrary to Oaths, and Laws, and common reason, as the shame and
disgrace of Religion: These Assassinates were satisfied with the preaments of
one Pulpit Buffoon Peter's, a wretched fellow, that since he was whipped by the
Governors of Cambridge when a youth, could not endure government never after;
and the Revelation of a mad Herfordshire woman concurring with the proceedings
of the Army, for which she was thanked by the House; her Revelations being
seasonable, and proceeding from an humble spirit.

All the Nation abhorred their proceedings, therefore they hasten them, and in
five hours draw up such an horrid Act, as was not heard of in five thousand
years.

An Act of the (Commons of England) (when not one in five hundred approved it)
Assembled in Parliament, (when the Parliament by the Army destroyed) for
Erecting of an High Court of (pretended) Justice, for the Trying, and Judging
of Charles Stuart King of England, of that Treason they should have been tried
for themselves.

Commons, yet dare murder him in their own, and that for levying war against

offered violence themselves.
exemplary and condign punishment: Whereas also the The Parliament, as they
called it, had received such Concessions in order to a peace, that this murder
could never have been attempted upon the King, till these wretches had
attempted another violence upon them. The Parliament, they say, delayed this
Judgment, when God knows they always abhorred it; and these men first turned
out of the House, for refusing to consent to this murder, and then they commit
the murder in their name.
Parliament well hoping that the restraint and imprisonment of his person
(after it had pleased God to deliver him into their hands) would have quieted

and silent! but with a dreadful silence, made up of amazement and horror; the
very Traitors themselves, not daring to own their new Treason, persuaded the
Nation that they would not do, even what they were most busy about; most
people being of opinion, that they might fright, none thinking they durst

places, or most of them, and at many other places in this Land, at several
other times, within the years aforementioned: And in the year of our Lord, one
thousand six hundred forty and six; He, the said Charles Stuart, has caused
and procured many thousands of the Free-people of the Nation to be slain; and
by Divisions, Parties, and Insurrections within this Land, by Invasions from
Foreign Parts, endeavored and procured by him, and by many other evil ways
and means: He, the said Charles Stuart, has not only maintained and carried on
the said war, both by Land and Sea, during the years beforementioned; but
also, has renewed, or caused to be renewed, the said war against the
Parliament and good People of this Nation, in this present year, one thousand
six hundred forty and eight, in the Counties of Kent, Essex, Surrey, Sussex,
Middlesex, and many other Counties and Places in England and Wales, and also by
Sea: And particularly, He, the said Charles Stuart, has for that purpose,
given Commission to his Son the Prince, and others; whereby, besides multitudes
of other persons, many such, as were by the Parliament entrusted, and employed
for the safety of the Nation, being by Him or his Agents corrupted, to the
betraying of their Trust, and revolting from the Parliament, have had
Entertainment and Commission, for the continuing and renewing War and Hostility
against the said Parliament and People, as aforesaid. By which cruel and
unnatural wars by Him, the said Charles Stuart, Levied, Continued, and Renewed,
as aforesaid, much innocent blood of the Free-people of this Nation has been
spilt, Families undone, the Public Treasury wasted and exhausted, Trade
obstructed and miserably decayed, vast expense and damage to the Nation
incurred, and many parts of the Land spoiled, some of them even to desolation.
And for further prosecution of evil Designs; He, the said Charles Stuart, does
still continue his Commissions to the said Prince, and other Rebels and
Revolters, both English and Forrainers, and to the Earl of Ormond, and to the
Irish Rebels and Revolters associated with him; from whom further invasions
upon this Land are threatened, upon the procurement and on the behalf of the
said Charles Stuart.

All which wicked Designs, Wars, and evil Practices of Him, the said Charles
Stuart, have been, and are carried on, for the advancing and upholding of the
Personal Interest of Will and Power, and pretended Prerogative to Himself and
his Family, against the Public Interest, common Right, Liberty, Justice, and
Peace of the People of this Nation, by and for whom he was entrusted as
aforesaid.

By all which it appears, that He the said Charles Stuart, has been, and is
the Occasioner, Author, and Contriver of the said Unnatural, Cruel, and Bloody
Wars; and therein guilty of all the Treasons, Murders, Rapines, Burnings,
Spoils, Desolations, Damage and Mischiefs to this Nation, acted and committed
in the said wars, or occasioned thereby.

And the said John Cook by protestation (saving on the behalf of the People of
England, the liberty of Exhibiting at any time hereafter, any other Charge
against the said Charles Stuart, and also of replying to the Answers which the
said Charles Stuart shall make to the Premises, or any of them, or any other
Charge that shall be so exhibited) does for the said Treasons and Crimes, on
behalf of the said People of England, Impeach the said Charles Stuart as a
Tyrant, Traitor, Murderer, and a Public and Implacable Enemy to the
Commonwealth of England: And pray that the said Charles Stuart King of England,
may be put to answer all and every the Premises; That such Proceedings,
Examinations, Trials, Sentence, and Judgment, may be hereupon had, as shall be
agreeable to Justice.

A Charge ridiculous in the matter of it, laying that war to the Kings charge,
for which they should have been hanged themselves; accusing him for breaking
the Privileges of Parliaments, when they had the other day dissolved the very
Being of them; and pretending the common good, when two or three years
discovered, the whole Plot was nothing but private Interest; these very
Miscreants being turned to grass, by one of their own self-deniers, for a
self-seeking Combination. Contemptible in the framers of it, the one a
Runnagate Dutchman, Dorislaus, who being preferred by the King, History
Professor at Cambridge, read Treason, in his first Lecture against his Patron,
and now commits it: The other a poor and desperate Solicitor, Cook, said to
have two Wives to live with, and twenty ways, though none either honest or
successful, to live by. And worse in the witnesses of it, the scum of Mankind,
two or three raked out of Prisons and Goals, not a man of reputation, or worth
two pence in the three kingdoms; notwithstanding a Proclamation to invite all
persons to witness against the King, appearing to promote so horrid a fact, and
these hired men of Belial, with the hope of a morsel of bread. The King was
always of an even temper, but never more than in this case, retaining a Majesty
becoming himself in his misery, and looking as if he were, as he ought to be
indeed, the Judge; and they, as they were indeed, the Malefactors: Smiling (as
he might well, as far as the public calamities gave him leave) at the horrid
names (Murderer, Traitor, etc.) of the worst Subjects given to the best King.

Upon the Picture of his Majesty's sitting in his Chair before the High Court
of Justice.
NOt so Majestic in thy Chair of State,
On that but Men, here God and Angels wait,
Expecting whether hopes of Life, or fear
Of Death, can move Thee from Thy Kingly Sphere,
Constant and Fixed, whom no black storm can soil
Thy Colors, Head and Soul are all in Oil.
And the Lady With the danger of her life.
Fairfax saying aloud in the face of the Pretended Court, That where as they
took upon them to Judge his Majesty, in the Name of the People of England, that
it was a Lie, the tenth, she might have said the thousandth, part of the
People, being so far from allowing that horrid villainy, that they would dye
willingly to prevent it.

The Charge being Read, his most Excellent Majesty (looking upon it as below
him to interrupt the impudent Libel, and vie Tongue with the Billings-gate
Court) with a Calmness, Prudence, and Resolution peculiar to his Royal breast,
asked the Assassinates, By what authority they brought a King, their most
Rightful sovereign, against the Pointing at Col. Cobbet that brought him from
the Isle of Wight, where he said be Treated with many honorable Lords and
Gentlemen, and is this the end of the Treaty?
Public Faith, so lately given him at a Treaty between him and his two Houses?
By what lawful Authority? said he again more Emphatially: For I am not ignorant
(continued he) that there are on foot every where very many unlawful Powers, as
of Thieves and Robbers on the Highway: Adding, That whatsoever they did, he
was resolved not to betray the Charge committed to him by, and confirmed to him
by Ancient Descent. And answering the pretended Presidents interruption and
false suggestion, That he was called to an account Both parts of the impudent
Assertion equally ^rue. 1. That he was now Judged by the People, and that he
was at first chosen by them.
by the Authority of the People of England, by whose Election he was admitted
King.

That the kingdom descended not to him by Election, but by Hereditary Right,
derived from above a thousand years: That by refusing an unlawful power, he
stood more apparently than they for the Privileges of the People of England,
whose Authority was showed in Parliament Assemblies; but that there appeared
none of the Lords, whose presence (and not only theirs, but the Kings also) was
required to the Constituting of a Parliament; but that neither one nor both
Houses, nor any Iudicatory upon Earth, had power to call the King of England to
account, much less some certain Judges, chosen by his Accusers, and masked with
the authority of the Lower House: That he could not make his defense, unless
they showed their authority; since it would be the same offense to acknowledge a
Tyrannical power, as to resist a Lawful one. And upon the prating Fore-mans
bold suggestion, That they were satisfied in their own authority, Replying
rationally, That it was not his own apprehension, nor theirs neither, that
ought to decide the Controversy. Whereupon the most Excellent King was
commanded away, with Tomlinson and Hackers guard, parting with the Conspiracy
without moving his Hat, with these words, Well Sir, and saying (on the sight of
the Sword) I do not fear that: And nothing else observable, save that the
Silver Top of his Staff falling off at the reading of the Charge, he wondered
at it, and seeing none to take it up, he stooped for it himself, and put it in
his Pocket.

Monday Ian. 22. after three bloody Harangues at their Fast On Sunday when its
against all Canons to fa^t, none ever doing so but these and the Scots
Presti^^s, who would needs Proclaim a Fast that day, because the King designed
to Feast the Ambassador of Denmark.
Ian. 21. on Genesis 9. 6. Mat. 7. 1. Psalm. 149. 6, 7. Three Texts as miserably
tormented that day, as his Majesty was the next; these men always first being a
torment to Scripture, the great Rule of Right, and then to all that lived
according to it.

They being perplexed with the Kings Demurrer to their unheard of Jurisdiction,
resolved among themselves, after some debate, to maintain it as boldly.

As they had Voted it, Ordering.
That if the King offer to dispute the same again, the President shall tell
him, That the Commons of England Assembled in Parliament, have Constituted the
Court, whose power may not be permitted to be disputed by him.

That if he refused to Answer, it shall be accounted a Contumacy to the Court.

That if he Answer with a Salvo of his Prerogative above the Court, he shall be
required to Answer possitively, Yea, or, No.

Whereupon, the King appearing to the no little disturbance of the Spectators,
and astonishment of the That ordered that none should make any disturbance on
pain of death.
Conventicle its self, not without interruption from the desparate Ringleader
of the pack, insisted on these Heads, without any other Answer, for their own
power, than their own authority.

That he less regarded his Life, than his Conscinece, his Honor, the Laws and
Liberties of the People; which that they might not all perish together, was a
sufficient reason why he could not make his defense before these Judges, and
acknowledge a new form of Judicature: For what power had ever any Judges to
erect a Judicature against their King? or by what power, said he, was it ever
granted? Not by Gods Laws, which on the contrary command obedience to Princes;
nor by the Laws of the Land, which enjoin all Accusations to be read in the
Kings Name; nor do the Laws give any power to the Lower House, of judging even
the meanest Subject. Nor lastly, does their power flow from any authority which
might be pretended extraordinary, delegated from the people, since they had not
asked the consent so much as of every tenth man in this matter; and that if
power without Laws may set up Courts, he knew not how any man could be safe in
his Life or Estate; it being not his own, but the whole kingdoms, that he stood
upon.

The Traitor in grain, still ever and anon interrupting the Kings Speech, and
telling him, That the Court was abundantly satisfied of their authority, and
would not admit of any reasons that should detract from their power. At last,
pressed upon him to be mindful of his Doom; But where, said the King, in all the
world is that Court, in which no place is left for reason? You shall find, Sir,
answered the President, that this very Court is such a one.

Whereupon, after several appearances which they had, to see whether they could
satisfy their C. Downs that thought it fit the King should be hea^d by the
Lords and Commons.
dissenting Members, or whether they could alter the judgment of the resolved
King.

Remember, said he then, when he was going away, that it is your King from whom
you turn away your ear; in vain certainly will my Subjects expect justice from
you, who stop your ears to your King ready to Plead his Cause.

Its very remarkable, how that in this, and all other transactions of his
Majesty, he appeals to the Reason and Law of the world, which is impartial to
all Mankind: His adversaries to themselves, vouching both the truth of their
Charge, and the Jurisdiction of their Court, with their own authority; being
neither able to prove his Majesty guilty, except by their own testimony; or if
guilty, to be tried by any Court on earth, but by their own Assertion. Nay,
they that alleged the Parliament of England for the Authority, against whom
the King should transgress, and that by which they proceeded, would not receive
the Kings Wherein ^e was earnest, not for his own concerns, but for those of
the kingdom
earnest and reiterated Though he offered much ^o say for the peace of the
kingdom, which if the meanest man had offered, he should have been heard.
Appeal to the Lords and Commons, who made up that Parliament.

Long were they troubled how they might assert their power, longer how they
might execute it; some would have Majesty suffer like the basest of
Malefactors, and that in his Robes of Habiliaments of State, that at once they
might dispatch a King and Monarchy together: Others malice, proposed other
horrid violences to be offered to him, but not to be named among men (the men
were indeed huge ready at inventing torments, being a company of Executioners
got together, rather than Judges; and a pack of Hangmen, rather than a Court)
till at last, they thought they should gratify their ambition, to triumph over
Monarchy, sufficiently, if they Beheaded him; and so waving all his Pleas for
himself, and the Allegations of Mankind for him; after several unworthy
Harangues, consisting of nothing else but bold affirmations of that power,
whereof they had no one ground, but those affirmations and reflections on the
Kings Demurrer, as a delay to their proceedings; when indeed he hastened them,
by offering that toward the peace of the kingdom in one hour, that was not
thought of in several years. Notwithstanding his seasonable caution to them,
That an hasty Sentence once past, might be sooner Repented of than Recalled;
Conjuring them, as they loved the Liberty of the People, and the Peace of the
Kingdom, they so much pretended for, they would receive what he had to offer to
both; adding, that we should think long before we resolve of great matters, and
an hasty Judgment may bring on that trouble, and perpetual inconvenience to the
kingdom, that the Child unborn may repent of; adjuring them, as they would
answer it at the dreadful day of Judgment, to hear what he had to say.

The Club of Assassinates proceed to this horrid Sentence.

Whereas the This was their (...) that the Commons of England in Parliament
appointed them a Court, whereas they neither did i^, nor ^^uld do it.
Commons of England in Parliament, have appointed them an High Court of
Justice, for the Trying of Chales Stuart King of England, before whom he had
been three times Convented, and at first time a Charge of High Treason, and
other Crimes and Misdemeanors was read, in the behalf of the kingdom of
England, etc.

Here the Clerk Read the Charge.

Which Charge being Read unto him, as aforesaid, He, the said Charles Stuart,
was required to give his Answer, but he refused so to do, and so expressed the
several passages at his Trial in refusing to Answer. For all which Treasons and
Crimes, this Court does adjudge, that the said Charles Stuart, as a Tyrant,
Traitor, Murderer, and a Public Enemy, shall be put to death, by the Severing
his Head from his Body.

To which horrid Sentence the whole Pack stood up, by agreement among
themselves before made; and though they agreed in nothing else, either before
or since, unanimously Voted the bloody words, words of so loud a guilt, that
they drowned all the earnest Proposals of Reason and Religion, offered by a
Prince that was a great master of both; reason being a more dreadful Sentence
against, than that they pronounced against him; and then used the sameforce to
hurry the King away, that they had employed to bring him thither; answering his
Allegations with that violence, wherewith they composed and made good their own.

The King, always great, was now greater in the eye of the world, for the great
Reason he offered, the honorable Conduct (...) managed, and the freedom of
Speech he used much beyond other times, the captivity of his Person
contributing much to the liberty of his Discourse.

All the great throng that pitied, but could not help, afflicted Majesty, with
whom they saw themselves drawn to the slaughter, groaned upon the Sentence, but
with the peril of their lives; It being as fatal then, for any persons to own
respect or kindness to Majesty, as it was for the King to carry it; and as
dangerous for others to be good Subjects, as for him to be a good King. They
that were to force him out of his Life, forced others out of their Loyalty;
endeavoring fondly to depose him from his Subjects hearts, as they had done
from his Throne. Several persons having since deposed, that to set off their
ridiculous Scene, they had those who were appointed to force poor creatures to
cry Justice, Justice, (who, as the excellent Prince observed, would have done
as much for money for their own Commanders) a word one of them in Command then
said, since he cried, because, if it had been heard, the Traitors had been at
the Bar, and the Judges of the Land at the Bench; and deterr others from
saying, God save the King: Notwithstanding which force, this last voice was the
most hearty, and the other most forced. Observable it is, that to make his
Majesty parallel with his great Pattern, whom he represented equally in his
Sufferings, and in his Goodness and Power, a wretch, that was within a little
while executed by his own Partner, Spit in his Face, whereat his Majesty not
moved, only wiped the Spittle, and said, My Savior suffered much more for me.
The Excellent Prince (while the Traitors before him, were as much slaves to
their base Malice, Envy, Fear, Ambition, and Cruelty, as the poor People were
to them) exercising as ample a Dominion over himself now, as he had heretofore
over three kingdoms; looking not as if he were before the Miscreants, but they
before him; and he to give, as he did, and not receive a Doom.

I cannot forget how an Ancient Father says, That some creatures would not
suffer God to be a God, unless he please them. These are the Creatures, that
would not endure Gods Vicegerent should be so, unless he served them.

Thus having formerly forgotten the Oaths of God that were upon them, laid
aside the Allegiance which they owed, gone against the sense of the Law, of the
Clergy, the Nobility, the Gentry, and most of the sober people of the Nation:
Besides, above half of both Houses before they could fight the King. But
infinite were the obstructions they were to break through (so carefully has
God guarded Kings) before they could murder Him, they must suppress the
unanimous desires of the whole Nation, expressed in the looks, wishes, and
prayers of all men, and the declared sense of several Countries in their
respective Petitions, which many thousands delivered in London, with the hazard
of their Lives, and maintained in All d^claring for a Pe^sonal T^^aty.
North Wales, under Sir John Owen; in South Wales, under Laughorne and Poyer;
in the Navy under the Prince; in Kent, Essex, and Surrey, under several of the
Nobility and Gentry, of those and the adjacent Counties; they must steal the
King (that won ground from his Adversaries by his carriage, as much as they had
done upon him by their Arts and power, reducing to an entire obedience to his
Government all that conversed with his Excellent Person) from those men that
were now as ready to engage for him, as ever they did against him, as they did
at Holdenby, when it was said (so considerable is a suffering King, his very
miseries being more powerful than his Armies) by the Faction, that now they had
the King in their power, they had the Parliament in their Pockets, they must
renounce those promises they made upon their Souls, and as they and their
Posterity should prosper, that pitying the barbarous usage of His Majesty,
they were resolved never to part with their Arms till they had made his way to
the Throne, and rendered the condition of his party the more tolerable: Promises
that to en^nare the charitable Prince (that suspected not that falsehood in
others, that he found not in himself) they gilded with the like specious, but
entrapping kindnesses, as the permission of what they knew was as dear as his
Life, to the pious King, the Ministry of his Chaplains; Commerce by Letters
with his Queen, the Visits of his Party, the service of his Courtiers, (some
whom they also admitted to their Council of War, to mould Propositions which
they will urge in his behalf, and alter them to the Kings gust, and at his
advice, the intermingling with their Remonstrances, such good words as these,
That the Queen and the Royal Family must be restored to all their Rights, or
else no hope of a solid Peace.

They must sacrifice Eleven of the most Worthy Members in the House of Commons,
and seven Noble Lords, to the lusts and cavils of mercenary Soldiers, that
would not hearken formerly to the delivering of half so many to answer the
Articles of their Sovereign, (an Argument that Religion, Justice, or the love
of Liberty which are always uniform, but unworthy Interests that vary with
hopes and fears, had the strongest influence upon them.

Nay, they must overcome the Secluding 140. Members.
Parliament, it, by whose pretended Authority they had hitherto the Imprisoning
the Chief Citizens, ^iding triumph^n^y through the streets of London, and
seizing the Tower, etc.
City of London, at whose charge they had hitherto fought, and the first
Leaders of the Army, by whose Reputation it was first raised, and by whose
skill and activity it so long prospered: The Kings prudence, and their own
jealousies (combinations in crimes conclude in jealousies, each party thinking
the advantage of the other too great) having committed and injealousied them.

They must Conquer Scotland, and their dear Brethren, and take the King off
from the Presbyterians, by their arts and insinuations inveighing him into the
pit they had laid for him in the Isle of Wight (for his escape from
Hampton Court, by the withdrawing of the Sentinels from their usual posts,
appeared to be their design) they must oppose the highest reason in the world
offered by the King there, intent upon the settlement of the Nation for a
Personal Treaty, agreeable to the sense of the whole kingdom. 1. By Preliminary
Articles, which they knew the King could not yield to; and upon his refusal,
four Votes of No Addresses to him, which they could never have compassed, had
they not sent half the Members away to the Country, upon pretense of expediting
the Contributions; and tired the other half with late Sitting, from ten in the
morning till twelve at night; and withal, the Menaces of the Officers that came
with Remonstrances to the House, and the terror of the Army; two Regiments
whereof, under color of guarding, but indeed for awing the Parliament, were
quartered at Whitehall.

They must endure the clamors of an undone people, deluded with pretenses of
avoiding Tyranny into Slavery. 1. For an excellent Religion, broken into
Schisms and Heresies. 2. For Prayers and Fasts, made to serve impious designs,
and promote prosperous crimes. 3. For Liberty, become an empty name, the common

Law; men lingering in On shipboard in Summer time^ others sold slaves.
strange imprisonment, knowing neither their crimes nor their accusers, because
they had not guilt enough for condemnation; thousands forced to be Exiles in
strange lands, or Suffering nasty Confinements and ignominous Tortures.
Slaves at home. 4. For Propriety, hedged no longer by Law, but become a prey
to the fraud and violence of the Conspirators. 5. For great Virtues, become as
dangerous as formerly great crimes were. 6. For Converse, become a snare, spies
in each company watching men's words, and searching into their thoughts. 7. For
the Parliament, become a Conspiracy, divided in its self, and enslaved to its
vassals, who made Laws according to their interests, and executed them
according to their lusts. The whole Nation now better understanding their good
and wise Prince; the public interest and themselves panted for a return to the
obedience of the most incomparable Government, and most inestimable Prince in
the world. Insomuch (so admirable were the returns of Divine Justice at that
time) that the very same Convention, that first stirred up this way of
tumultuary Petitions against the King, were now forced to complain, That the
honor and safety of Parliaments (for so they called the poor remainder of that
Assembly) was endangered by Petitions.

They must rescinde the City Petitions, and their own Votes, that the Kings
Concessions were a safe ground for the Parliament to settle the Peace of the
kingdom on: The King having granted so much as the people might see he was not,
as he was reported, obstinate against his own happiness, and the Nations peace,
and so gratified not his Enemies, and yet so discreetly, that he deserted not
his Friends; his wisdom tempering prudently their harsh Propositions, and his
Reason urging effectually his own.

They must cast off all obedience to their own Superiors, as well as to the
King; and imprison the Parliament, as well as the King; Violate their
Protestation, and renounce their Solemn League and Covenant, disown the Lords
House, and leave not above sixty of almost five hundred Members in the House of
Commons.

In fine, they must go against their own Prayers, Sermons, Engagements and
Consciences, against the very foundations of Government in the world; and the
sentiments of Mankind about it, against the known Laws of the Land, and against
truths as clear as the Sun, in these unheard of Propositions.

I. That the People, under God, are the Original of all just Power. II. That
the Commons of England Assembled in Parliament, being chosen by, and
representing the People, have the Supreme Authority of this Nation. III. That
whatsoever is Enacted and Declared for Law by the Commons of England Assembled
in Parliament, has the force of a Law. IV. That all the people of this Nation
are concluded thereby, although the consent and concurrence of the King and
Peers be not had thereunto. V. That to raise Arms against the peoples
Representative, is Treason. VI. That the King himself took Arms against the
Parliament, and on that account is guilty of the Bloodshed throughout the
Civil War, and that he ought to expiate the Crime with his own Blood.
Bold and ridiculous men! That think with one breath to alter the notion of
Good and Evil, and to make their Usurpations just, because they had the face to
declare them so.

contrary to those numerous and fearful obligations of their many Oaths; to the
public and private Faith, which was expressed in their Protestations and many
Declarations; to the Laws, the commands of Scripture; to the dishonor of
Religion, and the endangering of the public good of the kingdom.

His Majesty's Reasons against the pretended Jurisdiction of the High Court of
Justice, which he intended to have delivered in writing on Monday, Ian. 22.
1648: but was not permitted.
HAving already made my Protestations, not only against the illegality of this
pretended Court; but also, that no earthly Power can justly call me (who am
your King) in question as a delinquent: I would not any more open my mouth upon
this occasion, more than to referr my self to what I have spoken, were I alone
in this case concerned. But the duty I owe to God in the preservation of the
true Liberty of my People, will not suffer me at this time to be silent: For,
how can any freeborn Subject of England call life, or any thing he possesses
his own, if power without right daily make new, and abrogate the old
fundamental Law of the Land? which I now take to be the present case:
Wherefore, when I came hither, I expected that you would have endeavored to
have satisfied me concerning these grounds, which hinder me to answer to your
pretended Impeachment; but since I see nothing I can say will move you to it
(though Negatives are not so naturally proved as Affirmatives) yet I will show
you the reason, why I am confident you cannot judge me, nor indeed the meanest
man in England: For I will not (like you) without showing a reason, seek to
impose a belief upon my Subjects.

There is no proceeding just against any man, Hereabouts he was stopped, being
not permitted to speak any more of Reasons.
but what is warranted either by Gods Laws, or the Municipal Laws of the
Country where he lives. Now I am most confident, that this days proceedings
cannot be warranted by Gods Laws; for on the contrary, the authority of the
obedience unto Kings is clearly warranted, and strictly commanded both in the
Old and New Testament; which if denied, I am ready instantly to prove: And for
the question now in hand, there it is said, That where the word of a King is,
there is power; and who may say unto him, what do thou? Eccles. 8. 4. Then
for the Laws of this Land, I am no less confident, that no learned Lawyer will
affirm, that an Impeachment can lie against the King, they all going in his
Name; and one of their Maxims is, That the King can do no wrong. Besides, the
Law, upon which you ground your proceedings, must either be old or new; if old,
show it; if new, tell what authority warranted by the Fundamental Laws of the
Land has made it, and when: But how the House of Commons can erect a Court of
Judicature, which was never one it self (as is well known to all Lawyers) I
leave to God and the World to judge: And were full as strange, that they should
pretend to make Laws without King or Lords House, to any that have heard speak
of the Laws of England.

And admitting, but not granting, that the People of Englands Commission, could
grant your pretended power, I see nothing you can show for that; for certainly
you never asked the question of the tenth man of the kingdom, and in this way
you manifestly wrong even the poorest Plough-man, if you demand not his free
consent; nor can you pretend any color for this your pretended Commission,
without the consent, at the least, of the major part of every man in England,
of whatsoever quality or condition, which I am sure you never went about to
seek; so far are you from having it: Thus you see, that I speak not for my own
Right alone, as I am your King, but also for the true Liberty of all my
Subjects, which consists not in the sharing the power of Government, but in
living under such Laws: Such a Government as may give themselves the best
assurance of your lives, and propriety of their goods. Nor in this must, or do
I forget the Privileges of both Houses of Parliament, which this days
proceedings does not only violate, but likewise occasion the greatest breach of
their Public Faith, that I believe ever was heard of, with which I am far from
charging the two Houses: For all the pretended crimes laid against me, bear
date long before the late Treaty at Newport, in which I having concluded as
much as in me lay, and hopefully expecting the two Houses agreement thereunto,
I was suddenly surprised and hurried from thence as a Prisoner, upon which
account I am against my will brought hither; where since I am come, I cannot
but to my power defend the Ancient Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, together
with my own just Right. Then, for any thing I can see, the Higher House is
totally excluded. And for the House of Commons, it is too well known, that the
major part of them are detained or deterred from Sitting; so, as if I had no
other, this were sufficient for me to protest against the lawfulness of your
pretended Court. Besides all this, the peace of the kingdom is not the least in
my thoughts, and what hopes of settlement is there, so long as power reigns
without rule of Law? Changing the whole frame of that Government, under which
this kingdom has flourished for many hundred years (nor will I say what will
fall out, in case this lawless, unjust proceeding against me do go on.) And
believe it, the Commons of England will not thank you for this change, for they
will remember how happy they have been of late years under the Reign of Queen
Elizabeth, the King my Father, and my self, until the beginning of these
unhappy troubles; and will have cause to doubt, that they shall never be so
happy under any new. And by this time it will be sensibly evident, that the
Arms I took up, were only to defend the Fundamental Laws of this kingdom,
against those who have supposed my power has totally changed the ancient
Government.

Thus having showed you briefly the Reasons, why I cannot submit to your
pretended Authority, without violating the trust which I have from God, for the
welfare and liberty of my people; I expect from you, either clear reasons to
convince my judgment, showing me that I am in an error (and then truly I will
readily answer) or that you will withdraw your proceedings.

With what composedness of Spirit, and patience he heard the pretended Charge,
and all its Slanders and Reproaches, smiling at the words Tyrant, Traitor, etc.
with what Authority he demanded, by what lawful Power, grounded on Gods Word,
or warranted by the Constitutions of the Kingdom, they proceeded! with what
earnestness he admonished them, Telling them, that it was not a slight thing
that they were about.
both what Guilt, and what Judgments they would bring upon this Land, by
proceeding from one sin to another against their lawful Sovereign!

With what resolution he told them, He would not betray the Trust reposed in
him, for his own Prerogative, his Peoples Liberty, and the Privileges of
Parliament, as long as there was breath in his body, until they could satisfy
God and the Country. Adding, that there was a God in heaven that would call
them to an account. And that it was utterly as unlawful to submit to a new and
unlawful Authority, as to resist a lawful one; Neither his apprehension nor
theirs being likely to end the Controversy! How zealously he told them, That
if the free People of England (now secure of nothing, when all things were
subject to an Arbitrary Power) were not concerned as well as himself, he would
have satisfied himself with one Protestation against any Jurisdiction on earth,
trying a Supreme Magistrate; but in a case of so extensive a Concernment, it
was unreasonable to impose upon men bold Assertions, without evident Reasons;
it being not enough to say, The Court assert their own Jurisdiction, and you
must not be permitted to offer any thing against it, its not for Prisoners to
require^ (to the last whereof it was excellently well answered: Prisoners! sir,
I am not an ordinary Prisoner:) Reasons are not to be heard against
Jurisdiction. Show me (replied the good King) that Jurisdiction, where Reason
is not to be heard. Flinging the Reply, with this parting Memorial: Well,
remember, that the King is not suffered to give in his Reasons, for the Liberty
and Freedom of all his Subjects.

How pathetically he did Conjure them by all that was dear unto them, to let
him offer his Reasons in the Painted Chamber A motion so reasonable, that
Colonel Downs could not but press them to hearken to it, so far that they had
adjourned not to consider what the King had offered but to check Col. D. into a
compliance.
before the Lords and Commons, leaving with them these weighty considerations,
That they should think long before they Resolved of great matters suddenly; a
little delay might give peace to the kingdom, whereas a hasty Judgment may
bring on that trouble and perpetual inconvenience, that the Child unborn may
repent it! Re-inforcing them with this great period, I do require you, as you
will answer it at the dreadful day of Judgment, that you will consider it once
again. These noble circumstances, together with those ignoble ones of their
consulting about Hanging and Quartering him, or Beheading him in his Robes.
Their proceeding (after a wretched Harangue of B's alleging the Treasons of
former times as presidents for this, and wresting, Law and History as their
Preachers did the Scripture) to the Sentence; to which sixty seven Mechanic
Regicides expressed their Assent by standing up, their consultation about the
time and place of executing that Sentence, and the warrant sealed by forty
eight of them, we are the more brief in, because they are so excellently
published in a Royal Volume already Printed 1662. for Mr. Richard Royston his
Majesty's Bookseller, and his Fathers faithful Servant, who underwent as many
dangers in publishing the Defenses of the Royal Cause, as others in maintaining
the being of it.

Now they would not suffer him to live, yet they let him not quietly dye;
envying him, even his very solitudes which they disturbed with irreligious
intrusions, and interruping his Devotion (as if they intended the loss of his
soul as well as his life) with two things he was equally averse to, Impertinent
Talk and Tobacco. Much ado had, the best of Princes, to gain the privilege of

his Children and Relations for the satisfaction of his mind. Or 2. His
Chaplain, Bishop Iuxon, to settle his Conscience; the latter of whom being
permitted to come not till eight of the Clock on Saturday night; the
incomparable Prince enjoying in the midst of tumults a calm serenity, being
full of his own Majesty, and having a greater power over his temper, than his
enemies had over his person, bespeaks him thus: My Lord, that you came no
sooner I believe was not your fault, but now you are come, because these Rogues
pursue my blood, you and I must consult how I may best part with it. Indeed,
all the while he did all things becoming a Christian obliged by his calling to
suffer, not reflecting that he, was a Prince (to whom such usages were unusual)
born to command.

Since they could not keep the Bishop from coming to him, they disturbed him
both the next day Ian. 28. in Reading Divine Service, and Preaching on Romans 2.

petulant disputes, which he either answered irrefragrably, or neglected
patiently; and at White Hall, with the noise of the workmen that prepared the
Scaffold; he being brought thither on purpose Ian. 28. at night to dye often by
every stroke of the Axe upon the Wood, before he should dye once for all, by
one stroke of it upon himself.

Neither do they only disturb, but either out of fear or design tempt him too,
with unworthy Articles and Conditions, which being levelled at his Honor and
Conscience, as their other malices were at his Life: After hearing one or two
of them read to him, he resolved not to sully the splendour of his former
virtues, with too impotent a desire of life. His Soul composed to Religion (as
all others were to sorrow for the villainy of the Actors in this Tragedy, and
their own sins, especially their credulity, and fear of the horrid consequence,
there being a dreadful calm all over the City, that was neither tumult nor
quiet, all Sermons, Prayers, and Discourses full of horror, and all
Congregations overwhelmed with tears) applied its self to such duties of
Religion, as Reading, Praying, Confession of Sins, Supplication for Enemies,
Holy Communions, and Conferences, and such offices of humanity, as sending
Legacies to his Wife and exile Children, and exhorting those at home, admitted
to him Ian. 29. to this purpose, his last words to them being taken in writing,
and communicated to the world (by the Lady Elizabeth his Daughter, a Lady of
most eminent endowments, who though born to the supreamest fortune, yet lived
in continual tears, and died confined at Carisbrook (whither her Father was
cheared) in the Isle of Whight) to this effect^

A true Relation of the Kings Speech to the Lady Elizabeth and the Duke of
Gloucester, the Day before his Death.
HIs Children being come to meet him, he first gave his Blessing to the Lady
Elizabeth, and bad her remember to tell her Brother James, when ever she should
see him, that it was his Fathers last desire, that he should no more look upon
Charles as his eldest Brother only, but be obedient unto him as his Sovereign;
and that they should love one another, and forgive their Fathers Enemies. Then
said the King to her, Sweetheart, you will forget this: No (said she) I shall
never forget it whilst I live; and pouring forth abundance of tears, promised
Him to write down the particulars.

Then the King taking the Duke of Gloucester upon his knee, said, Sweetheart,
now they will cut off thy Fathers head (upon which words the Child looking very
steadfastly on him) Mark Child what I say, They will cut off my head, and
perhaps make thee a King: But mark what I say, you must not be a King, so long
as your Brothers Charles and James do live; for they will cut off your Brothers
heads (when they can catch them) and cut off thy head too at last: and
therefore I charge you do not be made a King by them. At which the Child
sighing said, I will be torn in pieces first: which falling so unexpectedly
from one so young, it made the King rejoice exceedingly.

Another Relation from the Lady Elizabeth's own Hand.
WHat the King said to me, Ian. 29. 1648. being the last time I had the
happiness to see him, he told me, he was glad I was come, and although he had
not time to say much, yet somewhat he had to say to me, which he had not to
another, or leave in writing, because he feared their Cruelty was such, as that
they would not have permitted him to write to me. He wished me not to grieve
and torment my self for him, for that would be a Glorious death that he should
dye, it being for the Laws and Liberties of this Land, and for maintaining the
true Protestant Religion. He bid me read Bishop Andrews Sermons, Hookers
Ecclesiastical Policy, and Bishop Lauds Book against Fisher, which would ground
me against Popery. He told me, he had forgiven all his Enemies, and hoped God
would forgive them also; and commanded us, and all the rest of my Brothers and
Sisters, to forgive them. He bid me tell my Mother, that his thoughts never
strayed from her, and that his love should be the same to the last. Withal, he
commanded me and my Brother to be obedient to her, and bid me send his Blessing
to the rest of my Brothers and Sisters, with commendation to all his Friends.
So after he had given me his Blessing, I took my leave.

Further, he commanded us all to forgive those People, but never to trust them;
for they had been most false to him, and to those that gave them power; and he
feared also to their own Souls: and desired me not to grieve for him, for he
should dye a Martyr, and that he doubted not, but the Lord would settle his
Throne upon his Son, and that we should be all happier then we could have
expected to have been, if he had lived; with many other things, which at
present, I cannot remember.

Till at last (all endeavors for preventing so great a guilt failing) even
Col. Downs, one of their own Members, attempting a Mutiny in the Army, and the
Lord Fairfax being resolved with his own Regiment to hinder the Murder, until
the Conspirators in vain urging, That the Lord had rejected him, took him aside
to seek the Lord, while their instruments hasten the Execution by private
order, and then they call that a return of their prayers.

On the Fatal day, Ian. 30. having desired five Preachers sent to pray with him
by the Juncto, to pray for him, if they pleased, telling them, that he was
resolved, that they who had so often and so causelessly prayed against him,
should not in his agony pray with him; and preparing himself with his own
Devotion in the offices of the Church; he was strengthened in his own
sufferings by the sufferings of his Savior, whose Body and Blood he received
that morning, and the After the (...) was (...) the Bishop for his (...) man

majesty was much comforted.
History of whose Passion fell to be the Chapter of the day of His; who had he
been before Christ, had a condition, and an innocence that had made him a Type
of him. So that he came cheerfully from St. James's to White Hall (often
calling on his slow Guards, that kept not pace with him (who always walked
fast) to move faster, with these words, I now go before you to strive for an
heavenly Crown, with less solicitude than I formerly have led my Soldiers for
an earthly Diadem) with extraordinary alacrity, ascending the stairs leading
to the Long-gallery, and so to the Cabinet-chamber; whence his supplications
being ended, he went through the Banqueting House to the adjoining Scaffold,
every way dressed to terror, with the same spirit he used to ascend his Throne,
showing no fear of death, but a solicitude for those that were to live after.
He thought it to as little purpose to Harange the Army, as to complement a
Mastive or a Tiger; and others were kept at such distance, that they might see,
but not hear; and therefore expressed himself thus to those that stood near him.

His Majesty's Speech upon the Scaffold.
I Shall be very little heard of any body here, I shall therefore speak a word
unto Meaning Col. Thomi^son.
you here: Indeed, I could hold my peace very well, if I did not think, that
holding my peace would make some men think, that I submit to the guilt as well
as to the punishment; but I think it my duty to God and to my Country to clear
my self as an honest man, as a good King, and a good Christian. I shall first
begin with my Innocence: In troth, I think it is not very needful for me to
insist long upon this, for all the world knows, that I did not begin a War with
the two Houses of Parliament; and I call God witness, to whom I must shortly
make an account, that I never did intend to incroach on their Privileges, they
began upon me: It is the Militia they began upon, they confessed the Militia was
mine, but they thought it fit to have it from me: And to be short, if any man
will look to the dates of Commissions, of theirs, and mine; and likewise to the
Declarations, will see clearly, that they began these unhappy Troubles, not I:
So that as the guilt of these enormous Crimes that are laid against me, I hope
in God, that God will clear me of; I will not, I am in charity: God forbid,
that I should lay it upon the two Houses of Parliament, there is no necessity
of either, I hope they are free of this guilt; for I do believe that
illinstruments between them and me, has been the chief cause of this
bloodshed: So that by way, or speaking, as I find my self clear of this, I
hope (and pray God) that they may too; yet for all this, God forbid that I
should b^ so ill a Christian, as not to say, Gods Judgments are just upon me;
many times he does pay Justice by unjust Sentence, that is ordinary. I will
only say this, that an unjust Strafford.
Sentence that I suffered to take effect, is punished now by an unjust Sentence
upon me, this I have said to show you that I am an innocent Man.

Now to show you that I am a good Christian: I hope there is Pointing to Dr.
Juxon.
a good man that will bear me witness, that I have forgiven all the world, and
even those in particular, that have been the causers of my death; who they are,
God knows, I do not desire to know, I pray God forgive them. But this is not
all, my charity must go farther; I wish that they may repent, for indeed they
have committed a great sin in this particular. I pray God, with St. Stephen,
that this be not laid to their charge, nay, not only so, but that they may take
the right way to the Peace of the Kingdom; for my charity commands me, not only
to forgive particular men, but to endeavor to the last gasp, the Peace of the
Kingdom. So, Sir, I do wish with all my soul (and I do hope there are some
Turning to some Gentlemen that wrote.
here will carry it farther) that they may endeavor the Peace of the Kingdom.

Now, Sirs, I must show you, both how you are out of the way, and will put you
in the way: First, you are out of the way; for certainly, all the way you ever
have had yet, as I could find by any thing, is in the way of Conquest;
certainly, this is an ill way; for Conquest, Sir, in my opinion, is never just,
except there be a good just cause, either for matter of wrong, or just title,
and then if you go beyond it, the first quarrel that you have to it, is it that
makes it unjust in the end, that was just at first: But if it be only matter of
Conquest, then it is a great Robbery; as a Pyrate said to Alexander, that he
was the greater Robber, himself but a petty one: And so Sir, I think the way
you are in, is much out of the way. Now, Sir, to put you in one way; believe
it, you will never do right, nor God will never prosper you, until you give God
his due, the King his due, (that is, my Successors) and the People their due; I
am as much for them as any of you: you must give God his due, by rightly
regulating his Church (according to his Scriptures) which is now out of order.
To set you in a way particularly, now I cannot, but only this, A National Synod
freely called, freely debating among themselves, must settle this; when every
opinion is freely and clearly heard.

For the King, indeed, I will not ( then turning to a Gentleman that touched
the Axe) said, Hurt not the Meaning, if he did blunt the edge.
Axe, that may hurt me.

For the King, the Laws of the Land will clearly instruct you for that,
therefore, because it concerns my own particular, I only give you a touch of it.

For the People, and truly, I desire their Liberty and Freedom as much as any
body whatsoever; but I must tell you, that their Liberty and Freedom consists
in having of Government, those Laws by which their Life and Goods may be most
their own. It is not for having share in Government (Sir) that is nothing
pertaining to them: A Subject, and a Sovereign, are clean contrary things; and
therefore, until they do that, I mean, that you do put the People in that
Liberty, as I say, certainly they will never enjoy themselves.

Sir, it was for this that I am now come here: If I would have given way to an
Arbitrary way, to have all Laws changed according to the power of the Sword, I
needed not have come here, and therefore I tell you (and I pray God it be not
laid to your charge) that I am the Martyr of the People.

In Troth Sirs, I shall not hold you much longer, for I will only say this to
you, that in truth I could have desired some little time longer, because I
would have put this that I have said in a little more order, and a little
better digested then I have done, and therefore I hope you will excuse me.

I have delivered my Conscience, I pray God you may take those courses that are
best for the good of the Kingdom, and your own salvations.

Dr. Iuxon. Will your Majesty (though it may be very well known your Majesty's
affections to Religion, yet it may be expected that you should say somewhat for
the worlds satisfaction.


King. I thank you very heartily, my Lord, for that, I had almost forgotten it.
In Troth Sirs, my Conscience in Religion, I think is very well known to all the
word, and I declare before you all, that I dye a Christian, according to the
profession of the Church of England, as I found it left me by my Father, and
this Pointing to Dr. Juxon.
honest man I think will witness it.


Then turning to the Officers, said, Sirs, Excuse me for this same, I have a
good Cause, and a gracious God, I will say no more. Then turning to Col.
Hacker, he said, Take care they do not put me to pain, and Sir, this, if it
please you. Then a Gentleman coming near the Axe, The King said, Take heed of
the Axe, pray take heed of the Axe. Then speaking to the Executioner, said, I
shall say but very short prayers, and when I thrust out my hands. --

Then the King called to Dr. Juxon for his Nightcap, and having put it on, he
said to the Executioner, Does my Hair trouble you? who desired him to put it
all under his Cap, which the King did accordingly, by the help of the
Executioner and the Bishop: Then the King turning to Dr. Juxon said, I have a
good Cause, and a gracious God on my side.

Dr. Juxon. There is but one Stage more, this Stage is troublesome and
turbulent, it is a short one; but you may consider it will soon carry you a
very great way: It will carry you from Earth to Heaven; And there you shall
find a great deal of cordial Joy and Comfort.


King. I go from a Corruptible to an Incorruptible Crown; where no disturbance
can be, no disturbance in the world.


Dr. Iuxon. You are Exchanged from a Temporal to an Eternal Crown, a good
Exchange.


The King then said to the Executioner, Is my Hair well?

Then the King took off his Cloak and George, and giving his It is thought to

George to Dr. Juxon, said, Remember.

Then the King put off his Doublet, and being in his Wastcoat, put his Cloak on
again, and looking on the Block, said to the Executioner, You must set it fast.

Executioner. It is fast, Sir.


King. When I put my hands out this way, stretching them out, then...


After that, having said two or three words (as he stood) to himself, with
Hands and Eyes lifted up, immediately stooping down, laid his Neck upon the
Block: And then the Executioner again putting his Hair under his Cap, the King
said, (thinking he had been going to strike) Stay for the Sign.

Executioner. Yes, I will, and please your Majesty.


Then the King, making some pious and private Ejaculations before the Block, as
before a Desk of Prayer, he submitted without that They had provided I (...)

violence they intended for him, if he refused his Sacred Head to one stroke of
an Executioner (that was disguised then, as the Actors were all along) which
Severed it from his Body.

In the consequence of which stroke (great villainies, as well as great
absurdities, have long sequels) the Government of the world, the Laws and
Liberties of three Kingdoms, and the Being of the Church was nearly concerned.
So fell Charles the First, and so expired with him the Liberty and Glory of
three Nations; being made in that very place an instance of Humane Frailty,
where he used to show the Greatness and Glory of Majesty.

All the Nation was composed to mourning and horror (no King ever leaving the
world with greater sorrows) women miscarrying at the very intimation of his
death, as if The Glory was departed: Men and women falling into Convulsions,
Swounds, and Melancholy, that followed them to their graves. Some unwilling to
live to see the issues of his death, fell down dead suddenly after him: Others

covetousness of the Faction, as barbarous as their Treason, made sale of) kept
them as Relics, finding the same virtue in them, as with Gods blessing they
found formerly in his person: All Pulpits rung Lamentations, and the great
variety of opinions in other matters were reconciled in this, That it was as
horrid a fact as ever the Sun saw, since it withdrew at the sufferings of our
Savior; and the King as complete a man, as mortality refined by industry was
capable to be. Children amazed and wept, refusing comfort at this; even some of
his Judges could not forbear to mingle their tears with his blood: All the
learning then in the world expressed its own griefs, and instructed those of
others in most excellent Poems and impartial Histories, that vindicated his
honor, and devulged the base arts of his enemies, when their power was so

dreadful, that they threatened the ruin of all ingenuity, as they had murdered
the Patron of it.

While the few Assassinates that crept up and down, afraid of every man they
met, pointed at as Monsters in nature, finished not their reason when they had
ended his Martyrdom; One ( O. C.) to feed his eyes with cruelty, and satisfy
his solicitous ambition, curiously surveyed the murdered Carcass, when it was
brought in a Coffin to White Hall, and to assure himself the King was quite
dead, with his fingers searched the wound, whether the Head were fully severed
from the Body, or no. Others of them delivered his body to be Embalmed, with a
wicked, but vain design, to corrupt his Name, among infamous Empericks and
Chirurgions of their own, who were as ready to Butcher and Assassinate his
Name, as their Masters were to offer violence to his Person; with intimations
to enquire (which were as much as commands to report) whether they could not
find in it symptoms of the French disease, or some evidences of frigidity and
natural impotency, but unsuccessfully; for an honest and able Physician
intruding among them at the Dissection, by his presence and authority, awed the
obsequious Wretches from gratifying their opprobrious Masters; declaring the
Royal body tempered almost ad pondus, capable of a longer life than is commonly
granted to other men.

But since their search into his Body for calumnies were vain, they run up to
Gods Decrees, and there found, that he was rejected of God; and because his
Reign was unhappy, they concluded that his person was reprobated.

And when they had endeavored to race him out of Gods Book of Life, and
consequently out of the hearts of his People, the vain men pull down his
Statue, both at the West End of Saint Paul's, and at the Exchange; in the last
of which places they plaistered an Inscription, which men looked on then as
false, and Providence has rendered since ridiculous; Exit Tyrannus Regum
ultimus. Fond Rebels! that thought (to use the weighty words of the reverend
Dr. Pirrinchief) to destroy the memory of that Prince, Imp^iso^ing the Bishop
of London, and searching Pocket^s and Clothes.
whose true and lasting glory consisted not in any thing, wherein it was
possible for successors to show the power of their malice, but in a Solid
Virtue, which flourishes by age, and whose fame gathers strength by
multitude of years; when Statues and Monuments are obnoxious to the flames of a
violent envy, and the ruins of time.

But he had a Monument beyond Marble, his Papers with the Bishop of London and
others, and his Incomparable Book of Meditations and Sollioquies. Those
Repositories of piety and wisdom, which first they suppressed, envying the
benefit of mankind; and when the more they hindered the publication of the
Royal Pieces, the more they were sought after. They would have robbed his
Majesty of the honor of being the Sea M. Iconoclastes.
Author of them, knowing they should be odious to all posterity, for murdering
the Prince that composed a Book of so Incredible Prudence, Ardent Piety, and
Majestic and Truly Royal Style. Those parts of it which consisted of Addresses
to God, corresponded so nearly in the occasions, and were so full of the Piety
and Elogancies of David's Psalms, that they seemed to be dictated by the same
spirit.

The ridiculous President, in his Examination of Mr. Royston, who Printed it,
asked him, How he could think so bad a Man (for such would that Monster have
this excellent Prince thought to be) could write so good a Book?

But these attempts were as contemptible as themselves were odious, the faith
of the world in this point being secured, 1. By the unimitably exact Style, not
to be expressed any more than Jove's thunder, but by the Royal Author. 2. By
those Letters of his which they published, of the same periods with these
Meditations they suppressed. 3. By Colonel Hammonds testimony, who heard the
King Read them, and saw him Correct them. 4. By the Archbishop of Armaghs
evidence, who had received commands from the King, to get some of them out of
the hands of the Faction, who had taken them in his Cabinet at Naseby: Besides,
Mr. Roystons command sent him from the King, to provide a Press for some Papers
he should send to him, which were these, together with a design for a Picture
before the Book; which at first, was three Crowns indented on a Wreath of
Thorns; but afterward the King re-called that, and sent that other which is
now before the Book.

This was the vile employment of villains, while all that was virtuous in the
Nation honored the memory of that good Prince, who like the being he
represented, the more he was understood, the more he was admired and loved;
leaving great examples behind him that will be wondered at, eastier than
imitated,

Particularly, the Duke of Richmond, the Marquess of Hertford, the Earls of
Southampton and Lindsey, and the Lord Bishop of London, obtained an order to
Bury his Corpse (which four of his Servants, Herbert, Mildmay, Preston, and
Ioyner, with others in a Mourning Equipage, had carried to Windsor) provided

Canterbury.
I Know not how to begin the History of this incomparable Prelate Dr. Laud, but
as Baudius does his Oration on that Peerless Scholar Joseph Scaliger, Verba
desunt Rebus Immensis: Or as Count Johannes Picus of Mirandula, does his
Complement upon his matchless Barbarus, Ego quidem nec possum, aut taecere quae

possem quod semper sentio; scio quae de te jam Concipio infra fastigia tua
Infinitum subsidere, scias and tu quaecunque loquimur long esse minora iis
quae concipimus, tam deesse scias animo verba, quam rebus animus deest.

So hard it is for one of my thoughts and condition to take the dimensions of
so great a Worth, and so difficut for one of my phrase to express it; but the
good man expresses himself, being is impatient of Varnish on his own Actions,
as he was of Paint over others Faces; (his saying to a Lady, That she was well
plaistered, made all the colored Dames blush through their Vermilion, a much
deeper red.)

He was born October. 7. 1573. at Reading in Berk-shire, and after a wonderful
preservation in his infancy from a very sore fit of sickness, and a happy
education in his childhood under a very severe Schoolmaster; who from his
Strange Dreams, Witty Speeches, Generous Spirit, Great Apprehension, and Nimble
Performances, promised him that Greatness which he afterward enjoyed, saying
to him, When you are a little great man, remember Reading School. Admitted in
Oxford 1589. chosen Scholar of St. John's, June 1590. and Fellow, June 1593.
Comencing Bachelor of Arts, June 1594. and Master July 1599. Ordained Deacon,
June 4. 1600. and Priest, April 5. 1601.

Doctor Young the Lord Bishop of Rochester that Ordained him, finding his study
raised above the Systems and Opinions of the age, upon the nobler foundation of
the Fathers, Councils, and the Ecclesiastical Historians, easily presaged, That
if he lived he would be an instrument of restoring the Church from the narrow
and private principles of modern times, to the more free, large, and public
sentiments of the purest and first Ages.

(...)
1 July 4. 1604. He proceeded Batchelour of Divinity (his Position giving no
less offense to Dr. Holland and other Calvinists in the Schools, than his
Sermon, October. 26. 1606. did to Dr. Airy and other Puritans at St. Mary's) and
Anno 1608. Doctor, being invest, ed in his Vicarage of Stanford in
Northamptonshire, November. 16. 1607. admitted Chaplain to Dr. Neal Bishop of
Rochester, Aug. 5. 1608. Preaching his first Sermon to King James at Theobalds,
Sept. 17. 1609. inducted into West-Tidbury in Essex (which he had in exchange
for his Advowson of Northkilworth in Leichestershire) October. 28. 1609. and into
the Rectory of Cuckston in Kent, May 25. 1610. which (by reason of the
unhealthiness of the place, where he was sick for two months of a Kentish Ague)
he exchanged for Norton, to which he was November. 1610. inducted by Proxy, May
10. 1611. He was chosen President of St. John's, having resigned his Fellowship
there, October. 2. 1610. April 18. 1614. Dr. Neal Bishop of Lincoln bestowed on
him the Prebend of Bugden, and December. 1. 1615. the Arch-deaconry of
Huntington, as the King (whose Chaplain he was sworn November. 3. 1611.) November.
1616. gave him the Deanery of ^l^cester, of which his Majesty was pleased to
say to him, That he well knew it was a Shell without a Kernel; and Aug. 2.
1617. the Rectory of ^bstock in Leichestershire, and Ian. 1. 1620. the Prebend
of Westminster, whereof he had the Advowson ten years before; and June 29.
1622. the Bishopric of St. David's, with the Presidentship of St. John's, the
Prebend of Westminster, and Parsonages of Creek and ^^^s^ck in Commendam with
it, whereunto he was chosen October. 10. and at London House.
Consecrated November. 18. by the Lords Bishops of London, Wor^^ster, Chich^ster,
Fly, Landaffe, and Oxford, the Archbishop Abbot, being though irregular for
casual Homicide.

King Charles finding how he managed these Preferments King James had bestowed
upon him, advanced him, June 20. 1626. to the Bishopric of Bath and Wells, in
the room of Bishop Lake then deceased, and October. 2. the same year Dean of the
Chapel, in the place of Bishop Andrews then departed, and June 17. 1628.
Bishop of London, and Aug. 6. 1633. Archbishop of Canterbury, instead of
Archbishop Abbot then newly dead, the highest honor a Subject can be raised to
in England, or a Minister in the Protestant Church; and as if these honors were
not equal to his merit, at the same time, that he was Installed Archbishop of
Canterbury, he was twice offered, once Aug. 7. 1633. and the second time Aug.
17. following, to be Cardinal, he both returning the Messenger, whom de
discovered to his Majesty this Answer like himself, That there was somewhat
within him that would not suffer that, till Rome was other than it is.

The (...) it raised him.
2. It must needs be imagined, that these preferments raised him as much envy
as advantage; and indeed, though he was singular in other felicities, he was
wrapped in the common unhappiness in this case: For Christmas 1610. Arch bishop
Abbot set the good Lord Chancellor Ellsmen to suggest to King James his being
Popishly affected. October. 3. 1623. he went to the Lord Keeper Williams, who he
found had done him many ill offices; who October. 3. 1623. he says in his Diary,
quarelled him gratis in the Duke of Buckingham, their Joynt-patrons
Withdrawing-chamber.

April. 3. 1624. He went to Archbishop Abbot about a course he had taken to
ease the Church in times of paying the Subsidies to be given that Parliament
(which the Lord Keeper Williams, and the Bishop of Durham approved so well,
that they confessed it was the best office that was done for the Church for
seven years before.) His Grace was very angry, Asked what he had to do to make
any Suit for the Church; telling him, that never any Bishop attempted the like
at any time, nor would any but himself have done it: that he had given such a
wound in speaking to any Lord of the Laity about it, as he could never make
whole again; that if the Lord Duke did fully understand what he had done, he
would never endure him to come near him again.

Whereunto he calmly replied, That he thought he had done very good offices for
the Church, and so did his betters think: If his Grace thought otherwise, he
was sorry he had offended him; hoping that he having done what he did out of a
good mind, for the support of many poor Vicars abroad in the Country; who must
needs sink under three Subsidies a year; his Error, if it were one, was
pardonable.

Ian. 25. 1624. He was forced to declare the whole affair about the Earl of D's
Marriage, which happened twenty years before, when he was a young man, and that
Lords Chaplain to the Duke of B. ill willers, notwithstanding his growing merit
and services; whispering and suggesting up and down that supposed old
miscarriage: Nay, again, April. 9. 1625. he writes thus in his Diary; The Duke
of Buckingham, most Venerable to me by all Titles, certified me; that some
body, I know not out of what envy, had blemished my Name with King Charles his
most Excellent Majesty; taking occasion from the error I fell into (I know not
by what fate heretofore) in the Case of Charles Earl of Devon-shire, December.
26, 1605. April 11. the Duke of Buckingham met him, and informed him what
Secretary C. had suggested against him to the Lord High-Treasurer of England,
and he to the Duke.

Ian. 17. 1627. He showed the King reasons why the Papers of the deceased
Bishop of Winchester concerning Bishops that they are Iure Divino, should be
Printed, and was opposed then by several Grandees, who were of the humor the
Historian expresses thus; That they liked not their own happiness, if others
had the honor of contriving it; receiving no counsels, but what they themselves
first gave.

In October. 1627. The Dean of Canterbury, and Sir Dudley Digges, told Dr. W.
that if things went not well in the Isle of Rhee, there must be a Parliament,
and some must be Sacrificed, and B. L. as like as any; which gave him great
trouble: Till the King desired him, Not to trouble himself with any reports,
before he saw him forsake his other friends.

June 1. 1628. The House of Commons put him into their black Lists of
Innovators and Incendiaries, by the same Token, that one in that House stood
up, and said, Now we have named these persons, let us think of some Causes. And
Sir E. C. answered, Have we not named my Lord of Buckingham without showing a
Cause, and may we not be as bold with them? Wherefore he enters the Dissolution
of that Convention in his Manual March 10. thus: The Parliament which was
broken up this 10th of March labored my Ruin.

March 29. 1629. Sunday, two Papers were found in the Dean of Paul's his Yard
before his House, one of which to this effect concerning him. Laud, look to thy
self, be assured thy life is sought, as thou art the fountain of all
wickedness; Repent, Repent thee of thy monstrous sins, before thou be taken out
of the world, and c. And assure thy self, neither God nor the World can endure
such a vile Counselor to live, or such a whisperer, and c.

Ian. 26. was thus noted by his Lordship: This day discovered to me that which
I was sorry to find in L. T. (Weston) and F. C. (Cottington) sed transeat. Feb.
28. Master Chancellor of London, Dr. Duck brought me word, how miserably I was
slandered by some Separatists: I pray God give me patience, and forgive them.

T. whereof he advertised his Majesty. Some 37. Libels against him up and down
the Streets of London, we had thought worthy remembering, had not he thought it
fit they should not be forgotten.

But for which of his good deeds? The enjoyment of great and and many
Preferments might indeed raise him malice, but his design by all those
Preferments to do great and many good works might have recovered him love; for
surely none needed to have envied that man's Preferment, His good works dove.
that considers what he did, or what he intended.

1. What he did.

1. 1607. No sooner was he Invested in any of his Livings, than he Invested
twelve poor people in a constant allowance out of hose Livings; besides his
constant repairing of the Houses, and furnishing of the Churches wheresoever he
came.

2. When he was chosen, with much opposition both there and at Court, Anno
1618. he set up a great Organ in St. John's Chapel, being to be tracked every
where by his great Benefactions. Allowing the fifth part of all his Incomes to
charitable and pious uses: He built a Chapel and repaired the Cathedral at St.
David's.

Upon occasion both of the abrupt beginning and ending of public Prayers on
the fifth of November, he settled a better order in the Kings Chapel, as Dean
of that Chapel, prevailing with that Gracious King, that he would be present
at the Liturgy as well as the Sermon; and that at whatsoever time of Prayers he
came, the Priest who Ministered should proceed to the end of Prayers, which was
not done before from the beginning of King James his reign to that day.

1629, 1630. He furnished the Library of Oxford with 1300 Hebrew, Arabic,
Persian Manuscripts, and choice Antiquities, the University with their
excellent Statutes, With new Privilege, as large as those in Cambridg, since
11. the eighth h^s time.
and a large new Charter; and St. John's College in it with useful and curious
buildings; a College that as well as Christ-Church, might be called Canterbury
College.

From the year 1630. to the year 1640. he recovered hundreds of Impropriations
in Ireland, procuring of King Charles to give all Impropriations, yet remaining
in the Crown within the Realm of Ireland, to that poor Church.

1630. He set upon the repair of St. Paul's, the only Cathedral in Christendom
of that name, allowing, besides a great sum to begin it, five hundred pounds a
year while he was Bishop of London, and no doubt after he was Archbishop of
Canterbury, till it was finished.

1633. He retrenched the extraordinary Fees at Court for Church-preferments,
sometimes to prevent the Extortion of inferior Officers, doing poor Ministers
business himself, rather than they should be at the charge of having it done by
others.

1634. He began the settlement of the Statutes of all the Cathedrals of the new
foundation; whose Statutes are imperfect and not confirmed; and finished those
of Canterbury.

1635. He procured and bought settled Commendams, whereof several sine Cura, on
the small Bishoprics of Bristol, Peterbourgh, St. Asaph, Chester, and Oxford.

1636. He set up a Greek Press in London, buying both Matrices and Press for
Printing of the Library M. SS. and others he intended to make a rare Collection
of.

The same year he erected an Arabic Lecture in Oxford, first settled there for
his life, and afterward for ever, as he did an Hospital at Reading, with 200
l. per annum Revenue, established in a new way.

1637. A Book in Vellam of the Records in the Tower, that concern the Clergy,
at his own charge Transcribed, and left in his Study at Lambeth for posterity.

A new Charter for the Town of Reading, and a new Charter and Statutes for the
College and University of Dublin.

2. What he Intended.

1. He had cast a Model for the increase of the Stipends of poor Vicars. 2. He
intended to see the Tithes of London settled, between the Clergy and the City.
3. He thought to have settled some hundreds a year upon the Fabric of St.
Paul's, toward the repair till that be finished, and to keep it in good state
afterward, Wherein be did intend to hang as great, and as tuneable a Ring of
Bells, as any are in the world.
communicating likewise to a friend to rebuild the great Tower some yards
higher than before. 4. He purposed to have opened the great Square at Ouford,
between Saint Mary's, the Schools, Brasen-Nose, and All Souls. 5. He resolved
to set on foot the buying in of Impropriations, hoping to be able to buy in two
or three in a year.
Not to mention his Entertainments of the King and Queen, to the honor and
advantage of the University of Oxon, when he was Chancellor there; his
bestowing all his favors upon no other condition, than something to be done by
his Clients in acknowledgement of them for the Church. So he obliged Bishop
Bancroft to build the Bishopric a House; another to bestow the Patronage of
upon St. John's: A third, to raise the Stipends of three Vicarages in his gift,
and c. His preferring of Churchmen to the greatest Places of Trust, to honor
Religion, too much despised in the later times. For see his design in the
advancement of that good man, Bishop Iuxon, as it is expressed in his Diary
(and an exact Diary is a window to his heart that makes it.)

March 6. William Iuxon, Lord Bishop of London, made Lord High-Treasurer of
England, no Churchman had it since Henry the Sevenths time: I pray God bless
him to carry it so, that the Church may have honor, and the King, and the State
service and contentment by it. And now if the Church will not hold up
themselves under God, I can do no more. His daily Hospitality, and weekly
Alms, and other the great effects of a very great spirit, that had not so
great a prize in its hand, as he had a large heart to dispose thereof for the
general good; looking upon himself as the Steward, rather than the Master of
his great Revenues, might have excused his height from envy, as well as that of
the heavens, that are not maliced because high, but reverenced because benign;
none grudging them either the Place they hold, or the Vapors they draw up;
because all are blessed with the Influences they shed, and the Showers they
send: And the rather, because he was as great himself as his performances, and
his preferments were not only means to do good works, but the just reward of
great parts; parts every way becoming the greatest Clergyman and Statesman;
and indeed few or none envied his preferments, that were not afraid of his
abilities; he being reckoned one of the greatest Scholars of our Nation: His
judgment being as acute (witness the exactest Piece ever writ on that subject,
his Controversy with Fisher) as his Eye was piercing, his Memory as firmly
retaining his Observations, as his Apprehension took them Discerningly, and his
Industry collected them Vnweariedly. He was not advanced because he would keep
a good House, repair his Barns, and c. any Dunce may do this; but, because he
seemed born to the honor he was raised to, owing his degree not only to Favor,
but to Nature too; he being exact in all the recommending excellencies of
humane accomplishments, thought deserving more honor beyond Sea, than those he
was envied for here. In all those Arts and Sciences he honored with some
thoughts about, he was not so much skillful, as commanding; not only knowing,
but a Master; and having gone through the difficulties of Ingenuity with as
much success as a Scholar, as he did the difficulties of Government as a
Statesman, in both a Primate, in both excelling. The forementioned Piece
composed with such an authentic and unerring accuracy, as if there had been a
Chair of Infallibility at Lambeth, as well as at Rome, and he had been indeed
what his Predecessors have been called, Papa alterius Orbis, and each word had
been decreed by the Crosier, than written with the Sword, deserved the highest
encouragements in that Church, whereof it was the best defense, which how ever
ridiculously at first ascribed to others, was so peculiar to him, that his very
enemies confessed he did it, because, none else: So hard it is to counterfeit
the great Genius and Spirit of Honor, and there are in such Books the
inimitable peculiarities of an incommunicable faculty and condition.

To which, when you add the exemplary strictness of his Life, witness his care
in keeping a constant Diary of it. He is a good Christian that Audits the
account of his soul every day, as he a good husband that casts up the expenses
of his occasions every night. The tenderness of his Conscience evident in this
and other passages of his Devotion.

The constant course of his Devotion is lately published, Printed at: Oxford
1666
his observations of Gods providence over him to furnish him with matter for
his private prayer, while he did (as the Apostle exhorts) thus watch unto
prayer, as his sicknesses, his falls, the causualities in his Family and
Affairs, (he judging nothing too mean for him to remarque that was not below
God to do) were exact, his diet temperate, his converse chaste, having no Woman
about his house, reckoning it not every man's gift in Tertullians phrase; Salvis
oculis videre faeminam, the gravity of his Person, (severity and quickness
being well compounded in his face) giving a good example always in this
plainness of his garb and apparel, and when in power, good precepts checking
says the Historian, such Clergymen as he saw go in rich or gaudy dresses
under his common and tart notion of Ministers of the Church-triumphant. Thus as
Cardinal Wolsey is reported the first Prelate, who made Silks and Sattens
fashionable for Clergymen, so this Archbishop first retrenched the usual
wearing thereof. Once at a Visitation in Essex, one in Orders (of good Estate
and extraction) appeared before him very gallant in habit, whom he publicly
reproved with the plainness of his own apparel. My Lord (said the Minister) you
have better Clothes at home, and I have worse; whereat his Lordship rested very
well contented: wearing his hair short, and injoyning others so to do; not
enduring to know any of his kindred if they appeared with flaunting Clothes,
long hair, or smelt either of Tobacco or Wine. I knew (says an Historian) a
near Kinsman of his (by the way, to show the impartiality of his favors) in
Cambridge Scholar enough, but something wild and lazy, on whom it was late
before he reflected with favor, and that not before his amendment, and
generally those preferred by him were men of Learning and Ability.

The great influence of his public spirit reaching not only so far as he had
power himself, but also as far as any had power that either saw his good
example, or read his effectual admonitions. At a Visitation kept in St. Peter's
Cornhil for the Clergy of London, The Preacher discoursing of the painfulness
of the Ministerial Function, proved it from the Greek deduction of (...) or
Deacon, so called from (...) dust, because he must laborare in pulvere in
arena, work in the dust, do hard service in hot weather. Sermon ended, my Lord,
then of London, proceeded to his Charge to the Clergy, and observing the Church
ill repaired without, and slovenly kept within. I am sorry (said he) to meet
here with so true an Etymology of Diaconus, for here is both dust and dirt too,
for a Deacon or Priest either to work in; yea it is dust of the worst kind,
caused from the ruins of this ancient house of God, so that it pittieth his
servants to see her in the dust. Hence he took an occasion to press the repair
of that, and other places of Divine Worship, so that from this day we may date
the general mending, beautifying, and adorning of all English Churches; some to
decency, and some to magnificence.

I say it you add these admirable endowments of his Person, to the excellent
Catalogue of his Actions, you might confess that there was reason why he should
be envied, but no reason why he should be Libelled so often, His sufferings.
as I have formerly mentioned he was. Why his house should be sacked Monday May
11. 1640. about midnight by 500 persons of the rascal riotous multitude,
according to the Paper posted upon the Exchange, exhorting them so to do, May
9. to his utter ruin, had not he upon timely notice fortified his house, taken
and punished the Ringleaders in spite of the tumult that brake all the prisons
about the Town; and severely threatened him in a Libel September 1. with another
assault in the Kings absence. Why he should receive such a Letter as he did
from one Mr. Rocket, informing him, That he was among the Scots as he traveled
through the Bishopric of Durham, he heard them inveigh, and rail against the
Archbishop exceedingly; and they hoped shortly to see him, as the Duke was,
slain by one least suspected. Why the Scots Commissioners should name him in
the House of Lords an Incendiary, and in the House of Commons a Traitor, Dec.
16. 17, 18. Why he should be committed to the Black Rod and confined, being
only permitted to go to Lambeth for a Book or two, and some Papers for his
defense against the Scots, where he staid late, (hearing with comfort the 93.
and 94. Psalms, and the 50. of Isaiah) to avoid the gazing of the people; why
they should make him as soon as he was confined December 21. sell Plate to pay
500 l. for punishing a known Adultery, in which case, he said, Suppose it was
more than the Law strictly allowed, what may be done for Honor and Religions
sake? Why D. C. 24. there should be a resolution among the Lords to sequester
him from the Kings Counsel, and deprive him of his Archbishopric; not only,
as he says, before he had put any answer in for himself, but likewise before
his adversaries put in any Charge against him? Why Friday Feb. 26. after full
ten weeks Imprisonment in Mr. Maxwells house, he should be ordered to the
Tower? why he should be followed, and railed at by the people and rabble in
multitudes in his way thither, as he went in Mr. Maxwells Coach to the very
Tower-gates? and indeed it was thought he was sent that way on purpose to be
torn in pieces by the rabble.

Why October. 23. 1642. his Jurisdiction should be requestred to his inferior
Officers, and his Spirituals and Temporals suspended, he having not so much as
power to bestow a Living? Why Nov. 8. 42. his house should be seized for a
Garrison and Prison, his Rents sequestered, as was pretended, to keep the Kings
Children? Why October 24. he should be so closely confined, as to be debarred
the liberty of the Tower, nor to speak with any Prisoner or other person, but
in the presence of his Warder; all his Servants being removed from him but two,
and they not to speak with one another, nor with any other, but before the
Warder, nor to stir out without the Lieutenants leave? Why Nov. 24. his Chapel
was broken open at Lambeth, and the Furniture of it spoiled, his Hor^es at the
same time being seized by order from the Committee, and all his provision in
the house spent upon the prisoners.

Why March 24. 1642/3. there should be a plot to send him and Bishop Wren to
New England within fourteen days, and April 25. a motion made to that purpose
in the Lower House? Why May 1. his Chapel windows should be defaced, all his
Goods and Books seized upon, and he confined to his Chamber, not to stir out
without his Keeper; and a rumor that he should be removed to a Prison-lodging.

Why Feb. 26. 1640. so many bitter Speeches should be made of him, as of a
spiritual wickedness in high places, and 14 general Articles exhibited against
him, with a promise to make them good by Articles more particular, besides the
Impeachment of the Scots Commissioners, and the further enforcing of the former
Articles by the English, Oct. 23. 1643. in ten Articles more, to all which he
was ordered the same day to put in his Answer in writing against the sixth, and
upon second thoughts Nov. 13. with much ado allowing Mr. Herne, Mr. Chute, Mr.
Hales, and Mr. Gerard of Grayes-Inn, to be of Counsel for him: and Mr. Dell,
Cob, and Smith, his Servants, for Sollicitors; On which 13 of Nov. 1^43. he was
brought to the Bar, and made his answer: whereupon the Committee for his Trial
met closely at Star Chamber to prepare evidences against him, and his Trial
appointed Ian. 8. 1643. first, and afterward Ian. 16. when about three a Clock
in the afternoon (after three years Imprisonment and no hearing) he appearing,
had no more done (but their Articles read, and his answers thereunto rejected)
as he had not Ian. 22. 1643. nor Feb. 22. 1643. March 4. 9. and 12. All which
bitter days they carried him up and down, from the Tower to Westminster. either to
kill him with grief, cold, and vexation, or to give the rabble opportunity to
do him a mischief, as they did March 13, 16, 18. 1643. and March 28. 1644.
April 16. and May 4. 20, 27. and June 6. 11, 17, 20. 27. July 20, 24, 29.
seventeen days besides twelve days attending more, wherein there was nothing
done: and Sept. 2. 11. October. 11. Nov. 2. 11, 13. December. 4. spent in Speeches
and delays, they designing rather the tyring than destroying of him. All this
while not allowing him to answer his whole Charge at once, but one Article one
day, and another Article another, and not declaring (though earnestly
petitioned by him so to do) what Articles were Treason, what Misdemeanors, but
sheltering themselves under the old (...) That all the Articles taken together,
not each, or any particular Article by it self, made up the Treason.

Why, after so many mouths trial, in which (notwithstanding their tedious
proceedings to break his spirit) he had acquitted himself with such a
confidence as became the constancy and innocence of a Christian Bishop and
Confessor: but yet must fall to please the Scots and those merciless men, who
imputed Gods anger in the difficulties of their success against their Prince,
to the continuance of this Prelates life: He should be voted guilty of
High Treason by the little remainder of the House of Commons at Westminster,
Nov. 10. 1643. and condemned by seven Lords in the upper House, (all they not
concurring neither) December. 17. 1644. to be hanged, drawn, and quartered: The
first example of murdering men by Votes, and of killing by an Order of
Parliament (neither House, if full and legally sitting, having power over the
life of the meanest subject without the King) since the Creation. And why, when
the Lords upon his Petition, to the distaste of some Commons changing the
manner of that vile execution, to that more generous of being beheaded (the
motion for exposing him to the contempt and malice of the people of
New England, being waved as too great an honor, because it would make his End
as his Life was, Dr. P. life K. Charles.
much like that of the Primitive Bishops, who for their piety were banished to
barbarous Coasts, or condemned to the Mines; or else it would be like the
Athenian Ostracism, and confess him too great and good to live amongst us) he
must be brought to the Scaffold, Ian. 10. after he had endured some affronts in
his Antichamber in the Tower, by some Sons of Schism and Sedition, who
unseasonably, that morning he was preparing himself to appear before the great
Bishop of our souls, would have him give some satisfaction to the godly (for so
they called themselves) for his Persecutions, which he called Discipline: To
whom he answered, That he was now shortly to give an account of all his actions
at an higher and more equal Tribunal, and desired he might not be disturbed in
his preparations for it. Others asked him (to ruffle his soul into a passion,
now he was fairly folding it up, to deliver it into the hands of his Redeemer)
what were the most comfortable words a man should dye with in his mouth? And he
mildly answered, Cupio dissolvi, and esse cum Christo; adding meekly (when
asked how a man at that time might express his assurance) That such assurance
was to be found within, grounded on the word of God concerning Christ's dying
for us, and that no words were able to express it rightly.

Why these Indignities to so good a man in his life time, and more in
scandalous Papers of him, when dead, which I hope the authors have lived to
repent of! Indignities, the bare narrative whereof, is a Satyr against our age
and Nation, and therefore I attempt not the just expression of it, my very
apprehension over laying my words, and indeed this black action receives no
colors.

The crimes laid to his Charge, and reasons of his sufferings
You shall hear his Faults.

1. Adorning the Chapels and Churches that he had to do with, with Pictures
for decency and instruction, the use Calvin himself, as he alleged him, And

superstitione teneor, ut nullus prosus imagines serendas censeam, etc. Though
they charged him with many ornaments of Chapels, that he found there done by
others; and urged, that he took them out of the Mass Book, when he never knew
they were there.

2. Removing and Railing the Communion Table Altar-wise, North and South
against the Wall, and furnishing his Lambeths Chapel, according to Queen
Elizabeth's Injunction, the pattern of the Kings Chapel, and the practice of
the Lutheran Churches.

3. The setting up of a Side-table, called Credentia, according to the way in
Bishop Andrews his Chapel, bowing toward the Communion Table, according to the
ancient practices in Queen Elizabeth's and King James his reign, and using Copes
according to the twenty fourth Canon of the Church 1603.

4. The ancient custom of Standing at Gloria Patri, Bowing at the Name of
Jesus, according to the eighteenth Canon of our Church, and twelfth Injunction
of Queen Elizabeth. Organs, and As ancient at Constancines time, sec Polyd.

5. Receiving a Bible with a Crucifix Embroidred on the cover of it from a Lady.

6. A Book of Popish pictures, two Missals, Pontificals and Breviaries, which
he made use of as a Scholar.

7. His Admirable Book of Devotion, digested according to the ancient way of
Canonical Hours, after holy David's example, Psalm. 119. 164. and the And the

8. Three Pictures in his Gallery, one sent him, the other two there since
Archbishop Whitgifts time, of Saint Augustine, Saint Ambrose, etc. allowed by
the Harmony of Protestant Confession in the lawful use of them; and written
against severely by himself, in the unlawful use of them.

9. His Reverent Posture at White Hall Chapel, which all the Lords used, and
the Knights of the Garter were bound to use. Bishop Wren's adorning the Altar
with a And it was pretly th^^ swear (...) was offended much the new Crucifix,
whereas he (...) no notice of the old crucifix, that wathere many years before.
See Antiq. B^ic. p. 33. and 102.
Crucifix, which was nothing to him, more than some peoples bowing that way:
which they urged against him.

10. His Compiling the Form of the Kings Coronation, when it was done by a
Committee according to an old form of Consecration, belonging to Archbishop
Abbot, there being no passage new in it, but this old Protestant one, used in
Popish times, which fixed more spiritual power in the King, than the Pope would
willingly allow, jealous that any should finger Saint Peter's Keys save himself.
And is this, Let him obtain favor for thy people like Aaron in the Tabernacle,
Elisha in the waters, Zecharias in the Temple, give him Peter's Key of
Discipline, and Paul's Doctrine; which my Lord inserted not of himself, but in
concurrence with the rest.

11. All the comely Repairs of any Church or Chapel, especially in the
Universities, any bodies bowing to One swore against him, that a man bowed to
the Virgin Mary's Pictures over St. Mary's door in Oxon.
a Picture in his time; as if he could answer all the miscarriages and
indiscretions of men throughout the kingdom during his government. The Oxford
Scholars reverence to the Communion Table, Dr. Lambs questioning Mr. Corbet,
and Mr. Cheynel: the Oxford Copes, and Latin prayers; nay, all that was done
either in Oxford or Cambridge, from 1628. to 1640.

12. All the Copes, Altars, Candlesticks, Utensils, Furnitures, and Gestures
(though according to Canon) used in any Cathedral in England.

13. The Railing of Communion-tables, the receiving of the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper, and saying Second Service there, according to the Canons and
Injunctions, the using of Painted Glass, Bishop Wren, Bishop Mountagues, and
Bishop Peirces his Visitation Articles about Parish Churches, wherein he had
nothing to do.

14. Punishing Mr. Smart of Durham, who was censured by the High Commission at
York, where he was none. 2. Mr. Chancy, who suffered by the High Commission,
when he was but one. 3. Mr. Bromley, prosecuted by Sir Nath. Brent without him.
4. Mr. Sherfield, who suffered by the whole Court of Star Chamber in his
absence. 5. The purging of Dr. Featleys Sermons, done by his Chaplain unknown
to him. 6. Mr. Workman, by his own Diocesan and the High Commission, not by
him. 7. Mr. P. B. and B. proceeded with in a legal way in Star Chamber, he
not being there.

8. Birket and the Churchwardens of Becking ston, the one proceeded against in
the High Commission, and the other by Bishop Pierce, without his privity. 9.
Ferdinando Adams was Pursevanted by Bishop Wren for shutting his Church against
his Visitors, and not by my L. of C.

15. Pictures found in Sir F. Windebanke and Dr. Ducks Bibles, nothing to him.

16. His Consecrating of Churches and Chapels, according to the Word Exodus 40

times; using Bishop Andrews his form for Consecration.

17. His taking money for it, by which you must understand fifteen pounds fees,
which he returned to the Churchwardens, to distribute among the poor.

18. A draught of his Popish Furniture, and form of his own Chapel, as they
urged, which proved not his, but Bishop Andrews form and furniture, which he
had caused to be transcribed.

19. The Book of Sports, which was published, first in King James his Reign,
before he had any power in the Church; and afterward in King Charles his Reign,
before he had the chief power in the Church; he being very strict in his
practice on that day, and the less strict of any Bishop in pressing the
publication of that Declaration which allowed liberty to be otherwise;
suspending none in his whole Province for that fault alone, and setting out
such moderate Visitation-Articles, as by the Joynt-petition of the most sober
and moderate part of the Clergy to him, were desired to be the Standard to all
other Visitation-Articles.

Besides, that if he had set out, and pressed that Declaration, it was only a

Licentiousness, contrary to Christian practices; for it allowed only Lawful
Recreations, and those only after Evening Prayer; and that only to them that
came to Prayers, with a very severe Caution against Profaneness and
Debauchery: It declared the first only Impune, in the way of a Civil Edict,
determining nothing; but condemned the latter as unlawful, in the way of an
Ecclesiastical Decree, allowing nothing. It undeceived the people, that they
might not be ensnared from their Liberty to Judaical opinions, but understand
the truth in this point, as it was declared by the Laws either of God or Men
truly. It restrained the people, that they might not be debauched from their
Christian sobriety to Heathenish looseness; but practice their duty on this day,
as it was taught by the Laws of God and Men orderly.

20. His next Charge, is his For which trey searched the (...) book.
preferring of 1. The great Scholar, Critic, and Antiquary Dr. Mountague,
though it was Sir Dudley Carleton that preferred him. 2. The profound Divine
and honest man Dr. Iackson. 3. Charitable, Meek, and Learned Dr. Christopher
Potter. 4. Acute, Pious, and Rationable Bishop Chapple. 5. Pious,
Publick-spirited, and Learned Dr. Cosins, preferred indeed by the Archbishop
of York. 6. The very Learned and Industrious Bishop Lindsey, deservedly
preferred indeed by Bishop Neile. 7. The worthy A. B. Neile, who was so far
from being preferred by my Lord of Canterbury, that in truth my Lord of G. was
advanced by him. 8. The smart, discreet, and understanding man Bishop Wren,
Chaplain to Bishop Andrews. 9. He is charged with the Encouragements he gave
Dr. Heylm, who was raised by the Earl of Denby: Dr. Baker, Bray, Weeks,
Pocklington, who were recommended by the Bishop of London, etc. 10. It is
reckoned his fault, that he interposed with His Majesty for such worthy men, as
Bishop Usher recommended to him in Ireland, and that upon a difference between
the Lord Keeper and the Master of the Wards, about Livings in the Kings Gift;
he moved the King to remove the occasion of those differences, by presenting to
him immediately himself, and that if he recommended a worthy man to the King as
Chaplain, he trespassed upon my Lord Chamberlains Office.

21. Some hundred Books are produced, out of which some indiscreet passages had
been expunged by Some his Chaplains, some the Bishop of Londons.
Dr. Heywood, Dr. Baker, Dr. Weeks, Dr. Oliver, etc. and these purgations are
laid upon him: and because the forementioned Gentleman suffered not bitter
expressions that tended to the raising of old and legally silenced
Controversies, to pass the press, as the For so they are, when licenced.
expressions of the Church of England, the Archbishop must come to the Block,
as an enemy of the Church of England.

22. Because a Jesuit contrived a Letter wherein Arminianism is said to be
planted in England, to usher in Popery, therefore the Archbishop preferring
some worthy men who were of the same mind with Arminians, had a design to
introduce Popery.

23. The High Commission called in many Books, and punished Authors, Printers,
or Booksellers, and the poor Archbishop, therefore indeavored the subversion
of the Government.

24. The Kings Declaration to silence the Controversies of the Church, and his
care to check those that endeavored to renew them: The King and Councels Order
at Woodstock about the tumult 1633. at Oxford: the Kings persuading of Bishop
Davenant, and Bishop Hall, to leave out some passages in their writings that
might disturb the Peace, and imprisoning their Printer for daring after they
were purged, to insert them in. His Majesty's approving Bishop Harsenets
considerations about the Controversies, and sending them to every Bishop, and
his Deputies, reversing the Articles in Ireland, make up his 21 th. Charge.

25. The Star Chamber Order July 1. 1637. about Printing, whereby the Geneva
Bibles were prohibited here; and by Sir William Boswell suppressed in Holland,
Mr. Gellibrands new Almanac in Mr. Foxes his way burned; Beacon, Palsgraves
Religion, and c. and other Books against the Kings Declaration for laying down
Controversies stifled, through the actions of other men, must be this good man's
fault.

26. If Popish Books crept in either by imposing on his Chaplains, or being
printed without license, though innocent ones too, he must be guilty of a
design against the Protestant Religion

27. The Kings Command to him to alter the form of Prayer for the fifth of
November, Dr. Potters request to him to review his Book called Charity
mistaken, must be another branch of his Charge: as was his Majesty's Order
about sending the Common Prayer upon D. H. request: The Scottish alterations of
it, another; the Bishops Chaplains presuming to alter the least Syllable in a
conceited Authors Work a third. The Importation of unlawful books by stealth
against his will, and without his knowledge, a fourth. Considerations about
Lectures written by Bishop Harsenet, and sent to every Diocese by Archbishop
Abbot, a fifth^ Attorney General Noy's suppressing the Puritan Corporation,
for buying in of Impropriations as illegal and dangerous, a sixth. The
alteration of the Letters Patents for the Palatinate Collection by the Kings
Order, who would not have such expressions pass the Great Seal, as determined
some Controversies, as that the Pope was Antichrist, which neither the Schools
nor the Church had decided, a seventh. His very favorable dealing with the
Walloon, the French, and Dutch Church (for which they thanked him) upon some
encroachments of theirs upon the Parishes, where they lived, an eighth.

28. 1. The Jesuits whispering into the ears of some fond people to raise
suspicions of him, and so oppositions against him, which was the sum of Sir H.
M. Mr. A. M. and Mr. Chapter hear-says of him, produced at the Bar.

2. Rumors raised upon him, because of his acquaintance with one Louder Brown,
and Ireland, reputed Papists; because his supposition in Oxford concurred in
some things with Bellarmine, where Bellarmine himself concurred with the
Primitive times.

3. Because Bishop Hall writ a Letter to one W. L. not to halt between two
Religions.

4. Because a Doctor in the University preached against those who were severe
against the Puritans, the then predominant Faction, and moderate against the
Catholics at that time kept under, and that he was pointed at by the
University as one of those discreet men, which indeed moved him, but yet so,
that in a business of that kind he thought fit (in a Letter to Bishop Neal) to
be swaged to a patient course.

The Treaty for the Spanish Match, which began before he was so much as Bishop,
and ended before he was Privy-Counsel, the Duke of B. breaking it off to the
great contentment of the Kingdom, as appeared by the Parliaments thanks to him
1624. with whom he is accused to be so familiar, and the Treaty with France,
which was managed with the Parliaments approbation.

inconsistent with the Laws of the Land, and the Charity one Christian ought to
have toward the other; his endeavor after a reconciliation of all Christian
Churches expressed in these words: Reply to fither. p. 388
I have with a faithful, and single heart, labored the meeting, the blessed
meeting of peace and truth in Christ Church, which God I hope will in due time
effect.

His Correspondence with Priests and Jesuits (not half so much as Archbishop
Bancroft and Abbot, held with them to understand the bottom of their Intrigues
and Designs) not proved against him, he being as shie of them and they of him,
as any man in England; and only watchful over them and others that were likely
to disturb the Peace of the Realm, in such a prudent and discreet way, as the
vulgar understand not, and therefore suspected.

His not believing every idle rumor about Papists and others, so far as to
acquaint the King and Counsel with it, especially when they tended to the
disparagement of our gracious Queen, or her Great Mother.

His answer writ by the Kings command to the Commons Remonstrance against him
1628. The Lord Wentworths Letter to him about Parliaments in Ireland: His
speaking a good word for an old Friend Sir F. W. to prefer him at Court.

His supervising of the Scottish Lyturgy by warrant from the King, and the good
Orders sent into Scotland by the Kings Command, and under his Hand and Seal.

All the Letters he sent into Scotland about that Affair, by his Majesty's
special Command in these words: Canterbury, I require you to hold a
Correspondency with the Bishop of Dunblane, the present Dean of our Chapel
Royal in Edinburgh, that so from time to time he may receive our directions by
you, for the ordering of such things as concern our Service in the said
Chapel. By virtue of which likewise he was enjoined to peruse the new
Common Prayer, and Canons of Scotland, sent by the Bishops there, hither to
England; and send them, with such emendations, as his Majesty allowed, back
again into Scotland.

His being the occasion of the Tumults there who was against the Commission for
recovering Tithes, which was the real occasion of them, and who writ thus to
the Lord Traquair, High-Treasurer of Scotland:

My Lord,
I Think you know my opinion, how I would have Church-business carried, were I
as great a Master of men, as I thank God I am of things, the Church should
proceed in a constant temper; she must make the world see she had the wrong,
but offered none, And since Law has followed in that kingdom, perhaps to make
good that which was ill done; yet since a Law it is, such a Reformation, or
Restitution should be sought for, as might stand with the Law, and some
expedient be found out, how the Law may be by some just Exposition helped, till
the State shall see cause to Abolish it. Yea, and found great fault with the
Bishops there, for that they acted in these things without the privity and
advice of the Lords, and others his Majesty's Councils, Officers of State, and
Ministers of Government.

Some Jesuits writing pretended Letters, discovering the method taken in
England for reducing Scotland; a Paper of Advice sent him about Scotland from a
great man thither, and Sir John Burwughs observation out of Records, concerning
War with Scotland, transcribed for his use; among which these are considerable.

I. For Settling the Sea Coast.
1. Forts near the Sea, Fortified and Furnished with Men and Munition. 2. All
Persons that had Possessions or Estates in Maritine Counties, commanded by
Proclamation to reside there with Families and Retinue. 3. Beacons Erected in
diverse fitting places. 4. Certain Light Horse about the Sea Coasts. 5. Maritine
Counties Armed, and Trained under several Commanders, led by one General under
his Majesty.
II. Concerning the Peace of the Kingdom.
1. All Conventicles and Secret Meetings severely forbidden. 2. All Spreaders
of Rumors, and Tale-bearers Imprisoned. 3. All able Men, from sixteen to
threescore, throughout the Kingdom Armed and Trained; and those that could not
bear Arms themselves having Estates, to maintain those that could.
An Order of the Councel-table, under thirteen Privy-Counsellors hands to him
and all the Bishops, to stir up all the Clergy of ability in their respective
Diocesses, to contribute toward the defense of the Realm, and a Warrant under
his Majesty's hand, to the same purpose; The suppression of the scandalous
Paper about the Pacification, disavowed by the English Commissioners, the Earls
of Arundel, Pembroke, and Salisbury, etc.

The Kings Officers Contributions toward the same occasions.

The Sitting of the Convocation 1640. by his Majesty's Order, approved by all
the Judges of the Land under their hands.

The Orders sent by the Council, to the Lord Conway, then in Chief Command of

The Recusants Contributions according to their Allegiance, toward the defense
of the Kingdom, by the Queens Majesty's directions^

The Discoveries the Catholics pretended to make of one another.

These are his pretended Faults, most part whereof are Faults that no man yet
was thought guilty for, being excell^nt Virtues; and the rest of the
miscarriages, he was not guilty of, being 1. Either the Acts of whole Courts,
where he was never but one, and sometimes none. 2. Or the actions of particular
Persons, in whom he was not concerned; or acts of State, by which he was
obliged. So that in reference to the first, he might use St. Eucherius his
Prayer. God pardon me my sins, and Men forgive me Gods grace and gifts: And
with respect to the second, that good man's Orisons, who used to pray, O!
forgive me my other men's sins.

And these the crimes for which his Sacred Blood, after so many Tumults,
Libels, and Petitions in England, Scotland, and Ireland, was shed; without any
respect to his Abilities, his Services, his Age, his Function, or Honor: Crimes
you see answered when named, made up into a Charge that was its own Reply, and
therefore barely set down by me, without any reflection, save their own nature
and self-confutation. What is ridiculous need only be showed.

interceded for others to God, pleading for himself before men.


I. To his Charge in General.
My Lords!
MY being in this place in this condition, recalls to my memory that which I
long since read in Seneca, Tormentum est, etiamsi absolutus quis fuerit causam
dixisse (6. de Benef. c. 28.) His excellent Defense of himself. 1. His General
Speech.
It Is not a grief, only, no; it is no less than a torment, for an ingenuous man
to plead Capitally or Criminally, though it should so fall out, that he be
absolved. The great truth of this, I find at present in my self; and so much
the more, because I am a Christian; and not that only, but in Holy-orders; and
not so only, but by Gods grace and goodness, preferred to the greatest place
this Church affords; and yet brought, Causam dicere, to plead for my self at
this Bar.

And whatsoever the world think of me (and they have been taught to think much
more ill of me, then, I humbly thank Christ for it, I was ever acquainted with)
yet, My Lords, this I find, Tormentum est, it is no less than a torment to me,
to appear in this place.

Nay, my Lords, give me leave to speak plain truth; No sentence that can justly
pass upon me (and other I will never fear from your Lordships) can go so near
me, as Causam dicere, to plead for my self upon this occasion, and in this
place.

For as for the Sentence, be it what it shall, I thank God for it; I am for it
at Saint Paul's ward ( Acts 25. 11.) If I have committed any thing worthy of
death, I refuse not do dye: For I thank God, I have so lived, as that I am
neither afraid to dye, nor ashamed to live. But seeing the Malignity which has
been raised against me by some men, I have carried my very life in my hands
these diverse years past. But yet, my Lords, if there be none of these things
whereof they accuse me, though I may not in this Case, and from this Bar appeal
unto Caesar, yet to your Lordships Justice and Integrity, I both may, and do;
not doubting, but that God of his goodness will preserve my innocence.

And as Job in the midst of his affliction said to his mistaken Friends, so
shall I to my Accus^r^; God forbid I should justify you; till I dye I will not
remove my Integrity from me. I will hold it fast and not let it go, my heart
shall not reproach me as long as I live, Job 22. 5.

My Lords, the Charge against me is brought up in ten Articles, but, the main
heads are two: An endeavor to subve^t the Laws of the Land, and the Religion
established; Six Articles (the fifth, first and the last) concern the Laws, and
the other four Religion.

For the Laws, first, I think I may safely say, I have been, to my
understanding, as strict an observer of them all the days of my life, so far as
they concern me, as any man has; and since I came into place, I have followed
them, and been as much g^ided by them as any man that sat where I had the honor
to sit. And of this I am sorry I have lost the testimony of the Lord Keeper
Coventry, and other persons of Honor since dead.

And the Council which attended at the Council Board can witness, some of them
here present, that in all references to the Board, or debates arising at the
Board, I was for that part of the cause, where I found Law to be; and if the
Council desired to have the cause left to the Law, well I might move in some
cases, Charity or Conscience to them; but I left them to the Law, if thither
they would go: And how such a carriage as this through the whole course of my
life in private and public, can stand, with an intention to overthrow the
Laws, I cannot yet see.

Nay more, I have ever been of opinion, That Laws bind the Conscience, and
have accordingly made Conscience of observing them: and this doctrine I have
constantly preached as occasion has been offered me; and how is it possible, I
should seek to overthrow those Laws which I held my self bound in Conscience to
keep and observe?

As for Religion, I was born and bred up in and under the Church of England, as
it stands established by Law; I have by Gods blessing^ grown up in it to the
years which are now upon me, and to the place of Preferment which I now bear.

I have ever since I have understood ought in my profession, kept one constant
tenor in this my profession, without variation or shifting from one opinion to
another, for any worldly ends: And if my conscience would have suffered me to
do so, I could easily have slid through all the difficulties which I have pressed
upon me in this kind: But of all diseases I have held, a Palsy in Religion
most dangerous; well knowing and remembering, that disease often ends in a dead
Palsy.

Ever since I came in place, I have labored nothing more, than that the
external public worship of God (so much slighted in diverse parts of this
Kingdom) might be preserved, and that with as much decency and uniformity as
might be: for I evidently saw, that the public neglect of Gods service in the
outward face of it, and the nasty lying of many places dedicated to that
Service, had almost cast a damp upon the true and inward worship of God, which
while we live in the body needs exterial helps, and all little enough to keep
it in any vigor. And thus I did to the uttermost of my knowledge, according
both to Law and Canon, and with the consent and liking of the people; nor did
any Command issue out from me against the one, or without the other.

Further my Lords, give me leave, I beseech you, to acquaint you with this
also, that I have as little acquaintance with Recusants, as I believe, any man
of my place of England has, or ever had sithence the Reformation; and for my
kindred, no one of them was ever a Recusant, but Sir William Web, Grandchild to
my Uncle Sir William Web, sometimes Lord Mayor of London, and since which some
of his Children I reduced back again to the Church of England.

On this, one thing more I humbly desire may be thought on, That I am fallen
into a great deal of obloquie in matter of Religion, and that so far (as
appears by the Articles against me) that I have endeavored to advance and
bring in Popery: Perhaps my Lords, I am not ignorant what party of men have
raised these scandals upon me, nor for what end, nor perhaps by whom set on;
but howsoever, I would fain have a good reason given me, if my conscience stood
that way, and that with my conscience I could subscribe to the Church of Rome,
what should have kept me here before my imprisonment to endure the libelling,
and the slander, and the base usage that has been put upon me, and these to
end in this question for my life? I say, I would know a good reason for this.

First, my Lords, is it because of any pledges I have in the world to sway me
against my conscience? No sure, for I have neither Wife nor Children to cry out
upon me to stay with them; And if I had, I hope the calling of my conscience
should be heard above them.

Is it because I was loath to leave the honor and profit of the place I was
risen too? Surely no, for I desire your Lordships and all the world should
know, I do much scorn the one and the other, in comparison of my conscience.
Besides, it cannot be imagined by any man, but that if I should have gone over
to them, I should not have wanted both honor and profit; and suppose not so
great as this I have here, yet sure would my conscience have served my self of
either, less with my conscience would have prevailed with me, more than greater
against my conscience.

Is it, because I lived here at ease, and was loath to venture my loss of that?
not so neither; for whatsoever the world may be pleased to think of me, I have
led a very painful life, and such as I would have been content to change, had I
well known how; and would my conscience have served me that way, I am sure I
might have lived at far more ease, and either have avoided the barbarous
Libelling and other bitter grievous scorns which have been put upon me, or at
least been out of the hearing of them.

Not to trouble your Lordships too long, I am so innocent in the business in
Religion, so free from all practice, or so much as thought of practice for any
alteration unto Popery, or any blemishing the true Protestant Religion
established in England, as I was when my mother first bore me into the world;
And let nothing be spoken but truth, and I do here challenge whatsoever is
between Heaven or Hell, that can be said against me in point of my Religion, in
which I have ever hated dissimulation. And had I not hated it, perhaps I might
have been better for worldly safety then now I am: but it can no way become a
Christian Bishop to halt with God.

Lastly, if I had any purpose to blast the true Religion established in the
Church of England, and to introduce Popery, sure I took a wrong way to it; for,
my Lords, I have staid more going to Rome, and reduced more that were already
gone, then, I believe any Bishop or Divine in this Kingdom has done; and some
of them, men of great abilities, and some persons of great place; and is this
the way to introduce Popery? My Lords, if I had blemished the true Protestant
Religion, how could I have brought these men to it? And if I had promised to
introduce Popery, I would never have reduced these men from it.

And that it may appear unto Your Lordships how many, and of what condition the
persons are, which by Gods blessing upon my labors, I have settled in the true
Protestant Religion established in England: I shall briefly name some of them,
though I cannot do it in order of time, as I converted them.

Henry Berkinstead of Trinity College Oxon, seduced by a Jesuit and brought
to London. (The Lords and others conceiving him to be Berchinhead the Author of
all the Libellous Popish Oxford Aulieusses, against the Parliament, at the
naming of him smiled: which the Archbishop perceiving, said, My Lords, I mean
not Berchinhead the Author of Oxford Aulicus, but another.)

Two Daughters of Sir Richard Lechford, in Surrey, sent toward a NVNNERY.

Two Scholars of Saint John's College Cambridge, Toppin and Ashton; who got the
French Ambassadors pass, and after this I allowed means to Toppin, and then
procured him a fellowship in Saint John's: And he is at this present as hopeful
a young man, as any of his time, and a Divine.

Sir William Web, my kinsman, and two of his Daughters; And his Son I took
from him, and his Father being utterly decayed, I bred him at my own charge,
and he is a very good Protestant.

A Gentleman brought to me by Mr. Chesford, his Majesty's Servant, but I cannot
recall his name.

The Lord Mayo of Ireland, brought to me also by Mr. Chesford.

The Right Honorable the Lord Duke of Buckingham, almost quite gone between the
Lady his Mother, and Sister.

The Lady Marquess Hamilton, was settled by my direction, and she dyed very
religiously and a Protestant.

Mr. Digby, who was a Priest.

Mr. James, a Gentleman brought to me by a Minister in Buckingham-shire, as I
remember.

Dr. Heart the Civilian, my Neighbors Son at Fulham.

Mr. Christopher Seaburne, a Gentleman of an ancient Family in Hereford-shire.

The Right Honorable the Countess of Buckingham.

Sir William Spencer of Parnton.

Mr. Shillingworth.

The Sons and Heirs of Mr. Winchcombe, and Mr. Wollescott, whom I sent with
their friends liking to Wadham-Colledge Oxford, and received a Certificate Anno
1631. of their continuing in conformity to the Church of England. Nor did ever
any one of these I have named relapse again, but only the Countess of
Buckingham, and Sir William Spencer; it being only in Gods power, not mine, to
preserve them from relapse.

And now let any Clergyman of England come forth, and give a better account of
his zeal to the Church.


To the Accusation against him, about Imposing a Liturgy upon the Church of
Scotland, he gave in this true Narrative.
DOctor John Maxwell, the late Bishop of Rosse, came to me from his Majesty. It
was during the time of a great sickness, which I had Anno 1629. (which is
eleven years since.) The cause of his coming was to speak with me about a
Lyturgie for Scotland. At this time I was so extreme ill, that I saw him not.
And had death (which I then expected daily) seized on me, I had not seen this
heavy day.

After this, when I was able to sit up, he came to me again, and told me, It
was his Majesty's pleasure, that I should receive some instructions from some
Bishops of Scotland concerning a Lyturgrie, that he was employed about it; I
told him, I was clear of opinion, that if his Majesty would have a Lyturgie
settled there different from what they had already, it was best to take the
English Lyturgie without any variation, that so the same Service Book might
pass through all his Majesty's Dominions. To this he replied, that he was of a
contrary opinion, and that not he only, but the Bishops there, thought their
Countrymen would be much better satisfied, if a Lyturgie were made by their
own Bishops, but withal, that it might be according to the form of our English
Book. I added, if this were the resolution, I would do nothing till I might by
Gods blessing have health and opportunity to wait upon the King.

And here give me leave (I humbly beseech you) to tell your Lordships, that
this was no new conceit of his Majesty to have a Lyturgy framed, and Canons
made for the Church of Scotland: For he followed the example and care in the
business of his Royal Father King James of blessed memory, who took Order for
both at the Assembly held at Perth, Anno 1618. As appears in the Acts of that
General Assembly, and the Sermon which the late Reverend Arch Bishop of St.
Andrews, preached before it, page 40. and 68.

When I was able to go abroad, and came to his Majesty, I represented all that
passed. His Majesty avoided the sending of Dr. Maxwell to me, and the business,
but then agreed to my opinion, to have the English without alteration. And in
this case I held the business for two, if not three, years at least: Afterward
the Scottish Bishops still pressing his Majesty that a Lyturgie made by
themselves, and in some things different from the English Service, would relish
better with their Countrymen, they prevailed with his Majesty at last to have
it so, notwithstanding all I could say or do to the contrary.

Then his Majesty commanded me to give the Bishops of Scotland the best
assistance I could in this way and work. I delayed as much as I could with my
Obedience. When nothing would serve but it must go on, I did not only acquaint
his Majesty with it, but writ down most of the amendment or alterations in his
Majesty's presence. And do hope there is no one thing in that Book which may
not stand with the Conscience of a right good Protestant. Sure I am, his
Majesty approved them all, and I have his warrant under his Royal hand for all
that I did about that Book.

As for the way of introducing it, I ever advised the Bishops both in his
Majesty's presence, and at other times, that they would look carefully to it,
and be sure to do nothing in any kind but what should be agreeable to the Laws
of that kingdom. And that they should at all times as they saw cause, be sure
to take the advice of the Lords of his Majesty's Council in that Kingdom, and
govern themselves accordingly. Which course if they have not followed, that can
no way (as I conceive) reflect upon me. And I am able to prove by other
particulars as well as this, that for any thing concerning that Nation, I have
been as careful their Laws might be observed, as any man that is a stranger to
them might be.

To the grand Charge, his endeavor to reconcile the Church of England to the
Church of Rome (which certainly is a noble design) or a plot to introduce
Popery; he made this general defense Sept. 2. 1644.

My Lords,
I Am charged for endeavoring to introduce Popery, and reconcile the Church of
England to the Church of Rome: I shall recite the sum of the Evidence and
Arguments given in for to prove it.

First, I have in my first Speech, nominated diverse persons of Eminency, whom I
reduced from Popery to our Church, And if this be so, then the Argument against
me is this; I converted many from Popery, Ergo, I went about to bring in
Popery, and to reconcile the Church of England to the Church of Rome.

Secondly, I am charged to be the Author of the, and c. Oath in the New Canons,
parcel of which Oath is to abjure Popery, and that I will not subject the
Church of England to the Church of Rome (A more strict Oath then ever was made
against Popery in any Age or Church.) And then the agreement against me is
this; I made and took an Oath to abjure Popery, and not to subject the Church
of England to the Church of Rome; therefore I was inclinable to Popery, and
endeavored to subject the Church of England to the Church of Rome.

Thirdly, The third Canon (of the late New ones) was made by me, which is
against Popery; and then the Argument is; I made a Canon against Popery; Ergo,
I was inclinable to, and endeavored to introduce it.

Fourthly, I was twice seriously offered a Cardinalship, and I refused it;
because I would not be subject to the Pope and Church of Rome; Ergo, I was
addicted to Popery, and endeavored to reduce the Church of England into
subjection to the Church of Rome.

Fifthly, I writ a Book against Popery, in Answer to Fisher the Jesuit; and
then the Argument is this; I writ a Book against Popery; Ergo, I am inclinable
to Popery, and labored to introduce it.

Sixthly, It is alleged, I concealed and cherished the Plot of the Jesuits
discovered by Habernfield; and therefore I intended to bring in Popery, and
reduce the Church of England to the Church of Rome. I answer, either this Plot
was not real; and if so, then Romes Masterpiece is quite blown up, and
published in vain. Or else it was real, and then I was really in danger of my
life, for opposing Popery and this Plot. Then the Argument from it must be
this; I was in danger of my life, for cherishing the Jesuits Plot of reducing
the Church of England to the Church of Rome; Ergo, I cherished and endeavored
to effect this Plot.

Seventhly, I labored to make a reconciliation between the Lutherans and
Calvinists; Ergo, I labored to introduce Popery, and make a reconciliation
between the Church of England and the Church of Rome.

These were his general Defenses, besides his particular Answers to each
Article of his Charge (consisting of near nine hundred, and designed to make up
in number, what they wanted, that the good Prelate might sink under a
Cumulative Impeachment, as his good friend L. L. I. did under a Cumulative
Treason) so Accurate, so Pertinent, so Acute, so Full, so Clear, so Quick, and
so Satisfactory and well Accommodated ad homines, as argued he had great
abilities beyond expectation. A Clear Understanding above distractions, a
Magnanimous Spirit out of the reach of misfortunes, a Firm Memory, proof
against the infirmities of this age, and the injuries of the times, a Knowledge
grasping most things and their circumstances, and a Prudence able to put them
together to the most advantage; and in fine, a Soul high and serene above his
afflictions, and what was more, the sense of them, his passions too; like
Moses, he that was quick and zealous in Gods and the Kings cause, was most meek
and patient in his own; mastering himself first, and so (if there had been any
place for reason) overcoming even his adversaries: Had not they injured him so
much, that they thought themselves not safe unless they did injure him more;
and secure themselves from the guilt of their Libels, Tumults, Imprisonments,
and Impeachments, by the more dreadful one of his Death. (So men are robbed,
first of their Goods, and upon second thoughts, lest they should complain and
retaliate, of their Lives.) And indeed he could not expect there should be a
great distance, between his Prison and his Grave [A carceribus ad metam] the
consciousness of their guilt in burying him above ground in his Imprisonment,
could no ways be satisfied, but by Imprisoning him under ground by his Burial.

When they wanted nothing to complete their guilt but this death (concerning
which his Majesty in his Letter to the Queen expresses himself thus: Nothing
can be more evident, than that Straffords Innocent Blood has been one of the
great causes of Gods just Judgment upon this Nation by a Civil War, both sides
hitherto being almost equally punished, as being in a manner equally guilty;
but now this last crying blood being totally theirs, I believe its no
presumption hereafter to hope, that his hand of Justice must be heavier upon
them, and lighter upon us; looking now upon our Cause having passed by our
faults) they preached and talked that nothing interrupted their success but his
death, imputing all their disasters to his impunity, as the Heathens did all
theirs to those like him, The first good Christians. Then upon any public
misfortune it was Christiani ad Leones, and at this time, upon any misadventure

of some people, that thought his very solitude too great an enjoyment for him,

of misery to be made a Martyr) as if he had mounted rather to have beheld a
triumph, than to be made a sacrifice; and came not there to die, but to be
translated, and exchange his Miter for the Crown of Martyrdom.

The clearness of his Conscience being legible in the cheerfulness of his dying

of the setting Sun; there desiring to have room to die, and declaring that he
was more willing to go out of the world, than any man to send him; he first
took care to stop the chinks near the block, and remove the people he spied

should fall upon the heads of the people; in which desire it pleased God he was
so far gratified, that there remaining a small hole from a knot in the midst of
a board, the forefinger of his right hand at his death happened to stop that

coming thither to insult, went away to weep for him, who had this peculiar
happiness with his Master, that he gained that reverence by his Adversity, that
neither he nor any gained in Prosperity; he turned his Scaffold to a Pulpit,
and Preached his own Funeral, in these express words delivered by him to the
excellent Dr. Stern, to be communicated to his Fellow-Chaplains.

His Graces Speech, according to the Original, written with his own hand, and
delivered by him upon the Scaffold on Tower Hill, Ian. 10. 1644. To his
Chaplain Dr. Stern, now Lord Archbishop of York.
Good People,
THis is an uncomfortable time to preach, yet I shall begin with a Text of
Scripture, Heb. 12. 2. Let us run with patience that race which is set before
us: Looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith, who for the joy
that was set before him, endured the Cross, despising the shame, and is set
down at the right hand of the Throne of God.

I have been long in my Race, and how have I looked unto Jesus the Author and
Finisher of my faith, he best knows. I am now come to the end of my Race, and
here I find the Cross, a death of Shame. But the shame must be despised, or no
coming to the right hand of God. Jesus despised the shame for me, and God
forbid that I should not despise the shame for him.

I am going apace (as you see) toward the Red Sea, and my feet are upon the
brink of the very brink of it: An Argument I hope, that God is bringing me into
the Land of Promise, for that was the way through which he led his people.

But before they came to it, he instituted a Passover for them. A Lamb it was,
but it must be eaten with sower herbs, Exodus 12. 8. I shall obey, and labor to
digest the sower herbs, as well as the Lamb. And I shall remember it is the
Lords Passover. I shall not think of the herbs, nor be angry with the hand
that gathered them, but look up only to him who instituted that, and governs
these; for men can have no more power over me then what is given them from
above, St. John 19. 11.

I am not in love with this passage through the Red Sea, for I have the
weakness of flesh and blood plentifully in me. And I have prayed with my
Savior, Vt transiret calix iste, that this Cup of Red Wine might pass from me,
St. Luke 22. 42. But if not, Gods will, not mine be done. And I shall most
willingly drink of this Cup as deep as he pleases, and enter into this Sea,
yea, and pass through it in the way that he shall lead me.

But I would have it remembered (Good people) that when Gods Servants were in
this boisterous Sea, and Aaron among them, the Egyptians which persecuted them,
and did in a manner drive them into that Sea, were drowned in the same waters,
while they were in pursuit of them.

I know my God, whom I serve, is able to deliver me from this Sea of blood, as
he was to deliver the three Children from the furnace, Dan. 3. And (I most
humbly thank my Savior for it) my ^^^^lution is, as theirs was: They would not
worship the Image which the King had set up, nor will I forsake the Temple and
the ^^^uth of God, to follow the bleating of Ieroboams Calves in Da^, (...) in
Bethel.

And as for this people, they are at this day miserably misled: God of his
mercy open their eyes, A Prophetical (...) exactly fallen out to be (...).
that they may see the right way. For at this day the blind lead the blind,
and if they go on, both will certainly into the ditch, St. Luke 6. 39.

For my self, I am (and I acknowledge it in all humility) a most grievous
sinner many ways, by Thought, Word, and Deed: And yet I cannot doubt but that
God has mercy in store for me a poor penitent, as we^e as for other sinners. I
have now upon this sad occasion ransacked every corner of my heart, and yet I
thank God I have not found among the many, any one sin, which deserves death by
any known Law of this Kingdom.

And yet hereby I charge nothing upon my Judges. For if they proceed upon proof
by valuable witnesses, I or any other innocent may be justly condemned. And I
thank God, though the weight of this Sentence lie heavy upon me, I am as quiet
within as ever I was in my life.

And though I am not only the first Archbishop, but the first man that ever
died by an Ordinance in Parliament, yet some of my Predecessors have gone this
way, though not by this means. For Elphegus was hurried away and lost his head
by the Danes; Simon Sudbury in the fury of Wat Tyler and his followers. (...)
Before these St. John Baptist had his head danced off by a lewd Woman: And St.
Cyprian Archbishop of Car^hage, submitted his head to a persecuting sword. Many
Examples, Great and Good; and they teach me patience. For I hope my cause in
Heaven will look of another die, than the color that is put upon it here.

And some comfort it is to me, not only that I go the way of these great Men in
their several Generations; but also that my Charge, as foul as it is made,
looks like that of the Jews against St. Paul, Acts 25. 8. For he was accused
for the Law, and the Temple, i.e. Religion. And like that of St. Stephen, Acts
6. 14. for breaking the Ordinances which Moses gave, i.e. Law, and Religion,
the Holy Place, and the Law, ver. 13.

But you will say, do I then compare my self with the integrity of St. Paul,
and St. Stephen? No, far be it from me. I only raise a comfort to my self, that
these great Saints and Servants of God were laid at in their times, as I am
now. And it is Memorable, that St. Paul, who helped on this accusation against
St. Stephen, did after fall under the very same himself.

Yea, but here is a great clamor that I would have brought in Popery, I shall
answer that more fully by and by. In the mean time you know what the Pharisees
laid against Christ himself, John 11. 48. If we let him alone, all men will
believe on him: Et venient Romani, And the Romans will come, and take away both
our place, and the Nation. Here was a causeless cry against Christ, that the
Romans would come; and see how just the Judgment of God was. They crucified
Christ for fear lest the Romans should c^me^ And his death was it which brought
in the Romans upon them; God punishing them with that which they most feared.
And I pray God this clamor of Venient Romani, of which I have given no cause,
help not to bring them in. For the Pope never had such a Harvest in England
since the Reformation, as he has now upon the Sects and Divisions that are
amongst us. In the mean time, by Honor and Dishonor, by good Report, and evil
Report, as a deceived, and yet true, am I passing through this world, 2 Cor. 6.
8.

Some particulars also, I think it not amiss to speak of.

1. And First, This I shall be bold to speak of the King our gracious
Sovereign; he has been much traduced also for bringing in of Popery. But on my
Conscience, (of which I shall give God a present account) I know him to be as
free from this Charge as any man living: And I hold him to be as found a
Protestant according to the Religion by Law Established, (...) G^eces Ch^ratler
of K. Charles the Ma^yr.
as any man in his Kingdom; And that he will venture his life as far, and as
freely for it. And I think I do, or should know both his affection to Religion,
and his grounds for it, as fully as any man in England.

2. The second particular, is concerning this great and populous City (which
God bless.) Here has been of late a fashion taken up to gather hands, and then
go to the Great Court of the Kingdom, the Parliament, and clamor for Justice;
as if that great and wise Court, before whom the Causes come which are unknown
to the many, could not, or would not do justice but at their appointment; a way
which may endanger any innocent man, and pluck his blood upon their heads, and
perhaps upon the Cities also.

And this has been lately practiced against my self, the Magistrates standing
still and suffering them openly to proceed from parish to parish without check.
God forgive the setters of this, with all my heart I beg it: but many
well-meaning people are caught by it.

In St. Stephens Case, when nothing else would serve, they stirred up the
people against him, Act. 6. 12. And Herod went the same way: When he had killed
St. James, yet he would not venture upon St. Peter, till he found how the other
pleased the people, Acts 12. 3.

But take heed of having your hands full of blood, Isa. 1. 15. For there is a
time best known to himself, when God above other sins makes inquisition for
blood. And when that inquisition is on foot, the Psalmist tells us, Psalm. 9.
12. That God Remembers, but that is not all, he remembers, and forgets not the
Complaint of the poor, i.e. whose blood is shed by oppression, ver. 9.

Take heed of this: It Is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
God, Heb. 12. but then especially, when he is making inquisition for blood.

And with my prayers to avert it, I do humbly desire this City to remember the
Prophecy that is expressed, Ier. 26. 15.

3. The third particular is, the poor Church of England. It has flourished,
and been a shelter to other Neighbor Churches, when storms have driven upon
them. But alas, now it is in a storm it self, and God only knows whether, or
how it shall get out. And which is worse than a storm from without, it is
become like an Oak cleft to shivers with wedges made out of its own body. And
at every cleft profanneness and irreligion is entering in; While (as Prosper
speaks) men that introduce profaneness, Lib ^. De vitae contempt. cop. 4.
are cloaked over with the Name Religionis Imaginariae, of Imaginary Religion:
for we have lost the substance, and dwell too much in Opinion. And that Church
which all the Jesuits machinations could not ruin, is now fallen into danger
by her own.

4. The last particular, (for I am not willing to be too long) is my self, I
was born and baptized in the bosom of the Church of England Established by Law,
in that Profession I have ever since lived, and in that I come now to die.

What clamors and slanders I have endured for laboring to keep an Uniformity in
the external service of God, according to the Doctrine and Discipline of this
Church, all men know, and I have abundantly felt. Now at last I am accused of
High Treason in Parliament, a Crime which my soul ever abhorred. This Treason
was Charged to consist of two parts, an endeavor to subvert the Laws of the
Land: And a like endeavor to overthrow the true Protestant Religion Established
by Law.

Besides my answers to the several Charges, I protested mine innocence in both
Houses. It was said, Prisoners protestations at the Bar must not be taken. I
must therefore come now to it upon my death, being instantly to give God an
account for the truth of it.

I do therefore here in the presence of God and his holy Angels take it upon my
death, that I never endeavored the subversion either of Law or Religion, and I
desire you all to remember this protest of mine, for my innocence in this, and
from all Treasons whatsoever.

I have been accused likewise as an Enemy to Parliaments: No, I understand
them, and the benefit that comes by them too well to be so: But I dislike the
misgovernments of some Parliaments many ways, and I had good reason for it; for
Corruption optimi est pessima. And that being the highest Court, over which no
other has Jurisdiction, when it is misinformed, or misgoverned, the subject is
left without all Remedy.

But I have done, I forgive all the world, all and every of those bitter
Enemies which have persecuted me; And humbly desire to be forgiven of God
first, and then of every man. And so I heartily desire you to join in prayer
with me.

His Graces Prayer upon the Scaffold.
O Eternal God, and Merciful Father, look down upon me in Mercy, in the Riches
and Fullness of thy Mercies. Look upon me, but not till thou have nailed my Sins
to the Cross of Christ, but not till thou have bathed me in the Blood of
Christ, not till I have hid my self in the Wounds of Christ; that so the
punishment due unto my sins may pass over me. And since thou art pleased to try
me to the uttermost, I most humbly beseech thee, give me now in this great
instance, full patience, proportionable comfort, and a heart ready to die for
thine honor, the Kings happiness, and this Chuches preservation. And my zeal to
these (far from arrogance be it spoken) is all the sin (humane frailty
excepted, and all incidents thereto) which is yet known to me in this
particular, for which I come now to suffer: I say, in this particular of
Treason. But otherwise my sins are many and great; Lord pardon them all, and
those especially (what ever they are) which have drawn down this present
Judgment upon me. And when thou have given me strength to bear it, do with me
as seems best in thine own eyes, Amen.

And that there may be a stop of this issue of blood, in this more than
miserable Kingdom, O Lord, I beseech thee give grace of Repentance to all
blood-thirsty people. But if they will not repent, O Lord, confound their
designs, defeat and frustrate all their designs and endeavors, which are, or
shall be contrary to the glory of thy great Name, the truth and sincerity of
Religion, the establishment of the King and his Posterity after him, in their
just Rights and Privileges, the Honor and Conservation of Parliaments in their
just Power, the Preservation of this poor Church in her Truth, Peace, and
Patrimony, and the settlement of this distracted and distressed People under
their ancient Laws, and in their native Liberties. And when thou have done all
this in mere mercy for them, O Lord, fill their hearts with thankfulness, and
with religious dutiful obedience to thee, and thy Commandments all their days.
So, Amen Lord Jesu, Amen.

And receive my soul into thy bosom. Amen. Our Father which art in Heaven, etc.

The Lord Archbishop's Prayer, as he Kneeled by the Block.
LOrd, I am coming as fast as I can. I know I must pass through the shadow of
death, before I can come to see thee. But it is but Vmbra Mortis, a mere shadow
of death, a little darkness upon Nature; but thou by thy Merits and Passion
have broke through the jaws of death. So, Lord receive my soul, and have mercy
upon me, and bless this kingdom with plenty, and with brotherly love and
charity, that there may not be this effusion of Christian blood amongst them,
for Jesus Christ his sake, if it be thy will.

Many there was to see so able an Head struck off at one blow, as it was upon
these words of his spoken aloud, Lord receive my Soul.

And more crowded to see so good a man buried at his own Church of Barking in
London by the Common Prayer (which was Voted down at the same time that he was
Voted to dye) in hope both of that resurrection, which he has had already with
the Cause he dyed for; being removed in July 1663. from Barking in London to
Saint John's College in Oxford, with his friend and successor in that College,
the Deanery of the Chapel, Bishopric of London, and Archbishopric of
Canterbury, raised by him, where he was Interred with these Monuments.

The first by Dr. M. Lluelin, then Student of Christ-church. An Elegy on the
most Reverend Father in God William, Lord Archbishop of Canterbury. Attached
the 18. of December 1640. Beheaded the 10. of January 1644.
Most Reverend Martyr,
THou, since thy thick Afflictions first begun,
Make Dioclesian's days all Calm, and Sun;
And when thy Tragic Annals are compiled,
Old Persecution shall be Pity styled;
The Stake and Faggot shall be Temperate Names,
And Mercy wear the Character of Flames:
Men Knew not then Thrift in the Martyrs Breath,
Nor weaved their Lives into a four years Death.
Few ancient Tyrants do our Stories Tax,
That slew first by delays, then by the Axe:
But these ( Tiberius like) alone do cry,
It Is to be reconciled to let thee dye.
Observe we then a while into what Maze,
Compass, and Circle, they contrive delays;
What Turns and wild Perplexities they choose,
Ere they can Forge their Slander, and Accuse:
The Sun has now brought his warm Chariot back,
And Rode his Progress round the Zodiac;
When yet no Crime appears, when none can tell,
Where thy guilt sleeps, nor when 'twill break the Shell.
Why is his Shame deferred? what is in it that brings
Your Justice back, spoils Vengeance of her Wings?
Has Mercy seized you? will you Rage no more?
Are Winds grown tame? have Seas forgot to roar?
No, a Wild Fierceness has your Minds possessed,
Which Time and Sins must cherish and digest:
You durst not now let his clear Blood be spilt,
You were not yet grown up to such a Guilt;
You try if Age, if Seventy Years can Kill;
Then you have your ends, and you are Harmless still;
But when this failed, you do your Paths enlarge,
But would not yet whole Innocence discharge.
You Will not be Devil all, you fain would prove,
Good at fair distance, within some remove.
"Virtue has sweets, which are good Men's duegain,
"Which Vice would not deserve, yet would retain.
This was the Cause, why once it was your Care,
That Storms and Tempests in your Sins might share:
You did engage the Waves, and strongly stood
To make the Water guilty of his Blood.
Boats are dispatch^ in haste, and it is his Doom,
Not to his Charge, but to his Shipwreck come.
Fond men, your cruel Project cannot do,
Tempests and Storms must learn to Kill from you;
When this came short, He must walk Pilgrimage,
No Coach, nor Mule, that may sustain his Age,
Must trace the City (now a Desert rude)
And combat Savage Beasts, the Multitude.
But when Guardian Innocence can fling
Awe round about, and save him by that Ring.
When the just Cause can fright the Beasts away,
And make the Tiger tremble at her Prey.
When neither Waves dare seize him, nor the Rout,
The Storm with Reason, nor the Storm without:
Lost in these Streights when Plots have vanquished bin,
And Sin perplexed has no relief, but Sin.
Agent and Instruments now on you fall,
You must be Judges, People, Waves and all;
Yet 'cause the Rout have it performed by you,
And long to see done, what they dare not do.
You put the Crime to use, it swells your heap,
Your Sins, your Wealth, nor are you guilty cheap,
You Husband all; There Is no appearance lost,
Nor comes he once to the Bar, but at their cost.
A constant Rate well Taxt, and Levied right,
And a just Value set upon each Sight.
At last they find the days by their own Purse,
Less known from him, than what they do disburse:
But when it now strikes high for him to appear,
And Chapmen see the Bargain is grown dear;
They Muster Hands, and their hot Suits enlarge,
Not to pursue the Man, but save the Charge.
Then lest you loose their Custom (a just fear)
Selling your Sins, and others Blood too dear.
You grant their Suits, the Manner, and the Time,
And he must die for what no Law calls Crime.
The afflicted Martyrs, when their pains began,
Their Trajan had, or Dioclesian.
Their Tortures wear some Colors and proceed,
Though from no guilt, yet 'cause they disagreed.
What League, what Friendship there? They could not join,
And fix the Ark and Dagon in one Shrine.
Faith, combats Faith; And how agree can they,
That still go on, but still a several way?
Zeal, Martyrs Zeal, and Heat against Heat conspires,
As Theban Brothers fight, though in their Fires.
Yet as two different Stars unite their Beams,
And Rivers mingle Waves, and mix their Streams:
And though they challenge each a several Name,
Conspire, because their moisture is the same.
So parties Knit, though they be diverse Known,
The Men are many, but the Christian one.
Trajan, no Trajan was to his own Heard,
And Tigers are not by the Tigers feared.
What strange excess then? what is that menstruous power,
When Flames do Flames, and Streams do Streams devour.
Where the same Faith, against the same Faith does Knock,
And Sheep are Wolves to Sheep of the same Flock?
Where Protestant, the Protestant defies,
Where both Assent, yet one for Dissent dies?
Let these that doubt this, through his Actions wade,
When some must needs convince, all may persuade.
Was he Apostate, who your Champion stood,
Bathed in his Ink before, as now in Blood?
He that unwind' the Sable Jesuit,
That feels the Serpents teeth, and is not bit?
Unites the Snake, finds each mysterious Knot,
And turns the Poison into Antidote.
Does Nicety with Nicety undo?
And makes the Labyrinth the Labyrinth's Clew?
That slight by sleight subdues, and clearly proves,
Truth has her Serpents too, as well as Doves.
Now, you that blast his Innocence, survey,
And view the Triumph of this glorious day;
Could you (if that might be) if you should come
To Seal God's Cause with your own Martyrdom,
(Could all the blood whose Tides move in their veins,
Which then perhaps were Blood, but now in stains)
(Yield it that force and strength, which it has took
Should we except his Blood) from this his Book,
Your Flame or Axe would less evince to Men,
Your Block and Stake would prop, less than his Pen.
Is he Apostate whom the Baits of Rome
Cannot seduce, though all her glories come?
Whom all her specious Honors cannot hold?
Who hates the Snare, although the Hook be Gold?
Who prostituted Titles can despise,
And from despised Titles greater rise?
Whom Names cannot Amuse, but seats withal
The Protestant above the Cardinal?
Who sure to his own Soul, does scorn to find
A Crimson Cap the purchase of his mind?
"Who is not great may blame his Fates offense,
"Who would not be, is great in's Conscience.
Next these, his sweat and care how to advance
The Church but to her just Inheritance,
How to gain back her own, yet none beguile,
And make her Wealth her purchase, nor her spoil:
Then, shape God's Worship to a joint Consent,
'Till when, the Seamless Coat must still be Rent:
Then, to repair the shrines, as Breaches sprung,
Which we should hear, could we lend Paul's a Tongue.
Speak, speak! Great Monument! while thou yet art such,
And Rear him 'bove their scandals and their touch;
Had he survived, thou might in Time delare,
Vaste things may Comely be, and Greatest Fair.
And though thy Limbs spread high and Bulk exceed,
Thoud'st proved that Giants are no monstrous Breed:
Then 'bove extent thy luster would prevail,
And against dimension Feature turn the scale;
^ut now, like Pyrrah's half adopted Birth,
Where the issue part was Woman, part was Earth,
When female some, and some to Stone was bent,
And the one h^lf was to others Monument,
Thou must imperfect lie, and learn to Groan,
Now for his Ruin, straightway for thine own:
But this and Thousand such Abortives are,
By Bloody Rebels Ravished from his Care;
But yet though some miscarryed in the Womb,
And Deed's still-born have hastened to their Tomb,
God (that Rewards him now) forbad his store,
Should all lie hid, and he but give in the ore.
Many are stamp't and shaped, and do still shine,
Approved at Mint, a Firm, and perfect Coin.
Witness that Mart of Books that yonder stands,
Bestowed by him, though by another Hands:
Those Attick Manuscripts, so rare a Piece,
They tell the Turk, he has not conquered Greece.
Next these, a second beauteous heap is thrown,
Of Eastern Authors, which were all his own;
Who in so various Languages appear,
Babel, could scarce be their Interpreter.
To these we may that fair-built College bring,
Which proves that Learnings no such Rustic thing;
Whose Structure well contrived does not relate
To Antic Fineness, but strong lasting state:
Beauty well mixed with Strength, that it Complies
Most with the Gazer's use, much with his Eyes,
On Marble Columns thus the Arts have stood,
As wise Seth's Pillar's saved 'em in the Flood.
But did he leave here Walls, and only own
A Glorious Heap, and make us Rich in Stone?
Then had our Chanc'lor seemed to fail, and here
Much honor due to the Artificer:
But this our prudent Patron long foresaw,
When he refined Rude Statutes into Law;
Our Arts and Manners to his Building falls,
And he Erects the Men, as well as Walls:
"Thus Solons Laws his Athens did Renown,
"And turned that throng of Buildings to a Town.
Yet neither Law, nor Statute, can be known
So strict, as to himself, he made his own,
Which in his Actions Inventory lies,
Which Hell or Prinne can never scandalize:
Where every Act his Rigid Eye surveys,
And Night is Bar and Judge to all his days;
Where all his secret thoughts he does comprize,
And every Dream is summoned to an Assize;
Where he Arraigns each Circumstance of care,
Which never parts, dismis'd without a Prayer,
See! how he sifts and searches every part,
And ransacks all the Glosets of his heart;
He puts the hours upon the Rack and Wheel,
And all his minutes must confess, or feel:
If they reveal one Act which forth did come
When humane frailty crept into the Loome,
If one thread stain, or sully, break, or faint,
So that the man does interrupt the Saint,
He hunts it to its death, nor quits his fears,
Till't be imbalm'd in Prayers, or drowned in Tears.
The Sun in all his journey never did see
One more devote, or one more strict then He.
Since his Religion then is unmixt and Fine,
And Works do warrant Faith, as Ore the Mine:
What can his Crime be now? Now you must lay
The Kingdom Laws subverted in his way:
See! No such Crime does over his Conscience grow,
(Without which Witness never can make it so)
A clear Transparent White, bedecks his mind,
Where naught but innocence can shelter find,
Witness that Breath which did your stain and blot
Wipe freely out, (though Heaven I fear will not)
VVitness that calm and quiet in his Breast,
Prologue, and Preface, to his place of Rest;
When with the World he could undaunted part,
And see in Death, nor Meagre looks, nor dart.
When to the fatal Block his gray Age goes
With the same ease, as when he took Repose.
"He like old Enoch to his Bliss is gone,
"'It Is not his Death, but his Translation.
The second by Mr. John Cleveland. On the Right Reverend Father in God, Will.
Laud, Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.
I Need no Muse to give my Passion vent,
He brews his Tears that studies to Lament.
Verse chymically weeps; that pious rain
Distilled with Art, is but the sweat of the brain.
Who ever sob'd in Numbers? Can a groan
Be quaver'd out by soft Division?
It Is true, for Common formal Elegies,
Not Bushels Wells can match a Poets Eyes:
In wanton VVater-works he will tune his Tears
From a G^neva Jig up to the Spheres:
But when he mourns at distance, weeps aloof,
Now that the Conduit-head is his own Roof,
Now that the fate is Public, we may call
It Britains Vespers; Englands Funeral.
Who has a Pencil to express the Saint,
But he has Eyes too, washing off the Paint.
There is no Learning, but what Tears surround,
Like to Seth's Pillars in the Deluge drowned.
There is no Church, Religion is grown
From much of late, that She Is increased to none:
Like an Hydropick body full of Rheumes,
First swells into a body, then consumes.
The Law is dead, or cast into a Trance,
And by a Law-dough-bak't, an Ordinance.
The Lyturgy, whose doom was Voted next,
Died as a Comment upon him the Text.
There Is nothing lives: Life is, since he is gone,
But a Nocturnal Lucubration.
Thus have you seen Deaths Inventory read;
In the Sum Total -- Canterbury's dead.
A sight would make a Pagan to Baptize
Himself a Convert in his bleeding Eyes
Would thaw the Rabble, that fierce Beast of ours
(That which Hyena-like weeps and devours)
Tears that flow brackish from their Souls within,
Not to repent, but pickle up their Sin.
Mean time no squalid grief his look defiles,
He guilds his sadder fate with Noble smiles:
Thus the Worlds eye with reconciled streams
Shines in his showers as if he wept his beams.
How could success such Villainies applaud?
The State in S^rafford fell, the Church in Laud;
The Twins of public rage adjudg'd to die,
For Treasons they should Act by Prophecy.
The Facts were done, before the Laws were made,
The Trump turned up after the Game was played;
Be dull great Spirits, and forbear to climb,
For Worth is Sin, and Eminence a Crime.
No Churchman can be innocent and high,
It Is height makes Grantham Steeple stand awry.

A CHARACTER OF ARCHBISHOP LAUD.
THE Pregnancy of his Childhood, promised the Wisdom of his Riper Years, and
obliged his Friends beyond their Abilities to his Support; and Strangers beyond
Expectation to his Encouragement: Some Persons offering him great sums of money
for his maintenance in his younger years, upon the bare security of his arts,
which paid them well in his more reduced age. None more observant of Favor,
none more mindful of Kindnesses, and none more grateful for Civilities: He was
so wise, as seldom to forget an Injury in the consequence of it; and so Noble,
as ever to remember Love in the return of it. His honest Parents conveyed him
an excellent temper, and that temper a brave spirit, which had the advantage of
his birth, a place at an equal distance from the University, where he was to be
a Scholar; and the Court, where he was to be a Man: In the first of these, his
Indefatigable Industry, his Methodical Study, his Quick Apprehension, his
Faithful Memory, his Solid Judgment, his Active Fancy, his Grave and Quick
Countenance, his Sharp and Piercing Eye^ raised by Discreet and Wary Steps to
all the Preferments, and commended him to all Employments of the University.
When Proctor, whereof he was admitted for his prudence, Having so when King
James come in, an opportunity, to show himself.
May, 4. 1603. to the Earl of Devonshire's Service, September 3. 1603. which
hazarded; and when He Read the Lecture Founded by Mr. May.
Divinity Reader, 1602. observed by the Lords of Roch^st^r and Lincoln for his
judgment, which advanced him, as his design was, above the level of Modern
Sciolists: So were his Studies not prepossessed with the partial Systems of
Geneva, but freely conversant with the impartial Volumes of the Church
Catholic. He had an infallible apprehension of the Doctrine and Discipline,
and a deep insight into the interest of Christianity. This Capacious Soul
conversed with the most knowing of all Judgments, to find the bottom of all
Errors; and with the most judicious of his own, to discern the grounds of all
truth. He had his Eye to the University to reduce it, when Head of Saint John's,
on the lower functions of the Church in his Pastoral charges, to reform them;
and upon the higher, when Dean of Glou^est^r, Prebend of W^s^minster, and
Bishop of St. David, to settle them. He was a man of that search and judgment,
that he found out the principles of Government that were true to the Church; of
that faithfulness and resolution, that amidst all discouragements he was true
to them The Church Government, he found by many private-spirited-men
accommodated to their ease and interest, he adjusted to truth and settlement;
consulting not humors, which are uncertain as Interest; but truth, which is
certain as Eternity.

Archbishop Abbots yield, and they will be pleased at last, was a great
miscarriage; Archbishop Lauds Resolve, for there is no end of yielding, was
great policy. His great reach in Government, suitable to that Kings
apprehensions, commended him to King James; his vast ability and integrity to
King Charles, and the Duke of Buckingham; to the first whereof he was
Privy-Councellor, to the other a bosom friend; before both whom he laid the
best representation and Ideas of the English Government, as to things and
persons in several abstracts, of any man under heaven. I have heard a
Statesman say, That none knew Ioints, Turnings, Flexures, Interests of all
Parties in Church or State, that were either to be encouraged or suppressed,
with the seasons and opportunities to do it, so well as Doctor Laud.

Discerning was his Foresight, complete his Intelligence, exact his
Correspondence, quick his Dispatches, seasonable and effectual his Sermons and
Discourses, inquisitive and observing his Converse. His Instruments were able
and knowing men, that were faithful to the Church, as he was in Manwaring and
Mountague's Case to them; Knowing well (as he wrote to my Lord of Buckingham
that discouragement would deter men of parts, whom encouragement might make
serviceable. He knew no man better how to temper a Parliament, having a
Catalogue of all the Nobility and Gentry, with their interest and inclination,
in his eye: He understood none more exactly what was to be discoursed and
proposed to them, having a clear apprehension of the several junctures and
tendencies of affairs. He entertained no thought but what was public in his
breast, no man but was nobly spirited in his familiarity: Ever watchful he was
of all opportunities to advance the Churches honor.

1. In her Sons, as Bishop Iuxon, etc. 2. Her Discipline, as in his several
Visitations, Articles in Star Chamber, and High Commission matters. 3. In her
Indowments, as the buying of Impropriations in Ireland. 4. In her Privilege,
as the Canon of England. 5. In her Ornaments, as the repairing of St. Paul's,
and most other Churches in his Province. 6. In her Universities, as the
Statutes of Oxford, the Privileges of Cambridge, and his vast gifts of
Oriental Books and Buildings, and his vaster design for both; and as watchful
against all the designs to undermine it.
The Feoffees for Impropriations he laid aside, the Sabbatizing and
Predestinarian Controversies he silenced, the Licentious Press he reduced,
Dignities and Preferments he worthily filled up, Bribes at Court he retrenched,
no Interest, no Alliance could ever advance an unworthy Person while he lived:
Breed up your Children well, and I will provide for them, was his saying to all
his Relations.

Many a man would be disobliged by his sternness at first view, for whom, if
deserving, he would afterward contrive kindnesses by after and unexpected
favors. No place of experience did he ever miss, none of employment did he
ever decline: He would never see Authority bafled, but ever wave all
proceedings against all offenders, or go through with them; his Prosecutions,
as in Leightons Case were close; his Observation of all circumstances, as in
Loncolns Wary; his Declaration of the Cases clear and convincing, as in Pryns,
Bastwick, and Burtons; his Sentence mild and compassionate, as in Wallers; his
Resolution and Justice ever making way to his mercy, and his mercy crowning his
Justice: Often did he conferr with the ablest and most Orthodox Clergy, with
the most experienced and most observing and reserved Courtiers, with the
profoundest Lawyers, with the skillfullest and discreetest Mechanics; out of
all whose opinions, the result was his most exact Judgment in any Case that
came before him at Court, or at Lambeth.

The roughness of his nature sent most men discontented from him; but so, that
he would often of himself find ways and means to sweeten such as had any worth
again, when they looked for it. Many were offended at his prudent zeal against
the Jewish Sabbatism in his government, who were very well satisfied with the
strictness of his observation of the Lord's Day in his person. But let one great
man express another, Bishop Gauden, Archbishop Laud, whose thoughts lie so
much the more levelled to his brave Sentiments, as his dignity did to his high
place.

As to his secret design of working up his Church by little and little to a
Romish conformity and captivity, I do not believe (says he) he had any such
purpose or approved thought; because, beside his declared judgment and
conscience, I find no secular policy or interest which he could thereby gain,
either private or public, but rather lose much of the greatness and freedom,
which he and other Bishops with the whole Church had; without which temptation,
no man in charity may be suspected to act contrary to so clear convictions, so
deliberate and declared determination of his conscience and judgment in
Religion, as the Archbishop expresses in his very excellent Book. I am indeed
prone to think, that possibly he wished there could have been any fair close or
accommodation between all Christian Churches (the same which many grave and
learned men have much desired.) And it may be his Lordship thought himself no
unfit instrument to make way to so great and good a work, considering the
eminencies of parts, power, and favor which he had. Happily he judged (as many
learned and moderate men have) that in some things between Papist and
Protestant, differences are made wider, and kept more open, raw, and sore then
need be, by the private Pens and Passions of some Men, and the Interests of
some little Parties, whose partial Polities really neglect the Public and true
Interest of the Catholic Church, and Christian Religion; which consists much
in Peace, as well as in Purity; in Charity, as in Verity. He found that where
Papists were Silenced and Convinced in the more grand and pregnant Disputes
(that they are Novel, Partial, and Unconform to Catholic Churches in ancient
times) then he found they recovered spirits, and contested afresh against the
unreasonable Transports, Violences and Immoderations of some professing to be
Protestants; who to avoid Idolatry and Superstition, run to Sacrilege and
Rudeness in Religion, denying many things that are Just, Honest, Safe, True and
Reasonable, merely out of an ((...)) excessive Antipathy to Papists. Possibly
the Archbishop, and some other Bishops of his mind did rightly judge, that the
giving an Enemy fair play, by Just, Safe, and Honorable Concessions; was not
to yield the conquest to him, but the most ready way to convince him of his
wickedness; when no honest yieldings could help him any more, than they did
endanger the true cause or courage of his Antagonist.

For my part, I think the Archbishop of Canterbury was neither ^^^vinist, nor
Lutheran, nor Papist, as to any side or party; but all^ as far as he saw, they
agreed with the Reformed Church of (...), either in Fundamentals, or innocent
and decent Super^^^uctures: Yet, I believe, he was so far a Protestant, and of
the ^e^ormed Religion, as he saw the Church of England did Protest (...) the
Errors, Corruptions, Usurpations, and Superstitions of (...) Church of Rome; or
against the novel Opinions and Practices of any Party whatsoever. And
certainly, he did with as much honor as justice, so far own the Authentic
Authority, Liberty, and Majesty of the Church of England (in its reforming and
settling of its Religion) that he did not think fit any private new Masters
whatsoever, should obtrude any Foreign or Domestic Dictates to her, or force
her to take her Copy of Religion from so petty a place as Geneva was, or Frank
fort, or Amsterdam, or Wittenbergh, or ^denborough; no, nor from Augsburgh or
Arnheim, nor any foreign City or Town, any more than from Trent or Rome; none
of which had any Dictatorian Authority over this great and famous Nation or
Church of England, further than they offered sober Counsels, or suggested good
Reasons, or cleared true Religion by Scripture, and confirmed it by good
Antiquity, as the best Interpreter and Decider of obscure Places and dubious
Cases.

Which high value, its probable, as to his Mother the Church of England, and
Constitution, was so potent in the Archbishop of Canterbury, that as he thought
it not fit to subject her to the insolency of the Church of Rome; so nor to the
impertinencies of any other Church or Doctor of far less repute in the
Christian world; no doubt his Lordship thought it not handsome in Mr. Calvin, to
be ((...) rather then (...)) so censorious of the Church of England, to brand
its Devotion or Liturgy with his tolerabiles ineptiae, who knew not the temper
of the Nation, requiring then not what was absolutely best, but most
conveniently good; and such not only the Liturgy was, but those things which he
calls Tolerable Toys. I having occasion to speak with him, he upon a time was
pleased to grant me access, and some freedom of speech with him; and withal,
asked me the opinion of the people of him: I told him, they reported his
Lordship endeavored to betray the Church of England to the Roman
Correspondency and Communion, he at length very calmly and gravely thus
Replied, protesting with a serious attestation of his integrity before Gods
Omniscience, that however he might mistake in the mean Method, yet he never had
other design than the Glory of God, the Service of his Majesty, the good Order,
Peace, and Decency of the Church of England; that he was so far from complying
with Papists, in order to confirm them in their errors, that he rather chose
such Methods to advance the honor of the Reformed Religion in England, as he
believed might soon silence the Cavils of fiercer Papists, induce the more
moderate Recusants to come in to us, as having less visible occasion given them
by needless Distances and Disputes to separate from us; which he thought arose
much from that popular variety, Inconstancy, Easiness, Irreverence, and
uncomeliness, which might easily grow among us in the outward profession of
Religion, for want of observing such uniformity and decency in Religion, as
were required by the Laws and Cannons of this Church and State. He added, that
he had (further) a desire, as much as he could, to relieve the poor and
depressed condition of many Ministers; which he had to his grief observed in
Wales and England, where their discouragements were very great, by reason of
the Tenuity and Incompetency of their Livings: That in his Visitations, he had
sometime seen it with grief, among twenty Ministers, not one had so much as a
decent Garment to put on, nor did he belive their other Treatment of Life was
better; that he found the sordid and shameful Aspect of Religion and the
Clergy, gave great advantages to those that were Popishly inclined; who would
hardly ever think it best for them to join with that Church, which did not
maintain either its own honor or the Clergy, to some competency and comeliness.

Much more discourses his Lordship was pleased to use at several times to this
purpose, which commands my charity to clear him, as far as I can judge, of any
tincture of Popery truly so called, or of any Superstition, which places a
Religion in the nature and use of that thing which God has not either
particularly commanded, or in general permitted. I suppose he thought, that
where God has allowed to his Church, and to every private Christian (so far as
may consist with the Churches order and peace) a liberty of Ceremonious, and
circumstantial Decency as to Gods Worship; there neither he was to be blamed,
nor did he blame other men, if they kept within those discreet and inoffensive
bounds, which either the Churches public peace required, or its indulgence to
promote Christians permitted.

That uniformity he pressed was not more advantageous to Religion, which must
of necessity have been propagated, when Controversies had been turned to
Devotion, then it was necessary for the State; which cannot be secure as long
as there is a mark of distinction, under which all malcontents may shrewd
themselves; a note of Separation, whereby the Factions may reckon their
parties, and estimate their strength, and a way open to popularity, to the
ambition of any whose interest or desperateness shall adventure to make himself
head of so great a party.

He was a person of so great abilities (which are the designations of nature to
dignity and command) that they raised him from low beginnings to the highest
office the Protestant profession acknowledges in the Church, and he was equal
to it: His learning appeared eminent in his book against Fisher, and his piety
illustrious in his Diary. He was of so public a spirit, that both the Church
and States have lasting Monuments of the virtuous use he made of his Princes
favor. At his admittance into which, he dedicated all the future emoluments of
it to the glory of God, and the good of men, by a projection of many noble
works, most of which he accomplished, and had finished the rest, had not the
fate of the Nation checked the current of his design, and cut off the course of
his life. He was not contented by himself only to serve his generation (for so
he might appear more greedy of fame, than desirous of the universal benefit)
but he endeavored to render all others as Heroic, if they aimed at a capacity
for his friendship; for (I have heard it from his enemies) no great man was
admitted to a confidence and respect with him, unless he made address by some
act that was for the common good, or for the ornament and glory of the
Protestant Faith. Learned men had not a better friend, nor Learning it self a
greater advancer; he searched all the Liberaries of Asia, and from several
parts of the world purchased all the ornaments and helps of literature he
could, that the English Church might have (if possible) by his care, as many
advantages for knowledge, as almost all Europe did contribute to the Grandeus
of that Rome. The outward splendour of the Clergy was not more his care, than
their honor, by a grave and pious Conversation. He would put them into a power
of doing more good, but was sore against their vices and vanities; he scorned a
private Treasure, and his friends were rather relieved, than raised to any
greatness by him in his election of friends; he was determined to the good and
wise, and such as had both parts and desires to profit.

The Church had his closest embraces, if otherwise it happened, their fraud,
not his choice, deserved the blame. Both Papists and Sectaries were equally his
enemies, one party feared, and the other hated his virtues. Some censured his
zeal for Discipline above the patience of the Times: but his greatest
unhappiness was, that he lived in a Factious Age, and corrupt State, and under
such a Prince, whose virtues not admitting an in mediate approach for
Accusations, was to be wounded by those it caressed. But when Faction and
Malice are worn out by time, Posterity shall ingrave him in the Albe of the
most excellent Prelacy, the most indulgent Fathers of the Church, and the most
injured Martyrs. His blood was accompanied with some tears that fell from those
Eyes that expected a pleasure at his Death: and it had been followed with a
general Mourning, had not the public Miseries, and the present Fears of Ruin
exacted all the stock of grief for other Objects. His very Enemy Sir Edward
Deering would confess, that let him die when he would, St. Paul would be his
Monument, and his Book against Fisher his Epitaph.

THE Life and Death OF Dr. ROGER MANWARING, Lord Bishop of St. David's.
THE Daughter of the Duke of Exeter having nothing to do, invented the Rack in
the Tower, (therefore called the Duke of Exeters Daughter to this day) and this
Bishop used to say, that he was troubled with people, who if they were not
employed about him, were so idle, that they would have been a trouble to
themselves. In purchases we value Houses at nothing, because they turn to
little Profit, and are kept up with a very great Charge; This Bishop valued his
Kindred and Extraction, though as Noble as any in Cheshire, not much, because
the bare honor of them contributed little toward the maintenance of them; in
which respect he observed Feb. the third the first day he went to School, as
strictly as Nov. 9. the first day he came into the world, owing to the first
only his Being, to the other his being a Man. He was much for Mothers Nursing
their own Children, alleging (from Caligula in Dio Cassius, who was of his
Nurses disposition, and not of his Parents, when he was as mischievous as
brutishness armed with power could make him) that as the Nurse was who had the
forming of his first Idea's, and the moulding of his first constitution, so the
Child proved; and more against Fathers keeping their Children at home under
their own tuition, because private Education hardly raises Youths to that
vigor, freedom, and generosity of spirit, that a more public does; where the
Conversation goes as far as the Instruction, and the example of
School-fellows, beyond the Precepts of Schools-masters, the one showing what
they ought to do, the other what they may. He professed he owed his Elocution
and Pronunciation to one of his Fellow-Pupils gallant delivery of the Speeches
of Aj^x and Ulysses in Ovid, 13. (...)
for Poetry; and Cicero's Oration against Anthony for Prose: His Memory to
another artificial way of commanding Homers Iliads by heart; the success of his
Study to the common place and method of a third; his invention to the growing
fancy of a fourth, that lay before him, as the Ring-streaked Rods did before
Jacobs Sheep, or the Ethiopian before the Teeming-woman. Richard Norshall
says, Bale (de Scriptor. Brit. c. 7. n. 6.) left behind a Set of Sermons for
every day he was a Bishop, and R. Manwaring had a set of Exercises for every
day, he was a Scholar; doing nothing himself, and hearing nothing from others
of remark, but what he writ down, (being as Dr. Harris said of Dr. Preston, a
needless Ingrosser of other men's Notions) for he said he had a good Memory if
he did not trust it; and when he lost a notion, the careless man (he said) made
the thief.

An habit of exactness in his smaller performances, rendered him exact in those
more considerable, he being careful of two things, the settling of his voice,
and his mind.

The modern Jews have among others a form of Prayer, wherein they bless God as
well as for their vents of Ejection, as mouths for their admission of
nourishment. Mr. Manwaring, though very studious to acquire Learing, was more
curious to express it; knowing that small abilities well set off, out-go
greater that want that advantage. The composing of four witty Verses,
recommended him to that Eminent School whereof he was Scholar; the pronouncing
of an ingenious and vigorous Oration gained him that noble Lord, who thought it
an honor (sit to be remembered in an eminent part of the Parsonage-House he gave
him) to be his atron. His Critical skill in Greek and rational Head, preferred
him Fellow of the College; and his discreet carriage, and observing head,
Chaplain to his Lord; in all which capacities his performances were not gaudy,
but proper, becoming, and always equal usually, especially in Divinity,
managing his Exercises with a pleasing kind of Magisterium Theologicum, to use
the old phrase of Matthew Paris. Being so full that it was not with him as it
was with some men; the Platonic year of whose dicourses being not above three
days long, in which term all the same matter returns again. He might be called
Good-luck, as his Namesake R. Twiford was, because however unhappy in himself,
yet he brought good success to others, as two Worshipful Families can testify
whithersoever he went, which made several Places and Persons ambitious at the
same time of his presence and service, good employments suing for him as
earnestly as others had done for good employments; though Locusts are generally
devourers of all food, yet some Locusts, as those of St. John, are wholesome,
though course food themselves; most troubles are losses, yet this Gentleman's
very losses were gains, in that, as he said, they made him better acquainted
with himself, and better known to others.

Three things he was much resolved on, the Redemption of Captives, the
Converting of Recusants, and the undeceiving of the seduced Sectaries; and
three Dyaries he kept, one for the Transactions of his own Life, another for
the public Affairs of the Church and Kingdom, and a third for the most
remarkable passages of Providence that happened in the world. Many rich persons
he effectually exhorted to good Works, much Alms, he industriously Collected;
his charitable Collections he carefully preserved, and discr^etly disposed of,
not only for the relief of want; but as he said, of the Primitive Oblations, to
encourage virtue, keeping a Discipline, as he would say, all charitable people
should over the Poor, who especially, if beggars, by reason of their wandering
life are under none. ( as mo^^ is no predicament but may be reduced to any) He
profited much by his Books, more by his Company, which at the same time
improved his parts and credited them; good acquaintance at once instruct, and
by their various Interests, set off one another. Two of whom died the very same
day, and near as could be guessed (certainly their Stars were as intimate as
they, and there was the like correspondence in their Genitures, that was in
their Affections) the same hour.

The first Canon of our Church injoyning every Minister to Preach four times a
year at least, for the asserting of the Kings Authority and Supremacy. Dr.
Manwaring observing the diminution of both Sermons, the one at Court, before a
Royal Auditory; the other at his own Parish at St. Giles in the Fields, before
a noble one. In both which places he was looked upon as an Eminent Preacher, as
became the Kings subject and Chaplain, maintained at that time when the Kings
necessity put him upon the Loan, and his Authority commanded it much against
the grain of the people, as they were at that time humored. That the Kings
Royal Command in Imposing of Loans and Taxes, though without common consent in
Parliament, does oblige the subjects Conscience upon pain of Eternal damnation;
and that the Authority of Parliament is not necessary, for the raising of Aids
and Subsidies. A Position for which he was Charged 1627. by Mr. Rous in
Parliament, aggravated by Mr. Pym into five Branches.

1. His endeavor to infuse into His Majesty's Conscience a persuasion of a
Power not limited with Laws, which he said King James in a Parliament Speech
1619. called Tyranny, accompanied with Perjury. 2. His endeavor to persuade the
Consciences of the subjects, that they are bound to obey Illegal Commands; yea,
he damns them for not obeying them. 3. He robs the subject of the property of
their Goods. 4. He brands them that will not loose this property, with most
scandalous and odious Titles, to make them hateful both to Prince and People.
5. He indeavoureth to blow up Parliaments, and Parlimentary Power; which five
were drawn up into one great one (to use Mr. Pyms words, Serpens qui serpentem
devorat, fit Draco,) viz. A mischievous Plot to alter and subvert the Frame and
Government of the State and Commonwealth; and June the thirteen 1628. censured
thus.
1. To be imprisoned during the pleasure of the House. 2. To be fined a
thousand pounds. 3. To make his submission at the Bar in this House, (the House
of Lords) and the House of Commons at the Bar there, in verbis conceptis, by a
Committee of this House. 4. To be suspended from his Ministerial Function three
years, and in the mean time a sufficient Preaching man to be provided out of
the Profits of his Living, and this to be left to be performed by the
Ecclesiastical Court. 5. To be disabled for ever after from Preaching at Court.
6. To be for ever disabled of having any Ecclesiastical Dignity in the Church
of England. 7. To be incapable of any secular Office or Preferment. 8. That his
books are worthy to be burned, and his Majesty to be moved, that it may be so
in London, and both the Universities.
According to the third Branch of this Censure, he was brought to the Bar June
twenty three, and enjoined this Submission on his knees.

I do here in all sorrow of heart, and true repentance acknowledge those many
errors, and indiscretions which I have committed in preaching and publishing
the two Sermons of mine, which I called Religion and Allegiance, and my great^
fault in falling upon this Theme again, and handling the same rashly,
scandalously, and unadvised in my own Parish Church in St. Giles in the Fields
the fourth of May last past. I humbly acknowledge these three Sermons to have
been full of dangerous Passages, Inferences, and scandalous Aspersions in most
part of the same. And I do humbly acknowledge the just proceedings of this
honorable House against me, and the just Sentence and Judgment passed upon me
for my great offense. And I do from the bottom of my heart crave pardon of God,
the King, this Honorable House, and the Commonweal in general, and those
worthy Persons adjudged to be reflected upon by me in particular, for those
great offenses and errors. And according to the first he was imprisoned in the
Tower, until that Parliament was dissolved, and then in recompense of his
Sufferings and Services, he was preferred. 1. To the Rich Parsonage of
St^mon-Rivers in Essex, then void by Bishop Mountague his Fellow Sufferers
Preferment July 16. with a Dispensation to hold it with the Vicarage of St.
Giles. 2. To the Deanery of Worcester, May. 1633. And 3. To the Bishopric of
St. David's, Dec. 1635. with a pardon drawn Ian. 1628. according to His
Majesty's Pardon of Grace to his Subjects at his Coronation, with some
particulars for the pardoning of all errors committed either in speaking,
writing, or printing, whereby he might be hereafter questioned.

How afterward he was apprehended 1640. suddenly, confined severely, fined
heavily, plundered violently, and persecuted from place to place continually;
that for the two last years of his Life, not a week passed over his head
without either a Message or an Injury, he desired God not to remember against
his Adversaries, and adjured all his Friends to forget.

Only the faults alleged against him must not be forgot; for (besides the
aforesaid Sermons first warranted by a Bishop for the Press, as containing only
the same points delivered with offense from the Pulpit, which Sergeant Heal
delivered with applause in a 43 Eliz.
Parliament (who said That he marvelled the House stood so much either at the
granting of a Subsidy, or time of payment, when all we have is her Majesty's,
and she may lawfully at her pleasure take it from us; and that she had as much
right to all our Lands and Goods, as to any Revenue of the Crown, and that he
had Presidents to See the Freeholders Grand Inquest.
prove it, and to be suffered for once: and the old demurrer is, Deus non punit
in id idem) he was charged,

I. with Popish Innovations, by which you are to understand his care to reduce
the Cathedrals he belonged to, to order and decency: As for instance, it is
reckoned as his fault that he gave the Archbishop of Canterbury, Sept. 24.
1635. this account concerning his Services in the Church of Worcester.

1. An Altar-stone of Marble erected, and set upon four Co^umes. 2. The Wall
behind the Altar covered with Azure, Colored stuff with a White silk lace
down each seam. 3. The Altar it self adorned with a Pall, an upper and lower
front. 4. A perfect Inventory taken of all Ornaments, Vestments, and Implements
of the Church, as well sacra as focalia; diverse Vestments, and other Ornaments
of the Church, as Copes, Carpets, Fronts, etc. being turned into Players Caps,
Coats, and employed to that use by the direction of Mr. Nathaniel Thomkins
burnt, and the Silver extracted, put into the treasury of the Church. 5. The
Kings Scholars being forty, usually coming tumultuously into the Chore, ordered
to come in Bimatim; and to do reverence toward the Altar.
II. He was accused for conversing with Papists, whereof many in his Parish
loved his Company, which was no more than his prudent civility to gain them by
his worth and addresses to him, who were reported to have gained him to them,
when all that knew him understood well, that like the Lapwing he fluttered
furthest from his nest, having at once the closest, and therefore the smoothest
way of conveying his Design and Project.

III. He was looked upon as sociable and jovial, whereby you must understand a
good nature, ready to communicate its self in instruction to the ignorant, in
free discourses to the wise, in civil mirth, and a becoming cheerfulness among
his friends, usually saying at his Table, that there were three things
requisite to one good Meal, to pray heartily, to eat heartily, and in a sober
way to laugh heartily.

In an orderly Hospitality among his rich Neighbors, and Charity among his
poor ones, especially the modest, whose craving he expected not, but prevented
(some grounds will rather burn than chap) though otherwise he was as severe in
reducing disorderly Beggars, as he was pitiful in relieving impotent and
unfortunate Expectants; usually saying, That King Edward the sixth was as
Charitable in granting Bridewell for the punishment of Sturdy Rogues, as in
bestowing St. Thomas Hospital for the relief of the poor and helpless: Liking
the Picture of Charity, drawn with Honey in the one hand to feed Bees, and a
Whip in the other to drive away Drones.

In a frakness and freedom among his Tenants, whose thriving he consulted as
much as his own, esteeming three particulars the honor of a Church, 1. Punctual
Discipline. 2. An Exemplary Clergy. And 3. Improving Tenants.

King William Rufus (not so tender in other sacred points, as he was
conscientious in this) had two Monks come to him to buy an Abbots place, who
outvied each other in the sums they offered, while a third Monk stands by and
says nothing; to whom the King said, what will thou give for the place? Not a
Penny answered he, for it is against my Conscience: Then, quoth the King, thou
of the three best deservest the Place, and thou shall have it.

Three Tenants at one time standing in competition about a considerable
Lordship to be Let by the Doctor, one offering a great Fine, and a small Rent;
the second proposing a small Fine, and a great Rent; and the third no Fine, and
a good reasonable Rent, with the improvement of the Vicarage and the Church.
Nay, said the Doctor, this is my Tenant, that comes not to ensnare me with
great overtures for my self, but to treat with me upon fair proposals for the
Church; expecting nothing from him but his prayers to God for the Church, a
respectful carriage toward Churchmen, his punctal dealing with the Cathedral;
his good usage to the subordinate Tenants, and good Housekeeping; that as he
had got his Lease easily, he would keep house on the Church-patrimony
exemplarily: what he said of Simoniecal Parsons, is true of overcharged
Tenants, They can scarce afford to feed their sheep fat, who rent their Pasture
too dear.

These were his faults, which were other men's virtue, the slander of good and
evil, varying with the humors of men, and the temper of times, which turned
about him, as the Spheres about the Center, or as the alterations of his Body
about his Soul, himself all the while immovable; reckoning that answer of the
King (when he was moved to interpose in his behalf with the Parliament) so much
honor to him, that he wished it Inscribed on his Tomb. He that will Preach
other than he can prove, let him suffer; I give them no thanks to give me my
due.

I cannot but take notice of what was strange, when he spoke, and found a great
truth by them that lived to see it, viz.
That whosoever lived to see an happy end of that War, which they saw so
unhappily begun, should observe that no man of what persuasion soever, but
would be heartily sorry for it, and heartily repent of it; for they should find
so many interests coming in to disappoint them in the end they aimed at in the
war, that they would wish they had never commenced it.

One Burgoes Pupilla Oculi was a Book he much A^ to Dr. Rainbow Bishop of
Carlisle.
recommended to young men; to propose to themselves a pattern (and Bishop
Felton was his pattern) was his advice to young Preachers; to aim at some
particular thing in the reading of any Book, was his rule to young Students; to
be always doing something was his counsel to his young Hearers; to Analyze
Authors was his direction to young University Men; to Pen Sermons and Pray
them, was his lesson to his young Curates, on whom he called often for an
account of their Studies, dismissing them with this Caution of the
Pythagoreans, (...), Reverence thy self, Do nothing unworthy your Calling.

You cannot be too humble as Men, neither can you be too grave and reserved as
Ministers; Tanti eritis aliis, quanti vobis met ipsis.

But he had his virtues too much to be exactly charactered, being of the
Captains mind, who when another had made a large Recital of his own
Atchivements; asked him, and what have you done? Answered, Others can tell you
that, not enduring to give any account of himself, any more than the Conqueror
at the Olympic Games endured the Laurel due to him, until another put it on
his Head; which we shall hear do in these words, Hic Iacet

THE Life and Death OF Dr. ROBERT SIBTHORP.
IT were pity to sever them in their Character, that were so like in their
Carriage, both making themselves known to the world by the Shibboleth of the
Authority of the Church, and the Prerogative of the King; the first was a
rational man, and dived to the bottom of his subject; the other a smooth man,
that got in the bottom of his Hearers hearts; whose discourse went off
plausibly in the air of his good delivery, though they passed not so well in
the steady and fixed way of the Press. The Preaching of the Sermon called
Apostolic Obedience, got him much repute He (...) ^be^ it at Northampton
Assizes, 16^^.
at Court, and as much envy (for this passage in it, viz. That the Prince has
power to direct his Counsel, and make Laws and Subjects, if they cannot
exhibit active obedience, in case the thing commanded should be against the
Law of God, or of nature, or were impossible, yet nevertheless they ought to
yield a passive obedience, and in all other cases they are bound to active
obedience, the time the loan was pressed by the King, and so much disgusted by
the people in the Country.

It was liked so well by those that heard it, that they would have it Printed,
and so ill by Archbishop Abbot, when he read it, that he would not License it.

But it seems that Sermon that was not approved of by the Archbishop, was not
so much as questioned by the Parliament, which found so much the more fault in
the man, as they found the less fault in the Sermon, which vexed them
grievously, since they could not but be angry at it, and could not punish it,
it being smart against their late courses, yet cautious within their standing
Laws.

But being an active man (and if he had any fault, it was too much heat) he
does not only assert the doctrine of the Kings Prerogative and the Subjects,
but he suppresseth the impugners of it, complaining with Dr. Lamb, even of the
Bishop of Lincoln, against the Loan to the Council Board, and pursuing that
complaint in Star Chamber. But the best jest is, that those very people that
found fault with this Sermon, made it a Branch of their Articles against
Archbishop Laud, that he blotted several passages (about Sabbath-breaking,
Evil Counselors, Popery, which they say the Doctor had cunningly interwoven
into his discourse, to sweeeen the harsh point of the Prerogative) out of that
Sermon; when indeed that Sermon came out with so much care on all sides, that
the King commanded four Bishops to view and judge it, and every passage in it.

All the preferment that he had was his Vicarage of Brackley, and a poor
Prebends of Peterburgh, though so deserving of the Church in that Diocese, that
Dr. John Towers, Bishop of Peterburgh, in a Letter to my Lord of Canterbury,
wished him as heartily in the Deanery, as he did himself in the Palace.

It may be some that were in the Historians Character, sola socordia
innocents, that had phlegm enough to make them as they phrase it, discreet and
moderate, judged him one of those unhappy men, that had a certain (...), heat
or activity of spirit, that is, say they, wonderful apt without a due
corrective of wisdom, and knowledge to break forth into intemperate carriage,
and disturb the peace, and censured him as Tacitus does some stirring
Commonwealths-men, Quod per abrupta inclarescerent sed in nullum Reipusum,
talking, that zeal like Quicksilver must be allayed with wisdom, and calling
honest men in Livies phrase, Spiritus magni magis quam utiles. But let us hear
in this case a most learned, and a most ingenious person.

Its not for superiors to frown upon, and brow-beat those who are hearty, and
exact in the management of their Ministry; and with a grave and insignificant
Nod, to call a well-regulated and resolved zeal, want of prudence and
moderation; such discouraging of men in the way of an active conformity to the
Church, is to crack the sinews of Government; for it weakens the hands, and
damps the spirit of the obedient. And if only scorn and rebuke shall attend men
for asserting the Churches dignity, many will choose rather to neglect their
duty in the Churches service, only to be rewarded with that, that shall break
their hearts too.

That very little he had got in the time of peace, he lost in the time of war;
their practices and designs had been a long time the subject of his smart
reproofs, and his estate now become a prey to their revenge. To see the good
man escape them in his Clarks habit, that had been certainly murdered in his
own; when it was safe to be any thing but a Minister: and withal, to hear the
cheerful man smile out his old Motto, I have as much as I desire, if I have as
much as I want; and I have as much as the most, if I have as much as I desire.
'Twas a spectacle that had melted any spirit, but that in which the custom of
cruelty had taken away the conscience of it; whom yet he was very tender of,
according to his usual Maxim, Nature may induce me to show so much care of my
self, as to look to my adversaries; reason shall persuade me to show so much
wit, as to beware of those that deceived me once; but Religion has taught me
so much love, as to be injurious to none. For estate.

Abundance, he thought a trouble; want, a misery; honor, a burden; business, a
scorn; advancement, dangerous; disgrace, odious; but competency, a happiness. I
will not climb lest I fall, nor lie on the ground lest I am trod on. He for
carriage: He did so much for^ think what he would promise, that he might
promise only what he would do; that he would often do a kindness and not
promise it, and never promise a kindness, and not to do it. In Religion: His
heart spoke more devoutly than his tongue, when as too many peoples tongues
speak more piously than their hearts. The good man has oftentimes God in his
heart, when in his mouth there is no good mentioned; The Hypocrite has God
often in his mouth, when the fool has said in his heart there is no God: The
tongue speaks loudest to men, the heart truest to God.

(...) Its pity to part intimate Friends, the one dying under the sense, the
other under the fear of this Nations Calamity.

THE Life and Death OF Dr. JOHN BARKHAM.
JOhn Barkham, that said he had lived under a good Government, and was afraid
to live any longer, lest he should see none at all, was born in the City of
Exeter, bred in Corpus Christi College in Oxford, whereof he was Fellow,
Chaplain afterward to Archbishop Bancroft, and Parson of Bocking in Essex.
Much his Modesty, and no less his Learning; who, (though never the public
Parent of any) was the careful Nurse of many Books, who otherwise had expired
in their Infancy, had not his care preserved them. He set forth Dr.
Crackenthorp his Posthume Book against Spalato, and was helpful to John Speed,
in the composing of his English History; ^ea, he wrote the whole Life of the
Reign of King John (which (...) ^he King of all the Reigns in that Book, for
profound Penning) discoverable from the rest of the different style, and much
Scripture cited therein. Mr. Guillim in his Heraldry was much beholden to this
Doctors Emendations.

He was a greater lover of Coin than of Money, rather curious in the Stamps,
than covetous for the Metal thereof. That excellent Collection in Oxford
Library, was his gift to the Archbishop, before the Archbishop gave it to the
University, richer in M. SS. than Printed Books, and richer in the skill he had
by the phrase and Character to fill up the defects, and guess at the meaning of
a Moth-eaten Record, than in the possession of the Paper; when the Factious
were admitted to look upon his Rarities, they did him the kindness to supect
him of his Religion, thinking that the rust of his old Inscriptions cankered
his Soul with as old Superstition. When it is in the study of Antiquity, as it
is in that of Philosophy, a little skill in either of them inclines men to
Atheism or Heresy, but a depth of either study brings them about to their
Religion.

When both extremes, as he called them, to the virtue of the Church of England,
the Partisans of Rome and Geneva, the men of the old Doctrine, and the new
Discipline met with any little remnant of Antiquity that made for them, they
ran to him with it, and he would please himself infinitely with a story which
has been since his death Printed; the story was this. A Nobleman who had heard
of the extreme age of one dwelling not far off, made a journey to visit him,
and finding an aged person in the the Chymney corner, addressed himself to him
with admiration of his age, till his mistake was rectified so (Oh Sir, said the
young old man, I am not he whom you seek for, but his Son, my Father is further
off in the Field. They mistaking middle Antiquity for Primitive History,
wherein he was so versed, that he had not the Fathers books only, but their
hearts; not their History only, but their Piety: So strict in his life, that he
went among Fathers himself, being observed as much a rule to others, as they
were to him. Skilled he was in many Tongues, and yet a man of a single heart.
When God made him rich, he made not himself by coveteousness poor; and if God
had made him poor, he could have made himself by contentment rich. Bishop Usher
and he had one useful quality above many others, that they understood men
better than they did themselves, and so employed men that could not tell what
to do with themselves upon what was most suitable to them, and most profitable
to the public, having Dr. James his motion much upon their spirits, that all
the Manuscripts of England should be collected and compared: A design that
would have proved very beneficial to the Protestant, (considering how many M.
SS. England has still, notwithstanding her loss at the dissolution of
Monasteries) if prosecuted with as great endeavor as it was proposed with good
intention. You would think you were at St. Augustine, and St. Cyprians House,
when you saw the poor at the Doctors doors, the Neighbors welcome at his Table;
young Scholars in his Study; Bibles and other godly books in each room of his
house; the Servants and all the Household so used to Psalms and Chapters, that
they spoke familiarly the holy Language; the hours of Devotion and Instruction
constantly observed, the people being at all the returns of duty in Gods
service to forget their own business, though in their own business they never
forgot Gods service. When you saw a man making the errors of men the subject of
his grief, not of his discourse; so prudently reproving sin, as to spare the
person, and yet so discreetly tender toward the person, as not to countenance
sin. A man that would not give his heart the lie with his tongue, by not
intending what he spoke, or his tongue the lie with his actions, by not
performing what he promised; that had rather friendly insinuate men's errors to
themselves, than detractingly blaze them to others: a man that would not put
off his Devotion for want of leisure, nor his Charity for want of Ability; that
thought it better to deny a request, for that was only discourtesie than not
to perform a promise, for that is injury; that would not rebuke, as the
Philosopher would beat his servant in anger; angry reproofs being like scalding
potions, that work being to be done with compassion rather than passion. Many
excellent books were dedicated to him, its pity but there should be an entire
book made of him.

Annex we to both their Lives, THE Life and Death OF JOHN DAVENANT, Lord Bishop
of Salisbury,
THeir good Friend, who told Dr. Ward when he saw what his and other men's
indulgence to dissenting persons was like to come to, that he was ashamed to
live, when he should have nothing left him, but to live; and when such
immoderate courses were taken by them against Government, for whom he and
others had so often interceded for moderation from the Government, to see the
most irreligious things done, under the pretense of Religion: to see that he
that had with so much success moderated Controversies in the Schools, offered
expedients in Convocations, decided the Debates of Synods, (his prudent
directions, interpositions, seasonable and obliging Authority contributing much
to the peaceable end of that Convention) governed Universities, persuaded
Kings, nay, and by reason of his agreement with the Faction in some Doctrines,
done them many favors in Discipline, could not (among the leading men of the
party that he had so much obliged) by their Oaths and their Allegiance, by the
honor of Religion, and the dangers of it, by love to Brethren, or respect to
the designs of enemies, by the spirit of Peace, and the God of love, by their
bowels toward their Country, or their Fosterity, the Children yet unborn, by
the prayers and tears of their ancient Friend and a Reverend Bishop, gain so
much as Christian accommodation and mutual forbearance, but (after a most
excellent Tract of the Peace of the Christian world Disserta^^^^ pale ad Do

wherein he taught how that the few necessary things wherein men agreed should
be of more power to unite them, than the indifferent things wherein they
dissented, should have power to divide them. That the Christian world might
have unity in the few Fundamentals that are necessary; liberty in the things
that were indifferent, and so Charity in all things) despairing of persuading
men to peace by Arguments, who were set on War and Tumults by their Lusts,
which were to be subdued rather than convinced. He died of an old Consumption,
improved with new grief for the misery of those times which he foresaw sad,
and saw dangerous, April 1641. being (though his Father was a Citizen, living

vigorous) and as remarkably preserved in the first half seven years from his
Birth, falling down an high pair of stairs and rising at the bottom with so
little harm that he smiled. (They say when Chry^omes smile, it is because of
some intercourse between them and the little ones Guardian Angels: when this
Infant smiled it was certainly at the preservation of him by such an Angel) and
beyond all these preferred, when (his Father in his lifetime not allowing him
to be Fellow, no more than he would his rich Relations, to one of whom he said
when he had given his voice against him: Cousin, I will satisfy your Father,
that you have worth, but not want enough to be one of our Society,) he was
against his will made Fellow of Queens, the Provost alleging to him that
Preferment was not always a relief for want, but sometimes an encouragement for
worth; and against seven Competitors made Margaret Professor (Dr. Whitacre
having, when present at some of his youthful exercises, the earnest of his
future maturity, pronounced that he would in time prove the honor of the
University) when but a private Fellow of a College, and before three others
chosen Master of Queens, when not forty years of age; and Bishop of Salisbury
upon the death of Dr. Toulson his Brother-in-law, that he might provide for his
Sister and her numerous family, when he had not a Friend at Court but the King.

THE Life and Death OF THOMAS HOWARD, Earl of Arundel.
THomas Howard An E^^^dom that belong^^ to the Lord of Arundel (...).
Earl of Arundel and Surrey, the first Earl, and Earl Marshal of England, and
Knight of the Garter, (Son to Philip Earl of Arundel, Grandson to His incestor
John Howard created Duke of Norfolk by Rich. III. July 4. 1483. 1 Rich, III.
Thomas Duke of Norfolk, Gandfather to Thomas now Duke of Norfolk, to whom the
honor of that Dukedom was restored 1661. by his Majesty King Charles the
Second, which was lost for his Ancestors great kindness to his Great
Grandmother, Mary Queen of Scots; whose life Thomas the foresaid Duke of
Norfolk, endeavored to save with the loss of his own, and Courting her love,
lost his Mistress Queen Elizabeth, who spilt that blood then called amorous,
rather than traitorous, that he intended to make Royal, and to prevent a
Marriage between him and the Queen of Scots, divorced his Head from his Body,
making him contented to lie in his Ancestors cold Grave, for aspiring to a
Queens warm Bed.) was born at London, July 7. 1572. bred (when his Father was
under a Cloud) at Westminster near London, and Trinity College in Cambridge,
when he had so much moderation as to appear constantly at our Prayers and
Sermons, and so much insight into the Protestant Principles, as to judge that
the distance between the Catholic and Reformed Churches grew not from their
Controversies, but their Interests; not from the Opinions themselves, which
might be compounded, but from the passions of those that managed them, which
could not be reconciled. Neither was he satisfied only to read what men
thought, but he traveled to see what they did either in Courts, as at France
and Rome; or in Camps, as in the Low Countries; or in Universities, as in St.
Omers, etc. from whence he returned a very accomplished Gentleman, fit

1. For a Kings Privy Council, to which honor King James admitted him, 1607.

2. For a Companion of the most honorable Order in the world; such he was
created by King James, with Prince Charles, and the Earl of Sommerset, 1611.
that King saying, He was a very fit man for the first of those Honors, because
he could not flatter; and for the second, because he could not but obey.

3. For the Judge of the Court of Honor, being a great Master of it.

4. For an Ambassador to the Emperor, about the Restoration of the Palatinate,
as he was by King Charles the first 1636. where having proposed reason to the
Emperor, and disposed most of the Princes to hearken to that reason so far,
that the Lower Palatinate was granted; when Bavaria, who got the upper
Palatinate into his possession, answered at last like a Soldier, what he had
concealed all the time of the fruitless Treaty, That what he had with so much
hazard of his Person, and expense of Treasure won by the Sword, in defense of
the Empire, against the Empire, he would now maintain with the same Power in
the possession. The stout Earl, to express his disdain of the insignificant
answer, returned home (notwithstanding the interpositions of the Polish and
Spanish Ambassadors sent after him to moderate his anger, and promise better
effects, after some weeks patience) without so much as taking his leave,
procuring the like flur for the Imperial Agent that came over hither to excuse
their past carriage, and to offer new conditions, upon strong presumption of
Marriage, which he had driven very far, between the Electors Sister Elizabeth,
and the King of Poland.

5. For a Judge in several extraordinary Courts of Justice, an employment
befitting the dignity of his Person, and the firmness, impartiality, and
resolution of his Spirit.

6. For General of the gallant Army that went against Scotland, a place
suitable to his skill, experience, and conduct.

7. For a Commissioner to examine the Spanish Navy under D'Oquendo 1639. and
the design of it upon our Coast, which he did discreetly and narrowly,
discovering more than we could suspect.

And 8. For a Companion to the Queen Mother of France, when she departed from
England, in which capacity he was to his dying day very serviceable to her, and
to his Majesty, contributing toward his service abroad, for Arms, Ammunition,
Intelligence, and a good Correspondence, near upon 20000 l. and toward his
relief at home above 14000 l. Insomuch, that the honorable Henry Howard has
paid for debts since his death near upon an 100000 l. He subscribed with the
rest of the Nobility 12000 l. and sent more over privately 8000. several ways;
which had cost him his whole estate, or at least a very severe Composition, had
he not discreetly settled it in Sir Richard Onslow, and other Trustees, who had
done as signal Services for that which they called a Parliament, as he had done
for his Majesty.

A Noble man this, made up rather of that honesty, that desires rather to be,
than to seem good, than of that hypocrisy, that desires rather to be, than to
seem good; one that made his business more to deserve opinion than have it; as
more concerned what thoughts he himself, than what others had of him. He
understood the Religion he professed, and professed the Religion he understood;
he never thought himself so good as he should be, unless he strived to be
better than he was; equal in all conditions, under the worst, patient, because
he deserved it; and despaired not as long as he could pray; under the best
sober and thankful, because he feared it, and presumed not as long as he might
offend. Supporting himself and friends with this consideration, that if things
are not so good as he would they should have been, yet they were not so bad as
he knew they might have been: what if I am not so happy as I desire? its well I
am not so wretched as I deserve.

They say Favorites are Court-dyals, whereon all look when Majesty shines on
them, and none when it is night with them. Our Nobleman was most conspicious in
his Eclipses, and like the Images of Brutus and Cassius, Quod abesset co magius
persulgebat. Though always in favor, because entertained for use, not
affection; not only relying so much on his Masters favor, as his Master did on
his abilities: Goodness consecrated his greatness, and his greatness honored
his goodness; he managed his estate so as to support his honor, and employed
his honor so as both to support and credit his estate; good husbandry may stand
with great h^nor, as well as breadth with height; he saved his estate by ways
thrifty and noble, with no loss to his honor, traveling to gain experience
abroad, and save expenses at home. He might with Francis Russel, second Earl of
Bedford of that Surname (as Queen ^lizabeth merrily complained of him) make
many Beggars by his Liberality, he made none by his Oppression or Injustice,
being as punctual as his Ancestor Thomas Duke of Norfolk, who when he was
carried to be buried in the Abbey of Thetford, Anno 1524. had made so even with
the world, that no person could demand a groat of him for debt or restitution
of any injury done by him. As he was a complete Gentleman himself, so he took a
particular care his Posterity should not be defective, often with pleasure
telling the Ran-counter between a Nobleman of Henry the eighths time, and Mr.
Pace one of his Secretaries; The Nobleman expressing himself in contempt of
Learning, that it was enough for Noblemens Sons to Wind their Horn, and carry
their Hawk fair, and to leave Study and Learning to the Children of mean Men.
Mr. Pace replied, That then you and other Noblemen, must be content that your
Children may Wind their Horns, and keep their Hawks, while the Children of mean
M^n do manage ma^ter of State.

But we will make bold with the rest of his Character, as we find it in a Book,
called Observations upon the States^men and Favorites of England, p. 725. only
correcting the misnomer there of Philip, in stead of Thomas Earl of Arundel;
and adding that he married Alethei^ (his Wife, Daughter to the Earl of
Shrewsbury, so Christened by Queen Elizabeth, because of the faithfulness of
that house to the Crown) so he espoused truth and faithfulness so cordially,
that when he heard some would have begged his Offices in his absence, he said,
He was glad they made such easy demands, which his Majesty might easily grant,
since he held not him by his preferments, but by his heart.

Had his faith been as Orthodox, as his faithfulness was Eminent, King James
his Gratitude, and his Uncle Northamptons Policy, had raised him as high as his
had been, and his Posterity now is: But since his Opinion was supposed to have
made him a Separatist from the Church, and his Temper a Recluse from the Court,
we have him in a place of Honor only, as Earl Marshall, while we find his
Brother in a place of profit, as Lord Treasurer, though both in a place of
Trust as Privy-Councellors; where this Earl approved himself a confutation of
his Uncle, the Earl of Northamptons Maxim; See the (...) upon the Lord S^encer.
That a thorough-paced Papist cannot be a true-hearted Subject: Being as good
an Englishman in his heart, as he was a Catholic in his conscience; only the
greatness of his spirit would not suffer any affronts in Parliament, whence he
endured some discountenance from the Court; insomuch that the House of Lords,
finding him a Prisoner, when they sat, 1626. would not Act till, after several
of their Petitions, he was Released; afterward, his temper yielding with
years, he was very complying, only he presumed to marry his Son, the Lord
Matr^vers, to Elizabeth, Daughter of Esme Stuart, Duke of Lenox; a person so
nearly related to his Majesty, that he thought it proper for him only to
dispose of her; a fault he laid upon the Mothers of each side who made the
Match.

Indeed the Politic Observator says, That women of all creatures are the most
dexterous in contriving their designs, their natural sprightfulness of
imagination, attended with their leisure, furnishing them with a thousand
expedients, and proposing all kind of overtures, with such probability of happy
success, that they easily design, and as eagerly pursue their design.

When he was sometimes barred the Service of his own times, he gave himself to
the Contemplation of those before him; being a fond Patron of Antiquaries and
Antiquity. Of whose old pieces he was the greatest hoarder in Europe, setting
aside Ferdinando de Medicis, Grand Duke of Tuscany, from whom, by the mediation
of Sir Henry Wotton, he borrowed many an Antic Sculpture, which furnished his
Library so well (as we may guess by Seldens' Marmora Arundeliana) that as my
Lord Burlieghs Library was the most complete one, for a Politician; my Lord
Bacons, for a Philosopher; Mr. Seldens, for an Historian; Bishop Vshers, for a
Divine; my Lord of Northampton, and my Lord of Dorset, for a Poet; Mr.
Oughtreds, for a Mathematician; Dr. Hammonds, for a Grammarian, or an universal
Critic; so the Earl of Arundels was the best for an Herald or an Antiquary; a
N^bl^ communicated to ^ll ing^ni^us persons, by the Honorable II. Howard of
Norfolk, greater in his own worth than in any (...).
Library not for state, but use.

Neither was he more in his Study, where he bestowed his melancholy hours, than
in Council, where he advised three things with reference to the Foreign
troubles. 1. Correspondence abroad. 2. Frequent Parliaments. 3. Oftener
Progresses into the Countries.

And he was not less in the Field than in Council, when General against the
Scots (the more shame!) that Protestants should at that time rebel against the
King, when supposed Papists ventured their lives for him.

After which Expedition, he was ordered beyond Sea with the Queen Mother of
France, 1639. when they say he looked back on England, with this wish, May it
never have need of me.

It is true some observe, that the Scots who cried upon him as a Papist, yet
writ under hand to him, their Noble Lord; as they did to Essex, and my Lord of
Holland, so effectually, that they had no mind to the war afterward: And it
was as true, that he declared first (all the other Lords concurring with him)
against the false and scandalous Paper, that the Scots published, as the
Articles of Paci^ication.

And upon this occasion, a Schedule was a second time given of the parties that
combined against the Government, viz. 1. The busy Medlars, that had got the
plausible trick of Haranguing, since King James his time, not used in
Parliament from Henry the Sixth time, to his. 2. The covetous Landlords,
Inclosers, and Justices of the Peace, that ruled in the Country, and would do
so in Parliament. 3. Needy men in debt, that durst not show their Heads in time
of Peace. 4. Puritans, that were so troublesome against Hutton, etc. in Queen
Elizabeth's days; and under pretense of Religion, overthrew all Government. 5.
Such malcontents, as either lost the preferment they had, or had not what
they were ambitions of, with their kindreds and dependants. 6. Lawyers, that
second any attempt upon the Prerogative, with their Cases, Records, and
Antiquities. 7. London Merchants, that had been discovered by Cra^field and
Ingram, as to their Cheats put upon the King in his Customs and Plantations. 8.
Commonwealths-men, that had learned from Holland in Queen Elizabeth's days, to
pray for the Queen and the State. And 9. Such Recusants as were Hispaniolized,
whereof this Earl was none; but though as a Church Catholic, he had most of
the Catholic Peers Votes devolved upon him; he never bestowed them
undutifully, albeit sometimes stoutly and resolutely.

A great friend he was to all new Inventions, save those that ^ended to do that
by few hands, which had been usually done by many; because, said he, while
private men busy their heads to take off the poors employment, the public
Magistrate must busy his to find them maintenance. Either he, or the Earl of
Northampton used to say (when asked, what made a complete man) To know how to
Cast Accounts; an accomplishment though ordinary, yet might save many an estate
in England.

Sanders writes, that Queen Katherine Dowager never kneeled on a Cushion, and
my Lord never allowed himself the temptation, he called it, of softness, well
knowing that the ablest Virtue, like the City of Rome, was seldom besieged, but
it was taken too; seldom assaulted, but foiled: Virtues being like the Tree in
Mexican^, Dr. H^ylin writes of, that if you but touch any of its branches, it
withers presently.

We read of a Germane Prince, admonished by Revelation (as Surius and Baronius
relate the story, Anno 1007.) to search for a Writing in an old Wall, which
should nearly concern him, wherein he found only these two words, Post sex;
whence he prepared for death within six days; which when past, he successively
persevered in godly resolutions six weeks, six months, six years, and on the
first day of the seventh year the Prophecy was fulfilled, though otherwise than
he Interpreted it; for thereupon he was chosen Emperor of Germany, having
before gotten such a habit of piety, that he persisted in his religious course
for ever after, being s^mmoned by a fit of Sickness to prepare for death some
years before he died; he did so inure himself to devotion, That all the days of
his appointed time he waited until his change should come, expecting at all
times that which might come at any time, and must come at one time; than which
nothing more certain, nothing more uncertain. He died at Venice, 1646.

THE Life and Death OF Sir FRANCIS CRAWLEY.
THIS Gentleman, who with Zorastes laughed at his birth, and death, was born at
Lutton in Bedford-shire, the very same day and hour, as it was computed, April
6. 1584.
that Ploiden died at London: the very reason why his Father recommended so
earnestly, and he embraced so willingly, the study of the Law, than which no
study more knotty, he would say to the Novices that were first admitted to it,
none more pleasant to the Ancients that had experience in it; wherein he
profited, as he might have done in any profession, since very happy in those
two qualities, Secrecy and Celerity, the two great wheels of considerable
performances; improving faster than fame, the wings of industry surprising men
beyond those of fame. His deterity in Logic in the University, promised him an
able Pleader at the Inns of Court. It was his observation, that the fashioning
of a Man's Head, to the minute subtilties of a Sophism, opened and fitted it to
entertain the distinct, and least circumstances of a Case. He wore a signet
Ring, wherein was Engraven his famous Ancestors Picture, with better success
than Sc^pio Alsricanus did that which carried his Fathers Face, which was taken
off by the people of Rome, because he was unworthy to wear his Fathers
Portaiture, that did not follow his Pattern; it being not fit his Picture
should go without his Virtue.

One part of his time he spent with his Acquaintance, and the other with his
Books; the one bringing him to practice, as the other enabled him for it.

He studied the English Nobility and Gentry for his pleasure, observing their
Alliance in Heraldry, and for his profit noting their correspondence in
Interest; being as able to put suitable Persons together to make a Party, as
any Herald was to put Kindred together to frame a Pedigree. His Study was like
his Converse, rather well contrived than toilsom, his Art, not his Drudgery;
his soft and fair, went far in Labyrintho properantes ipsa velocit as Implicat.
He is not the likeliest man to run out of a Maze, that runs fastest. He was as
rich in his observations of his own age (no remark being missed in his
Table Book) as he was in his History of Former Ages.

Happy in himself, more in his Relations, especially those he called his
Blessings (as if peculiar to him) his good Wife, and excellent Children, of
whom he was loving, not fond. One point of his devotion was remarkable, that he
never met a person subject to infirmities, but in stead of deriding them in the
other man, he blessed God that he had not occasion to grieve for them in
himself. And another of his instructions to those about him notable, that its
not the least, a man skillful to have so much command of him^ self, as to be
contented to submit to the commands of others.

The Courtesies he bestowed, were gifts never remembered by him; those he
received, loans never forgotten: The Discourse he loved, was that which had
left of other men's vices, and most of their virtues, without censure of
Superiors, scorn of Inferiors, vainglory, or a supercilious reservednesse
(when men are rather Riddles than Company) in the persons themselves.

Liberal he was of every thing, especially of good advice; covetous of doing
good: He would hardly receive an ill opinion of any, and more hardly express
it. He dispensed Justice to his friends, not as a friend, but as a friend;
answering, when it was told him, that that was not the way to be rich, That it
would never repent him for being the poorer for doing justice.

He neither encouraged an ill-inclined person by overmuch mildness, nor
discouraged a well-inclined one by extreme severity.

He could pardon a man that he caught in a mistake, for it was a common
frailty, commending in him the acknowledgment of it as a great virtue [the
noblest thing that St. Augustine did was his Retractation] but reject him that
stood in it as a hopeless wretch; a man he called not constant, but obstinate;
it being more to justify a fault, than to fall into it. His Apparel was
neither mimically in fashion, nor ridiculously out; neither vain, nor singular.

His short divertisement fitted him for business, rather than rob^bed him of
time; he would say to his Sons, That they who make recreation a business, will
think business a toil. To be without an estate, and not want; to want, and not
desire; to manage well a great estate, and to bear a mean; to be sensible and
patient, not to grow great by corruption, nor to grow proud with greatness;
not to ebb and flow with a man's condition, and to be neither supercilious nor
dejected; to take the changes of the world, without any change in a man's self;
not to defer death, but sweeten it; to be neither loath to leave the world, nor
afraid to give account for it, were qualities that he admired in others, and
lived to be Master of himself.

He never commended a man to his face, but before others, to create in them a
good opinion of him; nor dispraised any man behind his back, but to himself, to
work in him a reformation of himself; avoiding the appearance of evil, left he
should do ill unawares, or hear ill undeservedly.

He could not with patience hear what was unseasonable or unsavory, arguing
want of goodness or judgment; Speak well, was his rule, or say nothing; so if
others be not bettered by thy silence, they will not be worse by the discourse.

Being more intent upon knowing himself, than letting others know him; he found
that the greatest part of what he knew not, was the least of what he knew. He
was as careful that others should be bettered by him, as that he should be
bettered by others; observing little but what he would imitate, and doing
nothing but what might be imitated.

In the Morning he thought what he had to do, for which he might ask Gods
blessing; and at Night what he had done, for which he must needs ask pardon;
being ready always to part with and give account for his life; not being afraid
to look upon his score, but fearful to increase it. To despair, because a man
is sinful, is to be worse, because he has been bad. To be discontented he
reckoned a folly, because it makes that which was a punishment only before, a
sin now; and by finding fault with God, to make another fault in our selves. He
neither made another man's fault his own by aggravating it, nor doubled his own
by excusing it.

These virtues of his Person, the great reputation of his Parts and Skill, the
eminency of his Practice, and his known Integrity, preferred him to a relation
to many Noble Persons, and at last to the Service of the Crown: for having been
some years Barrister of Grayes Inn, and called, with fifteen more, to be
Sergeant, Term. Mich. Anno 21. Iacobi Regis, being Puisne to them all;
insomuch, that it was remarkable at that time,
that he read in Grayes Inn, after he had received his Writ to be Sergeant,
which was done by the advice of the Lord Chancellor and the Judges; he was made
the Queens Sergeant the next Term, I. Car. and upon the death of Sir Francis
Harvey, one of the Justices of the Commons Bench. Wherein, with what
impartiality he administered Justice to the people, and with what faithfulness
he gave advice to the King, especially in the matter of Ship Money, may be
guessed by his sufferings from the Faction, and his love from the whole Kingdom.

Which (since we could not be so happy, as to have an account of this excellent
Father from his excellent Son; who is as well his Character, as his Child; his
History, as well as his Issue:) we must be contented to take from a friend of
his, who would have Posterity know him, to whom they are so much obliged.

THE Life and Death OF Mr. JOSIAS SHUTE.
HIS very name is as a Silver Trumpet to his Reputation, sounding out a
Quicquid doctiorum est, assurgite huic tam colendo nomini: With whom it was, as
with Job appearing, Chap. 29. The young men hid themselves, and the aged rose
and stood up; when the Ear heard him, then it blessed him; and when the Eye saw
him, it gave witness to him. His name I say, is an Aromatic Ointment,
diffusing a more rich Perfume, then the choicest of our broken Boxes.

2. He descended of a Learned Race, the Son of an eminent Divine in Yorkshire,
and one of five famous Brother-Preachers. A man of that latitude of Learning,
that length of Apprehension, that depth of Judgment, and height of Speculation,
so complete in all Dimensions, that I may justly renew that admiration of Naz.
concerning Basil, (...), where was there such a mixture of rare Parts and
Graces: What kind of Learning was he unacquainted with? what kind was he not
Excellent in? as if he had studied that alone.

3. And though he were a man of but a single heart, yet was he one of diverse
Tongues, able to read the Scriptures without the spectacles of Translators; he
both drank and derived those Holy Waters out of their sweeter Fountains, the
Originals. And even Bellarmine acknowledges, the Original is in several cases
to be used. Luther and Melancthon valued their Skill in the Originals above
Kingdoms, faith Amam in Paraen. L. H. Our grave Author, like a wise Merchant,
was well skilled in the Tongue of the place he traded to; being Master of those
three Grand Mother-Languages inscribed on the Cross of Christ, besides some
others of their Progeny.

4. Filius Ecclesiae in patribus versatissimus: This Son of the Church of
England was most familiar with the Ancient Fathers both of the East and West.
Of the Greek, Chrysostom lay in his bosom, even till he did Patrizare, become
like unto him in his flowing strife and golden Eloquence. Among the Latin, St.
Augustine, that Maul of Heretics, was in chief esteem with him.

5. He was an exact Historian, for Ecclesiastical History especially, those
Records of the Church; the ignorance whereof is the Mother of many of our
growing Errors and Indevotions, nor was he less acquainted with the Schools;
(though more delighted with the waters of Siloah, than of Meriba,) even a
Master of the Master of the Sentences, and a Secretioribus unto the Councils,
even of their Cabinet.

6. And because the flock is not only to be fed, but cured sometimes; he was a
singular Casuist, and Chyrurgeon, that knew well (...), to set in joint again,
and to bind up the broken heart: A Soul-Chyrurgeon right, for all those
properties of heart, and hand, and eye, no less sweet and soft in exhortations
and consolations: He was indeed another Apollos, an Eloquent man, and mighty in
the Scriptures; and as another Basil, he did thunder in his Doctrine, and
lighten in his Life, his light shined before men; not only that of knowledge,
but that of example also in his Piety and Charity, in his Gravity and sweet
Affability.

He gilded not over Luke-warmness with the Varnish of Discretion, nor allowed
he violence in unconcerning and indifferent Affairs, under the pretense of zeal.

He was at Mark at last, tall people may be Porters to Lords, (says one that
^elt the effects of moderation) very little people may be Dwarss to Ladies,
whiles men of a middle stature may t^ant Masters, many notorious for
extremities may find many to advance them, whilst moderate men state few to
Prefer them.
last dignified with the Arch-Deaconry of Colchester, and having been above
three and thirty years Rector of St. Mary Woolnoth in Lumbard-street London, an
indefatigable, most faithful, and most beloved Preacher of the Gospel there;
lamenting the distractions fallen upon the Church, he departed hence to rest
with God, June 22. 1643.

He was born in Gislewick in Yorkshire, and bred in Trinity College in
Cambridge, and afterward became Minister of St. Mary Woolnoth in London, and
was, Reader, I do say, and will maintain it, the most precious Jewel that was
ever shown or seen in Lumbard-street; all Ministers are Gods Husbandmen, but
some of them can only plough in soft ground, whose shares and coultres will
turn edge in a hard point of Divinity: no ground came amiss to Mr. Shute,
whether his Text did lead him to Controversial or positive Divinity; having a
strain without straining for it of native Eloquence, like the Paracelsian, who
could draw Oil out of the slints of Controversies. He spoke that which others
studied for: he was for many years, and that most justly, highly esteemed of
his Parish, till in the beginning of our late Civil Wars some began to neglect
him, distasting wholesome Meat well dressed by him, merely because their mouths
were out of taste, by that general distemper, which in his time was but an
Ague, afterward turned to a Fever, and since is turned to a Frenzy in our
Nation.

I insist thereon the rather for the comfort of such godly Ministers, who now
suffer in the same nature wherein Mr. Shute did before: indeed no Servant of
God can simply and directly comfort himself in the offerings of others, (as
which has something of envy therein) yet may he do it consequently in this
respect, because thereby he apprehends his own condition herein consistent with
Gods love and his own Salvation, seeing other precious Saints taste with him of
the same affliction, as many godly Ministers do nowadays, whose sickles are
now hung up as useless, and neglected, though before these Civil Wars they
reaped the most in Gods harvest. Mr. Shute dyed Anno Domini 1640. and was
buried with great Solemnity in his own Church, Mr. Vdall preaching his Funeral
Sermon: Since his death, his excellent Sermons are set forth on some part of
Genesis, and pity it is there is no more extant of his worthy endeavors. It
must not be forgotten, how retiring a little before his death into the
Country, some of his Parishoners came to visit him, whom he cheerfully
entertained with this expression: I have taught you, my dear stock, for above
thirty years how to live, and now in a very short time how to die; he was as
good as his word herein, for within an hour he in the prefence of some of them
was peaceably dissolved.

This famous man with his Brothers, (...).
1. Nathamel, bred in Christ College in Cambridge, an excellent Scholar, and
solid Preacher, though nothing of his extant besides Corona Charitatis, a
Sermon at the Funeral of Mr. Fishbourne, living many years at St. Mildreds, a
painful and careful Minister, and dying 1638. Dr. Holdsworth most excellently
preaching his Funeral Sermon on this ^ext, We have this our treasure in Earthen
vessels. 2. Robert, Minister of Lyn. 3. Thomas, Minister of Chester; and
Timothy lately Minister at Exeter, are a Confutation of the slander raised upon
Clergy-mens Children, it being a question whether they were more happy in their
good Father, called commonly the Reverend Vicar of Gizlewich, or he in so
eminent Sons; Great, though not equally set in conveniently distanced
Candlesticks.

One in Cambridge (they are the words of a Cambridge man) being demanded his
judgment of an excellent Sermon at the University-Church, returned that it was
an uncomfortable, leaving no hope of imitation for such as should succeed him.
In this sense must we allow these men uncomfortable men (though the sweetest
tempered men in the world) possessing such as shall follow them in time, with a
despair to equal them in eminence.

Thus much of this good man is dispersedly public already by others; something
must be added by us who have sat under his Ministry twenty four years, being
Baptized, Chatechized, and Married by him; the title of whose Acquaintance and
Friends we as ambitiously affect, as Fulke Lord Gr^vill did that of being Sir
Philip Sidneys Friend, when he ordered his Memorial should be, That he was
Servant to Queen Elizabeth, Privy-Counsellor to King James, and friend to Sir
Philip Sidney. One he was that would not suffer us to spend our whole time to
know what we should be, but to be as careful to be what we knew, bidding us
beware of the Ricket-Christianity in head-notions, and Paralletick Religion in
lip-labors; that bid us follow our Places to discharge our Consciences, as well
as to improve our state; rather to do good than grow rich, injoyning one of us
to give judgment, and not sell it; and taking nothing to do an unjust thing,
and give nothing to enjoy it.

No sin so great he thought as that we felt little, as little want of feeling
is a symptom of dying; only the misery is, they that loose feeling in regard of
sin, cannot do so in respect of punishment; the less the occasion of sin, the
greater the nature of it.

He did endeavor to sweeten Religion by his own conversation, and persuade
others to do so, to remove the old calumny, and the new scandal, Spiritus
Calvinianus est spiritus Melancholicus, study rather to make thy self fit for
employment (was his rule) than to think thy self so, adding against buying of
places, that they that grew great by buying, continued so by selling; if a man
buys a place he deserves not, he wrongs others, if that he deserves himself;
measure your Wealth by your mind, not Estate, was his Citizens rule, and your
expense by your Estate, and not his by your Estate, lest while you fear to be
thought mean, you become so: Let your thoughts be such to your selves, that you
need not be ashamed to have God know them (this was a rule in Devotion) and
words such to God as you need not be afraid men should hear them, that the one
may not do you harm by an ill habit, nor the other to others by an ill example.

It was his own comfort that he was inwardly sincere, and others benefit that
he was outwardly exemplary; his discourse wherein he would neither undertake
nor talk much, was rather profitable than curious, not for applause to hear
well, but for use to do well.

He asserted the utmost of Christian Liberty (being sensible with Cardan, that
there was no Superstition so dangerous, as theirs that avoided Superstition)
but practiced the least of it, not going to the farthest point of lawfulness
because (as the East and West Indies meet in a point) that lay upon the borders
of unlawfulness, and he that will do all that he may, may do what he ought not;
he measured his promises by his ability, and his performances, though to his
prejudice, by his promises; an honest man does not promise more than he means,
nor a wiseman more than he is able, though a great Scholar: his greatest
knowledge he reckoned that of himself: and though an able man, yet valued it
his greatest ability that he conquered himself: he did good as privately as
others do evil. Good counsel, like charity, begins at home, he that will do
good upon others, must be good himself, otherwise it is an easier matter to
give good counsel, than to follow it.

He would condemn nothing out of humor, nor maintain any thing out of fashion;
because, he said, he desired to say nothing that he must recall, and to do
nothing that he should repent.

He deferred not the duty he durst not deny, because he reckoned his life by
moments, the minute past being irrecoverable, and that to come uncertain, the
present only ours: The more men delay repentance, the more work they have to
do, and the less time to do it in; his last hour therefore finding him rather
willing to go than contented to carry, having nothing to do but to dye.

He would not suffer us to measure our want of goodness by others store, nor
our store of it by others want; for the crooked must be measured by the
straight, and not by the more crooked; teaching us to measure Gods blessings,
not by our wants, but by our deserts.

He did not wonder at the various effects of the doctrine he taught, any more
than at the diverse effects of the Physic he would sometimes prescribe, (and he
would say that a good Divine should have something in him of the good
Physician) both succeeding according to the capacity of the Patient; for under
unprofitableness we should blame not Gods means, but our own hearts; when we
profit, we should not thank our own hearts, but God and his means. The way to
be long young, is to be old betimes (he said) and the way to live always, was
to dye daily; the thoughts of the dissolution of soul and body, which is the
natural death, being the best means to prevent the dissolution of soul and
body, which is the spiritual death; and death becomes the beginning of a man's
happiness, and not the end.

Consideration was the main part of his work, and he would have made it the
main part of ours; all the evils in the world, he would say, being capable of a
prevention by these two words, quid foci? And by that which as it was the
peculiar faculty, so was the proper happiness of a man. Reflection, and
suffering reason to check and control the Appetite, and faith to govern
reason, when urged much with his stiffness in the points of Obedience and
Rebellion. If I did not think these doctrines true (said he) I would never have
published them? and since I think they are true, I dare not renounce them:
Which puts us in mind of his smart check to Back-sliders; If the profession of
Religion was not good, why did you enter into it? if it was, why do you not
continue in it?

It was an endless thing, he thought, to be solicitous about fame, for that
lies in the power of many; a short work to take care of Conscience, for that is
in the power of one. Upon some good words bestowed on him by the men of the
times, that heard ill, he startled with, Why? what have I done, that these
should speak well of me? Parcat cognatis maculis similis fera.

Let thy estate serve thy occasions (it was his last words to his Brother) thy
occasions, thy self; thy self, thy soul; thy soul, thy God.

To take Resolution (he urged us to) upon good grounds, and not to forsake
them, but upon good reason; prescribing to us a solid judgment, and not fond
opinions; and if we maintain opinions, to do it because they are true; and not,
because they are ours. Christian Liberty he asserted, and Christian
Licentiousness he bewailed.

He would satisfy Nature, and not humor it; stand still, rather than go out of
his Calling; flow to choose a friend, and slower to change him; courteous to
all, intimate with a few (saying, our Savior had many Hearers, but a few
Disciples) his acquainted, he reckoned his neighbor; his friend, himself; he
scorned no man for his meanness, nor humored any for their wealth; advising
young men not to cease to be good Christians, by desiring to be esteemed good
Companions. In stead of a Cato, set before thee, said he, to Mr. I. S. set
before thee a God, whose eye is always upon thee, and therefore keep thy eye
always upon him; doing nothing to which thou may willingly desire Gods
absence, or can not desire his assistance.

He was very earnest with us, to keep this much upon our hearts, that the good
we receive is not for our own sake, nor the good we do by our own power. He was
unwilling that we should repine at sufferings, as other men's faults, if they be
not blessings, it is our own: He saw his own mortality in other men's death, and
his own frailty in their sins; so thinking of death, as to be afraid of sin
that led to worse; and so reflecting on sins, as not to be afraid of death that
led to better. He charged us in the beginning of the times, to make not the
best men our rule, for they that in all things follow him that may err, will be
sure in some things to fall into error. He compared what he did, with what he
suffered, being infinitely taken with this consideration, that he had received
more good than he had done, and done more evil than he suffered.

Often repeating to us the saying (as he did recommend to us the solid and safe
works) of Bishop Davenant, in an Emphatical Prayer, which he made for half a
quarter of an hour before he died, reserving (that strength which standers by
thought he had lost, when for many days he had not spoke, though not
speechless) for his last hour, wherein he thanked God for that his fatherly
correction, because in all his life time he never had one heavy affliction,
which made him often much suspect with himself, whether he was a true Child of
God or no, till that his last sickness.

If I have lived well, I have lived long enough, would he say, to those that
were impatient to hear that he should dye; if otherwise, too long; to desire to
be here still, is to desire to be still out of heaven. Child, would he say to a
friend, never think it too soon to be serious, for it may be too late to put
off amendment: with hope of living is to loose eternal life, by presuming on a
temporal one. In the beginning of the troubles he much inculcated that rule
that we should intend the public good, as well as our private advantages,
because by providing for a man's own particular he may wrong the public,
whereas by effecting good to the community, a man must do good to himself;
whence all creatures do that as more good, which is good to the more; measuring
good not by what it is in it as to us, but by what it is in its self. He
thought he should not fear death the last change, that was acquainted with a
life so full of changes.

Its pity, he would say to Ladies that came to him, that Beauty which is an
ornament, should become a snare; the worst money is that which is spent about
fashions, and the worse time (more precious than money) that is employed in
Dressing, since God has made you beautiful in others eyes, let it be your care
to be so in his.

At Church he wished them to empty themselves of this world, to be conversant
in the next; to shut their eyes, that their ears might be open.

In Neighborhood he would wish them, to love others as themselves, in the kind
unseigned; in Friendship to love others as themselves, in the degree ardently.
Injuries show that thou art able to revenge, but not willing (lest thou do that
injury by incroaching on him to God, which thou complainest of in thy
Neighbor:) courtesies show thou art willing to requite, though not able; if
you live not for your selves, but to God; God will not live for himself, but
for you. Let your conceit be low, and your desires high, God being able to
render your capacity as great, as you know your worth is little.

He would unwillingly converse with a man that would forget himself by an
unreasonable anger, or his friend and company by an unseasonable jest.

He loved his Body, which he had common with a Beast, in subordination to his
Soul, which he had common with Christ. His words, which were few, went far in
his house, but his example further; being, he said, angry for small faults, to
prevent greater; and pleased with the least good, to encourage men to do
better. He would hear no ill of a friend, nor speak any of an enemy; his rule
being, tell nothing of another, that thou would not have told him.

He would come to free Entertainments, and to costly ones; to hospitable, but
provident Tables, where that was thought too much for him, that was too much
for his friends estate, saying, he is not a friend that expects more than a man
is able, and he is not his own friend that does less; do all like your selves,
so that you weaken not your self, nor your estate.

Company, he said, like Climates altered With the ^roward thou shall learn
frowardness.
complexions; It is hard for a good man not to be the worse for bad company,
and for bad company to be the better for a good man.

The poor were sure of relief in his Vestry or House, since it was his common
saying, that we cannot with comfort call upon God for our daily Bread, if we
denied his poor, that called upon us for our daily Crumbs.

He had in every Sermon, something that suited every condition from the highest
to the lowest, and in every Prayer, something that suited with every want; his
arrows hit where he did not aim, as the Bell clinketh to the foolish as he
thinks; so a Sermon sounds to a man's ear according to his heart.

THE Life and Death OF Dr. THOMAS WESTFIELD, Bishop of Bristol.
MOurnful Jeremy of Great Saint Bartholomews, and the powerful Boanerges of
Lumbard-street, were loving in their lives, and in their death were not
divided; the thunder of the one is aptly followed by the showers and tears of
the other, who would melt those hearts the other broke. Dr. Westfield (our
Gildas, both the Wife and the Querulous, though as he no murmurer, no
complainer, impious against God, or uncharitable against Man, complaining
without cause, or without measure) but only inveighing against the sins, and
bemoaning the sufferings of his time; when he might call some that called
themselves Clergy, as Gildas did Montes malitiae; and the Britains too
generally, as the other does Atramentum saeculi. (...)
Whose Preaching, without a Parable, was mourning to his people; his lips and
eyes by a strange Metathesis changing their offices, these out-did the oratory
of those (for tears are very vocal) he in the Prophets phrase Ezekiel 20. 40.
dropping his words (though soft and silent, yet warm and melting ones) and his
doctrine (not in a Metaphor) distilling Deuteronomy. 32. 2.
like the Rain, and descending on his people like Dew, the Holy Spirit falling
on him like the Dove, innocent and mournful) was Native and Scholar Where
(...). Spite (a bad name of a good man) was his Master.
of St. Mary's in Ely, Scholar and Fellow of Jesus College in Cambridge, born
1573. when two Girls, Agnes Bridges about twenty years of age, and Rachel
Pinder about twelve, deceived many Ministers in London, and dying 1644. when
few young London Ministers were made use of to Impose upon the whole Nation.

He was taught under Dr. B^wl^ and Dr. Westfield, at M^^y le Bow in Cheapside.
Bishop Felton (who was happy in his assistants, two of them being preferred
Bishops, and more in his Chaplains, all of them reputed learned and religious
men) how to manage a Cure, before he enjoyed one, whence it was his usual
observation. That His observation of Curacies.
Curacies (which young men were so impatient of, though some men when elder
maintained them) were Nurseries, wherein young, raw, and unexperienced men,
that could not continue in the University under Learned Tutors and Governors,
might find an University in the Country under grave and sober Pastors, gaining
that stock of Learning and Experience in business, by the direction and example
of wisemen upon their Charges, which they might lay out upon their own: he
found happiness in this world as they that study the Philosophers-Stone,
without any desire to find it: he was neither stupidly ignorant of the Affairs
of the world, nor scornfully regardless of his concerns in it, but submissively
contented with Gods allotment aabout it. The French are said to have so
graceful a behavior, that all postures that they are in, and all attire that
they put on, becomes them; this good man became any condition, and every
condition became him, as if he had been born to that alone. Others affected a
more high way of talking than he (which he compared to a Kites high-flying in
the Air, that would yet vouchsafe to condescend to a Carrion upon the ground)
but he continued in a higher way of living than they; being happy in an humble
height whereby he did truly, what the Emperor is said Ironically to do, viz.
descendere in Coelum, he could not endure to hear men tell their friends what
others said ill of men behind their backs, it being all one as to go and tell
a man what is said of him when he is dead. Let your prayers (he would say) be
as frequent as your wants, His. Advice.
and your thanksgiving as your blessings, miss not the Confession and
Absolution in public, unless you have no sins to repent, or no care to be
forgiven them: Think not the worse of the Ordinance of God for the sins of the
Administrator; those that are ill themselves, may through Gods blessing (that
is not confined to the person, but to the thing) be Instruments of good to
others. It was our Saviors rule, Do as they say: the Stone shows the way
that cannot stir in it, and the Bell calls others to Church that hears not
it self. A sickly Physician may Cure, and a loose Divine may Save, acquaint
your selves rather with Gods Commandments than his Decrees, and conclude thy
Salvation rather from a diligent observing of Gods Revealed will, than a
curious search into his secret one.

When people pleaded Conscience for known sin, he would say, It was sad when
the greatest restraining from sin was the great pretense to it, and tell them
their Conscience was not their rule, but their guide, so far only can
Conscience justify our actions as it is its self justified by his word.

He was to the last, he said, contented to live, and yet desirous to dye; his
little saying he called it, was, let it be your first care to be good to your
selves, and your next, to make others so. Let it trouble you more to do a fault
than to hear of it, being more sorry that it is true, than that it is known;
never think to be free from censures, or faulty, while thy Neighbors and thy
self are but men.

He was the man that received no Opinion upon Credit, and vented none upon
Discontent, embracing Doctrines that might save, rather than fancies that might
raise him: Speaking what he thought, not what others (though good men, yet but
men) said; who, he said, should be his Copies no longer than they agreed with
the Original. The man that entertained whatever God sent thankfully, and did
whatever God commanded cheerfully, that spared no man's sins for the persons
sake, nor reflected on no man's person for his sins sake; That feared more to do
ill, than to suffer it: the Author of this rule, fear to do any thing against
that God whom thou love, and thou will not love to do any thing against that
God whom thou fear.

He did not easily entertain Friendship with a man without considerable
Acquaintance, nor easily part with a Friend he had entertained without a very
great fault: he would say that he must have no friend, that would have a friend
with no fault.

Every man, though his Adversary, was his Neighbor that needed him.

How much pleased was he to hear another commended! how much more, if he had
occasion to commend him himself: the first he would do without repining, and
the second without detracting.

He forgave many that he said he must reprove, because showing them their
fault, was instructing them in their duty; never loving a man the less for an
injury, though trusting him less, being thoroughly satisfied when the party was
thoroughly sorry. It was, he said, common to him with God to suffer injuries, to
exercise his patience, therefore it should be proper to him as it was to God to
forgive them, to exercise his Charity. In fine, a good man he was, without
noise; a provident man, without perplexity, merry without lightness, grave
without morosity, bountiful without waste.

These and many other his good virtues, recommended him first to Hornsey near
London, and his faithfulness and success there opened his way to St.
Bartholomews the Great in London, as his prudence and gravity did to the
Arch-Deaconry of S. Albans in Hertford-shire, and his worthy mannagement of
these inferior Places and Offices, purchased to him the good degree of a
Bishopric, and that at Bristol, which was offered him Anno 1616. to maintain
him, and then refused by him; because, he said, he wanted not subsistence: and
again 1641. that he might maintain it, and then accepted, because Episcopacy
wanted such a devout and well-reputed man to support it. For when his Majesty
was resolved to choose his new Bishops 1641. out of the most sound for
judgment, and unblameable for conversation, the Learned Dr. Prideaux Kings
Professor of Divinity at Oxford, for the good repute, his painful and learned
Lectures procured him at home and abroad, was made Bishop of Worcester; Dr.
Winniffe Dean of St. Paul's, for his Gravity, Learning and Moderation, Bishop of
Lincoln; Dr. Brownrigge Master of Catherine Hall, for quick and solid parts in
Disputing and Preaching, Bishop of Exeter; Dr. King Archdeacon of Colchester
for his general accomplishments as an obliging Gentleman, a great Scholar, a
devout Christian, an incomparable Preacher, a Generous, Liberal, and Hospitable
Clergyman, the pious and popular Son of a pious and popular Father, Doctor
John King Bishop of London.

Dr. John Westfield for many years the painful and profitable Preacher of Great
St. Bartholomews London, Bishop of Bristol: Surely, to use the words of the
Historians, Si urbi defensa ^uisset, his dextris, if Divine Providence had
appointed that Episcopacy should have stood at that time, more probable persons
could not have been picked out of England, envy and malice might feed upon
their own flesh, their teeth finding nothing in the foresaid elects to fasten
upon. But Episcopacy was so far from faring the better for them, that they
fared the worse for it; Insomuch that many who loved them much in their Gowns,
did not at all like them in their Rockets. Nothing was thought too much for him
by the Earl of Holland, and other Persons of Quality before the troubles, and
nothing too little since: To disturb his Devotion they removed and burnt the
Rails he had set about the Lords-Table: to interrupt his quiet, they made him
sue for his right, who had for many years not known what it was to ask it; they
who were glad formerly to converse with him in their Houses, would not have
Communion with him at Church; and he whose tears and natural persuasive
faculty, (for Bishop King said he was born an Orator) was reckoned powerful and
heart searching preaching, was neglected as the formal man of the dead Letter.

He preached the first Latin Sermon at the Erection of Sion College upon this
Text, Benedic Sioni Domine: and the last English Sermon at a Visitation upon
this Text, For Sions sake I will not hold my peace; he used often the story of
Mr. Dods being strangely moved at midnight without any reason in the world to
visit a Neighbor, to whom when he said he was come, but knew not why, the
Neighbor answered; You know not why you came, but God does that sent you; for I
was but just now under a temptation to make away my self; and he applied it
thus, that he would never go to visit any out of Complement but Conscience,
looking up to God that he might bless his presence in the Family whether he
went to rebuke the temptations any of the people thereof might lie under. As he
made not that wearisom which should be welcome by the tediousness of his
Sermons, never standing above his Glass (which he said was Mr. Robert Boltons
way) nor keeping a Glass unless upon an extraordinary occasion above a quarter
of an hour, so he made not that common which should be precious by the
courseness, or cursoriness of them; he never offered God or his people what
cost him nothing, being (unless surprised to an extempore performance, for
which he desires to be rather excused than commended) of Demosthenes his mind,
who never spoke what he had not studied, being wont to say, That he showed how
he honored and reverenced the people of Athens, because he was careful what he
spoke to them; desiring to admire rather than imitate them who made preaching
their nature, and could discourse Sermons. It cost him as much pains to set his
own Sermon on his heart (that he might speak to the hearts of the people) as it
did to get them into his head: he that speaks from his belly (called Ventri
loquus) seems to be another at further distance which whispers; and when a man
speaks from the heart, the speech seems to come from one at distance, and
that is God.

He kept up all Ordinances, Prayers, Sermons, and Sacraments in equal esteem,
as Scipio in a Controversy between two who should have the s^aling Crown due
to him that first climbed the walls, gives it to them both, knowing that they
both got up the wall together.

Especially taking care of Catechizing (priding him self as much as Luther did
in this Character, Discipulus Catechismi) that men studying the dark corners of
Divinity, might not lose themselves in the beaten Road of it; looking upon
Catechizing as the way of settling Religion at first, and maintaining it still.

Our Savior is observed not to preach against Idolatry, Usury, Sabbath^
breaking, among the Jews, because not so dangerous in an age wherein, says
one, Iniquity was spun with a finer thread: but against spiritual pride and
hypocrisy; this his Servant connived not at Debauchery, the confessed,
bewailed, and lamented sins of one part of the Nation, but was very severe
against Sacrilege, Disobedience, Curiosity, and Hypocrisy, the maintained
sins of the other: Men's Consciences, he said, flew in their faces for the one,
and would reform them, but their Consciences were made parties for the other,
and would harden them. Those sins he said were to be preached against, that
were grown into so much reputation as to be preached for: He looked upon it as
equally impertinent to confute an old Heresy which time had confuted, and to
spend time in reproving those sins which every ones heart reproved him for. He
read much, but orderly (drawing up his notions as the King of Sweden used to do
his men, not above six deep, because he would not have them lie in useless
Clusters, but so that every particular might be drawn into Service;) but
meditated more, dispiriting his Books into himself. He was glad to go from
London to Bristol to avoid the tumults, but he was gladder to be translated
from Bristol to Heaven, quite heart-broken with the Rebellion.

He never, though almost fifty years a Preacher, went up a Pulpit, but as
Luther said, he trembled; such an aw and reverence of God was upon his heart:
he preached but once before the King at Oxford, and he fainted; so great his
modesty before men, that gracious Prince (under whom it was encouragement
enough to be a good Divine) speaking to the people to pray for him, for he
said, It might be any man's Case, and wishing him to retire, saying, he was a
good man, and he would with patience wait for him, as he did, until the good
Bishop being a little refreshed, came up again and preached the best Sermon,
and the last that ever he made. What good opinion the Parliament, as it was
called, had of him, though not over-fond of Bishops, appears by the ensuing
Order, which with the following particulars are transcribed from his Daughter
Elizabeth's Mouth and Papers.

The Thirteenth of May 1643. from the Committee of Lords and Commons for
Sequestration of Delinquents Estates.
Upon Information in behalf of the Bishop of Bristol, that his Tenants refuse
to pay him his Rents, It is ordered by the Committee that all Profits of his
Bishopric be restored to him, and a safe Conduct be granted him to pass with
his Family to Bristol, being himself of great age, and a person of great
Learning and Merit.

About the midst of his Life he had a terrible Sickness, so that he thought (to
use his own expression in his Diary) that God would put out the Candle of his
life, though he was pleased only to snuff it. By his Will, (the true Copy
whereof I have) he desired to be buried in his Cathedral Church, near the Tomb
of Paul Bush, the first Bishop thereof; and as for my worldly Goods, (Reader,
they are his own words in his Will) which (as the times now are) I know not
well where they be, nor what they are; I give and bequeath them all to my dear
Wife Elizabeth, etc. he protested himself on his deathbed a true Protestant of
the Church of England, and dying Iunii 28. 1644. lies buried, according to his
own desire abovementioned, with this Inscription.

Hic jacet Thomas Westfield, S. T. D. Junii, Anno M D C X L I I.

Thus leaving such as survived him to see more sorrow, and feel more misery, he
was seasonably taken away from the evil to come, and according to the Anagram
made on him by his Daughter, Thomas Westfield,I Dwell the most safe.

Enjoying all happiness, and possessing the reward of his pains, who converted
many, and confirmed more by his constancy in his Calling.

THE Life and Death OF The Right Honorable, ROBERT Earl of LINDSEY.
I Find in the Observations upon the Statesmen and Favorites of England, this
honorable person thus consecrated to Immortality.

He and his whole Family (I know not whether more pious, or more valiant;
whether more renowned abroad as Confessors for their Religion, or at home as
Champions for their Country) have been in this last Age an Ornament or Defense
to the Crown, equally reverenced by the Subjects of it, and honored by the
Sovereigns.

This honorable Lords Ancestors were Richard ^ir^ue, and Katherine Ducthess of
Suffolk, so eminently known for their patience and constancy in suffering for
Religion in Q. Mary's days in the Palatinate: His Father was Peregrine Bertu^
in his Mothers right Lord Willough^y of Fres^y, so famous for his valor,
success, and conduct in acting for Religion in Queen Elizabeth's time, when
Commander in Chief, 1. Of the second Army of five, that the Queen sent to aid
the French King. 2. Of the third, fourth and fifth Brigade, she bestowed on the
assistance of the Dutch; and of the Garrison she entrusted with the keeping of
Berwick, and the Borders. The stout Soldier, that brooking not the assiduity
and obs^quiousness of the Court, was wont to say, That he was none of the
Reptilia, which could creep on the ground; and that a Court became a Soldier
of good skill, and a great spirit, as a Bed of Down would one of the Tower
^yons. That undaunted man, who when an insulting challenge surprised him, a Bed
of the Gout, returned this answer, That although he was lame of his Hands and
Feet, yet he would meet him with a piece of a Rapier in his Teeth: That Hero,
who taking a choice Gennet managed for the war, and intended a Present to the
King of Spain, and being importuned by the Spanish General to return it, with
an overture of his own choice, whether a 1000 l. down, or 100 l. a year during
his life for it? made this magnanimous answer, That if it had been a Commander,
he would have freely sent it back; but being an Horse, he loved him as well as
the King of Spain, and would keep him.

That useful man, to whom the Queen her self writ this Letter with her own hand.

Good Peregrine,
WE are not a little glad that by your Journey, you have received such good
fruit of amendment; especially, when we consider how great a vexation it is to
a mind devoted to Actions and Honor, to be restrained by any indisposition of
body, from following those courses which to your own reputation, and our great
satisfaction, you have formerly performed.

And therefore, as we must now (out of our desire of your welldoing) chiefly
enjoin you to an especial care, to increase and continue your health, which
must give life to all your best endeavors; so we must next as seriously
recommend to you this consideration, That in these times, when there is such
appearance, that we shall have the trial of our best and noble Subjects, you
seem not to affect the satisfaction of your own private Contentation, beyond
the attending on that which nature and duty challenges from all persons of
your quality and profession. For if necessarily (your health of body being
recovered) you should Elloigne your self by residence there from those
employments, whereof we shall have too good store; you shall not so much amend
the state of your body, as happily you shall call in question the reputation of
your mind and judgment; even in the opinion of those that love you, and are
best acquainted with your disposition and discretion.

Interpret this our plainness, we pray you, to our extraordinary Estimation of
you; for it is not common with us to deal so freely with many; and believe that
you shall ever find us both ready and willing in all occasions to yield you
the fruits of that interest, which your endeavors have purchased for you in our
opinion and estimation; not doubting, but when you have with moderation made
trial of the success of these your sundry Peregrinations, you will find as
great comfort to spend your days at home, as heretofore you have done. Of which
we do wish you full measure, howsoever you shall have cause of abode or return.

Given under our Signet, at our Manor of Nonsuch the 7. of October 1594. in the
37 th year of our Reign.

Your most loving Sovereign, E. R.


Heir our Nobleman was to his Fathers spirit, as well as honor, being none of
those degenerate Noblemen, that are like their Fathers Tombs, rather than
their Offspring, carved over outwardly with honorable Titles, and empty within
of any thing but dirt and corruption; but the happiest of all the four Actors
on the Stage of Honor, viz. the Beginners, the Advancers, the Continue^^, and
the Ruinors; raising his House, illustrious already, to an higher sphere among
the Stars of the first magnitude, and keeping the noble stream of his blood as
far from its fall, as he found it from its fountain.

He was born December 16. 1572. at London, the great Father, like Paulus
Aemilius, being amazed with three glad tidings at a time; the Taking of
Bellesont by his Regiment, the Routing of the Duke of Guise his Guards by his
Brigades, and the Birth of his sprightly Son by his Wife.

Queen Elizabeth would needs be God-mother to the Young General, as she called
him, and the Earls of Essex, and Leicester Godfathers, Christening him Robert,
(a name she observed happy in Soldiers and Statesmen, as D^^ H^ylin ob^^rveth
that H^^^^ been a ^^al Letter (...) England.
Henry was in Kings; John in Divines, Edward in Lawyers, Elizabeth in Queens,
William in Physicians, Edward and Francis in Scholars and Politicians) and H^^
inclin^tion.
injoyning a trial of his temper, as Pharaoh did that of Moses, before
discretion might be dissembled, when he discovered more inclination to the
Armor than to the Gown, being manly in his very Gugaws and Rattles; and almost
with Scanderbeg, calling the very first word he spoke for a Sword; and being
once by Sir W. Raleigh offered the same choice that Achilles was by Ulysses,
that is, the softer Fairings of Pictures, little Books, etc. and those more
severe, of little Swords, Pistols, he betrayed an Earls manhood by his choice
of the latter, laying hold the first thing when Gentlemen came to the House,
upon their Sword and Dagger.

But since (as he would say) he was followed by a Set of Masters that disposed
of all his hours at home, His Education.
and an excellent Tutor that managed his time in the University; and since the
humor of the three Sovereigns he lived under (and the temper of the Prince is a
great rule for the accomplishments of the Nobility) was knowing and learned,
Queen Elizabeth for soft and smooth Poetry, Oratory, and History; King James
for Various, Judicious, and indeed general Skill; and King Charles for all
Useful, Weighty, and Accurate Knowledge, he was forced to look into his Books.
He chose the more manly part of Learning, as History, to furnish his experience
with the wisdom of age, without its wrinkles or infirmities; Mathematics, to
regulate his conduct; Heraldry, to understand his own and others interests; and
Geography, to guide his Marches, Assaults, Battalias, etc. Physic, to
understand his own body; Law, to keep his Neighbors quiet; Religion, to
accommodate his Meditations; Divinity, said Richlieu, is the only stay of
retired thoughts, and more pleasant and various studies for discourse; blessing
God usually for these benefits of his Education, viz. 1. That he understood the
worth of his nature. Thirteen ben^fits of a good Education.
2. That he was taught the design of the world, and time of Gods continuing and
governing both. 3. That he had considered the best and the worst examples, with
the successes of both. 4. That he had learned the consequence, both of a
peaceable and a disturbed conscience. 5. That he had looked beyond the frailty
of life, and fixed to solid rules, made up of integrity and honor. 6. That he
had been inured to govern his desires within the limits of his capacity and
modesty, and so to be Master of an equal, and an even spirit. 7. That he had
attained an habit of Jealousy (which put him upon the examination of the end,
bottom, ground, and circumstamces of all affairs that came before him) that is,
indeed of prudence. 8. That he had freed himself from the observances,
opinions, and customs, that prevailed with mankind, in order to the more
vigorous prosecution of the noble design, and scope, which, 10. he had proposed
to himself. 11. That he resolved to dispose of time past, to reflection and
observation; time present, to duty; and time to come, to providence. 12. That
he could rest in no pleasure or enjoyment that was superficial. 13. That
according to the Arabic Proverb in Drusius, he could be so wise as to give
every thing its due estimation.

Much of his accomplishments he owed to his Fathers well-disciplined House,
more to the strict University, more than that, to a sober and manly Court; more
yet, to his four years Travels; and most of all, to his undertakings in the Low
Countries; where His ^^rriage (...).
his entertainments were free and noble, his carriage toward Officers and
Soldiers obliging, especially those of his own Country; his Engagements in
every Action and Council remarkable, his Designs on the Enemy restless, and his
Assaults forward, being with the first generally at a Breach or Pass; thrice
Unhorsed, but never daunted before At that battle whereof 1500. English under
Sir. Hor. and Sir F. Vere, every man was hurt.
Newport. His courage growing from his dangers, seldom using a Bed abroad, and
having little use of it (as sleeping but four hours a night usually) at home;
hardening thereby his body, and knitting his soul.

The first Expedition wherein he appeared, was in the Company of the Earls of
Essex and Nottingham to Cales, where his great spirit was so impatient of
delay, that when it was Voted they should set upon the Town and Ships, he and
the Earl of Essex threw up their Caps, and were so forward, that he was
Knighted in the Marketplace; where he said, An old Woman with a Stone knocked
down the Esquire, and the General commanded him to rise a Knight.

His next adventure was with Sir Thomas Vere to Brill, where he bestowed his
time in observing the exact way of modern and regular Fortification.

His third Expedition was (with Gilbert Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury, then
Ambassador) to make observation upon the Renowned French King, H. 4. and his
Court (the safest and most useful traveling, is in an Ambassadors Company, and
the best places to travel in is Holland, to see all the world, and France to
see any part of it.) Whence he stepped to see the siege of Amiens so honorably
managed by Sir John Baskervile, and Sir Arthur Savage.

His fourth sally was (after a Voyage with the Earl of Cumberland, to take the
Spanish C^rickes at Porto Rico) with the Northern Ambassadors, the Lord Zouch
and Dr. Perkins, to view the strength, Interest, and Alliance of the Danes,
Swedes, Muscovians, etc. and upon his return, a short journey after the Earl of
Essex, to see the obstructions to, and the benefits of the Conquest of Ireland.

And the last Voyage under Queen Elizabeth, was with his Countrymen Sir
Richard Leveson, and Sir William Mounson, to take the great Caricke worth
1000000 Crowns, in the very ^ight of the Spanish ^leet, and under their Castle,
to the great loss of the Spaniard, but the infinite advantage of the English,
who were looked upon now as a people to be feared, not to be invaded; thus
diverting the power of Spain, that ever and anon threatened us, to defend its
self.

Upon King James his arrival, he took a private journey to view the Interests,
Rarities, Politics, Magnificences, and the Designs of Italy, to prepare
himself with the more advantage to wait on the Earl of Nottingham, in the
splendid Ambassie to the slow and reserved Court of Spain, whence after a view
of the famous siege of Ost^nd^ he returned to be one of the Knights of the Bath
at the Installation of Charles Duke of York, afterward King of England.

And so during the peaceable Reign of King James, the accomplished Lord settled
in Lincolnshire, attended as was occasion, 1. The Parliament with very useful
suggestions in the three points he spoke most to, viz. Plantations, Trade, the
Draining of the Fens^ with other Improvements of our Country and Commodities.
2. The Court upon Solemn times with a grave and exemplary aspect and presence.
3. The Courts of Justice, reckoning the meanest service of Justice (not too low
for his Lordship, which was high enough for a King) in his Country with tried
Arts of Government, severe proceedings against Idleness and dissoluteness;
several ways to employ and enrich his Neighbors, and wholesome orders for the
execution of Laws. And 4. appearing at home, sometime at half-light, sometimes
like himself, as Affairs required; improving his Estate as formerly, by saving
expenses, and gaining experience in travel. So now by Rich Matches, equally
advancing his Revenue and Honor. 2. By thrifty management. 3. Noble Traffic,
he having learned at Florence and Venice, that Merchandise is consistent with
Nobility, and that the Stamel die is no stain to the Scarlet Robe: and a due
improvement of his Estate, with due encouragement to his Tenants, whose
thriving was his security as well as honor, and tender regard of his Neighbors;
disdaining as much to offer an injury to those beneath him, as he did to
receive one from those above him.

Such his tenderness of the poor that thronged about his doors, as if his house
had been then, what it was formerly, an Hospital, the Neighbor Gentry
complaining of him merrily, as Queen Elizabeth did of F. Russel, the second
Earl of Bedford, That he made all the beggars: Such the exactness of his pay
and word to all he dealt with, On mine Honor, was the best assurance from him
in the world. Such the good Government and civility of his Family, a College
rather than a Palace, where the Neighborhood were bred, rather than hired; and
taught to command themselves, by serving him.

So great his care against Enclosures: Whereas no grass grows where the Grand
Seigniors horse sets his foot, so nothing but grass grows, where some, rather
great than good men set their evil, but powerful eyes: His Housekeeping so
noble, having his fish (especially Pikes, of which he would say (it being the
Water-Tyrant that destroyed more fish than it was worth) that it was the
costliest dish at his Table, a dish of more State than Profit) his
Lincoln^shire being the A^^^y of England.
Fowl, his Beef, Mutton, Venison, and Corn of his own.

So happy his way of ending Controversies among his Neighbors, and consequently
so many ways did he serve, support, and sweeten the Government, that he was
created Earl of The third part of Lincolnshire.
Lindsey 1626. and after the ill success of the Lord Wimbledon, and the Earl of
Essex, and the Duke of Buckingham, as a man reserved for hazzards and
extremities, he (when all men stood amazed, expecting upon what great Person
the Dukes Command at Sea should be conferred) was pitched upon, as Commander in
Chief of the Fleet: (making up in Gallantry, Courage and Experience, what he
wanted in Presence; his contracted worth was the more vigorous, little
Load-stones do in proportion draw a greater quantity of Steel, than those that
be far greater, because their Poles are nearer together, and their virtue more
united) toward which place Sept. 8. 1628. from Portsmouth, arriving at the Bar
of the Haven, with reasonable speed of Wind and Weather, which though fortified
by Cardinal Richlieu's monstrous Boomes, Chains, and Barracado's, exceeding all
Narration and History, he bravely attempted passing the Outworks and Bulwarks,
to the very mouth of the Haven, until a cross-winde returned them foul one
upon another, from which great dangers and greater service, he brought off the
Fleet with a retreat as honorable as Conquest, that the effect of Conduct and
Prudence, and this of Fortune.

1630. He was admitted of the most Noble Order of the Garter, and one of his
Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council, and in right of his Ancient Family,
Lord High Chamberlain of England.

1631. Upon the Trial of a Combat between Donald Rey, and David Ramsey, he was
constituted Lord High-Constable of England for the day.

1635. He is Commander in Chief of forty sail, assisted by the Vice Admiral,
the Earl of Essex, to secure the Kingdoms Interest, Trade, and Honor in the
narrow Seas, against all Pirates and Pretenders that either Invaded our Rights

Pen, or might incroach upon them with the Sword.

And in the years 1637, 1638, 1639, 1640, 1641. when he had looked through the
whole Plot of the Conspirators on the one hand, and comprehended the gracious
Overtures and design of his Majesty on the other; when the Expedients he
offered were neglected, the warnings he gave of the consequence of such
proceedings slighted, the earnest Arguments he urged publicly and privately
were not regarded, and all the Interest and Obligation he had in the
Conspirators forgotten; withdrew after his Majesty, that he might not seem to
countenance those courses by his presence, which he could not hinder, being not
able to stop the Current of the ^umults, he was resolved not to seem to approve
it: but followed his Royal Master to York to enjoy the freedom of his
Conscience; where we find him among other Noble Persons attesting under their
hands his Majesty's averseness to War, as long as there was any hope of Peace;
and when neither He, nor any of his Loyal Subjects, when neither Law nor
Religion, neither Church nor State could be secured from the highest violations
and prophanations men could offer, or Christians endure without a War, and the
King not having his Sword in vain, but drawing it for a terror to evil doers,
and an encouragement to them that did well: He, and his Son the Lord Willoughby
of Eresby, afterward Earl of Lindsey, first joined with the rest of the
Nobility in a Protestation of their resolution, according to their Duty and
Allegiance, to stand by his Majesty in the maintenance of the Established Laws
and Religion with their Lives and Fortunes, and accordingly raised the
Countries of Lincoln, Nottingham, etc. as his retainers in love and observance,
to whom the holding up of his hand was the displaying of a Banner, as other
Honorable and Loyal Persons did other parts of England, until his Majesty with
an incredible diligence and prudence up and down the Kingdom, discovered to the
deluded people his own worth; deserving not only their reverence, but also
their Lives and Fortunes; encouraging the good with his discourses, exciting
the fearful by his example, concealing the Imper^ections of his Friends, but
always praising their virtues, and prevailing upon all, not too guilty or too
much debauched, so far as to raise an Army that amazed his Enemies (who had
represented him such a Prodigy of Folly and Vice, that they could not imagine
any person of Prudence or Conscience would appear in his service, expecting
every day when deserted by all as a Monster, he should in Chains deliver
himself up to the Commands of the Parliament) and surprised even his Friends,
who despaired that ever he should be able to defend their Estates, Lives, or
Liberties by a War, who to make his people happy (if they had not despised
their own mercies) had (by passing Acts against his own Power to Impress
Soldiers, his right in Tonnage and Poundage, the Stannary Courts, Clerk of the
Market, the Presidial Court in the North, and Marches of Wales) deprived
himself of means to manage, viz. of a Revenue, without which no Discipline in
an Army, as without Discipline no Victory by it; and who esteemed it an equal
misery to expose his people to a War, and himself to ruin.

Yet an Army, by the large Contributions and extraordinary endeavors of this
Noble Lord, and other Honorable persons, to be be mentioned in due time, which
being under several, who could abide no Equal, as none of them could endure a
Superior; having no Chief, or indeed being all Chiefs, the Swarm wanted a
Master-(...), a Supreme Commander, who should awe them all into obedience. It
was observed by Livy, that in the great Battle (the Cri^^cal day of the worlds
Empire) betwixt Hannibal and Scipio, that the Shouts of Hannibals Army was
weak, the voices disagreeing, as consisting of diverse I ang^ages; and the
shouting of the Romans far more terrible, as being all as one voice.

When they, who agreed in few other particulars, conspired in this, that the
Earl of Lindsey pitched upon as Lord General of the Army by his Majesty, was an
expedient worthy the choice, and prudence of a Prince, to command and train a
fresh Army, to credit and satisfy a suspecting people, when they saw the Kings
Cause managed by persons of such Integrity, Popularity, and Honor, as they
could trust their own with.

In which Command, his first service was the drawing up of Articles for
Discipline to be observed by the Army, wherein he took care,

1. Of Piety, as the true ground of Prowess.

2. Of Chasti^y, remembering how Zisca entangled his enem is by commanding so
many thousand Women, to cast their Ke^cheifs and Partlets on the ground,
wherein the other Army were caught by the Spurs, and ens^ared: Little hopes
that they will play the Men, who are overcome by Women.

3. Civility, that he might win the Country, in order to the reducing of the
Faction; it being sad to raise more enemies by boisterousness in their Marches
and Quarters, than they engaged by their Valor in the Field, so increasing
daily the many^ headed Hydra.

4. Sobriety, without which, he said, the Engagement would prove a Revel, and
not a War; and besides the scandal, render the best Army unfit, either for
Council or Action, and incapable of meeting with a sober enemies active
designs, much less of carrying on any of their own; so loosing the great
advantages of war, as G. Adolphus called them, Surprises.

Next the Discipline of the Army, he took care of their numbers (a great Army
being not easily manageable, and the Commands of the General cool and loose
some virtue, in passing so long a journey through so many,) and next, that of
their suitableness and agreeableness one with another; and after that, of their
order, that they might help one another as an Army, rather than hinder one
another as a Crowd; and then their Provision and Pay, that they might not range
for Necessaries, when they should fight for Victory. Thirty thousand men, as
brave Gonzaga said, thus disciplined, and thus accommodated, are the best Army,
as being as good as a Feast, and far better than a Surfeit.

In the Head of this Army a foot, with a Pike in his Hand (having trained up
his Soldiers by Skirmishes, before he brought them to Battle) he appeared at
Edgehill, October. 23. 1642. too prodigal of his Person, which was not only to
fill one Place, but to inspire and guide the whole Army. But that it is a
Maxim of the Duke of Roan, That never great person performed great
undertaking, but by making war in person; nor failed, but by doing it by his
Lieutenants: Here rather oppressed with number, than conquered by prowess,
opposing his single Regiment to a whole Brigade, and his Person to a whole
Company, after eighteen wounds, passages enough to let out any soul out of a
body above sixty, but that great one of the Earl of Lindsey, he was forced to
yield himself, first to the numerous Enemies about him, and next day, being
hardly used, to the Enemy, Death; his Side winning the day, and loosing the Sun
that made it.

Upon Edgehill the Noble Lindsey did,
Whilst Victory lay bleeding by his side.
At Edgehill that was true of him and his Countrymen, the Loyal Gentry of
Lincolnshire, that was observed of Cataline and his followers. That they
covered the same place with their Corpse when dead; where they stood in the
Fight, whilst living.

This was the Noble Lord, that pursued twelve French Vessels, in his own single
one, to their Haven, heated at once with anger and shame. He of whom it is
said, that when the Duke of Buckingham returning from the Isle of ^hee, was
told by his Majesty, That the neglect of his Releif, must lodge on his friend,
and confident Holland. He acknowledged, That indeed he had very affectionately
entrusted him in ordinary affairs, but never had him in such an esteem, as to
second him in arms, that place being more proper for my Lord of Lindsey; whose
judgment of that expedition was, that it was Friendship in Earnest, and War in
Jest.

He, who when all men were amazed at the Dukes fall, was assigned his
successor: And certainly, says one there present, he was a man of no likely
Presence, but of considerable experience by his former Expeditions; and one
that to the last of his life made good his Faith with gallantry and courage,
notwithstanding his ill success (the times fate rather than his.

THE Life and Death Of the Right Honorable, MOUNTAGUE, Earl of LINDSEY, Son and
and Heir of ROBERT, Earl of LINDSEY.
LOve is as strong as Death, both when it descends, as it was in the Duke of
Chastillions Case, who ventured his own life through twenty thousand men to
rescue his Son; and this noble Lord, who observing his great Father, like to be
lost in a Crowd, rather than an Army, took with him not so many as he desired,
but so many as he could find about him, either to rescue the noble Lord, or to
perish with him; made an attempt worthy his Relation and Cause, through three
thousand men, wherein, when he could not save his dear Father, he was taken
with him, and after his death so valued by his Majesty, that he sent a Trumpet
immediately to exchange him for the Lord Saint-Iohns, Earl of Bullingbrook; and
so esteemed on by the enemy, O^e ^^ssage ^onte^ni^g him (...) very ^ema^k^ble,
viz^ That a (...) being maintained by ^is S^que^tred Lo^d, and upon some
t^ouble of conscience, off^^ing (...) what he had ^^^ten by it; had this
answer, That if he was so conscious as to make restitu^^^ o^, he would be so
^oble as to give it h^^, being as willing to maintain a good work, as th^se
that Seque^^red him.
that they would not part with him for all their Prisoners taken by his
Majesty; so true was that observation of his Majesty, That he ^ought Gold to
Dirt.

His education happy, as he used to observe himself, in six things

1. The example of a wise and good Father.

2. The Learning and Experience of discreet and knowing Tutors, whom he
mentioned with no less honor than Aristotle was remembered by Alexander, who
equalled him that gave him Education, with his Father that gave him Being; or
his Master, by Augustus, who gave him so honorable an Interment; or his Tutor,
by M. Antonius, who erected him a Statue; or Ausonius, by Gratian, who made him
Consul.

3. Travel and Observation, which fixed those notions in his mind, that lay so
loose in others.

4. Hardship and Patience, to which he was used in a way of choice, when he
traveled abroad; that he might use it in a way of necessity, if there were
occasion at home.

5. Good and useful Company, generally above, seldom beneath himself; knowing
that gold in the same Pocket with silver, loses both of its color and weight.

6. An Inquisitive Nature, not contented with the superficial and narrow
notions others acquiesced in, from Tradition and Authors, but with a large
soul, enquiring after such an account of things, as was derived immediately and
genuinely from the nature of the things themselves. Happy in observing that
rule (...) remember to distrust, and wishing heartily for a systeme of
principles, gathered by observation and experience upon the systeme of nature.

The result of these and other advantages, was a competent skill in Arts
(especially Philosophy, Mathematics, Physic, and the two parts belonging to
it, Surgery and Botanism; or a great skill and insight in Herbs and Flowers)
and Arms; this accomplishing him for public Service, and the other being the
satisfaction and ornament of his private Life; the one being gained by
experience in the Low Country Wars, where he learned in the time of our peace,
what rendered him serviceable in the time of our war; the other by severe study,
weighing observations and good discourse.

His converse gave the world a singular pattern of harmless and inoffensive
mirth, of a nobleness, not made up of fine Clothes and Courtship; a sweetness
and familiarity, that at once gained love, and preserved respect; a grandeur
and nobility safe in its own worth, not needing to maintain it self by a
jealous and morose distance; the confirmed goodness of his youth, not only
guarding his mind from the temptation to vice, but securing his same too from
the very suspicion of it. So out-stripping in wisdom, temperance, and
fortitude, not only what others did, but even what they wrote, being as good in
reality as in pretense; to which he added this unusual glory, that since there
was but a small partition between the Kings of Iuda's beds and the Altar,
through which, they said, David had a secret passage; arguing the nearness
there should be between Religion and Honor, and that the Cross was an ornament
to the Crown, and much more to the Coronet; he satisfied not himself with the
bare exercise of Virtue, but he sublimated it, and made it Grace.

As he understood himself well, so he did his Estate, being taught to manage it
before he enjoyed it; being none of those soft Noblemen, who if they were, as
one was by his Father, to tell all the money they spent, would as he did
retrench their expenses, that they might save themselves a labor.

Good Husbandry, as Bishop Andrews said, was good Divinity, and as this
Nobleman practiced it, good Nobility. Improving his Estate to double the value
of that on the other side the Hedge of it, saying, Those were not times for
Noblemen to impoverish themselves, that they might enrich their Tenants.
Foreseeing greater occasions for his Estate, than the superfluity of
Hospitality, or the vanity of many Followers, viz. the supplying of his Prince,
the relieving of worthy fellow Subjects, and an honorable provision for the
several very hopeful branches of his numerous Family. He raised his Rents, as
plenty of money in the kingdom raised Commodities, knowing that the humor of
letting Rents stand still, as our Forefathers left them, was but the ready way
to be cast behind in the Estate we have, whilst all things we buy go on in
price; his Rents quickened, but did not gall his Tenants, his Enclosures without
depopulation; which he detested were injurious to none, (the poor having
considerable allotments for their common-age, and the free and Lease-holders a
proportionable share in the Enclosures) beneficial to many. (The Monarch of one
Acre which he may mould to his own convenience, being likely to make more
profit of it, than if he had a share in forty) and consequently useful for the
Commonwealth.

And as much prudence we observe in his Education of his Relation, as we did in
the managing of his Estate, all of them like the Ottoman Emperors, being bred
to employments that may save, if not improve their Estates and honor. It is a
sad story which one tells, viz. That when he was beyond Sea, and in a part of
France adjoining to Artoise, he was invited often to the House of a noble
Personage, who was both a great Soldier and an excellent Scholar; and one day
above the rest, as we sat in an open and goodly Gallery at Dinner, a young
English Gentleman, who desirous to travel, had been in Italy and many other
places, happened to come to this house; and (not so well furnished with return
home as was fitting) desired entertainment into his service. My Lord, who could
speak as little English as my Countryman French, bad him welcome, and
demanded by me of him what he could do: For I keep none (said he) but such as
are commended for some good quality or other, and I give them good allowance;
some an hundred, some sixty, some fifty Crowns by the year: and calling some
about him (very Gentlemen like, as well in their behavior as Apparel; This
(said he) rides and breaks my great Horses, this is an excellent Lutinist, this
a good Painter and Surveyor of Land, this a passing Linguist and Scholar, who
instructs my Sons, etc. Sir, (quoth the young man) I am a Gentleman born, and
can only attend you in your Chamber, or wait upon your Lordship abroad. See
(quoth Mounsieur de Lignitor, so was his name) how your Gentry of England are
bred, that when they are, or want means, in a strange Country, they are
brought up neither to any quality to prefer them, nor have they so much as the
Latin Tongue to help themselves withal.

That worth he bred up his relations, to be loved and countenanced in all men,
being a great Patron of useful Learning and Ingenuity, that was either likely
to be serviceable to the State or Church; or honorable to the Persons that
owned it.

He was of opinion, that as some Physicians when they are posed with a mongrel
Disease, drive it on set purpose into a Fever, that so knowing the kind of
the Malady, they may the better apply the Cure; so it would not be amiss to let
the unreasonable discontents of men whom nothing would satisfy (all
concessions to the tumultuary being like drink in a great heat, and likely to
inflame the thirst it should quench, break into open Rebellion, hoping it more
feizable to quench the fire when it blazeth out, than when it smoked and
smoothered. Accordingly, when his sober advices would not be hearkened to in
Parliament, he with other young Noblemen, as Commissioners of Array, raised an
Army in the Northern Countries that might back them in the Field; but being
taken (as aforesaid) Oct. 23. 1642. at Edgehill, he was detained Prisoner till
Aug. 11. 1643. when he returned to his Majesty to Oxford, where he was
extraordinarily welcome, the rather, because he had made so good use of his
Imprisonment (like the Primitive Prisoners, converting his Goalers) that
several Lords and Gentlemen immediately followed him, being convinced by him,
that as long as they staid in London, they were in Chains as well as he.

At Oxford his Majesty liked his Proposals, as weighty and provident, both in
the Parliament there, whereof he was a Member, and the Council, whereof he was
a great part: all men approved his Expedients in order to an Accommodation,
having a great insight into the temper of those at London, and to the
particular ways at all times most likely to work with them. And none can be
ignorant of his dexterity in the several Commands he undertook at Newbury, and
Naseby, especially in both which places he discovered a great reach in
observing advantages, and a greater in decoying the Enemy into them; being the
steerage that day to Sir Jacob Ashleyes Courage and Resolution, with whom he
Commanded the Right Hand Reserve.

His prudence was as intent in reconciling the differences at Oxford in order,
the forming of an united strength against the Enemy, as Providence is in
accommodating the disagreements of the Elements into a body that makes up the
world.

But when it pleased God, that the King and his Friends should see that the
best Cause was to be rendered glorious by great Defeats and Misfortunes, rather
than by great Victories; and when the Kings Friends were divided in their
Counsels as well as in their Forces, wanting that Peace and Agreement, which is
the only Comfort, and Relief of the oppressed, and, which makes them
considerable, even when despoiled of Arms, by imputing (as it uses to be in
unhappy Councels) the Criminous part of their Misfortunes to one another.

When the Kings Overtures of Peace (that argued him equal to himself under all
the messages of ruins, from each corner of the Nation like the fall of the
dissolved world) though applauded by the people that desired only Peace and
Liberty, were neglected by the Faction, who aimed at Conquest and Usurpation,
and his Majesty was forced in a disguise (an ominous Cloud before the setting
of the Royal Sun) to engage his very Enemies by extraordinary Trust and
Confidence in them; His Lordship, with the Duke of Richmond, etc. yielded up
himself to the Army, which after a considerable Imprisonment, admitted him in
the years 46, 47, and 48, to Negotiate Overtures of Peace on each side, by his
great Moderation, Prudence, and Interest, and (when these proved unsuccesseful
with those, who as it is said of a French Rebel, had drawn their Swords against
their King, and so thrown away their Scabbards, being capable of no
accommodation, because not secure from the guilt of their former Crimes, but by
committing greater, to cut off those they had acted against, being guided by
this Maxim, We must kill those from whom in justice we can expect nothing but
Execution) to Composition, paying near 7000 l. at first, besides what was
af^ter (penalty upon penalty was the common false Heraldry of those upstart
oppressors) squeezed from him by Decimations, etc. and the constant restraint
as it were of his Person all the years, from 46, to 60, being but a great
Paroule of fourteen years; in which time how magnanimous was he in unwearied
Overtures of Concessions, Requests, Arguments, Conjurations, Threatenings,
particular and infinite Applications; and a ransom too for his dear Masters
Life; yea, offering even himself, as being one of the prime Ministers of the
Kings commands as an hostage for him, and if the Conspirators must needs be fed
with blood, to suffer in his stead, for whatever he had done amiss: and when
they chose rather to take away his Majesty's life, than beg their own; and the
most impetuous passion of Ambition having swallowed the hopes of Empire,
carried them headlong to remove his Majesty, that they might Inthrone
themselves. How piously did he and his, many pious relations that made his
place a Cloister, rescent the Parricide, and the consequents of it, giving up
themselves to the extrraordinary Devotions, in the despised and afflicted way
of the Church of England, communicating where ever they were, only with the
Members of that Church to the honor whereof, and of baffled piety, and virtue
its self, I cannot conceal, though I offend unpardonably against her modesty,
when I mention a The Lady Sophia, wise to Sir R. Chawo^seth.
Sister of his that composeth her soul more carefully by Gods word, than others
do their faces by their Glasses: Spends that time in praying (keeping
inviolably all the Primitive hours of Devotion) that is thrown away too
commonly in dressing, gaming, and complementing: and bestow her thoughtful and
serious Life between the strictest fasting (but one sparing Meal in thirty six
hours, and not so much upon extraordinary occasions) the most Liberal Alms both
to the sick, and to the needy, bountiful both in her Skill, and in her Charity;
Indefatigable reading serious discourses, and constant prayers.

How prudently did he supply his Majesty and his Friends, and by a discreet
Correspondence, when he could not reclaim; yet he moderated the extravagancies
of the times, which had over-turn'd all things past the remedy of a
Restoration, if the extreme violence of some men had not been seasonally
allayed and corrected by the sober Applications and Interests of others.
Heartily did he wish well to the least design and attempt for Loyalty and
Liberty: but wisely did he observe that unsuccessful practices against any
Government, settle it, the Bramble of usurpation as well as the Oak being more
fixed and rooted by being shaken. All Governments making use of real dangers,
and when they want them, of seigned ones, to improve their Revenues, and
increase their Guards. But it is not to be forgotten, that when he could not
prevail for the Life of his Sovereign, he with other Honorable Persons procured
Orders, and made provisions for, and gave attendance on his Funeral, reserving
himself by his wary proceedings in his Masters cause, for the fittest
opportunity of his service, being not all the time of the Usurpation actually
restrained from his pursuit of the Royal Cause, but once 1655. by Mannings
Treason, being sure, as he would say, That if none betrayed him on the other
side of the water, none should on this; when with the Lords, Maynard, Lucas,
Peter, Sir Ieffrey Palmer, Sir Richard Wingfield, etc. he was committed to the
Tower upon suspicion, and as it proved, but the bare suspicion of what they
called High Treason. In which course he persisted until it pleased God by
diverse Revolutions to open a way for the Lord General to settle the Nation in a
way most suitable to his own prudent and wary Rules, with whom he entered into a
very strict and entire Friendship, continuing through the correspondency of
their discreet and generous tempers to his death; the General advising with him
about his Majesty's Reception, and other Affairs of very great consequence, and
being admitted at the same time with him one of his Majesty's most Honorable
Privy Council, Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, etc. Commander of a Regiment
in the Army, till it was disbanded; one among many other Noblemen of the
Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer, for the Trial of the late Kings Murderers,
one of the most Honorable Order of the Garter, 16 April 1661. appearing at his
Majesty's Coronation one of the first subjects in England in capacity of Lord
High Chamberlain of England, and upon all other occasions in Court, Parliament,
and Country carrying himself as a wise man, an ancient Nobleman, as a good
Patriot, and a Loyal Subject till he dyed 1665. at Kensington, leaving this
Character behind him, that as the Red Rose, though outwardly not so fragrant,
yet is inwardly more Cordial than the Damask; so the most excellent Persons
virtues are more inwardly solid between God and their own souls, than outwardly
vaunting in the sight of men; he being as plain in his soul, as he was in his
garb, which he resolved should be proud of him, rather than he of it.

THE Lives and Deaths Of four Sufferers of The Honorable House of RICHMOND. I.
Of the Right Honorable, GEORGE Lord D'AUBIGNEY.
XErxes viewing his vast Army from an high place all at a sight, is said to
weep at the thought, that within an hundred years all those would be mowed down
with death. What man, having in one view the great number of brave Persons that
lost their Lives in this War, can refrain the mingling of his tears with their
blood? Certainly young State-reformers like young Physicians, should with the
first Fee for their practice, purchase a new Churchyard.

What Erasmus said of his Countrymen the Germans, that I may see of our party
the Cavaliers, Nobiles habent pro hominibus, that they had Noblemen, as thick
as the other party had men. Insomuch, that had the War lasted a little longer,
the Ladies of England must have been in the same condition with the Gentlewomen
in Champaigne in France, who some 350. years since were forced to marry Yeomen
or Farmers, because all the Nobility in that Coun^ yet were slain in the Wars,
in the two Voyages of King Lewis to Palestine: and thereupon ever since by
Custom and Privilege the Gentlewomen of Champaign and Brye, ennoble their
Husbands, and give them honor in marrying them, how mean so ever before. George
Lord Aubigney, younger Brother to the Duke of Richmond, born 1615. in London,
bred for the most part in France, owing his Education to that Country, whence
he had that he was bred for, his Honor, the Lordship of Aubigny, a Town and
Seigniory, adorned with many privileges, an ample territory, and a beautiful
Castle, in the Province of Berry in France; bestowed by Charles the sixth, on
Robert the second Son of Alan Stuart, Earl of Lenox in Scotland, for his many
signal Services against the English, and was till of late, and its hoped will
be the honorary title and possession of the second branch of that Noble and
Illustrious Family, hence called by the name of Lords of Aubigny.

A Person whose life was naught else but serious preparations for death, his
younger apprehensions, when living, being of the mature with the oldest men's
thoughts; when dying, well knowing that his extraction and conditions, should
be as little excuse from strict expectations of his latter end, ^s they could
be none from the summons to it; the Series of his li^^ carried with it such an
awe of God, and sense of true Piety and ^eligion, as clearly evinced he had
strong and habituated Meditations of that Levelling Day, wherein the highest
stands on the same ground with the meanest. Religion was not then thought a
stain (...) honor, and the minding of heaven, the business only of those who
had nothing to do on earth: A person, that had so much the character of Titus,
The delight of mankind, that he was born to conquer by love; and could he but
have been heard to speak, he need not.

Pretty was the return he made, when dissuaded from Embarking himself in the
best cause in the world; I would have all those that refuse serving in this
War, served as they that were backward ^o engage in the Holy War, to each of
whom was sent a Spindle and Di^taffe, the upbrading ensigns of their softness
and effeminacy; the delica^y of our mould and make, (speaking of Noblemen) the
quickness of our spirits, the sprightliness of our faculties, the exact
proportion of our parts, the happiness of our address, the accomplishments of
our persons, the soundness of our constitutions, and it may be, whatever His
opinion is th^^ souls were equal.
Aristotle thought, the difference of our souls, the happiness of our
opportunities, ((...)) and Mithridates called Occasion, the Mother of all
affairs. And in fine, our being born happy, and as the Panegy^ist of
Constantine Enrolled in the list of Felicity, as soon as of Nature, engages us
to do so much more than others, as we are more than others.

The hardest temptation he ever found against virtue, was a kind of blush and
shame in the owning of it; with much regret reflecting on men's glorying in
their shame, and being ashamed of their glory. But I thank God (he would say) I
can undergo the bloudless martyrdom of a Blush; and the greatest help to it,
resolution; business taking up all the parts of time, and the workings of a
restless mind; temperance and sobriety, seriousness and patience,
consideration and circumspection (according to the Duke of Bavares Motto and
Medal; prudence with a Balance in her hand, Know, Choose, Execute, quickly)
and which included all, a mean or moderation: My Lord being very much pleased
with the story of the French King, who one day inquiring of an experienced man,
how to govern himself and his kingdom, had a large sheet of Paper presented to
him, with this one word instead of the many precepts he looked for: Modus, a
Mean.

His good example, had pressed many to the service of virtue when it flourished
(when the war broke out, he was told by a Master Stroud, whose Speech most
provoked him.
prevailing Member, that the Scots must be kept in Arms to awe the English, as
long as the Sons of Zeruiah were too hard for the well-affected) engaged as
many to the service of it, when afflicted; for with three hundred Gentlemen,
worth near 300000 l. he came to assist his Majesty, marching along with him
till he came to Edgehill, where come in to the succor of the Lord General, its
a question whether was more remarkable, his conduct or courage, his followers
being so advantageously placed, that every particular man performed eminent
service, (to borrow a few words belonging to the courage of the English in the
battle of Newport 1600. to express the valor of these Gentlemen in the battle
of Called so, because it was fought near a Village called Keinton in
Warwickshire.

Himself persisting in the Fight, though most of his party were dead round about
him, till his blood, more Royal now (that it was shed for one good King, than
that it was extracted from many great ones) issuing out at twelve wounds, left
him weak indeed, but not spiritless, his soul loath to withdraw, not only when
the party it commanded, but also when the body it lived in deserted it: In
which condition he was carried to Abingdon, and thence, when dead, not long
after to Christ-Church in Oxford, where he was buried with as many sighs, as
blasted hopefulness and expectation is attended with; there being not a sadder
sight, next the public Calamities, than to see a great virtue accomplished by
industry and observation, by a sudden and surprising stroke, made useless to
others but in the example, and to himself, as to any employment in this world,
besides the sitting of him for a better.

Magazines, letting in the Kings Forces; and this to be begun by Tumults to be

noble enterprises, so like her illustrious husband, that her character is as

THE Life and Death OF JOHN, Lord STUART.
Acts 22. 22. Heb. 11. 38. The wicked Jews said of St. Paul. Away with such a
fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he should live. St. Paul said of
the godly Jews. Of whom the world was not worthy.

AN Ingenious Person (in a Dedicatory Epistle to the Illustrious Esme Stuart
Duke of Richmond, the most hopeful Son and Heir of James Duke of Richmond, of
whom more hereafter) descants on these words thus. Here I perceive heaven and
hell, mercy and malice, Gods spirit and Man's spite, resolved on the question,
that it is not fit that good men should live long on earth: the same conclusion
being bottomed upon different premises. Wicked men think this world too good,
God knows it too bad for his people to live in. Henceforward I shall not
wonder that good men dye so soon, but that they live so long, since wicked men
desire their Room here upon Earth, and God their Company in Heaven; and that
this young Nobleman so soon exchanged his Coronet for a Crown.

A Nobleman of happy and assiduous Studies, not in Plays and Romances, the
follies of good Wits, but in the disquisition of solid and masculine knowledge;
as if he, as well as Philostratus had been born a Man, and his soul known no
Childhood; never did vice in youth find a more confirmed goodness, so
impregnable was he against the temptations, that gain easy access to those of
his rank and quality, that they could neither insinuate into him by their
allurements, nor force him by their importunities; securing both his mind from
the infection of vice, and his same from the suspicion.

A Nobleman being to think of himself, as Caesar did of his Wi^e; that others
may live so as not to be condemned, but he so as not to be suspected; his
virtue was not his stupidity or heaviness, but his choice, when he could have
been as handsomely and takingly vicious, as he was virtuous; the severe
exercises of his virtues being mingled with such charms from his parts and
ingenuity, that his very seriousness was as alluring as others divertisements
and pleasures. A quick and peircing Apprehension, a faithful and reten^tive
Memory, a sprightful and active Fancy, and a Judgment overruling them all;
neither prejudicated by vulgar opinions, nor easily cozened by varnished and
plausible error; that deserved to live the ornament of better times, and to dye
engaging against those vices, that were the shame of these.

There are a sort of Apes in India, thus caught by the Natives. They dress a
little Boy in his sight, and undress him again, leaving all the Child's Apparel
behind them in the place and then depart a competent distance. The Ape
presently attireth himself in the same garments, till the Child's Clothes become
his Chains, putting off his Feet, by putting on his shoes.

The mimical Do^terels of Lincolnshire are thus taken. As the Fowler stretches
forth his arms and legs, going toward the Bird, the Bird extends his legs
and wings appr^aching the Fowler, till surprised in the Net.

The sweet carriage, and exemplary virtue, which he exercised really toward
some of the Faction, brought them to comply with him so far, at least in
pretense a while, that at last they were his Converts in truth. His valor
conquering many, his goodness more: souls yielding to his virtues, while bodies
only lay prostrate be^fore his Sword. Of all his virtues his patience was the
most re^markable, whereby he hardened his body to the same temperament, that
travel had done his soul, he knew no bed for several times, but that earth he
sleeps on now; and Pulvinar was a true Latin word for his Pillow, ^afraid of
softness even in his Furni^ture; not willing to go to any Bed, but that people
had in those times, when the Proverb rise, which expresses lying a Bed by
these words, Lying in Straw. And this patience born up by a principle as noble
as it self, I mean a Religion, made up of these two great parts, Love and
Immitation of God. This noble person being of that brave Opinion, That of so
many diverse Religions and man^ners of serving God, which are or may be in the
world, they seem to be the most noble, and to have the greatest appearance of
truth, which draw the soul into its self; and cause it by pure contemplation to
admire, love, adore, dwell with, imitate, and enjoy the infinite Majesty of God
(the first cause of all things, and the Essence of Essences) acknowledge it in
general, without the nicety of particulars, to be goodness, perfection,
in^^uiteness, wholly incomparable. This is to approach the Religion of Angels,
and the Humanity of Christ, that shadow agreeing with the Divinity, as
equal-made Dyals with the Sun: For his winged and soaring reason as high as
theirs, that pretend nothing above it, acquiesced rather in the humble
obedience of faith, than in the critical researches of curiosity. And his
sprightly wit, bestowed it self not in jesting upon, but in adorning and
obeying Religion, being none of them that commence wit by blasphemy, and cannot
be ingenious, but by being impious. Indeed there was as manly a a beauty in his
carrage, as in his Face; and a grace in each of his actions, as of his Limbs;
charming all places he came to, rather than conquering them; having as generous
a confluence of Noble Endowments in his Mind, as he had of Noble Blood in his
Veins. Worth this (like a rich vein of Ore, that forfeits the land it is in to
his Majesty) that rendered him too good to be enjoyed by us.

For when it was necessary for him, otherwise born for the sweetness and calm
of peace, to offer violence to, and deny his nature, to perform his duty, in
assisting that Majesty, to which he was allied, as well as obliged, in the
defense of that Law and Liberty which his Ancestors had established, as much
his Inheritance as his Honor; after several actions, by which he shall ever
live the pattern of a religious, sober, active, watchful, and resolved
Soldier, he came to that wherein he died, the pattern of an excellent man; for
following my Lord Hopton, as ambitious to observe his conduct, as he was to
attain his other great virtues, at Brandonheath, or Cheriton-down, near
Alesford in Hampshire, the Army standing ready to receive Sir William Waller,
and observing he had the advantage of a hill, my Lord saying, That he lay so
there, that he did but tempt them to beat him; commands a Its very observabl^,
that he drew Hazlerigge and others into a disadvantageous Engagement in the
Devizes, by his provoking and tempting For^orn.
Vanguard of Light Horse up the hill, with such brave resolution, that he
gained it, and that quickly, rather because he supposed it only a show of the
enemy to amuse us, while he stole his main body away. (In the mean time
discreetly composing a difference arising in the command and service, the bane
generally of the Kings affairs, with these two words, Let us dispute the main
with the enemy, and we shall have time enough to dispute punctilioes among our
selves) and finding them possessed of another, after a pause whether he should
follow them, considering the thick Hedges and Bushes, wherein they were set,
ordering a Party to skirt those Hedges and Bushes, he followed directly to gain
a commodious hollow that lay between them, where many a gallant man had his
Grave, not daunted with the fall of two horses under him, nor with six wounds
given, and the death of near five hundred men round about him, till like the
Phoenix and the World, he expired in his brave heat and fire, March 29. 1644.
and besides the Monument in each heart that knew him, had one by his Brother in

THE Life and Death Of the Right Honorable, BERNARD Lord STUART, Earl of
Litchfield.
IT is hard for a Physician to prescribe proper Physic to such a Patient who
has a hot Liver, and a cold Stomach, because what is good for the one, is
naught for the other; and it was hard for a Nobleman to give satisfaction to
the Critical temper of those times: if he took his liberty in a Jovial
conversation, he was a scandal to his own party; if he re^strained it by a
strict carriage, he was looked on as the most dangerous Enemy against the
Faction. Some of the Kings Friends came as their example, eating and drinking,
and behold, cry they of the hot temper, Gluttons and Wine-bibbers; some came
fasting, behold cry they of the Cool thoughts, they have a Devil. This
excellent Lord being of the last number, and (having as great command of
himself by temperance, as he had over others by Commission) was as much the
object of the Factions envy, as men of another Genius (miserably enslaved by
their lusts before they were vanquished by the enemy) were of their scorn.

The youngest Brother of five in this Noble Family that served his Majesty, and
of three that dyed for him; whose young and bashful virtues, (like the unripe
and blushing glories of the Rose) lying close and shut till the Sun and Majesty
called them out, and Maiden accomplished, men walking up and down in their vail,
yet have left these instructions to mankind, that they have Parents
Parricidas, who leave their Children by their pains great Estates, and by their
carelessness mean understanding, the one being a constant blemish and reproach
to the other; besides, that a full Estate not seasoned with Learning and Piety,
has nothing grows on it besides Lust and Vanity, as a fat heap of muck
produces nothing but weeds and trash; as we see good ground grow mossie and
barren for want of culture, sow observe good wits grow more vicious than those
of less hope and pregnancy. The happiness of having the minds and manners of
Children formed and seasoned, while they are pliant and ductile, before license
break out into Pride and Luxury, before Lust grows headstrong and
intractable, while they are a rusatabula, tender trees and capable of shaping,
omnium hominum gravida est anima, said Philo, and want Masters, as Midwives, to
shape and fashion the Offspring of them.

The advantage of living according to the Hebrew Proverb, before a great eye
(even the eye in the Scepter and Wheel) always wakeful upon our actions, a
strict ear always attentive on our words; an indefatigable hand; ever writing
the account of our works; a severe Cato, constantly attending our performances.
Maxima part peccatorum tolletur sed peccatorum testii as^^deat.


The way to improvement is in each action to aim at excellency, he that aims at
heaven will shoot high, that man will fail at last that allows himself one
remiss and careless thought; especially great Persons, who like the great
Luminaries step not amiss, but all people gaze at them; the least spot and mote
in them being as visible as those in the Sun and other Lights that represent
them, and their infirmities are as visible as King Ozias his Leprosy which was
in his forehead; and so between great thoughts of honor, and ingenious
Sentiments of shame are under the happy necessity of doing well, because they
have not the convenience of doing ill: which necessity by holy thoughts may in
time be ratified and sublimated into choice, apart from all respects, as those
Lights we mention, shined when there were no Spectators. A full Theater raises
any man's thoughts; it should the Noblemans, besides that, the ^oil sets off the
Diamond, and greatness illustrates goodness, it being the triumph of virtue, as
Plato said, to have sin in power, and virtue in will.

These are the observations resulting from this Noble Persons virtues, as so
many beams from a great Light.

A person cast into the troubles of the times, almost as early as the Germain
Children used to be thrown into the streams of the Rhine, to see how well they
could wade, as they tried how well they could swim.

A person humble in greatness, sober in plenty, temperate in opportunities,
moderate in excesses, calm in the midst of Affairs and business, uniform and
equal in vicissitudes; that like Regio Montanus, chained all the Butter-flies
of appetites and thoughts, that could do what he would, and would do nothing
but what he should: that in the greatest occasions of evil, showed the greatest
reflections of good. The truly great man in St. Bernard, Cui faelici^as arrisit,
non irrisit; on whom Fortune smiled, but deceived him not; he enjoying the
satisfactions of a Votary in the midst of the pleasures of the Court, whose
glory and virtue fed on bitter afflictions, as the Sun does on Salt-waters; and
might have used Lewis the XII. Impress, Inter eclipses Exorior.

A person Noble, not by enjoying greatness, but by despising it. Quanta
felicitas inter delicias pariter and ruinas mundi erectum stare, one that
husbanded time so well, that even when young in years, was old in hours, and
had age in his thoughts; the first whereof were so wise when young, that they
needed not old, or seconds. Having a reposed nature, happy in a sober heat,
moderate desires^ and orderly, though quick imaginations, with all the
advantages of age, without any of its infirmities, able to judge as well as to
imagine, to advise as well as execute, and as fit for settled busisiness, as for
new Projects. Having summed together those Experiences by reading, which he
could not by living, to direct him in old Affairs, and not abuse him in new
emergencies.

Free from the errors of youth (neither embracing more than he could hold, nor
stirring more than he could quiet, nor flying to the end without consideration
of the means and designs, nor using extreme remedies, nor prone to innovations,
nor easily pursuing a few principles he chanced on, nor uneasily retracting the
errors he fell into) and the mistakes of age, as consulting too long, objecting
too much, adventuring too little, repenting too soon, and seldom driving
business home to the full Periods, but sitting down with mediocrity of success.

Whereby he enjoyed the favor and popularity of youth, and the Authority of
age; the virtues of both ages in him corrected the defects of either, acting as
a man of age, and learning as a young man.

This Incomparable Person being obliged in youth to hazard his life in the
behalf of those excellent Constitutions of this Kingdom, which he hoped to be
happy under when ancient, and willing with his blood to maintain what his
Ancestors with their blood had won; saying, That a small courage might serve a
man to engage for that cause; the ruin whereof no courage would serve him to
survive.

The King when it was visible that he could not have an honorable and a just
Peace without a War, having not so much care to raise an Army (the Nobility and
Gentry, who saw nothing between them and ruin, but his Majesty's Wisdom,
Justice, and Power flowing upon him) as to dispose of it under equal commands,
his own Troop consisting of 120 Persons of Eminent Quality, worth above 150000
a year, were entrusted with the Lord Bernard Stuart, a Person suitable to the
Command (as it is said in our Chronicles of Edward of Caernarvon) because one
of themselves, who having disciplined them with two or three Germain Soldiers
direction to the exactest Model, led them like himself valiantly and soberly
after Sir Arthur Astons Dragoons, to perform as the first, so the best charge
that was performed that day, clearing the lined hedges, so as to open a way to
Sir Faithful Fortescue and his Troop to come over to his Majesty, and to pursue
the Enemy with great slaughter for half a mile, until he observed the
Lieutenant General Willmot worsted, and his Majesty's Foot left naked; to whose
rescue he came, joining with Prince Rupert, with whom he drew toward his
Majesty with a noble account of his Charge, with whom (having taken care of his
wounded Brother disposed of to Abington, and Ian. 13. following, solemnly
Interred at Oxon) he marched to Aino, Banbury, Oxford, Reading, Maidenhead,
Col^brooke, and Brentford, where he managed the Kings Majesty his Retreat and
March, with exceeding Conduct and Resolution, as he did the excellent Services
imposed upon him.

1. Near Litchfield, whence afterward he was made Earl of Litchfield, 1644.

2. Before Marleborough, where he won three Posts, lost two Horses, and between
thirty and forty ounces of blood.

3. And in Newbury second Fight, Sept. 24. 1645.
when the Earl of Essex his Horse pressed so hard upon the Kings, that they
gave way in disorder, until this Noble Lord came in to the relief of Col.
Leg, as he had come just before to the rescue of Sir Humphrey Bennet, and
fell upon the Enemies Flank so dexterously and successful that he routed
them, with the lose of several of their Officers, and a multitude of the common
Soldiers.

4. And in Rowton-heath near Chester, where when the King was overpowered by
Poyntz and Jones, this Lord managed his Retreat to the amazement of all that
saw him, till he fell the last of the three illustrious Brothers of this
Family, that dyed Martyrs to this great Cause, wherein it was greater honor to
be conquered, than it was on the other side to conquer.

THE Life and Death OF LUCIUS CARRY, Viscount Faulkland.
A Brace of accomplished men, the Ornaments and Supports of their Country,
which they served with no less faithfulness and prudence in their Negotiations
abroad, than honor and justice in their Places at home: Of such a stock of
Reputation as might kindle a generous emulation in strangers, and a noble
ambition in those of their own Family. Henry Carry, Viscount Faulkland in
Scotland, Son to Sir Edward Carry, was born at Aldnam in Hertfordshire, being a
most accomplished Gentleman, and a complete Courtier. By King James he was
appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland, and well discharged his Trust therein: But an
unruly Colt will fume and chafe (though neither switch'd nor spurred) merely
because backed. The Rebellious Irish will complain, only because kept in
subjection, though with never so much lenity; the occasion why some hard
speeches were passed on his Government Some beginning to counterfeit his hand,
he used to incorporate the year of his age in a knot flourished beneath his
name, concealing the day of his birth to himself. Thus by comparing the date of
the month with his own birthday (unknown to such Forgers) he not only
discovered many false writings that were passed, but also deterred dishonest
Cheaters from attempting the like for the future. He made use of Bishop Vshers
interest while he was there, as appears by the excellent speech the Bishop made
for the Kings Supply.

Being recalled into England, he lived honorably in the County aforesaid,
until by a sad casualty, he broke his leg on a stand in Theobalds Park, and
soon after dyed thereof. He married the sole Daughter and Heir of Sir Lawrence
Tanfield, Chief Baron of the Exchequer, by whom he had a fair Estate in
Oxfordshire. Th^se Lodging at Oxford, was the R^^^^z^cus of all the Eminent
Wits, Divines. Philosophers. Lawyers, Historians and Politicians of that time.
His death happened Anno Dom. 1620. being father to the most accomplished
Statesman

When be with others went upon the King summons to York, and there testified
publicly the Kings gracious intentions, and vowed to stand by him who stood

Trust, Compliance with Opportunity, and the other sallies of young Gallants,
prepare them for more serious undertakings; as they did this Noble Lord, great
in his Gown, greater in his Buff; able with his Sword, abler with his Pen, a
knowing Statesman, a learned Scholar, and a stout man. One instance of that
excess in Learning and other Perfections, which portended ruin to this Nation

being among the Demagogues, that had been for twelve years silenced, and were
now to play the prize in Parliament, and show their little twit-twat, but
tedious faculties of speaking, makes the bitterest Invectives against the
Governors and Government of the Church that ever was penned in English; which
though designed by him, its thought to allay the fury of the Faction by some
compliance with it, carried things beyond the moderation and decency of that
Assembly, which he made too hot for himself, retiring in cooler thoughts, as
many more (that like Brutus could not lay the storms he had raised) to Oxford,

the main props of Westminster their Hypocrisy; this as Secretary, the other
as Student, in both laying open the little pretensions, whereby the poor people
were ensnared in their Civil and Religious liberties. Much was the gall always
in his Ink, and very sharp his Pen; but even flowing, and full his style, such
as became him, whose Learning was not an unsettled Mass of reading that whirled
up and down in his head, but fixed observations, that tempered with solid
prudence and experience, were the steady Maxims of his soul fitted for all
times and occasions; he having sat (as some Noble men's Sons use to do formerly
in the House of Lords) behind the Chair of State from his very Childhood, and
owning a large heart, capable of making that universal inspection into things
that much becomes a Gentleman, being a Master of every thing he discoursed of.
Insomuch that his general knowledge, husbanded by his wit, and set off by his
Meine and Carriage, attracted many to come as far as to see him, as he
professed he would go to see Mr. Da^llee, which rendered him no less necessary
then admirable at Court, until his Curiosity engaging him at Newbury, (...)

he was strangely slain there, dying as he lived till then, between his Friends
and his Enemies; to the Kings great grief, who valued him because he understood
his Parts and Services in the Treaty at Oxford, where he was eminent for two
things; the continuing of Propositions, and the concealing of Inclinations;
though no man so passionate for his design, as never enduring that hope that
holds resolution so long in suspense, but ever allaying it with that fear that
most commonly advises the best by supposing the worst. His usual saying was, I
pity unlearned Gentlemen in a rainy day.

He was Father to Henry Lord Faulkland, whose quick and extraordinary parts and
notable spirit performed much, and promised more, having a great Command in the
Country, where he was Lord Lieutenant; a general respect in the House where he
was Member, a great esteem at Court (with his Majesty and his Royal Highness
the Duke of York) where he was both Wit and Wisdom. When there was the first
opportunity offered to honest men to act, he laid hold of it, and got in spite
of all opposition, to a thing called a Parliament: By the same token, that when
some urged he had not sowed his wild Oats, he is said to reply, If I have not,
I may sow them in the House, where there are Geese enough to pick them up. And
when Sir I. N. should tell him he was a little too wild for so grave a
service, he is reported to reply; Alas! I am wild, and my Father was so before
me, and I am no Bastard, as etc. In which contention he out-did the most active
Demagogues at their own weapon, In Richards Parliament as it was called,
joining with the Commonwealths-men against the Vsu ^ed Monarchy, to make way
for the true one.
speaking when Major Huntington and his followers were for the Long-Parliament,
Sir I. N. L. S. were for the Secluded Members, my Lord carried all the County
for an absolute Free Parliament; which he lived to see and act in so
successfully, that he was Voted generally higher in Trust and Services, had he
not been cut off in the prime of his years; as much missed when dead, as
beloved when living. A great instance of what a His Religiouss Mother the La^y

strict Education (for no man was harder bred) a general Converse, and a Noble
Temper can arrive unto; and what an Orator can do in a Democracy, where the
affections of many is to be wrought upon, rather then the judgments of few to
be convinced. A Golden tongue falling under a subtle head under such a
constitution, has great influence upon the whole Nation.

THE Life and Death Of the most Illustrious JAMES, Duke of RICHMOND.
A Noble person, little understood, and therefore not easily described,
modestly reserving himself from men, when he sincerely approved himself unto
God.

Great in his Ancestors honor, greater in his own virtue, and greatest of all
in that, like the Star he He was Knight of the Garter.
wore; the higher he was, the less he desired to seem, affecting rather the
worth, than the pomp of nobleness. Therefore his courtesy was his nature, not
his craft; and his affableness, not a base servile popularity, or ambitious
insinuation; but the native gentleness of his disposition, and his true valor
of himself. He was not a He was v^ry well sk^lled in all the points of the
Religion of the Church of England.
stranger to any thing worth knowing, but best acquainted with himself and in
himself, rather with his weaknesses for Caution, than his abilities for Action.
Hence he is not so forward in the Traverses of War, as in Treaties of Peace,
where his honor enobled his Cause, and his moderation advanced it. He and my
Lord of Southampton, managing the several overtures of Peace, at London,
Oxford, and Vxbridge, with such honorable freedom and prudence, that they were
not more deservedly regarded by their friends, than importunally courted by
their Though yet he was once excepted from Pardon, to try whether he might be
f^ghted out of his Allegiance, upon his first going after his Majesty to York;
and bearing witness of his integrity for peace, and subscribed a Petition that
he would live and dye by him, if he was f^rced to a w^r.
enemies; who seeing they were such, could not be patient till they were
theirs, though in vain; their Honors being impregnable, as well against the
Factions kindness, as against their power. At Conferences, his conjectures were
as solid as others judgments; his strict observation of what was past,
furnishing him for an happy guess of what was to come; yet his opinion was
neither variably unconstant, nor obstinately immovable, but framed to present
occasions, wherein his method was to begin a second advice from the failure of
the first, though he hated doubtful suspense when he might be resolute. This
one great defect was his good nature, that he could never distrust, till it was
dangerous to suspect; and he gave his Enemy so much advantage, that he durst
but own him for his Friend. One thing he repented of, that he advised his
Majesty to trust Duke Hamilton his adversary, with the affairs of Scotland, in
compliance with the general opinion, rather than the Marquess Huntly his
friend, in compliance with his own real interest: An advice, wherein his
publick-spiritedness, superceded his particular concerns; and his good nature,
his prudence: So true it is, that the honest man's single uprightness, works in
him that confidence, which often times wrongs him, and gives advantage to the
subtle, while he rather pities their faithlessness, than repents of his
credulity; so great advantage have they, that look only what they may do, over
them that consider what they should do; and they that observe only what is
expedient, over them that judge only what is lawful. Therefore when those that
thought themselves wise, left their sinking Sovereign, he stuck to his Person
while he lived, to his Body when dead, and to his Cause as long as he lived
himself: Attending the first resolutely, burying the second honorably, and
managing the third discreetly; undertaking without rashness, and performing
without fear; never seeking dangers, never avoiding them. Although, when his
friends were conquered by the Rebels, he was conquered by himself; returning to
that privacy where he was guessed at, not known; where he saw the world unseen;
where he made yielding, conquest; where cheerful and unconcerned in
expectation, he provided for the worst, and hoped for the best, in the constant
exercise of that Religion, which he and his maintained more effectually with
their examples, than with their Sword; doing as much good in encouraging the
Orthodox by his presence, as in relieving Allowing (...) a year for that
purpose, besides that he in^^^ed Mr. Thr^scr^sse, etc. to accept of an
honorable la^ary, to take the freedom of his h^use, and the advantage of his
Protection.
them by his bounty. In a word, I may say of him as Macarius does of Iustine;
there was no vice but he thought below him, and no virtue which he esteemed not
his duty, or his ornament. Neither was his prudence narrower than his virtue,
nor his virtue streighter than his fortune. His main service was his inspection
into the Intrigues and Reserves of the Parliamentiers at Vxbridge, and his
Cajoling of the Independants and Scots at London, where the issue of his
observation was, That the King should, as far as his conscience could allow,
comply with the unreasonable desires of an unlimited ambition, to make it
sensible of the evils that would flow from its own counsels; being confident,
as events have assured us, that the people would see the inconvenience of their
own wishes; and that they would return that power which they sought for, but
could not manage to its proper place, before it became their ruin: For
unbounded liberty overthrows its self. But alas! it was too late to grant
them any thing, who by having so much, were only encouraged more eagerly to
desire what they knew the King in honor could not give: for when a Prince is
once rendered odious or contemptible, his indulgencies do him no less hurt than
injuries.

As his Services were great, so were his Recreations useful; Hunting, that
manly exercise, being both his pleasure and his accomplishment; his
accomplishment, I say, since it is in the list of Machiavel's Rules to his
Prince, as not only the wholesomest and cheapest diversion, both in relation to
himself and his people, but the best Tutor to Horseman-ship, Stratagems, and
Situations, by which he may afterward place an Army; whatever Sir Philip
Sidney's apprehension was, who used to say, Next Hunting, he liked Hawking
worst.

His other Brothers died in the Field, vindicating his Majesty's Cause, and he
pined away in his house mourning for his Majesty's Person; whom he would have
died He with the Earls of Lindsey and Southamptyn, offering themselves to dye
for his Majesty, having been the instruments of his commands, and it being, a
Maxim, that the King can do no wrong, he doing all things by his Ministers.
for, and when that could not be, died with his innocent temper, having rendered
him the Kings Bosom Friend, as his conscience made him his Good Subject.

THE Life and Death OF FRANCIS Lord AUBIGNEY, Lord Almoner to Her Highness
Mary, The Queen Mother of England.
TIme was when the despised Priesthood was so honorable, that the same great
word signified, and the same VII Tarnov. ^xrecitat. Bil^^^^^ ^^2^. Ed heador.
V^^ 4^2. ^^^ascen^de (...) Fide (...) vid. Casa^b. (...) Sue^^^. Aug. 31.
eminent Persons (among the Jews, the A^gyptians, the Graecians, and Romans)
executed together the two excellent Functions of Priest and Prince, Rex Anius,
Rex Idem hominum Phaebique sac^^^^^ ^^^rg. A^ncid. l. 3 And most of the Roman
Emperors were as proud of the sacred Title of Arch-flamens, as they were of the
C^^racter of Semper A^gusti. As to come nearer our selves, there were at one
time in England, three Kings Sons, six Dukes, eight Earls, and fourteen Lords
Sons in Holy Orders.

Time was, when Abbeys and Monasteries were an easy outlet for the Nobility
and Gentry of this Land to dispose of their younger Children; that Son who had
not metal enough to manage a sword, might have meekness enough to wear a
Cowle. Clap a vail on the head of a younger daughter (especially if she were
superannuated, not overhandsome, melancholy, etc.) and instantly she was
provided for in a Nunnery, without cost or care of her Parents.

One eminent instance whereof we have in Ralph Nevil, first Earl of Westmerland
of that Family, whom we behold as the happiest Subject of England since the
Conquest, if either we account the number of Children, or measure the height
of honor they attained to; for of nine Children he had by Margaret his first
Wife, Abbess of Barking; and a second, viz. Elizabeth, was a Nun: And of a
eleven by his Wife Joan, one Jane was a Nun, all the other seventeen being
Lords and Ladies, at that time, of the highest quality in the Kingdom. And no
wonder (says our Author) if our Earls preferred their Daughters to be Nuns,
seeing no King of England since the Conquest had four Daughters living to
woman's estate, but he disposed one of them to be a Votary; by the same token
that Bridget, the fourth Daughter of King Edward the fourth, was a Nun at
Dartford in Kent, the last English Princess that entered into a Religious Order.

If former Ages, so much the piety of their Noblemen; for that the Earls of
Devonshire, Courtneys; the Earls of Essex, Bouchers; the Earls of Warwick, the
Dukes of Lancaster, Beausort, for having two Priests a piece of their
respective Families; this Age may observe one Priest of noble Family, of the
Earl of Manchester, Mr. Mountague; one of the Earl of Baths, Mr. Greenvile; one
of the Earl of Northamptons, Mr. Compton; one of the Earl of Kent, one of the
Lord Crews, Dr. Crew; and to name no more, one of the Duke of Richmonds, the
Lord Aubign^y; one of those illustrious persons that made us happy in that Age
Plato wished for, When princes were Philosophers, and Philosophers Princes.

Who was born in London, 1609. and bred, when a Child, not as those, who in
point of judgment are never to be of age, but only able in pleasures; but as he
would say, In those Arts whereby a man might be good Company to himself; for
his honorable Relations perceiving in him more than ordinary natural
perfections, were careful to bestow on him Education in piety, and Learning
suitable to his high Birth; he meeting their care with his towardliness, being
apt to take fire and blaze, at the least spark of instruction put into him.

The sharpness of Winter (correcting the rankness of the earth) cause the more
healthful and fruitful Summers; so the strictness of his breeding compacted his
soul to the greater patience and piety; which with other virtues and abilities
raised him to so much reputation in the Court and University of Paris, that he
was preferred Canon of Rotterdam, 1641. Lord Abbot of in France, a place worth
1200 l. a year 1643/4. and was in nomination for a Cardinals dignity, upon the
inthronization of Pope Innocent the tenth, 1644/5. as appears by this passage
in a Letter.

My Lord Aubigney is now made an Abbot, the Queen of France has given him one
worth 2400. Pistols per annum; there is a speech that he shall be a Cardinal.
Sir K^nelme Digby goes Ambassador to Rome to the new Pope from the Queen, etc.
And this the necessity of affairs, or at least the conceived necessity will
cast it (meaning the Cardinalship) upon the Lord you know (i. e. Aubigney) who
has very powerful advancers by his friends in this Court, and is much liked,
and in a manner accepted of, in Italy; he himself declaring himself in so
hopeful a way for it, that he had thereupon taken the Sentane, Paris October. 21.
1644. Of which dignities I may, as St. Jerome does in another case, Habuit ut
calcaret; only he would bless God that he had that time to think how to live
well, that poorer persons were forced to employ in thinking how to live; and
that his Place gave so much countenance to his Actions, that against the too
prevalent customs of the world, they might have the authority of Examples; and
so much power to his words, that against the fond opinions of the world they
might have the force of Rules; especially since his advancements brought with
it abilities for that which is Gods nature ((...)) and therefore man's duty,
viz. to do good; the paceful comeliness of his body, at once representing and
adorning the virtues and beauties of his, charmed hearts to the love of the
first beauty, with as much success as ever fair Tablets did Eyes to the
admirations of the fair things they represented, and commanded souls to duty as
happily, as Edward the fourth that goodly Prince (who as Comm^nes observed, won
London twice by his presence and aspect) awed and obliged his Subjects to
Allegiance (...), Max. Tyr. A fair soul in a fair body, is as a River that
windingly creeps with many wavy turnings, within the Enamel of a beautiful
Meadow, pleasing and refreshing the world. Pangy^in Cons^ant.
Tecum vident Milites, admirantur and diligunt, sequuntur oculis, animo tenent,
Deo se obsequi putant, cujus tam pulchra sorma est tam certa divinitas.

Therefore in his discourses with Ladies, he used to urge to them the advantage
they had to reform a deba^ched world, with the instance of the women in
Ludovicus Vives, who so reclaimed a loose City, by vouchsafing none their
favors but the virtuous, the beauty of whose soul (since the soul wears all the
beauties of the universe contracted in it, as Aaron did all the glories of the
world embroidred upon him) answered to that of their own bodies, as Diamonds
and Pearls do to rich Cabinets and Pearls.

And now I speak of souls, his good soul slept not in the body, affording only
now and then some glimmerings of common sense and reason, but sparkled briskly,
being to a stupid world, a great argument of the Deity it worshipped; Hoc nempe
habuit argumentum divinitatis suae quod illam divina delectaverint; nec ut
alienis interest, sed ut suis. Sen.

And indeed, he used to say, that he much questioned the integrity, and
consequently the state of that soul, that besides the exemplariness and
communion of public devotion, did not use to retire to the intimacy of that
more private, consisting chiefly in these great parts. 1. Self-examination,
consideration, and meditation, soliloquies; for which in every place he
resided, he prepared a Closet, dressed, as his breast for holy and serious
thoughts, pleasantly, yet dark situated and furnished with two things; the
matters of his Devotion and of his Charity (wherein he expended the third part
of his revenue yearly, in such a way, that it was alms to the poor souls, as
well as relief to the distrested bodies) which he esteemed the life, because
the effect and the expensive trial of his devotion; and this Closet he
consecrated into a private Chapel, by his solemn entrance into it never
without a prayer. The words of his friend, (He taking it for a certain
argument, that the serious belief of a God, and of the World to come, is much
wanting in his heart, who dares be naught, idle, or sinfully merry, if he can
but get out of man's sight and congnizance;) which office he kept as constant on
his servent heart, as ever the people of God of old kept up the continual
Burnt-offering upon the Altar; making as much conscience of laying out his
time, as he did of expending his estate.

And the result of all these accomplishments was,

1. A moderate and tender spirit toward all sorts of Christians, expressing
himself to several Ministers of the Church of England, with such a latitude,
that upon the principle^ he expressed, he might have held communion with them,
and they with him; concluding his discourses with this, That he approved not a
nice, scrupulous, and uncharitable religion.

2. A great reverence to himself, being as much afraid to concern his divine
soul in any mean office, as Senec. de benef. l. 3. c. 36.
Paulus the Praetor in Tyberius his time, was to handle a Chamber Pot, having a
Ring on his Finger graved with the Emperors Image.

3. A very great resolution, in the strength of which, in the great difference
between the French King and Cardinal de Retz at Paris, he and others of the
Channons of Nostredame, durst serve the Majesty of afflicted truth, before that
of a glorious King, and endure the Restraint of Imprisonment, that he might
enjoy Liberty of Conscience.

To smell to a Turf of fresh earth is wholesome for the body, no less are
thoughts of mortality cordial to the soul; therefore the sight of death, when
it surprised him with a choice Feavor, At Sommerset house
1664/5. was neither strange nor terrible to him who died daily.

THE Life and Death OF RALPH, Lord HOPTON,
SOn of Sir R. Hopton, born 1601. in In Moun. ^^^^hshire.
South Wales, where his Mother had relations; and bred in Somersetshire, where
his Father had his seat.

His education such, that he learned to pray as soon as he could speak; and to
read, as soon as he could pray, before three year old he read any character or
letter whatsoever in our Printed Books, and within a while, any tolerable
Writing Hand; getting by heart, at four years and an half, five or six hundred
Latin and Greek words, together with their Genders and Declensions.

Horrori fuit Ingenium. From a strict School, and able Schoolmaster in the
Country, he was sent to a well-governed College, and an excellent Tutor, Mr.
Sanderson (after Dr. Sanderson, Bishop of Lincoln) of Lincoln-Colledge) in
Oxford; who put his young reason, by his judicious and exact method, into such
a frame, that (he would bless God for it) he had a habit (which men of a
superficial education, slight, immethodical thoughts, were strangers to) of
considering matters proposed to him leisurely and soberly, of recollecting the
proper circumstances of a business pertinently, of looking through sophismes
and appearances discerningly, of searching into the bottom of things quickly;
of observing advantages and disadvantages in Marching, Q^artering, Rallying,
Leaguering, etc. dexterously.

Its a great matter to put young and flexible faculties (by being solidly
grounded in the Initiatory Arts and Sciences, or in the exact notions and
apprehensions of things) into an unerring and comprehensive frame of thoughts,
reasoning, and discourse.

But (as youth not yet accustomed to dissembling, easily discloseth its temper)
he soon discovered by those rancounters which he had with his School-fellows,
and Fellow-pupils in the School and College, as prolusions to those
engagements he afterward had in the Field, that he was born for action, the
life of a Man; rather than speculation, the life of a Scholar. Letting it
suffice others to meditate upon the great things which former ages have done,
while he did great things which future ages might meditate upon. They may (...).
rest when they have raised a Scheme, a Frame, and Idea within themselves,
proportionable to the order and method of things without them; while he
compently understanding this all was urged by his eager virtues, to perform
things as great as those he under stood; and actions as great as his thoughts.

From the University therefore he goes to the Camp, putting off his Gown, to
put on his Corslet; and exchanging his Pen, for his Sword. First exercising
himself in the Low-Countryes, the then Nursery of English Gentry, as a
Volunteer; and afterward practicing in the He carried the Queen of Bohemia he

Palatinate as Captain; where he gathered such choice observations, principles,
and maxims of war, that being an eyewitness in the long Parliament (wherein
he was chosen a Member) of their dangerous proceedings (which he opposed with
strong reasonings in the House, and offered to contradict against the
Ringleaders of the Faction with his Sword and Life, challenging several of them
in Westminster Hall) he privately retired to countenance the Kings more just
proceedings in the Country, giving order for providing Arms and Ammunition at
his own charge, and direction to secure and fortify all such places as were
tenable in Sommersetshire, Wiltshire, and Devonshire, out of his own
experience, until he, Sir Bevill Greenvill, Sir Io. Stawell, and Sir Nicholas
Flanning, raised with their interest and arguments (Sir Ralph Hopton pleading
the Kings, at the Assizes, Sessions, and all other public meetings of the
Country, that his eloquence had as great success upon the wavering populacy, as
his Arms had against the most obstinate Rebels) a choice Army in the West (an
instance of what great concernment it was to keep the Militia in the Crown, and
not to separate the Sword from the Scepter) not to make a war, as he declared
to the Country, but to prevent it. (Thus Caesar that fought best in his age,
spoke so too; and the sharpness of his wit, was equal to that of his Sword.)

With which Army the Marquess of Hertford, then Commander in Chief, with his
direction, Aug. 3. 1643. defeated the Faction in Sommersetshire, took
Shepton-Mallet, cleared Dorsetshire, maintained Sherburn, with such conduct and
resolution, as daunted the men at Westminster for two months; and October. 3.
breaking through the Besiegers, who thought (to use their own words) to put an
end to the war, if they could but take him, and one or two more men of so
considerable fortunes, valor, and conduct, as both raised, and kept up the war.

Whereupon (non quaerendus erat quem eligerent, sed eligendus qui eminebat) he
was chosen Commander in Chief of the West, where in half an year he got 40.
Garrisons well maintained, 12000. men well disciplined, 1000 l. a month
Contribution regularly settled, above 400 old Officers, Soldiers, and Engineers
out of the Palatinate, the Low Countries, and Ireland, usefully employed: A
Press to Print Orders, Declarations, Messages, and other Books, to instruct and
undeceive the people. Prudently managed the Pen upon all occasions, being
wonderfully quick in clearing this great truth; That his Majesty, and his
Fellowers, had no other intention in this war that they were necessitated to,
than the defense of the Protestant Religion, the Laws, the Liberty and property
of the Subject; together with the Privilege of Parliament.

And by these ways prospered so well, but especially,

1. By the choice of his Deputies and Officers, as curiously observing other
men's worth, as he carelessly undervalued his own, being choice in his
instruments, because he was so in his designs; well knowing that great actions
must be left to the management of great souls.

2. By his Discipline of the Army, without which, Commanders lead thronged
Multitudes, and not Armies; and listed Routs, rather than Regiments; keeping
his Soldiers men (that they might not be conquered by their debaucheries
first, and then by their enemies) by moral instructions, enduring no Achan to
trouble his Camp; as well as making them Soldiers, that they might not be to
learn, when they were to perform their duty (Turpe est in art militari dicere
non putaram) by military direction.

3. By his Pay to his followers, pinching himself to gratify them, knowing
well what gelt could do, and what it was to keep back from men the price of
their blood, making them hazard their lives by Fight, to earn their pay; and by
Famine, before they got it. His three words were, Pay well, Command well, and
Hang well.

4. By his care to keep open the Trade of the Countries, under his Command, by
Sea and Land.

5. By his solemn familiarity, neither the Mother of Contempt, nor the Daughter
of Credan^ haud grat^i^am in ^an^a majestate comitatem, Leo.
Art, and design his language with Caesar to his Countrymen, was not Milites,
but Comilitones; and with the Husbandman, it was not Go ye, but Gawee; seldom
putting them upon any service, the most difficult part whereof he undertook not
himself, in so much, that the Country stood, as well out of love to his Person,
as conscience toward his Cause.

6. By sharing with them in their wants, observing their deserts, and rewarding
them; he never made scales of his Soldiers, when they were dead, in taking
Cities, nor Bridges of them when living, in bestowing preferments, knowing that
deserving persons are more deeply wounded by their Commanders neglect, than by
their Enemies; the one may reach to kill the body, the other deadneth the
spirit.

7. By preserving his Soldiers, being loath to loose them in a day, which he
could not breed in a year; and understanding the perience and resolution of a
veterane Army, he had the happy way of securing and entrenching himself; (for
which ^ustavus Adolphus is so famous) so as in spite of his enemies, to fight
for no man's pleasure but his own; not cozened by any appearances, nor forced by
any violence to fight, till he thought fitting himself; counting it good
manners in war, to take all advantages, and give none; especially when the
small beginnings of his affairs confined his care more how to save himself
handsomely^ than set on the enemy, giving his enemies occasion to complain that
he would not patiently lie open to their full stroke; as that Roman brought an
action against a man, because he would not receiv^ into his ^o^y his whole
dart. A prudent reservation is as useful as a ^esolute onset, it being a
greater skill to ward off blows, than to give them; he was as wise as that
Lewis of France in preventing danger, who had foresight to prevent mischiefs
when they were coming, but not a present prudence to engage them, when come;
though yet he was as ready in incountring dangers, as that Henry of England,
who could (as the Lord Bacon observes, who drew his life with a Pencil as
majestic as his Scepter) with ready advice, command present thoughts, to
encounter that danger with success, which he could not with foresight prevent.

8. By understanding his Enemies way, and the Countries situation, as to take
many advantages by his incredible diligence (all his army doing service once
every sixth day) and prevent all disadvantages by his equally incredible
watchfulness.

9. By his Piety, keeping strict communion with God, all the while he was
engaged in a war with men. He was reckoned a Puritan before the wars for his
strict life, and a Papist in the wars for exemplary devotion; entertaining
sober and serious Non-conformists in his House, while he fought against the
Rebellio^s and Factious in the Field. And we find him subscribing a Petition to
his Majesty 1630. with other Gentlemen of Sommerset shire, to prevent unlawful
and scandalous Ri^tous ^iplings, quarrels, murders, uncleaness, disorderly
asesembly.
Revellings on the Lords day. As we observe him publishing Orders for the
strict observation of the Lords day, the encouragement of good Ministers and
People throughout his quarters; being very severe in these two Cases, 1.
Rapines committed among the people. And 2. Profaneness against God, saying,
That the scandal of his Soldiers should neither draw the wrath of God upon his
undertaking, nor enrage the Country against his Cause.

By these courses, I say, he prospered so (being so well placed (to use
Paterculus his words of Sejanus) in eo cum judicio Principis certahant studia
populi) that the enemies Historian May, writes this undoubted, because an
adversaries testimony of him. Of all commanders there, that sided with the King
against the Parliament, Sir Ralph Hopton by his unwearied industry, and great
reputation among the people, had raised himself to the most considerable
height, until the Earl of Stamford coming to the West, raised Sir Ralph from
the Siege of Plymouth, with some disadvantage, which yet the old Soldier made
up again by a Parthian stratagem of a feigned flight, entrapping most of the
Earls men, and to overthrowing the Parliament Forces, in so much that the Earl
of Stamford desired a truce for twenty days, which Sir Ralph condescended to,
with a design, during the truce, to bring off Sir John Chadley, as he did so
happily, that the Earl was forced to betake himself to Exeter, the whole West,
consisting of so many rich, and flourishing Shires, being wholly at his
Majesty's devotion.

And when Sir William Waller, with the posse of twenty one Counties, came upon
him, he managed Skirmishes and Retreats with so much dexterity, that his very
Flights conquered; for drawing Sir William to the Devizes to Besiege it, and
making as if he would Treat about the yielding of that place; he contrived that
he should be surprised with an unexpected Party of Horse on the one side, while
he drew out upon him on the other, with such success, that he defeated,
scattered, and ruined him, beyond relief (the Earl of Essex being told, when he
would have advanced with his sickly Army, to recover him, that he was past it)
he himself running for security, first to Bristol, and thence riding with a few
Gentlemen for recruit to London; leaving the few Garrisons that party had in
those parts to Sir Ralphs mercy, who took five of them by Assaults, and seven
upon Surrendry, with three thousand Prisoners, five thousand Arms, six Ships,
with sixty four Pieces of Ordnance in a fortnights time. He was excellent at
contriving at the Scaling of Walls, as his Soldiers were in executing; and yet
more excellent in taking hearts being so civil, even to the most obstinate,
that they chose rather to be conquered by him, than protected by others, ever
detesting their bloudiness that came valiant to strong Holds, and departing
cruel thence, knowing no difference either of Age or Sex in their anger, though
they did in their Lust; only it is not be forgotten here, how this expert
Commander loosing the advantage of Lands-down, for want of Ammunition taught
his Soldiers to beat and boil Bed-cords to make Match of them.

From the Devizes, Sir Ralph marched into Hampshire and Sussex, facing
Petworth, entering Midhurst, and at last sitting down before Arundel Castle in
the extremest part of Suffex, which he carried, beating Col. Norton into
Chichester, and wheeling off in spite of the Enemy (that provoked him to fight
with disadvantage among lined Hedges and Thickets, where he saw many brave men
lost to no purpose at Cheriton-down) in appearance to Winchester, but really to
Basing, and so to Oxford, whence Anno 1645. we find him after the considerable
Recruits he had left the King, advancing Westwards, and besieging Taunton,
where (when we have observed that his Magazine being blown up, he was
grievously hurt in the face, carrying an honorable scar to his grave) our Pen
shall leave him, giving way to his own Secretary who has communicated to the
world this following account of him.

1645. His Majesty, the present comfort of the Kingdom, being worsted, and the
Prince, the future hope of it appeared, taking progress into the West to
understand the Country before he should govern it; and to let the Country
understand him, the pawn of their future felicity, whom it should obey; the
Lord Hoptons presence raised as many brave men in Cornwall, to wait on the Son
their Duke, as his wise, civil, and obliging conduct had done on the Father
their King: under whom designing to relieve Exeter in a body of 10000 Horse and
Foot, when they were met by my Lord Fairfax at Torrington, with 20000. where my
Lord despairing of breaking through them, drew out four or five Closes off the
Enemy, lining the hedges, and flanking his Foot with Horse, who disputed every
hedge first with the Dragoons, and then with the Reserves, and at last with the
whole body of the other Army, pouring upon them Regiment upon Regiment; and
when they had lost the hedges, maintained the Barricadoes at the end of the
Town with push of Pike, and the Butt end of their Muskets, for three hours; and
when over-powred there, my Lord brought up the Rear, and made good the retreat
though his Horse was shot under him; so that the Foot had time to pass over the
adjoining River, and the Horse to guard them; my Lord making use of every
Avenue in the Town, or near, to stop the Enemies Career; whom, if his advice
had been followed, he had surrounded and overcome with their own Victory. And
withdrawing to Cornwall he Rendezvouzed again, and made 5000. able Horse; a
body under the Command of so wise, as well as Valiant a Commander as the Lord
Hopton appeared to be in the late Service, might, if there had been any hope of
the Kings Affairs; and since there was not, commanded their own terms (when the
Prince withdrew from them to Scilly) at Truero, among others this Article
offered my Lord himself, is remarkable, considering it proceeds from an Enemy.

Lastly, for your self, besides what is employed to you in common with others,
you may be assured of such mediation to the Parliament on your behalf, both
from my self, and others; as for one whom for personal worth, and many virtues,
but especially for your care of, and moderation toward the Country, we honor
and esteem above any other of your party; whose error (supposing you more
swayed with Principles of Honor and Conscience) we most pity, and whose
happiness, so far as is consistent with the public welfare, we should delight
in more than in your least suffering. My Lord after much dispute, in hope
either of assistance from abroad, or of an accommodation between the King and
Parliament, as it was called at home, upon the advance of near upon 40000. men
toward him, disbanded, being allowed forty Horse and Arms, and twelve men for
himself for a while, and not long after pardoned for Life, but condemned in his
Estate. A favor like that I read of the Duke De Alva, vouchsafed the City of
Harlem, when he promised them their lives, and yet sterved many of them to
death saying, That though he had promised to give them their lives, he had not
promised to give them meat.

Gentle was this Excellent Persons Extraction in the West of England, and
man-like his Education in the Low Countries; that School of War, where Sir
William Waller and he learned, as is said of Iugurtha and Manus in one Camp,
what they practiced in two: The one being no less eminent for his Service under
his late Majesty of blessed memory, than the other was for his against him. The
one was the best Soldier the King had, the other the most experienced that the
pretended Parliament boasted of. None fitter to balance Sir Ralph Hoptons
success, none likelier to understand his stratagems, none abler to undermine
his designs, than his Fellow-souldier Sir William, who understood his method as
well as he was acquainted with his Person. Both were equally active, both
equally vigilant. But what better Character of this Hero, than that which his
Master gave him in his Patten for Baron, which is his History as well as his
honor.

HIs two great Actions, the one at Liscard, the other at Stratton, cannot be
better described than by an Eyewitness, whose words are these, as he says,
out of a Manuscript corrected with Sir Ralphs own hand, communicated to him by
his Secretary Mr. Tredus.

At Liscard, a little before the Fight began, the Kings party took it into
seasonable consideration, that seeing by the Commission the Lord Mohun brought
from Oxford four Persons (viz. the said Lord Mohun, Sir Ralph Hopton, Sir John
Berkley, and Colonel Ashburham) were equally empowered in the managing of all
Military matters: and seeing such equality might prove inconvenient (which
hitherto had been prevented with the extraordinary moderation of all parties)
in ordering a Battle, it was fittest to fix the Power in one Chief, and general
consent settled it in Sir Ralph Hopton. He first gave order that public prayers
should be read in the Head of every Squadron, and it was done accordingly; and
the Enemy observing it, did style it saying of Mass, as some of their Prisoners
did afterward confess. Then he caused the Foot to be drawn in the best order
they could, and placed a Forlorn of Musketeers in the little Enclosures,
wringing them with the few Horse and Dragoons he had. This done, two small
Minion Drakes speedily and secretly fetched from the Lord Mohun's House, were
planted on a little Borough within random-shot of the Enemy; yet so, that they
were covered out of their sight with small parties of Horse about them. These
concealed Minions were twice discharged with such success, that the Enemy
quickly quitted their ground; and all their Army being put into a Rout, the
Kings Forces had the Execution of them; which they performed very sparingly,
taking 1250. Prisoners, all their Canon and Ammunition, and most of their
Colors and Arms; and after public thanks, taking their repose at Liscard.

Stratton Fight succeeds on Thursday the 16. of May 1643.
THe Kings Army wants Ammunition, and has a steephill to gain, with all
disadvantage and danger: The Horse and Dragoons being not five hundred, and the
Foot two thousand four hundred. THe Parliament Army well furnished, and
Barricado'd upon the top of the hill, their Foot 3400 and their Horse not many
indeed, having dispatched 1200 to surprise the Sheriff and Commissioners at
Bodmin.

ON the Kings side, order was given to force the passage to the top of the
hill, by four several Avenues: the ascent was deep and difficult; resolutely
did his Majesty's Forces get up, and obstinately did the Enemy keep them down.
The fight continued doubtful, with many countenances of various events (from
four in the morning, till three in the afternoon) amongst which most
remarkable, the smart charge made by M. G. Chudleigh, with a stand of Pikes on
Sir Bevile Greenvil, who fell nobly himself, and had lost his Squadron, had not
Sir John (now Lord Berkley, who led up the Musketeers on each side of Sir
Bevil) seasonably relieved it, so resolutely re-inforcing the Charge, that
Major General Chudleigh, was taken Prisoner. Betwixt three and four of the
Clock, the Commanders of the Kings Forces, who embraced those four several ways
of ascent, met to their mutual joy almost on the top of the hill, which the
routed Enemy confusedly forsook. In this service, though they were Assailants,
they lost very few men, and no considerable Officer, killing of the Enemy about
three hundred, and taking seventeen hundred Prisoners, all their Canon (being
thirteen pieces of Brass Ordnance) and Ammunition (seventy Barrels of Powder)
with a Magazine of Biscuit and other Provision proportionable. For this Victory,
public Prayer and Thanksgiving was made on the hill; then the Army was
disposed of to improve their success to the best advantage. Nothing had sunk
his great spirit, but the fate of Kingdoms, with whose ruin only he was
contented to fall, and disbanded his Soldiers upon honorable terms. Five
things made my Lord Hopton so eminently serviceable. 1. His great in-sight into
the Designs, and prudent foresight of the events of present Counsel, which
when most doubted and wavered, gave him that great resolution that undertook
great difficulties, and bore up against greater. 2. His experience of War in
general, and his acquaintance with that seat of it committed to him in
particular. 3. His renown all over the Kingdom for Piety and Moderation, and
within his own association for Hospitality, Civility and Charity. 4. His Name
among the Enemies, as considerable for his Generousness and Justice, as for his
Valor and Conduct. 5. His Estate, that set him above Mercinariness; and his
care for Money, that set his Soldiers above need, the occasion of mutinying
among themselves, or of incivillities toward others. This Noble Lord dyed a
Bruges September 1652. without any issue, besides those of his Soul, his great
thoughts and greater actions, his Barony of Stratton being coferred on the Lord
John Berkley, younger Son of Sir Maurice Berkley of Bruerton in Somersetshire,
so highly concerned with him in the Martial Affairs of the West, (being one of
them that reduced and commanded it) he might well share with him the honor; and
as Queen Eliz. was pleased that none but a King should succeed in her Throne
when dying, she said, My Throne is the Throne of Kings; so this Lords Ghost
would be infinitely satisfied to see that none but an excellent Soldier should
inherit his honor, for his honor was the honor of Chivalry.

THE Life and Death OF Sir EDMUND VERNEY.
SIR Edmund Verney, whose Ancestor John Verney, stands as eminent in the
Catalogue of Gentry made for Buckinghamshire, in the twelfth year of King Henry
the sixth, 1433. as he does in the Catalogue of Martyrs from 1637. to 1666. was
born, April 7. 1596. at London, bred most part of his time at Court with an
education answerable to his birth. 1. Under such a discipline as molded his
tender soul to that frame, that was not only advantageous toward the
succeeding part of his education, but toward the irregularity of his whole
life. 2. Under that tuition which successively instilled ingenious and good
rudiments into his tender breast, in the order that was proper to his tender
years; Age at once maturating his parts, enlarging his capacity, and advancing
his Lectures, until several years Education had accomplished his mind with
that stock of active, useful, and manly knowledge, which furnished him with
those virtues that are a perfection to noble natures, and a rest and
tranquillity to great minds. 1. Bridling and checking the irregular sallies of
the inferior faculties, and the impetuous passions incident to younger years.
2. Fashioning his behavior to that humanity that was due to mankind, and that
modesty and gravity, which was due to himself. 3. Regulating his discourse to
that temper, that became the product of judgment and right reason, and raised
him to thoughts of employment worthy and ingenuous, abhorring to busy himself
vitiously or impertinently.

In a word, when Education had made him a complete man, he bethought himself
that he was born to labor, as the sparks are made to fly upwards, being endued
with that (...) (as Iamblichus calls it) that ever moving and restless
principle his soul, and trusted with those abilities that suggested to him that
he was not so far neglected by either God or Nature, as to be placed in the
world without employment. After sometime spent with my Lord Goring to see the
Low Country Wars, and some sallies out with my Lord Herbert, Sir Henry Wotton,
to see the Courts of France and Italy 1618. he goes with my Lord of Bristol
into Spain, whence he returned so well accomplished, as to be recommended to
the service of the Prince; where he as zealously opposed the plots and
stratagems of the Papists in Spain, as his Tutors, Hackwell and Winniffe did in
England; insomuch that he struck an English An action (...) to one so n^arly

sorbon Doctor, called Maillard, a Box on the Ear, for visiting one of the
Princes Servants sick of a mortal Feavor, whereof he died, and laboring to
pervert him; though with so much hazard, that he had much ado to keep out of
the Inquisition. One reason of the Princes hastening out of Spain, at whose
departure I find he presented Don Maria de Land with a cross of ten thick
Table-diamonds, bought of his Servant Sir Edmund Verney.

His Master, the Prince, disposing of Offices about him agreeably to men's
inclinations; when King, made this stout man Knight-Marshal, in which capacity
he was severely honest in time of peace, and undauntedly valiant in time of
war; saying, when by his place he held the Royal Standard at Nottingham, That
by the grace of God (his word always) they that would wrest that Standard from
his hand, must first wrest his soul from his body. And accordingly at the
battle of Edgehill, October. 23. 1642. when as Julius Caesar commanded his
Standard to be thrown among his enemies, that the Soldiers might be provoked
in honor to fetch it; so he adventured with his Majesty's colors among the
enemy, that the Soldiers might be engaged to follow him, and was offered his
life by a throng of his enemies, upon condition he would deliver the Standard;
he answered, That his life was his own, and he could dispose of it; but the
Standard was his and their Sovereigns, and he would not deliver it while he
lived, and he hoped it would be rescued, as it was, when he was dead; selling
it, and his life, at the rate of sixteen Gentlemen, which fell that day by his
hand. One of the strictness and piety of a Puritan, of the charity of a Papist,
of the civility of an Englishman; whose family the King his Master would say,
was the model he would propose to the Gentlemen, whose carriage was such, that
he was called the only Courtier that was not complained of. At the same time
that he ventured his life for his Sovereign at home, he sent his Son Sir Ralph
Verney to accomplish himself for his service abroad.

THE Life and Death Of the Right Honorable, SPENCER, Earl of NORTHAMPTON.
SPencer Compton Earl of Northampton, Son to William the first Earl of the
Family, Created 1618. 16. Iac. by Sir Francis Beaumont, the Duke of Buckinghams
Uncles Daughter, had as many remarkables, as he said, in his life, as there
were years to his death. He was born at Compton in Warwickshire, the very same
day and hour that the Powder Traitors were defeated at Dun-church in that
County; an Omen, that that life (like Caesar's, who was born at the defeat of a
Tumult) should be hazarded for the suppressing of Rebellion, that was begun
with the suppression of Treason. The first step he went by himself was to reach
the Kings Picture, and the first word he ever spoke was the King, an argument
he used upon his retirement, 1641. to those of the party (that had so much as
to understand worth, and making advantage of his solitude for a temp^ation,
pressed him to a ne^trality) why, besides the impossibility of being a Neuter,
he was resolved to stand by the Sovereignty and Government of his Native
Country, while he could either speak or stand; his parts were so great, and his
appetite to knowledge so large, that it was as much as four several Tutors, at
Home, at Cambridge, and in France, and Italy, each taking his respective hour
for the Art and Science he professed, to keep pace with his great proficiency;
the vigor of his soul, advantaged by the strong constitution of his body, as
that was by the temperance of his dyer. I am informed, that in all his life
time, he took but one Antidote, and never purged but once, and then the Physic
found no obnoxious humor to work upon, so healthful was his temper.

The symbolizing of their sober and grave temperr, rendered him as great a
Favorite to Prince Charles, as his Cousin the Wh^^^ Mother ^^d married his
Vn^le Sir (...). Compton.
Duke of Buckingham was of King James, being his Companion at home, and an
Attendant on him abroad, particularly in Spain, where I am told he waited upon
him in the quality of Master of his Robes and Wardrobe, and had the honor to
deliver all the Presents made by the Prince there, amounting to 64000 l.

As he held the Kings Train at the Coronation 1525. as Master of the Robes to
his Majesty, with the Earl of Denbigh, who was Master of the Wardrobe. Two
things he would have nothing to do with, 1. Church Lands, because his direct
Ancestor, being not only Chief Gentleman of King Henry the Eighths Bedchamber,
but the third man in his favor, had not a Shooe-latchet of Abbey-land (as there
was none in all his ancient paternal estate) though, says my Author, nothing
debarred him save his own abstine^ce. 2. Enclosures, since Captain Powch (a
poor fellow with a powch, wherein he said there was that which would secure his
followers, though there was nothing in it, but a piece of moldy Cheese) with
so many thousand people, did so much mischief, because of Enclosures in
Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, and Leichestershire. He could not endure
jesting with Religion, there being no people of what Religion soever, but had
serious and great thoughts of their Numen; nor an oath on any, except Judicial
and Solemn occasions, often repeating that of Prince Henry, That he knew no
game or Value, to be won or lost, that was worth an Oath.

Having been so many years a witness of the Kings Majesty's gracious
disposition, and for solong a time had experience of the benefit of his
Majesty's Government, and the comfort of the Religion established; upon the
Faction breaking out of their shell upon the warmth of the present peace and
plenty, and peeping out of their privacy, wherein like the Hedge-hogg they
rounded themselves in their prikcles without motion, and took aim at the
government; seeing the contracts of the Nobility and tumults of the commonalty
walking formerly; so ugly they are in themselves with the borrowed face of
Religion, but now in the heat of their success casting off that cloak, break
out daily into outrages, as much against Policy as Piety, as simple as
scandalous; (the licentious having given reins to their looseness, are not able
to stop themselves) he not only dissented from their proceedings in all public
counsels, but prepared to second that dissent with Arms, wherewith he was the
best furnished, when there was occasion to make use of them, of any Nobleman in
England; having settled his estate, and advanced several thousands toward the
public service, making the noblest appearance 1639. against the Scots, and the
most effectual provision 1642. against the English; waiting upon his Majesty to
York, to advise in the Ardua Regni, attest the clearness of his Majesty's
procedures, and vow his assistance, as appears by his hand to several public
Declarations from that place; from whence summoning as many good Soldiers and
honest Gentlemen, as were of his acquaintance, the one to raise the Country,
and the other to lead and command by the untained reputation of his name, the
moderation and sobriety of his principles, the exemplary regularity of his
person and family, the justice and generosity of his dealing with his neighbors
and dependants; the hospitality and alms of his house, the sweetness of his
spirit, amazed such a Body in Warwickshire, as having seized on the Ordnance
at Banbury, and marching resolutely against the Lord Brooks, checked his
Career, awed the Country to Allegiance, consining that Lord to two or three
Garrisons he had suddenly made for his retreat (and this notwithstanding a
Letter from the As it was called.
Parliament, May 30. 1642. to him, and such other Lords as they thought most
serviceable to his Majesty, naming him in the first place; and after his
generous answer, June 8. a Charge and Impeachment against him of very great
Crimes and Misdemeanors) proceeding so vigorously, that he in twelve Skirmishes
put a great stop to Essex his grand Rendez^^vous at Northampton; insomuch as
that Essex should say, The going away of these sober Lords from us, is a great
blow, not only in regard of their interest and reputation, but of their
vigilance and activity.

Upon which score, hoping to gain them by their worst way of cruelty, their
kindness, they forbear to proclaim my Lord Traitor, to render him desperate,
though in vain, as he observed, since they had charged him with Misdemeanors
that made him irreconcilable: Therefore he proceeds, securing most of the
Arms Ammunition, and Garrisons in Warwickshire, Stafford shire, and
Northamptonshire, and settling the Association, so as to be able to surnish
his Majesty with two thousand of the best disciplined men in all the Kings Army
to Keinton-fight, and to Besiege Lich^ield (having made the Country, from
Garrison to Garrison, one Line of Communication) when receiving intelligence of
^r^r^ton and Gells coming to the Relief of the Place, with near four thousand
horse and foot, he drew out a eleven hundred horse and dragoons^ so dexterously,
that he surprised and routed their house at Hopton heath (a place
disadvantageous to their horse, by reason of the Cunniberries there) the
deserted Foot leaving the field with one thousand five hundred Prisoners, two
thousand Arms, some Ordnance, with four Drakes, with all their Ammunition and
Baggage: An happy Victory, had it not cost the life of this gallant and
faithful Lord (of whom the King said, That he was the greatest loss but one, he
had had since the beginning of the Civil War) who Charging in the Head of his
Troops, and by the unevenness of the ground, with the force of the Enemy,
unhapply unhorsed, refused Quarter (saying, He would not owe his life to those,
who had forfeited theirs) and having so many wounds, that he need fear none,
being one great wound himself, he fell, to the great loss of his Majesty, and
his Cause, not without a noble testimony and resentment from his very enemies
victory, attending him to his Grave, March 19. 1642/3. dying as good a
Protestant as he had lived.

THE Life and Death OF Sir WILLIAM COMPTON.
AN honorable person, of such temperance from his youth, that he seemed to be
the St. Nicholas of our Church, of whom the report is, that when an Infant,
hanging on his Mothers breast, he fasted Wednesdays and Fridays, and would not
suck.

He had no sooner accomplished himself by travel and study, but his honorable
Brother, before mentioned, entreats his Company in his Expedition toward the
settlement of the Association for his Majesty in their Country, where he had an
excellent faculty of undeceiving those that wrested the Scripture by Scripture,
his Head being a Concordance, especially of St. Paul's Epistles; and he advising
it as very prudential, to condescend to level discourses at the capacity of the
people, and to convince them in their own dialect; having with him one who had
the best command of rain and sunshine in his Face, to smile and weep at
pleasure, his tears flowing at will, melted the affections of many; though
others better acquainted with the man, no more regarded his weeping, than they
did the moist droppings of a stone-wall against rainy weather.

Small resistance he had (the disorderly people not knowing how to digest
themselves into a body, as who expects that a rolling Snow-ball should have any
curious fashion?) men at first only fighting in a complement, until having
bravely brought off his Regiment after three onsets (wherein his horse was
twice shot under him) by two Brigades of the enemy, it fell to his lot to be
Governor of Banbury, for the retaking whereof he had contributed so much by his
courage and counsel, where his first care was a civil and strict carriage to
win those professing people, disposing his men so easily, paying for so
honesty, and countenancing Religion among them so exemplarily, that the people
of the place professed, that if the Kings Army carried its self so in other
places, they admired with what conscience any godly man could lift up a hand
against them; and his next by his own industry (being in his turn upon all
works and watches, as well as the meanest man among them) and the peoples, to
strengthen the Town, which by reason of its nearness to Oxford, and its command
over the adjoining Counties, he resolved to keep, as a place of very great
consequence to the King, and aimed at as of no less consequence to the other
side, especially, since his indefatigable way of Beating up Quarters, re^dred
him (of whose men, some in their turns for three years together, were observed
always on horseback, either relieving neighbors (witness that admirable relief
of Iackson) gathering Contributions, or alarming the enemy) as troublesome at
Banbury, as Colonel Massey was at Gloucester; the reason why, after some little
attempts before, 1644. the enemy came from Northampton with so many Miners and
Colliers, July 19. continuing their Mines till Aug. 27. on which day it was
assaulted by several Mines, Storms, and Batterings, with a Summons, to which
Sir William returned this answer, That they kept the Castle for his Majesty,
and as long as one man was left alive in it, willed him not to expect to have
it delivered.

And after several Batteries on three sides of the Castle, and seven Mines
obstructed by water, with an endeavor, with much loss, to drain the outmost
Mote. Another, September 16. to which Sir William returned this answer by the
Trumpeter, That he had formerly answered them, and wondered they would send
again: whereupon they proceed fiercely to their Assaults and Batteries,
together with their Grenades, and great Ordnances (of the one 346. of the
other 767. for a week together) though answered with frequent Sallies,
insomuch, that having made a breach upon the Westwall of the outward of the
Castle (the upper part near thirty yards in length, but the inside wall lined
with earth) they Storm it about nine a clock in the morning, September 23. with
six hundred of their choicest men, twelve being picked out of each Company with
burdens on their backs to fill the Mote, falling on with Scaleing-ladders in
four several places, besides a great throng of them in the Breach, but without
effect, Sir William himself maintaining the Breach, and giving order in all the
other parts, so that they fell off, desiring leave, after the Garrison had
stripped them, to bury their dead, especially, after the dreadful execution
made upon them, by a sally Sir William ordered upon them, under Leiutenant
Colonel Green the next day, when, with the men of Sechem, they were very sore.

And not long after, according to the good correspondence and intellegence Sir
William had with his Majesty's Forces, the Siege was raised by the right
honorable the Earl of Northampton, and Sir Henry Gage on the one side, and
himself on the other; the Besiegers being dispersed, and their Carriages,
Horses, three Wagons of Arms and Ammunition, two Fieldpieces, being taken
and sent into the Castle.

A piece of service (considering that Sir William was not for a eleven weeks in
Bed, so great his vigilance; nor for a week off the Works, so unwearied his
diligence; that he had Prayers four times every day, the spiritual arms
seconding the temporal, so eminent his piety, that he acted all things by
common counsel and consent, such his wariness and prudence: He countermined the
enemy a eleven times, and overreached them by stratagems six times, such his
skill. He trusted no man without his own immediate oversight, such by care; he
seldom failed in his aim, so exact this level; he had no Mutinies either in
Town or Garrison, so equal his Especiall^ in m^king and d^st^^^u^^ng Provisions.
Justice, and happy his Government) not to be equalled, but by another in 1646.
when Banbury was besieged the second time as Jerusalem was in the time of a
Passover, when all the Synagogues doing homage to the Mother-Temple, all
Iudaea was there the Guests, Cavaliers come from other places, being more than
the Inhabitants) by Whaley with a 1000. Foot, and four Troops of Horse, who lay
before it ten weeks ere Sir William would hearken to any terms, as nobly angry
with the Fortune of his Cause, as disdainfully vexed with the disparagement of
the siege; the Castle able to defy their entire Army, having defeated a far by
countermining underground, and throwing Stones and Grenades above ground,
yielded not till the whole Kingdom submitted (against which it had been folly
to loose themselves in an unequal and vain contest) to Providence rather than
Conquest, going off May 8. upon these honorable terms: All Officers with
Horses, Swords, Goods, Money, and Passes, with a safe Conduct whether they
pleased, without any Arrest or Molestation, by virtue whereof Sir William had
his liberty to settle his Affairs (and I know not whether he be, or another
(Sir William Compton of Frith in Kent, compounded for 0660 00 00) as he did,
yet hazzarded all again to serve his Majesty in the Kentish. Expedition, where
in my Lord Gorings absence he Commanded as Major General; in which capacity,
notwithstanding the difficulties he was to wade through, he made a comfortabl^
provision for the Army in Greenwich-Park amidst the infinite distractions; And
when a fatal infatuation and a pannick fear guided them into the Parliaments
hands, he approving himself more complete in Gallantry, Wisdom, Virtue, and
Honor, than years, discovered the snare, kept them together so as to make
honorable terms for them to go upon; The laying down of their Arms where they
pleased, under which pretense he drew them through the Enemy, taking many of
them Prisoners within a mile of London, to the general astonishment of that
whole City, an action of great consequence, as was the satisfaction he gave the
Country all along in Essex he marched, concerning the Principles whereupon they
engaged, and the infinite pains and care he took to keep the Garrison in its
highest distress in some competent order in Colchester by great Instructions,
and a greater example; where being taken a Prisosoner of War, he suffered all
the indignities that insulting meanness could offer there, being no pretended
Plot, but there was occasion to take him Prisoner, whom O. C. called the sober
young man, and the godly Cavalier, especially in Penruddocks business 1655. and
Sir Henry Slingshies 1658. He with the Earl of Oxford, the Lord Bellasi^, Sir
John Russel, called then the Sealed knot, managing all the eight attempts made
for his Majesty's Restoration from 1652. to 1659. when others having the
charge of raising other Countries in pursuance of Sir George Booths design, Sir
William Compton, Sir Thomas Leventhorp, and Mr. Fanshaw, undertook
Hertford-shire, and that project failing, he does with incredible industry and
prudence observe and improve the struglings of a giddy people now reeling into
Liberty, by degrees withdrawing the force that awed them; and assisting in the
gradual changes of the Government, suiting with particular persons gust, in
order to that great change that satisfied all, taking care when the Royal
interest was in view in a public Declaration, which he with other Noble,
Reverend, and excellent Persons subscribed, lest any offense might be taken at
the whole party of Cavaleers (to the prejudice of the expected settlement) from
the indiscretions or transports of any single persons promising, without any
regard to particular Factions or Interests, to submit quietly and cheerfully to
the present power, as it was vested in the Council of State, in expectation of
the future Parliament, which producing that blessed effect the three Nations
unanimonsly wished for, this Noble Person had as great a share in the Comforts,
as he had formerly in the cares and sufferings, being entrusted with the
Important place of Master of the Ordnance, till he died 1663. at Drury Lane, a
sudden, death to all persons but himself.

THE Life and Death OF Sir CHARLES COMPTON,
TWin to Sir William in actions, as well as Birth; one History serves both, as
well as did once one Picture: Of whom one may say, as one did of his Country
Warwickshire, that it was the Heart, but not the Core of England, having
nothing Course in his life, having had the same Education with his Brother
(saving that he excelled in two great Accomplishments for Pleasure and
Business, Music and Mathematics, without the first of which he would affirm
that a man was no Company; and without the second of no use.) He took to the
same War, being as eminent for Sobriety, Discipline, Moderation, Conduct,
Vigilance, and Activity in the field, where he Commanded as Colonel, as his
Brother was in the Garrison where he Commanded as Governor. There are two
wonders in his life. 1. His surprise of Breston-Castle with six men, and
himself by pretending to bring in Provision according to a Letter he
intercepted (as he did many, reckoning his intelligence the main piece of his
service, and having always abroad his (...), and (...), his many Eyes and Ears,
as men of business must) which enjoined it the next Towns. 2. His having two
Pistois clapped in his very face, and yet neither fire, but the owners which
were so sure of his life, loosing by his side both their own.

He was as much for Pasturage and Enclosures in his Country, as his Brother was
against them, answering those that complained, Sheep turned Cannibals in
Warwickshire, eating up Men, Houses, and Towns, their Pastures make such
depopulation, That though they make Houses the fewer in that Country, they made
them the more in the Kingdom; Towns being more peopled by Clothing and Wool,
than the Country is depopulated by pasturage: Indeed (to use the words of a
modern Author in this Case;) Corn does visibly employ the poor in the place
where it grows by Plowing, Sowing, Mowing inning, threshing: but Wool
invisibly maintains people at many miles distance, by Carding, Spinning,
Weaving, Dressing, and Dying, so that Abel need not kill Cain; the Shepherd
undo the Husbandman, but both subsist comfortably together.

What service he did his Majesty and his Father during the Rebellion, we may
guess by the trust reposed in him since the Restoration; his Prudence and
Courage having been as effectual against the late Usurpation, as the Ash of his
Country (a stand of which in Pikes in his Country men's hands, under his Conduct
was impregnable) is against viperous Creatures, of which it, is said that a
Serpent incircled with fire, and the boughs thereof will in this Dilemma, put
it self rather on the hazard of fire, than adventure on the fence of
Ashen-boughs: but it is unhappy that he was like that Ash too, of which it is
written, that being cut down green, it burns clear and bright, as if the sap
thereof had a fire-feeding unctuousness therein.

This Gentleman having measured his thoughts of Good and Evil, by the respects
of a transitory life, but with relation to an eternal state, to which his life
was in his esteem only a state of trial, dyed (by an unhappy accident (a fall
off his Horse at Northampton) a truly wiseman, that had not respect to a few
things, the least of any man needing that deathbed Repentance he used so much
to plead for of the opposite opinion, to which he would say That it was a
Tenent that would make heaven very empty; and yet never the more room there for
the maintainers of so uncharitable opinion: leaving this observation of the
late Usurpation, that the ruin of it was the old, but not so well-weighed
custom of Tyrants to cut off all those steps, by which they ascended to their
height, left leaving those stairs standing, others also might climb up the same
way.

THE Life and Death OF Sir SPENCER COMPTON.
A Fourth Brother of this Noble Family, of whom the excellent Dr. Pierce in his
Sermon upon his Parallel Mr. Peito, delivered this Character at Chesterton,
That he was a Person so singularly qualified by Grace, Nature, and Education,
that however his extraction was highly Noble, yet he thought he might
confidently say it was the lowest thing in him.

An happy Person, that from a due estimate of himself and this world, arrived
at just thoughts of his work in the world; and finding his duty engraven in his
Being, lived as a man ought to do, who being a middle person between those
purely intellectual Beings that could not enjoy this world, and the purely
sensual that could not understand it, was pitched upon as the fittest creature
to inhabit this world, soberly enjoying the comforts of it, and seriously and
devoutly reflecting on the Author of it.

A Person that had just sentiments of the dignity of humane Nature in himself,
and an universal Charity for it in others; one that measured not the wisdom he
studied by the subtilty and curiosity of Speculation, by fineness of thoughts,
depth of design, but a Noble design to keep up the Dignity of Mankind, by a
discreet piety toward the first Being, by a sober and due government of his
own actions; and a public justice and kindness toward all men, confining all
thoughts of glory within the compass of virtue; and being good, and thinking
nothing more dishonorable than sin; and being bad, pitying those ruins of
mankind that had nothing about them but laughter and the shape of men, and
thought themselves then to act most like men, when they approach nearest
beasts; and so hitting upon right Principles, lived a great deal of life in a
little time.

When I consider how ingeniously upon the great principles of Reason and
Religion, he would baffle those unhappy men, who having betrayed their
weakness, in giving themselves over to lewd courses, throw away that little wit
in defending them! how successfully would he reprove them, who, as he said,
laughed themselves into eternal misery, to this purpose: Ah! Sirs, it is easier
to laugh at goodness, than to practice it, it were worth the while to mock at
sin, if so we could annihilate it; and make it as well nothing in it self, as
to us. If the nature of things would so far vary with our humors, that goodness
would be less excellent by being despised, or sin less dangerous by being
thought so; urging them to name the man in all the Histories of the world, to
whom the very suspicion of evil was not a dishonor, though the real guilt of it
were now a glory. A discourse so much the more effectual from him, because he
prevented the common cavil made against dehortation from sin, That it was only
a thing some men live by declaining against, and others cannot live without the
practice; being as much by his virtue above the latter imputation, as he was by
his fortune above the first.

What a vast progress he made through all solid and gentle Learning, that was
either for ornament or use; and what a great proficiency in the experimental
part of Religion, I cannot but annex to his life those words, that being made
perfect in a short time Right honest, was to him a nobler title than Right
Honorable; and therefore he adhered to his Sovereign the closer, for that which
others deserted him, viz. his afflicted virtue; following the misfortunes of
that Court, the pleasures whereof he would have avoided and been afraid of,
choosing it, surely then, as the great Scene of Virtue; for though his
extraction was noble, his fortune fair, his abilities great by nature, and
greater by art and industry; yet was his modesty and meekness so far beyond all
these, that the only vice we knew him guilty of, that he made it his business,
rather to hide, than to exercise his virtue. And those two virtues (his modesty
and his meekness) made him so swift to hear, so low to speak, as appeared when
he was pleased to express himself, speaking much in (...) Homer.
few words, equally free from impertinency and superfluity.

A sober, honest, and good man, three of the most illustrious Titles of Honor
in the world, ^that led so well composed a life as he did, must needs have an
easy death as he had, the (...), the happy calmness of death, the Emperor
Augustus was used to wish for; for though sick of a Feavor, yet the union
between his soul and body was not violently broken, but leisurely untied; they
parting like two friends, not by a rude falling out, but a loving farewell: A
farewell to all the contentments of the world, not easily parallelled; for
calling to him such excellent and reverend persons, then at Bruges, when he
died, 1659. as Dr. Morley, and Dr. Earls, he raised himself upon his Pillow,
and held out his arms, as if he were to embrace one, saying, O my Jesus! and
intimating the comforts that then flowed in from the holy Jesus into his soul;
after which holy ecstasy, composing himself to a calm and serious discourse,
like Jacob scattering blessing when gathered, he said to the then standers by,
Exh^^ti^g some to sicquent prayers, others to temperance, others to seriousness.
O be good, O be virtuous! etc. An argument of the sincerity of his own
goodness, that he was so zealous to have it communicated to others; it being
natural, as well to the living Christian, as to other living things, to beget
his like. Departing, as much desired when he was gone, as admired by those that
knew him whilst living, a loyal Subject, a generous Man, a good Christian, a
loving Master, and entire Friend, an excellent Neighbor, and a very
extraordinary Example; one of those to whose virtues and prayers winning upon
men, and prevailing with God, we owe our Restoration.

THE Life and Death OF Mr. HENRY COMPTON.
OUT of respect to the Right Honorable the Earl of Northampton, I have put
together the distant Lives and Deaths of his three Brothers; and to keep on in
the name, I annex Henry Comptons, Son of Sir Henry Compton of Surrey. I think
the very same Sir Henry Compton, of whom I find this Note in Haberdashers-hall.

Sir Henry Compton of Brambleton, Com. Sussex, with 300 l. per annum settled
1372 02 00

A sober and a civil person this Henry Compton was, unhappy only in bad
Company, which are apt to ensnare good natures, that like the good fellow
Planet Mercury, is much swayed by neighbor Influences. No Company is
uncomfortable (gladness its self would grieve for want of one to express its
self to joy, like heat loses strength for want of reflection) but bad Company
is infectious, unless a man had the art, when with them, not to be of them:
Like the River Dee in Merionith-shire, which running through Pimblemcer,
remains entire, and mingleth not her streams with the water of the Lake. But it
were Tyranny to trample on him for those infirmities, he so often lay prostrate
before God for, and what God has graciously forgotten, let no man
despightfully remember.

His fall was as much the triumph of the Rebels, as his life was their shame;
doing even when Religion was nothing but discourse, better than they could
speak; his heart being better than their very tongues.

The occasion of his death was the same with that of the Nations ruin,
Iealousies, and a strange suspicion, that because a Lady, my Lord Chandois
Courted for him, his entire Friend and constant Bedfellow, had a greater
kindness for my Lord himself, than for him; that my Lord spoke two words for
himself, for one he spoke for him.

Jealousy, the rage of this good man, that shot vipers through his soul, not
to be pacified with the arguments urged, the mediations used, the protestations
made, though the most rational, and the best natured man living, after three
days interposal, especially upon some mad fellows suggesting to his relenting
thoughts, That it would be Childrens play to Challenge and not to Fight. How
passion diverts reason, and lust overcomes? and that unhallowed heat toward a
Mistress, the more sacred respect toward a Friend, through whose heart he must
needs make a way to the other heart that scorned him.

Fond men, that undervalue themselves so much, as to kill a man, that they may
enjoy the pleasures of a beast; fond hope, to expect satisfaction in the
enjoyment of that person, whom we cannot see without a guilt, that will make a
Bed of Down a torment; when each blush of the woman, puts in mind of the blood
shed for her, when each embrace recollects the last parting of dearest friends;
when we cannot feel the wound love makes without a greater, from the thoughts
of that hatred it gave. Blind love indeed, that killest the choicest friends
for the deadliest foes! a strange way really to hate, out of suspicion that we
may be hated; to be miserable, for fear of being miserable: But see the hand of
God, to whom they appealed; he that would needs fight, falls; and be that would
not, conquers, though the odds of Mr. Comptons side was five to one.

Duels (those exercises that become neither men, for men should reason and
beasts fight; nor Christian, whose honor it is to suffer injuries, but neither
to give, nor retaliate any) generally favor the most unwilling, as honor the
thing they fight for, being a shadow follows him most that flies it.

THE Life and Death OF GEORGE, Lord CHANDOIS.
THE flames of Eteocles and Polynices, who had been at variance in the Field,
when they lived, divided in their Urnes, when they were dead. Not so here, but
as a little dust thrown over them, reduces Bees that swarm to a settlement; so
a little earth cast upon them, compose the most mortal enemies to a
reconciliation; our Passing Bells duly extinguishing our heats and
animosities, as the Curfue-Bell rung in William the Conquerors time every night
at eight of the clock, put out all Fires and Candles.

These noble persons, divided in their death, shall be united in their history,
as they were in their lives; the great patterns of friendship agreeable in
their tempers, infinitely obliging in their converse (for though they were
always together, yet (such the great variety of their accomplishments) every
hour they enjoyed one another, had its fresh pleasures; pleasures not allayed,
but increased by enjoyment) open and clear in their carrage, mutually confident
in their trusts, faithful in their reproofs and admonitions, tender in each
others weaknesses and failings, ready to serve one another occasions,
impatient of Vel present^^ d^sideramu^.
absence (for they lived and dwelt together) careful and jealous in each others
concerns; in a word, observing the exact measures of the noblest relation in
the world, Friendship.

Bruges Lord Chandois, Baron of Sudely in the County of Gloucester, descended
from G^^^ Daughter of Ethrelred, a Saxon King of this Land, and Walter de Main
a Nobleman of Normandy: His Ancestor Sir Io. Bruges (created Baron Chandois of
Sudely, 1 Mariae 1553.) being under God the instrument of saving Being
Leiutenant of the Tower, when a Warrant was brought to Execute Queen Eliz. he
showed it Queen Mary, who ^rofessed that she knew nothing of it and so saved
her.
Queen Elizabeth's life, as he was one of the many Noblemen that would have
saved King Charles.

For when the great part of the Peers, who were of the most Ancient Families
and Noblest Fortunes, and a very great number of the House of Commons, persons
of just hopes and fair Estates, withdrew to weaken those designs; which though
they discovered, they durst not in London oppose, my Lord retired with the
first, Witnessing the justice and honor of the Kings pro^eedings, June 15. and
engaging to defend his Majesty's Crown and Dignity, together with his just and
legal Prerogative, the true Protestant Religion Established by Law, the lawful
Liberties of the Subjects of England, with the just Privileges of his Majesty
and both his Houses of Parliament, against all Persons and Power whatsoever,
not obeying any Orders or Commands whatsoever not waranted by the known Laws of
the Land, June 13. 1644. at York under his Hand and Seal.

And according to this Declaration, he hastened into Gloucestershire, first to
disabuse the people. 1. Concerning the Idle and Seditious Scandals raised upon
the King and his Government. 2. Touching Illegal Levies made, and Forces raised
by a pretended Ordinance of the Militia, without the Kings Authority, against
the known Laws of the Land; being as active in dispersing his Majesty's
Proclamations and Declarations, as others were in carrying about the Factious
Pamphets; and when (those courses wanted their just effects, because of the
judicial infatuation and delusion, poor people were given up to) to stop these
horrid beginnings of a Civil War, by arming Tenants and Servants (raising, with
Abraham, an Army out of his own house) and by Garrison his house (which by the
Law is every man's Castle) at Sudeley near Winchcomb in Gloucestershire, seated
on the meetings of the Vails and Woulds very commodiously to defend and command
the Country, especially my Lords three darlings, as he called them, the Here Is
the sundry Oaks in the Wood^, which the Spaniard in Queen Eliz time d^ contrive
by secret practices to have cut down and embezled, and therefore they say he
was the first that proposed the setting up of Iron, mills thereabout.
Woods, the Clothing, and the Iron-work of that Country; with near a 1000. men
and 5000 l. in Plate, he waits upon his Majesty at Shrewsbury, and thence (the
Lord Say being too hard for him at home, surprising his house, and making an
intolerable havoc, an essay to that plundering wherewith my Lord made them
odious in those parts) all along to Edgehill, Branford, and Oxford, where his
Majesty observed that his Counsels were well-grounded and happy, and his
performances quick, and well-designed. His Castle in the mean time (too narrow
a Sphere for his own activity) under the Command of Captain Bridges, and some
sixty Soldiers being besieged by Massy, with 300 Musketeers and three
Companies of Dragoons, and two Sakers, after a long Siege, several Assaults and
Batteries, when they were almost smoothered by the smoke of Hay and Barns
burned about the house, yielded Ian. 1642. a loss revenged by my Lord at
Newbury, Sept. 20. 16^^. when with the Earls of Caernarvon, and Northampton,
the true Heir of his Fathers valor, Commanding his Majesty's Horse there, the
King said, Let Chandois alone, his Errors are safe.

From which Battle he went to Gloucester to secure several Garrisons, which he
kept round about Sudeley, to hinder the Correspondence between Gloucester and
Warwick, and consequently between it and London, gathering a Cloud about
Gloucester (that only eyesore to his Majesty's Affairs in those parts) and
disposing of himself at Chettenham, the Lord Herbert and Sir John Winter in the
Forest; the Irish Forces on this side Berkley, and the Oxford at Painswick and
Stroud; so effectually, that he recovreed Sudeley, and distressed Gloucester,
till he was called with other Lords, Ian. 22. 1643. to the Parliamentary
Convention at Oxford, made up of such honorable Members as could not with
safety and honor sit where they were called by Writ, as the King, to advise
with whom they were called, could not at Westminster; where he subscribed a
Letter of Accommodation to the Earl of Essex, Ian. 27. to the Privy Council,
and the Conservations of the Peace of the Kingdom of Scotland, in pursuance of
the Act of Pacification against the Scots, Invasion, Ian. 29. and to the men at
Westminster, Feb. 6. 1643. all full of all the reason, condescension, and all
lawful compliance in the world for the Peace of the Kingdom, as were the
several Messages for Treaty of Peace, a free and full Parliament, sent during
that Session of Parliament, which concluded April 15. 1644. with an humble
Petition to his Majesty to continue his Care and Resolutions for the
maintenance of the true Religion, the established Laws, frequent Parliaments
and Synods, strict Discipline in the Army, with as much regard as can be to the
ease of the Subjects, in whose behalf they prayed that the present exigencies
of War, and Necessity, might not be drawn into example.

For these public Services he made a shift to deserve (besides frequent
Imprisonments, a Sequestration from his Countries service, and being turned to
herd with the Commons) this heavy Composition, George Lord Chandois 3975 10 00
and what escaped Sequestration, he bestowed in generous relief of Reverend and
excellent Persons, who wanted not their own Estates as long as he had any of
his, many Cavaliers he entertained; all according to their respective
qualities: he did endeavor to serve and promote, among others, the accomplished
Mr. H. Compton, dear to him for his relations sake, and dearer for his virtues;
virtues! that sweetened sad times, and made the owners of them happier in
enjoying themselves, than the world.

This excellent Person admitted to his own affections, he indeavored to
recommend to a Ladies of his acquaintance, who vouchsafed him (whose Fortune
and Person was below few Matches in the Kingdom) that respect for my Lords sake
while his Lady lived, that to his great trouble she would needs force upon
himself when she dyed; which Mr. Compton was so transported with (though my
Lord protested against her kindness to him, and directed Mr. Compton to prevent
it, by pressing his Marriage with her, telling him one morning as they were
abed together, that he should find she was a Woman, and fickle) above the
meekness of his nature, and of Religion (that in the precepts and examples of
it, has taught mankind to suffer the greatest evils before they do the least,
and supposed its Professors so meek, humble, patient, and charitable, that it
has nothing against shedding of blood more than the Injunctions of nature; and
Moses (he being looked upon as an Apostate, who renounceth Christ, that quits
his patience to give way to wrath) to take up a course begun by wicked and
branded Cain, the first Dueller (who as the Syriack, Chaldee, and LXX. read
that Text, said to his Brother, Let us go into the field) and continued against
all the Civil and Sacred Laws that obtained among all Vid. Hotcomm and Spelm in
verbo Ordeal.
sober people, only by the Goths and Vandals (who not enduring the ingenious
way of ending Controversies by Reason and Law, brought in the barbarous kind
of decisions by handling hot Iron, walking barefoot on burning Coals, scalding
Water, and the brutish Combat, or Duel) and first affront my Lord, and since he
was like Love, not easily provoked; afterward challenge him, who in point of
honor, as young Gallants cant, must answer him, and show that he understood not
the value of his honorable life; only satisfy two or three Hectors, that
forsooth he feared not death; setting up his own Honor against the humor of
Orlando Furioso, Christ's express precept, and example of meekness and patience;
as if it were not an higher honor to pass by and pity trivial offenses, than
only to quarrel with them, since by the last we are even with our adversary,
and by the first above him.

Loath was my Lord at first, and loath both when they had slept at Brentford,
where Mr. C. had an ominous Dream, a fair warning to awaken his reason (that
like Christ was asleep in this storm of his passion, from him who sometimes
speaks by dreams, sometimes by Visions in the night) to sacrifice their lives
to their own, and a Ladies follies, till edged on by some of their unhappy
company, who swore, What? Childrens play; nay but you shall fight. They did
very honorably indeed fore-go their Lives, the one to the Sword of his Friend,
and the other to the mercy of the Law; Mr. This is remarkal^ in this story,
that Mr. G^se^led his Estate upon the aforesaid Lady, and that she the next day
after his death made it (...) to his relations.
Compton (who was told by him that he needed not to have used a Sword to search
into his breast, which when if he should open, he would say (he said) that he
had killed a Friend; (though he never loved the man as Friend, that he feared
as an Enemy) but was not heard by him, who thought it was his art to woo)
lying at his mercy as he did (which troubled him most of all, that he must beg
his life of those that had forfeited theirs) at the cruel mercy of the
Usurpers, dying a while after of the Small Pox, 1655/6.

THE Life and Death Of the Right Honorable ROBERT DORMER, Earl of Caernarvon.
RObert Dormer (Grandchild to Robert Dormer Esquire Created Baronet by King James,
June 10. 1615. and Baron Dormer of Wing in Buckingham-shire, the thirtieth of
the same Month in the same year) was by King Charles in the fourth year of his
Reign made Viscount Ascot, and Earl of Caernarvon, a Person of whom King
Charles the First might say, as Lewis the 13 th. said of his Favorite Luynes,
that considering the debonairness of his temper when disposed to be merry, he
was a very fit man to be trusted with the Kings Majesty's Game, as he was,
being by a Grant to him and his Heirs Chief Avenor: and with respect to the
vastness of his parts when disposed to be serious, he was very capable of the
most concerning trust, which he had by Pattent, as Lord Lieutenant. His nature
was not so much wild, as great: and his spirit rather extraordinary than
extravagant; to be admired rather than blamed, as what age and experience fixed
every day more and more into a comprehensive wisdom, a deep understanding, a
strong resolution, and a noble activity. His Recreations were rather expensive
than brutish, not unmanning his person, as Drunkenness, etc. which he hated
perfectly, he being prone of those that gave occasion to the scandalous, and
odiously comparitive Proverb, As drunk as a Lord, as drunk as a Beggar; but if
moderately used, becoming his Dignity as Gaming, etc. which he affected
inordinately, though he left this caution to Posterity: That he that makes
playing his business, makes his business a play; and that Gaming swallow
Estates, as the Gulf did Curtius and his Horse. A man knows where he begins
that pleasure, but is utterly ignorant where he shall end; besides, that there
is no pleasure worthy an excellent spirit in high Gaming, which can have no
satisfaction in it, besides either sordid Coveting of what is another, or a
foolish Prodigality of what is their own; making that breach in their own
inheritance sometimes in one week, which they and their Heirs cannot repair in
many years. The temperature of his mind as to moral habits, was rather
disposed to good than evil; he was a Courtier and a young Man, a Profession,
and an Age prone to such desires, as when they tend to the shedding of no Man's
blood, to the ruin of no family, humanity sometimes connives at, though she
never approves of; so that we may say of this Great man, as one does of a
greater, That those things we wish in him, are fewer than the things we praise.

Being a Servant, not only to his Majesty's Prosperity, but to his Person;
waiting on him, not out of Interest, but out of Love and Conscience; no sooner
appeared the Conspiracy in Buckingham-shire, but he discountenanced it upon all
occasions, with his interest; and when it brake out in the North, he Marched to
oppose it with two thousand men, whom (when he could in Parliament, neither
save the Life of his Majesty's most faithful Servant, not preserve the Honor of
his Majesty's Person, being resolved rather to perish with the known Laws of
the Land, than to countenance them that designed the overthrow of them) he led,
to wait on his Majesty to York, where having, with the rest of the Nobility,
attested the integrity of his Majesty's proceedings, and vowed his defense,
under his Hand and Seal, he Rendezvouzed, Marching to settle the Commission of
Array, in Oxfordshire and Buckingham-shire, with so much activity, that we
find him with the Earls of Cumberland, New Castle, and Rivers, excepted by the
Party at Westwinster, out of the first Indemnity, In the fourth Article of
Essex his commission.
1642. they offered for their actions in behalf of his Majesty, as the Earl of
Bristol, the Lords Viscount Newarke and Faulkland, Sir Edward Hyde, Sir Edward
Nicholas, Master Endymion Porter, were for their Counsels and Writing. And
having disciplined his Regiment, we find him the Reserve generally to the
Kings Horse in all Engagements, as first to Prince Rupert in Edgehill, where
his error was too much heat, in pursuing an advantage against the Enemies
Horse, in the mean time deserting and leaving naked his own Foot; and
afterward to the Lord Willmot at Roundway-down, where by Charging near, and
Drawing up his men to advantage, not above six in a File, that they might all
engage, he turned the fortune of the day, as he had done at Newbury, (receiving
Sir Philip Stapleton with this Regiment of Horse, and Essex his Lifeguard with
a brisk Charge, and pursuing them to their Foot) had not a private hand put an
end to his life and actions, when breathing out his last, he asked, Whether the
King was in safety? Dying with the same care of his Majesty, that he lived.

So he lost his life, fighting for him who gave him his honor, at the first
September. 20. 1643.
battle of Newbury. Being sore wounded, he was desired by a Lord, to know of
him, what suit he would have to his Majesty in his behalf? the said Lord
promising to discharge his trust, in presenting his request, and assuring him,
that his Majesty would be willing to gratify him to the utmost of his power.
To whom the Earl replied, I will not dye with a Suit in my mouth to any King,
save to the King of Heaven.

By Anne Daughter to Philip Earl of Pembrook and Mountgomery, he had Charles
now Earl of Caernarvon. From his noble extract he received not more honor than
he gave; it for the blood that was conveyed to him, through so many
illustrious veins, he derived to his Children, more maturated for renown; and
by a constant practice of goodness, more habituated to virtue. His youth was
prepared for action by study, without which even the most eminent parts of
Noblemen seem rough and unpleasant, in dispight of the splendour of their
fortune: But his riper years endured not those retirements, and therefore brake
out into manlike exercises at home, and travail abroad. None more Noble, yet
none more modest; none more Valiant, yet none more patient.

A Physician at his Father-in-laws Table gave him a Lie, which put the Company
to admire, on the one hand the man's impudence, and on the other my Lords
mildness; until he said, I Will take the Lie from him, but I Will never take
Physic of him: He may speak what does not become him, I Will not do what is
unworthy of me. A virtue this! not usual in Noblemen, to whom the limits of
equity seem a restraint, and therefore are more restless in injuries.

In the midst of horror and tumults, his soul was sere^e and calm. As humble he
was as patient. Honor and Nobility, to which nothing can be added, has no
better way to increase, than when secured of its own greatness, it humbles it
self, and at once obliges love, and avoideth envy. His carriage was a
condescending as Heroic, and his speech as weighty as free; he was too great
to envy any man's parts and virtues, and too good to encourage them; many times
would he stoop with his own spirit, to raise other men's. He neglected the
minutes and little circumstances of compliance with vulgar humors, aiming at
what was more solid and more weighty: Moderate men are applauded, but the
Heroic are never understood.

Constant he was in all that was good: This was his Heroic expression, when
solicited by his Wives Father, to desist from his engagement with the King,
Leave me to my Honor and Allegiance. No security to him worth a breach of
trust, no interest worth being unworthy. His conduct was as eminent in war, as
his carriage in peace; many did he oblige by the generosity of his mind, more
did he awe with the hardiness of his body; which was no more softened to sloth,
the dalliances of a Court, than the other was debauched to carelessness by the
greatness of his fortunes. His prudence was equal to his valor, and could
entertain dangers as well as despise them; for he not only undeceived his
enemies surmises, but exceeded his own friends opinion in the conduct of his
Soldiers; of whom he had two cares, the one to his discipline, the other to
preserve them; therefore they were as completely armed without, as they were
well appointed within; that surviving their first dangers, they might attain
that experience and resolution, which is in vain expected from young and raw
Soldiers.

To this conduct of a General, he added the industry of a Soldier, doing much
by his performances, more by his example; that went as an active soul to
enliven each part, and the whole of his brave Squadron. But there is no doubt,
but personal and private sins may often times overballance the justice of public
engagements. Nor does God account every Gallant a fit instrument, to assert in
the way of war a righteous Cause; the event can never state the justice of any
Cause, nor the peace of men, consciences, nor the eternal fate of their souls.

They were no doubt Martyrs, who neglected their lives, and all that was dear
to them in this world, having no advantageous design by any innovation, but
were religiously sensible of those ^ies to God, the Church, their Country,
which lay upon their souls, both for obedience and just assistance.

God could, and I doubt not but he did, through his mercy crown many of them
with eternal life, whose lives were lost in so good a Cause; the destruction of
their bodies being sanctified a means to save their souls.

Such who object that he was extremely wild in his youth, put me in mind of
the return which one made to an ill natured man in a Company, who with much
bitterness had aggravated the loose youth of an aged and godly Divine; You have
proved (said he) what all knew before, with much pains, that Paul was a great
Persecutar before he was Converted: Besides that, as many then spoke more
demurely than they lived, he lived more strictly than he spoke; taking that
liberty in his discourse, he did not in his actions.

THE Life and Death OF EDWARD, Lord HERBERT Of Cherbury.
EDward Herbert, Son of Richard Herbert, Esquire, and Susan Newport his Wife,
was born at Mountgomery-Castle, and brought to Court by the Earl of Pembrooke,
where he was Knighted by King James, who sent him over Ambassador into France.
Afterward King Charles the First, Created him Baron of Castle-Island in
Ireland, and some years after Baron of Cherbury in Mountgomery-shire.

He was a most excellent Artist and rare Linguist, studied both in Books and
Men, and himself the Author of two Works most remarkable, viz. A. Treatise of
Truth, written in French, so highly prized beyond the Seas, and (they say) it
is extant at this day with great honor in the Popes Vatican. And an History of
King Henry the Eighth, wherein his Collections are full and authentic, his
Observation judicious, his Connection strong and coherent, and the whole exact.
He Married the Daughter and sole Heir of Sir William Herbert of St. Iulians in
Monmouth-shire, with whom he had a large inheritance in England and Ireland,
and died in August, Anno Domini, 1648. having designed a fair Monument of his
own invention, to be set up for him in the Church of Mountgomery, according to
the Model following; Upon the ground a Hath-pace of fourteen Foot square, on
the midst of which is placed a Dorick Column, with its right of Pedestal
Basis, and Capitols fifteen Foot in height, on the Capitol of the Column is
mounted a Vrn with a heart flamboul, supported by two Angels. The foot of this
Column is attended with four Angels, placed on Pedestals, at each corner of the
said Hath-pace; two having Torches reverst, Extinguishing the Motto of
Mortality; the other two holding up Palms, the Emblems of Victory.

When this Noble Person was in France, he had private Instructions from
England, to mediate a Peace for them of the Religion; and in case of refusal,
to use certain menaces. Accordingly, being referred to Luynes the Constable and
Favorite of France, he delivers him the Message, reserving his threatenings,
till he saw how the matter was relished. Luynes had hid behind the Curtains a
Gentleman of the Religion, who being an ear-witness of what passed, might
relate to his friends, what little expectations they ought to entertain from
the King of Englands intercession.

Luynes was very haughty, and would needs know what our King had to do with
their affairs. Sir Edward replied; It is not to you, to whom the King my Master
owes an account of his actions; and for me it is enough that I obey him. In
the mean time, I must maintain, That my Master has more reason to do, what he
does, than you to ask, why he does it? Nevertheless, if you desire me in a
gentle fashion, I shall acquaint you further.

Whereupon Luynes bowing a little, said, very well. The Ambassador answered,
That it was not on this occasion only, that the King of Great Britain had
desired the Peace and Prosperity of France, but upon all other occasions, when
ever any War was raised in that Country, and this he said was his first reason.
The second was, That when a Peace was settled there, his Majesty of France,
might be better disposed to assist the Palatine in the affairs of Germany.
Luynes said, We will have none of your advices. The Ambassador replied, That he
took that for an answer, and was sorry only that the affection, and the good
will of the King his Master was not sufficiently understood; and that since it
was rejected in that manner, he could do no less than say, That the King his
Master knew well enough what he had to do. Luynes answered, We are not afraid
of you. The Ambassador smiling a little, replied, If you had said you had not
loved us, I should have believed you, and made another answer: In the mean
time, all that I will tell you more is, That we know very well what we have to
do. Luynes hereupon rising from his Chair, with a fashion and countenance a
little discomposed, said, By God, if you were not Mounsieur the Ambassador, I
know very well how I would use you. Sir Edward Herbert rising also from his
Chair, said, That as he was his Majesty of Great Britains Ambassador, so he
was also a Gentleman, and that his Sword whereon he laid his hands, should do
him reason if he had taken any offense. After which Luynes replying nothing,
the Ambassador went on his way toward the door, and Luynes seeming to accompany
him, he told him there was no occasion to use such Ceremony after such
Language, and departed, expecting to hear further from him: But no message
being brought him from Luynes, he had in pursuance of his Instructions, a more
civil Audience of the King at Coignac, where the Marshal of St. Geran told him
he had offended the Constable, and he was not in a place of Security here:
Whereunto he answered, That he held himself to be in a place of security
wheresoever he had his Sword by him.

Luynes resenting the affront^ got Cadenet his Brother Duke of Chaun, with a
ruffling train of Officers (whereof there was not one, as he told King James,
but had killed his man) as an Ambassador Extraordinary to mis-report their
Traverses so much to the disparagement of Sir Edward, that the Earl of Carlisle
sent to accomdate le Mal Entendu, that might arise between the two Crowns, got
him called home; until the Gentleman behind the Curtains, out of his duty to
Truth and Honor, related all circumstances so, as that it appeared, that though
Luynes gave the first affront, yet Sir Edward kept himself within the bounds of
his Instructions and Honor, very discreetly and worthily. Insomuch that he fell
on his knees to King James before the Duke of Buckingham, to have a Trumpeter,
if not an Herald, sent to Mounsieur Luynes, to tell him, that he made a false
relation of the passages before mentioned, and that Sir Edward Herbert would
demand reason of him with Sword in hand on that point. The King answered, He
would take it into consideration: But Luynes a little after dyed, and Sir Edw.
was sent Ambassador to France again, and otherwise employed so, that if it had
not been for fear and jealousies, the bane of public services, he had been as
great in his actions, as in his writings; and as great a Statesman, as he is
confessed a Scholar.

THE Life and Death OF Dr. JOHN WILLIAMS, Lord Archbishop of York.
DOctor John Williams, born at Aber Conway in Caernarvon-shire, bred Fellow of
St. John's College in Cambridge, and Proctor of that University, has this
Character That a strong Constitution made his parts, a strict Education
improved them; unwearied was his Industry, unexpressible his capacity. He never
saw the Book of worth he read not, he never forgot what he read; he never lost
the use of what he remembered: Every thing he heard or saw was his own; and what
was his own, he knew how to use to the utmost. His Extraction being Gentile,
his large and Noble, his Presence and Carriage comely and stately, his Learning
Copious, his Judgment stayed, his Apprehension clear and searching, his
Expression lively and Effectual, his Elocution flowing and Majestic, his
Proctorship, 1612. discovered him a Person above his Place; and his Lectures to
his Pupils, above his Preferment. Bishop Vaughan first admitted him to his
Family, and then to his bosom; there his strong Sermons, his exact Government
(under my Lord,) his plentiful observation, his numerous acquaintance, made him
my Lord Chancellor Egertons Friend, rather than his Servant; his Familiar,
rather than his Chaplain. Never was there a more communicative Master to
instruct, than my Lord Elsemere; never a more capable Scholar to learn than Dr.
Williams, who had instilled to him all necessary State Maxims while his old
Master lived, and had bequeathed unto him four excellent Books when his Master
was dead. These four Books he presented to King James the very same time that
he offered himself to the Duke of Buckingham; The excellent Prince observed him
as much for the first gift, as the Noble Duke (of Buckingham) did for the
second: The King and Duke made him their own, who they saw had made that
excellent Book his. Willing was King James to advance Clergymen, and glad to
meet with men capable of advancements. His two Sermons at Court made him Dean
of Westminster; his exact state of the Earl of Somersets Case made him capable
of, and the Kings inclination to trust his Conscience in a Divines hand, settled
him in a Lord Keepers place actually, only for three years to please the
people, (who were offended with his years, now but thirty four, and his Calling
a Divine^ but designedly for ever to serve his Majesty. The Lawyers despised
him Sir Edward Cook has somewhere a saying that Divines meddle with Law, but
they commit great Errors.
at first, but the Judges admired him at last: and one of them said, That never
any man apprehended a Case so clearly, took in (...) the Law, Reason, and other
Circumstances more punctually, recollected the various Debates more faithfully,
summed it up more compendiously, and concluded more judiciously and discreetly:
For many of them might have read more than he, but none digested what they had
read more solidly; none disposed of their reading more methodically, none
therefore commanded it more readily. He demurred several Orders, as that of my
Lord Chancellors pardon, the Earl Marshals Pattent, etc. to let his Majesty see
his Judgment; yet passed them, to let him see his Obedience: He would question
the Dukes Order sometimes discreetly, to let him know he understood himself;
yet he would yield handsomely, to let him see he understood him: and indeed he
had the admirable faculty of making every one of his actions carry prudence in
the performance. Necessary it was, for one of his years and place, to keep his
distance, to avoid contempt; yet fatal was to him to do so, and incur envy.
Well understood he the interest of all his places, and resolutely he maintained
them. What, says he, shall the Liberties of Westminster he infringed, when the
chief Favorite is Steward, and the Lord Keeper D^an, and I the Contemptible man
that must be trampled on? When he was in trouble, what passion, what
insinuation, what condescension has he at command? when Petitioned to, how
quickly he looked through men and business? how exactly would he judge, and how
resolutely conclude, without an immediate intimation from his Majesty or the
Duke? Many eyes were upon him, and as many eyes were kept by him upon others;
being very watchful on all occasions to accommodate all emergencies, and meet
with all humors, always keeping men in dependence on the Duke, according to
this intimation of his -- Cabal 287. Let him hold it, but by your Lordships
favor, not his own power. A good way, had he been constant to it, the neglect
whereof undid him; for designing the promotion of Dr. Price to the Bishopric
of Armagh, he moved it to the Duke, who told him it was disposed of to Dr.
Usher. Whereupon he went his own way to advance that man, and overthrew
himself: for then his Lord let him feel what he had threatened my Lord Bacon
when he advanced him; That if he did not owe his Preferment always to his
favor, he should owe his fall to his frown. The peremptoriness of his judgment
rendered him odious: his compliance with Bristol, suspected; and his Sermon at
King James's Funeral (his trial, rather than his Preferment) obnoxious. His
spirit was great to act, and too great to suffer. It was prudence to execute
his Decrees against all opposition while in power; it was not so, to bear up
his miscarriages against all Authority, while in disgrace. A sanguine
Complexion, with its Resolutions, do well in pursuit of success: Phlegm and its
patience do better in a Retreat from micarriages. This he wanted, when (it may
be thinking fear was the passion of King Charles's Government as well as King
James) he seconded his easy fall with loud and open discontents, and those
discontents, with a chargeable defense of his Servants that were to (...)
justify them, and all ^^th that unsafe popularity, invidious pomp, and close
irregularity that laid him open to too many active persons that watched him.
Whether his standing out against Authority to the perplexing of the Government
in the Star Chamber in those troublesome times; his entertainment and favor for
the Discontented and Non-Conformists, his motions for Reformation and
Alteration in twelve things; his hasty and unlucky Protestation in behalf of
the Bishops, and following actions in England and Wales, where its all men's
wonders to hear of his M^ruit su^ (...) had those private grounds and reasons,
that if the Bishop could have spoken with the King but half an hour, he said,
would have satisfied him, the King of Kings only knows, to whom he has given
I hope a better account than any Historian of his time has given for him.

But I understand better his private inclinations, than his public actions;
the motions of his nature, than those of his power; the Conduct of the one
being not more reserved and suspicious, than the effects of the other manifest
and noble: for not to mention his Libraries erected and furnished at St. John's
and Westminster, his Chapel in Lincoln College; the Repairs of his Collegiate
Church, his Pensions to Scholars more numerous than all the Bishops and
Noblemen besides, his Rent Charges on all the Benefices in his gift as Lord
Keeper, or Bishop of Lincoln, to maintain hopeful youth, according to a Statute
in that Case provided. Take this remarkable instance of his Munificence; that
when Du Moulin came over he calls his Chaplain, now the Right Reverend Father
in God, John With whom he was very familiar, calling him to an account about
his fludy every night, and conser^ing with him about Affairs and Histo^ies.
Lord Bishop of Coventry and Litchfield, and tells him, he doubted the good
man was low, wishing him to repair to him with some Money, and his respects,
with assurance that he would wait upon him himself at his first leisure. The
excellent Doctor rejoices, that he could carry him no less than twenty pounds;
The Noble Bishop replied, he named not the sum, to sound his Chaplains mind;
adding, that twenty pounds was neither fit for him to give, nor for the
Reverend Forreigner to receive; Carry, said he, an hundred pounds.

He is Libelled by common fame for unchaste, though those that understood the
privacies and casualties of his Infancy, report him but one degree removed from
a Misogonist; Though to palliate his infirmities, he was most complete in
Courtly addresses. The conversableness of this Bishop with Women consisted
chiefly (if not only) in his Treatments of great Ladies and Persons of honor,
wherein he did personate the compleatness of Courtesy to that Sex; otherwise a
Woman was seldom seen in his house, which therefore had always more
Magnificence than Neatness, sometimes defective in the Punctilio's and Niceties
of Daintiness, lying lower than Masculine Cognizance, and as level for a Woman's
eye to espy, as easy for her hand to amend.

He suffers for conniving at Puritans, out of hatred to Bishop Loud; and for
favoring Papists out of love to them; yet whatever he offered King James (when
the Match went on in Spain) as a Counselor, or whatever he did himself as a
Statesman; such kindness he had for our Liturgy, that he translated and Printed
it at his own Cost into Spanish, and used it in the Visitation of Melvin, when
sick to his own peril, in the Tower; and such resolution for Episcopacy, that
his late Majesty of blessed Memory said once to him; My Lord, I commend you
that you are no whit daunted with all Disasters, but are zealous in defending
your Order. Please it your Majesty, replied the Archbishop, I am a true
Welshman, and they are observed never to run away till their General first
forsakes them, no fear of any flinching, while your Majesty does countenance
our Cause.

His Extraction was Gentile and Ancient, as appeared from his Ancestors estate
He left 1000l. per annum to his Heir, who is a Knight and Beronet, dying March
25. 1 (4). when it was a question whether his R^^t belonged to his ^^^^cuto, or
his Heir.
which was more than he could purchase without borrowing, when at once Lord
Keeper, Bishop of Lincoln, and Dean of Westminster. His mind great and
resolute, insomuch that he controuled all other advices to his last, to his
loss in Wales; and daunted Sir Sir J^hn Cook, was sent to command him into the
Country out of his Deanery of Westminster. He asked (...) John how d^^st he
command a man out of his Freehold? which wrought upon the old Gentleman so
far, that he never rested until he had his pardon s^aled for it.
John Cook, as you may see in his Character to his honor in England.

His Wariness has these Arguments.

1. That he would not send the Seal to the King, but under Lock and Key.

2. That being to depute one to attend his place at the Coronation of King
Charles the First, he would not name his Adversary, Bishop Laud, to gratify
him; nor yet any other, to displease the King; but took a middle way, and
presented his Majesty a List of the Prebendaries, to avoid any exception,
referring the Election to his Majesty himself.

3. That he proposed a partial At the Meeting in Jerusalem-chamber, March 1641.
with 20. moderate Conformists and Non-conformists, appointed upon his motion to
consider of the reformation of discipline and government, worship and doctrine,
with the innova^ious lately crept into all of them.
Reformation of our Church to the Parliament, to prevent an utter extirpation
by it.

4. That he exposed others to the censure of the Parliament, 1625. to save
himself.

5. That he answered to several Examinations upon the strength of his memory,
without any the least advantage taken by his Antagonist.

This Character of his I think very exact; that his Head was a well-fitted
treasury, and his Tongue the fair key to unlock it; that he had as great a
memory, as could be reconciled with so good a judgment; that so quick his
parts, that others study went not beyond his nature; and their designed and
fore-laid performances, went not beyond his sudden and ready accommodations.
Only he was very open, and too free in discourse, disdaining to lie at a close
guard, as confident of the length and strength of his weapon.

The first eminent Performance that raised him, was the entertainment he made
1612. when Proctor to the Spanish Ambassadors, brought thither by my Lord
Chancellor Elsmere, where with the gracefulness of his presence, the great
ingenuity of his discourses, the comeliness of his Addresses, the short,
courtly, pleasant method of the Exercises, whereof he was Moderator; and
especially that skill in the Spanish tongue, wherewith he had prepared himself,
he did himself, the University, and the Nation so much right, that the Lord
Chancellor of England, and of the University, in the presence, and with the
approbation of the Spanish Ambassador, took his leave of him, with this
Character, That he had behaved himself so well in this Treat to the
Ambassadors, that he was fit to serve a King, and that he would see him as much
wellcomed at Court, as they were in the University.

He knew the value of an opportunity, whereof he would say, that every man had
it sooner or later, and the neglect or improvement of it, was the marring or
making of every man in the world, and therefore he hazarded the expense of his
present fortune, to furnish himself to a capacity for a new one. Having
occasion to appear in public but seldom, when he came up, he was very careful
in the choice, pertinenoy, and seasonableness of his subject, and in the
exactness of his composure, setting out at once the variety of his learning,
the strength of his parts, and the Se^ his Serm^ns on King James his buncial of
App^^el, of ^^^^ag.
choiceness of his observation and prudence.

The greater the performance was (whether a Speech, or a Sermon, or a Debate)
he was to undertake, the more liberty and recreation he took, to quicken and
open his spirits, and to clear his thoughts; aiming at two things, which he
said, was all we could add to former perfection,

1. Method.

And 2. Perspicuity.

He understood well the divided interests, and Faction of the Kingdom; and knew
as well how to make use of them being able to Buoy himself up at any time
against any one side by the cosistance of the other, presently striking in with
A^ he plainly told the Duke of B. at Oxford.
William Earl of Pembroke, and other Patriots, for the public good of the
Nation, as soon as he was deserted by George Duke of Buckingham, and other
Courtiers, that aimed only at their own personal interest.

After four years Imprisonment, 40000 l. losses, when restored as one of the
Minions of the Parliament, he disputed for Episcopacy in the House of Lords
unanswerably; he drew up a Demurrer in behalf of the Bishops, in regard of the
Tumults that disturbed the freedom of their Votes and Sitting 1641. whereof the
Lord Keeper professed it was the strongest Demurrer, and the fullest of Law,
that ever he saw in his life. And when with Stenelaidos the Ephor, he saw it in
vain for that party to stand debating with words, which was injured above
words, he contrived and modelled such an Association in North Wales to assert
that authority, under which he had suffered, as not only secured that Country
against the Rebels, but yielded his Majesty several very great and seasonable
Supplies. Until God punishing Rebellion with success, and suffering it to
overthrow the best Government, that it might with its own weight, as Rome did,
overturn its self. ( For take off the common principles, in which Rebels agree,
and the common persons, that keep them together with those principles; their
variety of humors, and interests bring them immediately to a division, and so
to a ruin, Match. Prince l. 2. c. 3. and on Livy, l. 6. c. 2.. 3. And he saw
that those rods upon our backs, might singly be broken, when they could not be
broke, united, and in a bundle.) He thought it prudence to make that
composition in time for Wales, to prevent plundering, and the making of it the
seat of war, which he saw must be made for all England; and the dreadful
stories of his declaring for the Parliament was nothing else, but his
garrisoning of his own house, and discountenancing some straggling Cavaliers,
that did no good, but lie upon the Countries themselves, and draw thither whole
Armies of the enemy to lie upon it too.

There being hardly any ingenious person in England, that he encouraged not,
stealing favors upon them in a way equally suiting with their occasion, and
their modesty; the very wretch that writ the Satyr upon him, Printed with
Cleavelands Poems, owing his heat to the wine in his Cellar; and his Vein, to
his Gold. For receiving twenty pieces of him, and despairing of more, to please
his new patrons in the next Alehouse, vomited this Libel upon his old one. A

THE Life and Death OF HENRY HAMOND, D. D.
WHEN Doctor Henry Hamond was born. His Birth.
( Aug. 18. 1605.) at Where it is thought Caesar first passed his Army over the
Thames.
Chersey in Surrey (a place equally indeared to the pious, but unfortunate,
King Henry VI. for bestowing on him a charitable Burial; and to the excellent,
but not understood, King Charles I. for giving this man a seasonable birth) the
hopeful circumstances of his relations, promised as much in his Infancy, as the
eminent passages of his life performed in his Manhood. Son he was to Dr. John
Hamond, that exact Critic; Grandchild to By his Mothers side.
Dr. Alexander Nowel, that reverend Divine; God-son to Whose Physician his
Father was S^ct. His Education.
Prince Henry, that great Spirit.

To Eaton he was sent in his Long-coats, initiated in Latin, Greek, yea, and
Hebrew too (Languages that seemed to be his Mother tongue, so early were they,
rather infused to him, than acquired by him) by his Fathers care; and to
Magdalen College in Oxford at thirteen, by Mr. A good Grecian, who had a hand
in the publication of Sir H. Savile^ Magnificent Saint Chrysostom.
Allens assistance, his good friend; and Mr. Bush his diligence, his excellent
Schoolmaster. Here they that taught him Philosophy, were not ashamed to learn
of him the Tongues, especially the Hebrew, so rare a Quality in that age, that
at first admission, as he had no less than eight Batchellors his Scholars for
Greek, so he entertained four Masters his Pupills for Hebrew; wherein, as in
the whole Circle of Learning, that though his Father (and in him all his
Interest) dyed, yet his own merit recommended him at once to the honor and
advantage of Demi in that College at fourteen years of age, of Fellow at
nineteen, of Natural Philosophy-Reader at twenty, and the Orator at Dr.
Langtons Funeral at twenty two.

Having taken his Degree, Sect H^^ Course of study
the ordinary method of those times had preposted his soul, and ennarrowed his
spirit by the contrived and interested systems of modern, and withal obnoxous
Authors, but that his larger Genius and second thoughts prompted his great soul
to a study equal with its self, that took in all humane and sacred Learning
from the clearest and most dis-interested sources of both, wherein he gave on
all the occasions his fifteen years continuance in the University offered him,
such pregnant Specimens of a vast proficiency, as might be expected from that
indefatigable man that constantly studied twelve hours a day, and left Notes
and As may be seen in his Library.
Indexes at the beginning and end of each Book, upon almost all the Classick
Authors extant.

This industry, Sect His Preserment.
and this eminence, could not in those days, wherein Religion and Learning were
at their fatal height, both of perfection and encouragement, escape either
observation or preferment; therefore being ordained at twenty four ( viz.
1629.) and Bachelor of Divinity at twenty six ( viz. 1631.) and regularly,
both in conformity, as well to the Statutes of the House, as to the Canons of
the Church. Anno 1633. he Preached Dr. Frewens Course, (the President of his
College, since Lord Archbishop of York) at Court with that success, that with
the Right Honorable the Earl of Leicesters favor, then his Hearer, he was,
upon an honest resignation of his Fellowship, inducted, Aug. 22. of that year,
to Pensehurst, as not long after, by the Reverend Father in God, Brian Lord
Bishop of Chichester then, and since of Salisbury and Winchester, he was
dignified at Chichester.

His Preferments were not so suitable to his Desert, Sect. His Carriage in all
his places, 1. at a Minister.
as his Carriage was to his Preferment. For

When Rector of Pensehurst. Sermons.
His Sermons were not undigested and shallow effusions, but rational and just
discourses; his method was which he recommended to his Friends, after every
Sermon, to resolve upon the ensuing subject, and so pursue the course of study
he was then in hand with, reserving the close of the week for the Provision of
the next Lord's Day, whereby not only a constant progress was made in Science,
but materials unawares were gained unto the immediate future work, for (he
said) be the subject treated of never so distant, somewhat will infallibly fall
in conducible to the present purpose: but preaching being the least part of
Religion. Prayers.
Prayer and Devotion (that power of Godliness) was observed by himself and his
Family (guided by his good and prudent Mother) publicly and privately, every
day according to the strictest rules of the Church; for the assistance wherein
he allowed a Curate a comfortable Salary. The Sacrament.
His Administration of the Sacrament, was as of old, frequent and monthly,
wherein the The (...) use (...) of you may sie in his Sermon of the P^o ^hans
Ty^bings
Assertors was by his instruction and example restored to that repute, as it
not only relieved the aged, and apprentised the young, poor of Penshurst, but
afforded a surplusage to the necessities of Neighbor Parishes. Catech ^sing.
But that his other cares might be the more successful, he brought an able
Schoolmaster into the Town, and the Church Catechism into the Church, which
with his half hours exposition before Evening Prayer, he rendered so fully
intelligible to the meanest capacity, that he observed the older as well as the
younger hearers, reaped more benefit than from his Sermons. His Hospitality to
(...) r^^h, his (...) to the P^or his ^is^s to all, and his (...) with them.
Yet a Ministers converse must enforce his Doctrine, and the endearing of his
Person must recommend his instruction; very Hospitable, he was at all times,
especially those more solemn at his Table, very charitable at his door;
besides, the tenth of his Estate set apart for the poor in weekly Pensions, and
his Corn sold them below Market prices which though, as he said, he had reason
to do it, gaining thereby the charge of Portage, was a great benefit to them,
who besides the abatement of price, and possibly forbearance, saved thereby a
days work. Very civil he was in letting his Tithes, whereof one memorable
instance in this: Having let the tithe of a large Meadow, and received half the
Money at the beginning of the year, the meadow was drowned, and when the Tenant
offered the payment, he generously returned him the first, with this Noble
reflection, God forbid I should take the tenth where you have not the nine
parts. Very punctual he was in visiting the sick, whose request he prevented in
his addresses both in person and by writing, taking (as he would say) the
opportunity of that serious time to instill the most serious instruction, but
withal intimating the folly of remitting the great business of eternity to the
last hour, which God designed for the commensurate employment of the life; so
much Charity exercised among his Neighbors, taught them that love among
themselves, that no difference there in his time went beyond his mediation, and
that kindness for him (who had the rare happiness obliging both parties) that
as long as he was there, he had never any trouble for his Dues, and when forced
thence, no care for his Books and Estate; which when plundered, were redeemed,
and reserved for him by his Neighbors to the end of the War.

As Archdeacon.
When Archdeacon, so frequent were his public Sermons at the Cross and
elsewhere, so earnest and pathetick his Discourses for obedience and union
(which his zeal and prudence charged as the Interest of the Clergy (who saw not
then as he did what they do now) as well as their duty) in pressing whereof he
confessed he broke off once in a full Assembly of the Clergy from what he had
premeditated, not without as signal a blessing from God, as singular applause
from his Auditory, for what he had spoke so honestly out of the abundance of
his heart.

Dr. of vinity.
When his Dignities in the Church refused that privacy his modesty was
ambitious of, 1639. he (with eleven of his Contemporaries of the same House,
whom it had been an unkind, and a morose (...) of singularity not to have
accompanied) proceeded ^^^^or with that satisfaction in the management of the
Exercises belonging to that Degree to his hearers, as could not be expected
from one buried in a Country-living.

His Dignity in the Church challenged a place in the Convocation 1640. Sect His

his Virtue and Learning obtained a name in the Assembly 1644. his Regularity
and Loyalty being not so much envyed, as his Piety and Parts were reverenced by
that pa^ty, that having threatened and persuaded him in vain by their C^^ntry
Committees, permitted him his regular Ministry till July 1643. when the malice
of a designed successor making use of an un^uccessful attempt made in his
Majesty's behalf about ^unbridge upon the Doctors Doctrine and Example, forced
him to a retirement to his old Tutor Dr. Buckner, where he and his Fellow Pupil
Dr. Oliver stayed three weeks (during which time he dreamed, That being abroad
with Company on a Sun-shining-day, an horrid tempest surprised them on a
sudden, and divided them; to the lesser number whereof a small voice whispered,
Be still, and ye shall receive no harm; the Doctor falls to his Prayers and

was an 100 l. set upon Dr. Hammonds head, they resolved for Winchester, where
Dr. Oliver had an interest, until that Doctor was met with the News that he was
by a College choice to succeed Dr. Frewen now Bishop of Litchfi^ld, in the
President ship of Magdal^n-Colledge, whereupon (some seruples Dr. Hammond made
of the publickness of Oxford, and its distance from his beloved charge (to
which after addresses made to some friends in power, he had little hope of
returning) being satisfied) they betake themselves to a Preferment, rather than
a Refuge, and encompasing ^^antshire, with some difficulty come to Oxford.

Here enjoying that peace that was no where else to be had in an indefatigable
course of study, a Learned and useful converse with young men direct to them,
and with the Elder to satisfy himself; to meet with the Profaneness and
formality of the age, he composed his Practical Catechism, as he did his Tracts
of Scandal, of Conscience, of Will Worship, of resisting the Lawful Magistrate,
and of the Change of Church Government; to meet with its erro^s; all as
seasonably contrived as well performed, to check the gallantry of the profane
world, and discover the demureness of the more pretending; yet all like to be
suppressed by the Doctors modesty, had not his intimate friend Dr. Potter of
Queens, to whom they were communicated, extorted a publication, but with the
conc^alment of his name which was at first guessed, and at last Printed in
London and Cambridge.

Neither was his Pen more intent at Oxford, than his zeal and prudence at
London (where he attended the Duke of Richmond and the Earl of Southampton, as
Chaplain, in Order to the Treaty at Vxbridge) upon undeceiving the deluded; to
which he added (...) reason at Vxbridge, where being surprised (as attending
t^ere rather as a Chaplain than a Champion) he answered (...) ^to suggestions
or Arguments read out of a Paper, with that readiness as equally testified his
ability and the evidence of that hesitation which has been reported to his
disparagement; the naked truth of which business he sets down thus.

I never heard that Argument urged by Mr. Vines, D. (...).
or any other in my life; and for my pretended answer, I am both sure that I
never called God and his holy Angels to witn^ss any thing in my life, nor ever
swore any voluntary Oath that I know of; and that I was not at that meeting
conscious to my self of wanting ability to express my thoughts, or prssd with
any considerable difficulty, or forced by any considera^ion to (...) the answer
of any thing objected. I went to Mr. Marshall in my ow^ and my Brothers name,
to demand three things. 1. Whether any Argument proposed by them remained
unanswered, to which we might y^^^^ further answer. 2. Whether they intended to
make any repo^t of (...) by past disputations, offering if they would, to join
with them in it, an^ to perfect a conference by mutual consent after the manner
of that between Dr. Reynolds and Mr. Heart; both which being rejected, the third
was to promise each other, that nothing should be afterward (...) by either,
without the consent or knowledge of the other party; and that last he promised
for himself and Brethren, and so we parted.

But the fate of the Nation requires, that neither his strong reason could be
heard, nor his Majesty's just Arms prevail; yet the resolved man engages the
growing mischiefs in his Tracts of Superst^^^on, Idolatry, Sins of weakness and
wilfulness, Deathbed repentance, (...) View of the Directory, ^raternal
Corr^ption, The Power of the K^y^, His Answer to Mr. Cheynels Exceptions
against the Practical ^atechism: and (when the Romanists were, fishing in our
troubled waters) his Vindication of the Lord Faulkland. Those lucid interval he
was permitted attending his Majesty; and when forbidden that sad, but desired
service, managin^ the Affairs of the University and College (in the first
whereof he was Orator, as in the second Sub-Dean, since the disputation at
Vxbridge) with that assiduous and diligent inspection of the most minute
Persons or Affairs under his care; and that for three years together he was
seldom seen a bed before twelve at night, and as seldom after five in the

But the War giving way to a greater mischief, viz. a Visitation, the Doctor is
involved in the general Calamity, and with the most Reverend Father in God, the
now Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, confined at Oxford, whence all other honest
men were by beat of Drum banished; though (such is the reverence the worst men

refused a while their Preferment; and they who boggled not at any Oppression,
were tender of their Confinement. Colonel Bvelin himself, with whom they were
intended Prisoners, professing he must entertain them as friends; yet deprived
and imprisoned they were, so that the good Doctor could attend his Sacred
Majesty now, calling for him, no otherwise than by the excellent Sermons he
earnestly demanded, and the Doctor dutifully sent; and gaining no more favor
till the Kings death, but with the mediation of his Brother-in-law Sir John
Temple, than to be his own prisoner, at the honorable Sir Philip Warwicks
house, at Clapham in Bedford-shire; whence on the approach of that
unparallelled villainy, he drew up most pathetique Addresses to the Army, that
perpetrated it, and an unanswerable Reply to Ascham and Goodwyn, those two only
monsters of mankind, that durst defend it.

Which when now past, Sect. How be dis^ose of himself after the Kings death.
though it transported him as far as either affection, or duty could carry him,
yet sunk him not in an useless amazement; for redoubling his fasting, his
tears, and solemn prayer, he resumed his wonted studies.

And 1. To write his t^^ct of Christian Religion.
Reflecting on the Atheism, that Horrid Fact, and other Black Circumstances
threatened, he published his equally seasonable and applauded, Reasonableness of
Christian Religion.

The occasion and method of composing the Annotation^ on the New Testament.
Considering that there was not a more dangerous step to irreligion, than for
those, who durst not but own it, yet to deprave it, to a most scandalous
Theory, and a most horrid Systeme; he cleared its wrested Original, in two
Latin Quarto Volumes, with Reference to the Jewish and Heathen Customs, the
Primitive usages among Christians and Heretics, the Importance of the
Hellenistical Dialect (by which means, in a manner, he happened to take in all
the difficulties of the New Testament) a Collation of several Greek Copies, and
a New Translation, drawn up many years ago for his own use, which on second
thoughts, to serve all capacities, he cast into the present frame and method of
the Annotations on the New Testament.

The occasion and method of his dissertations.
The careful and public spirited man, adverting that ((...)) Religion, though
never so cleared, could not inwardly oblige, without a power confessed did
outwardly awe. Upon the Archbishop of Armaghs request. 1. To clear some
Exceptions Blondel had made against his Edition of Ignatius from some Eastern
Counsels. 2. And according to his promise of a fuller account, to publish that
in Latin, which he had writ to him in English, as well for his own honor, whom
Salmasius had unworthily called Nebulo, as the honor of Episcopacy now, as L.
Capellus intimated in his Thesis of Church Government at Sedan, deserted by all
men, he drew up those nervous and unanswerable Dissertations.

Thus cleared and vindicated he our Religion in bonds, Sect. His remove to
Worcestershire, and his reflect^^^ on what p^ssed ^here, 1651.
that was first published there; notwithstanding, 1. The loss of his dear
Mother, whose last blessing he was forbid, to attend her. For 2. The defeat of
his Majesty at Worcester (from whose own hand he received then a most gracious
letter, for the satisfaction of his Loyal Subjects, concerning his adherence to
the established Religion of the Church of England, wherein his Royal Father
lived a Saint, and died a Martyr.) And 3. The calamity that fell on the
honorable Sir John Packingtons Family thereupon at Westwoo^^^. whither he was
now removed. Bearing up himself with the providence of his Ma^esties miraculous
Deliverance, in expectation of his no less miraculous Restoration. To use his
own words, That God who had thus powerfully rescued him out of Egypt, would
not suffer him to perish in the Wilderness; but though his possage be through
the Red Sea, he would at last bring him unto Canaan; that he should come out of
tribulation, as gold out of the fire, purified, but not consumed.

But others having not that happy prospect of, (...) of the times.
nor those pious, and ^iducial reflections on those occurrences; and therefore
some, in that dark juncture, falling on the one side, to the Pompous way of the
Catholics; others, on the other side, to that more Novel of the Schismatics,
the prudent watchman equally provided for both. For the first, in his Treatise
of Heresy and Schism, his discourses against the Catholic Gentleman, and his
Armor-bearer S.W. and his Tract of Fundamentals. Forth second, in his six
Queries, his Replies to Mr. Cawdry, Mr. Ieanes, and the noble provincial
Assembly at London on the Presbyterian account; and to Mr. Owen, and Mr. Tombs
on the Independants and Anabaptists; adding that pathetick Paraenesis upon the
Interdict, Ian. 1. 1655. writ first in his Tears, and then with his Ink, he
looking on this sad dispensation as a reproaching (to use his own words) his
and his brethrens former unprofitableness, By casting them out as straw to the
Dunghall. A dispensation, that had even broken his great heart, had he not
admitted of an expedient, that secured all real duties in the Family where he
was.

than amazed at the failure threatened them for the future; both in the superior
order of Episcopacy, which he provided against, by a correspondence with his
Majesty abroad; and in the inferior of Priesthood, which he designed to supply
a seminary of pious, learned, and ^ell^ p^^ncipled Pensioners, be kept on foot
till his death, in a way more suitable to his Heroic mind, than his low
fortune; in which business it was observable, how his choice fixed on piety, it
being his prinple; That exemplary virtue must restore the Church.

his care extended to the banished abroad, as well as his vigilance to the
afflicted at home; and several sums of money did he send over, notwithstanding
that the Usurpers discovered it, and convented him, whose commanding worth awed
them to that reverence of him, that when others were amazed at the surprised,
he made it only an opportunity of saying something home to the fierce Monster,
concerning his soul, and discourse the appropriate ways remaining to alleviate,
at least, if not expiate for them; coming off with a new experiment of his old
observation, That they who least considered hazard in the doing of their
duties, fared still best.

Amidst which sad diversion, Sect. (...) action (...) to his Death.
his labors yet grew up in an un-interrupted course: His Review of the
Annotations, his Exposition of the Book of Psalms, his Pacifick Discourse of
Gods Grace and Decrees, (to Bishop Sanderson, upon some Letters that passed
between that reverend and learned Prelate and Dr. Pierce) his Latin Tract of
Confirmation, in answer to Mr. Daillee, together with his Enterprise upon the
Old Testament, begun at the Prov^rbs, and pursued to a third part of that Book;
until at the opening of the year 1660. when all things tended visibly to the
great Restoration, and the good Dr. was invited to London, to assist in the
great work of the composure of breaches in the Church; against which
undertaking, and the ensuing public employments he was to expect: He 1
Examined his inclinations, temptations, and defects, with the assistance of his
friends. 2. He contrived such public good works, as he might lay himself out
in the Diocese of Worcester, designed his charge. And 3. Fell to his Devotion,
in behalf of the Nation, now under its great Crisis, and hopeful method of
Cure. But on the fourth of April, a sharp Fit of the Stone seized him, which
put him, who at other times would say, I am not dying yet, into such
apprehensions of his danger, that he told the mournful Spectators of his
agonies, That he should leave them in Gods hands; who would so provide, that
they should not find his removal any loss; adding, That they should turn their
prayers for his recovery into intercessions for his happy change. I pray (said
he very passionately) let some of your fervor be employed that way: Being
pressed to make it his own request to God, that he might be continued to serve
the Church, he allowed this, a part of his devotion, viz. That if his life
might be useful to any one soul, he besought Almighty God to continue him, and
by his grace to ennable him to employ that life, he so vouchsafed,
industriously and successfully. Adding for the Church, that sincere performance
of Christian duties, so much decayed, to the equal supplanting and scandal of
that holy Calling; that those who professed that Faith might live according to
the rules of it, and to the form of Godliness superadd the power of it;
restraining the ex tempore irregularities of his friends ejaculations, with
that grave saying, Let us call on God in the voice of his Church.

But now through the long suppression of Urine, the blood being grown Thin and
Serous, and withal, Eager and Tumultuous, through the mixture of Heterogeneous
parts; this excellent person fell to a violent bleeding (whereat the standers
by being amazed, he said cheerfully, It was a mercy, and that to bleed to
death, was one of the most desirable passages out of this world:) and found no
ease, but that the pain of the Humors stoppage relieved the Stone, the Lethargy
that, and the Flux of Blood the Lethargy; which variety of tortures, exercised
not only his patience, but his thankfulness too; crying out in his greatest
extreamities, Blessed be God, blessed be God.

He made his Will with cheerfulness, the oversight whereof he entrusted with
his intimate and approved friend Dr. Hen^hman, now Lord Bishop of London, and
received the Sacrament, April 20. and 22. then Good Friday and Easter Day,
being very much concerned that he could not be with the Congregation, and
saying very passionately, Alas! must I be Excommunicated! So far was he from
their opinion, who in their most healthful days, make this not their Penance,
but their election and choice.

April 25. he bled with greater violence than before, beyond all remedy by
applications or revulsives, until the torrent ceased, the fountain being
exhausted, and the good Doctor became so weak, so cold, and so dispirited, that
he had strength enough only to persevere in his Devotions, which he did to the
last moment of his life; a few minutes before his death, breathing out those
words, which best became his Christian life, Lord make haste. The same day,
that commenced the Nations happiness, the Convention of a Free-Parliament,
concluded his life, just when it was like to be most comfortable to himself,
and serviceable to the Church: As if this great Champion of Religion, and
pattern of all virtue, were reserved for exigence and hazard, for persecution
and suffering; for he resigned his pure and active soul to him that gave it,
April 25. 1660.

HIS CHARACTER.
A Soul that dwelt nobly, in a strong and comely Body, whose Proportions were
just and graceful, 1. The f^ame of his Body.
his Face was serene and majestic, his Eye quick and sprightful, his
Complexion clear and florid, and the whole Man, abating the redness of his Hair
(which yet elsewhere might be an advancing to him) a beauty delicate, but
vigorous and patient of the severest toil and hardship; never approaching the
fire, never subject to any infirmities save Fevers, wherein yet his temperance
relieved him, until immoderate study altered his constitution.

Nobly was his soul seated, and noble it was, and just to the promise of his
outward shape. 1. His Sight, was admirably quick and distinct. The ^aculti^s of
his Soul.
His Ear, was accurate, and he naturally able to perform his part to a
Harpsicon or Theorbo, in the relieved intervals of his day labors, and night
studies. 3. His Elocution, was free and graceful, prepared at once to charm and
command his audience, and when impaired at his Country charge, reduced by his
late sacred Majesty with equal skill and candor, to its natural modulation. 4.
His Invention was rich and flowing, outgoing his dexterous Amanuensis, and
overflowing his Periods, an hours meditation at night, until he observed that
prejudicial to his sleep, and then in the morning suffced for two Sermons a
Sunday, 8. or 9. hours dispatched most of his small Tracts, as that touching
Episcopacy, drawn immediately upon my Lord of Salisbury (late of Winchesters
motion) in a friends Chamber, who professes that sitting by all the while, he
remembers not that he took off Pen from Paper till he had done five sheets,
having amidst his other diversions been frequently his own days work^. His
Memory was more faithful to things than to words, it being harder with him to
get one Sermon by heart, than to Pen twenty.

6. His speech was so happy, that being defective only in its redundance, his
late Sacred Majesty, the greatest Judge and Master of English Rhetoric in this
later Age, ennobled him and it with this Character, That he was the most
Natural Orator he ever heard.

7. His judgment was strong in his Writings, piercing in business, equally able
to unravel the designs of others, and model his own: though (as the excellent
Author of his life observes) the finding out the similitudes of different
things wherein the fancy is conversant, is usually a bar to the discerning the
disparities of similar appearances, which is the business of discretion, and
that store of notions which is laid up in Memory, assists rather confusion than
choice; upon which ground, the greatest Clerks are frequently not the wisest
men, yet the incomparable Doctor owned at once the highest fancy, and the
deepest judgment.

Great his natural abilities, Sect. His I^tellectual and acquired abilities.
greater his acquired, through the whole Circle of the Arts accurate and
Eloquent he was in the Tongues, exact in Ancient and Modern Writers, well
versed in Philosophy, better in Philology, Learned in School Divinity, a Master
in Church Antiquity, made up of Fathers, Councels, Ecclesiastical Historians
and Lyturgicks.

Eminent indeed his Intellectuals, Sect. His Moralls.
more eminent his Moralls, for 1. His temper, though sanguine (which he
observed a Providence) was chaste to an Antipathy against the very appearances
of wantonness; twice his Household cares inclined him to a Marriage, yet he
forbore the first time out of respect to the Lady, for whom a better Fortune
had a kindness, and the second time upon St 1 Cor. 7. 26.
Paul and St. Epist, ad Age^^uchiam
Ieromes advice for the present exigence; ever since espousing (what he
preserved inviolate) unto his death the more eminent perfection of spotless
Virgin chastity. 2. His appetite was good, but restrained to the plainest Diet,
and the most sparing, one Meal in twenty four hours was his constant allowance,
and but one for thirty six for two days in every week, and for three days in
Lent and Ember-week, his voluntary Fasts were his sensualities, and his
enjoined meals (after some Diseases) his penance, luxury even in the relation
would turn his stomach, which was so disciplined by his reason, that nothing
was pleasant to him (not his beloved Apples) that was not wholesome too, it
being his wonder (how rational Creatures (they are his own words) should eat
for any thing but health, since he that did eat or drink that which might cause
a fit of the Stone or Gout, though a year after, therein unmanned himself, and
acted as a beast: neither was he less observant of others prescription, that
his own; for when confined to a Diet, he would Carve and make that which is
others Civility, his refuge. 3. His Sleep was as moderate as his Diet, and if
prescribed him above five hours, his trouble rather than his rest; it being his
protestation, that when he was abridged his Night studies, he lost not only his
greatest pleasure, but highest advantage in reference to business, whereas to
be enjoined early rising in case of costiveness, or so, he judged a mere rescue
and deliverance.

So temperate a man must needs be industrious, and really so professed an Enemy
he was to idleness, Sect. His disposal of his time.
that he recommended no Maxim with that concern as this. Be furnished always
with somewhat to do, the best expedient both for Innocence and Pleasure; this
being his constant sentiment of that matter, that no Burden is more heavy, or
temptation more dangerous, th^n to have time lie on ones hands: the idle man's
brain being not only, as he said, the Devils shop, but his Kingdom too, a Model
of, and an Appendage unto hell, a place given up to torment and mischief. His
very Walks which yet were prescribed him, had their constant tasks, the very
time of his dressing and undressing, with his Servants assistance dispatched
Volumes (his saying was, he could not endure to talk with himself) He that
shall consider his laborious way immersed in almost infinite quotations, his
obligation to read so many Authors Ancient and Modern. His exact refusal of his
own and other men's Works or Business, his Agency for Persons of Quality, to
provide them Schoolmasters and Chaplains, his Correspondencies abroad and at
home, whereof some cost him ten, others twenty, thirty, forty, nay sixty sheets
of Paper at a time; his constant sickness which at last forbad him reading for
two hours after M^^l, on pain of a fit of the Gout, unquestionably to revenge
the failure, will not wonder at what is written of him, not only that nothing
kept him from his study, but what confined him to his bed, nor that neither
sometimes, nor that he was so averse to dilatary undertaking, that as he would
never spend that time in gazing on business that would serve to do it, so his
thoughts never lying fallow; he no sooner finished one business, but he
consulted about another; but that he gained time for business by the time he
spent in Prayer, whilst a more than ordinary assistance attending his
Devotions, his Closet proved his Library, and he studied most upon his knees.

His prayer, I say, the constant return whereof the last ten years of his life,
His Devotion.
exceeded David's seven times a day. For 1. As soon as he was ready, he was at
his prayer with his Servant in his Chamber, and afterward 2. More privately in
his Closet. 3. Between ten and eleven at his peculiar Office of National
Intercession. 4. A while after at the morning Office to be always performed by
himself. 5. In the Evening at his hour of private prayer enlarged on Sundays,
even with the loss of his Supper (if any occasion had diverted him at the usual
time) notwithstanding his Physicians prescriptions, which in other Cases he was
careful to obey. 6. About five at his solemn Intercession, and the Evening
Service seven at Bedtime; and all the while he was awake at his private
prayers, the (...). Psalm being designed his midnight entertainment in all
these. 1. His attention was fixed and steady. 2. His fervor sometimes
passionate to a transport. 3. His tears so observable, that it was the wonder
of one of his Domestics, since a Proselyte to the Directory, that the Learned
Dr. Hammond could find motive for his tears at the Cofession, that begins the
Liturgy: and it may be our Comfort that there wants not life and heat in the
public Offices of the Church, when they are not wanting in the hearts that use
them. 4. His Charity was as extentive as his Saviors love even to mankind,
ennarrowed with no more private respects, than those of nature and necessity:
the oppressed, the sick, his Enemies taking up a great part of his Liturgy
(three especial persons that had most unworthily disobliged him, whose names he
would never discover, being no otherwise revenged by him than with a peculiar
daily prayer in their behalf; prayers so effectual, that he had under their
hands a recognition of their undue procedure) the growing mischiefs of the
Nation enlarging his Intercessions which had peculiar resentments of the
thirtieth of January.

His Charity was comprehensive, Sect. His Friendship.
but his Friendship choice: Friendship! the most sacred thing in his
apprehension; next Religion, and the most happy next Heaven; without which he
would say, men led a pitiful, insipid, H^rb-Iohn-like life; he being so
passionate a lover of this virtue, that it was his grand design to propagate
and improve it among all he judged capable of being acquainted, to mutual
advantage; adding, that three persons he knew, whom their studies and troubles
had leagued together, were the happiest men in the Nation; and that he himself
had no such way of enjoying any thing as by reflection from the person whom he
loved, that his friends neglect of themselves was an unkindness to him; That he
had a thousand times rather that his friend should have that which was
conducible to health, than to have it himself: assuming, that if this were
believed, it were impossible any one should attempt to express kindness by
robbing him of his greatest pleasure, to see others do well. There are two
eminent fruits of Friendship. 1. The ease of the Heart. 2. The clearing of the
mind. Two ways does this excellent virtue conduce to the last.

1. By giving us opportunity with security to open and reflect upon our own
thoughts before our Confident.

2. By his faithful admonitin and advice which the Doctor would have extended
by others and him self, even^t indecencies and suspicions, saying usually, that
it was a poor design of friendship to keep the person he admitted to his breast
from being scandalous, as if the Physician should endeavor only to secure his
Patient from the Plague. Advertisements to which his friends were obliged,
though of mistaken features, were the greatest kindness and Complements, such
as that sent him in his Agonies, more tolerable to him than that message (that
now the days were come when his deserts should be considered, and himself
employed in the Government as well as the instruction of the Church. The most
insufferable injuries that could be done him, who was so perfect an enemy to
flattery, that when he did but suspect once that a commendation of one passage
in a Sermon of his, was brought in as an allay to some foregoing plain
dealing, He protested that nothing in the world could more avert his love and
deeply disoblige, than such unfaithfulness. Neither was his friendship more
punctual than constant, intervenient failures not superseding his affection,
but improving it to a tenderness for the person, increased by his detestation
of his Vice; excepting always those two things, Pride and Falseness, which
checked his kindness, because, as he said, they cut off the end of it, his
capacity of doing good otherwise, never despairing of the mollia tempora, of
plain and honest tempers, free from those artifices and close pretensions which
he perfectly hated, and as dexterously discovered, making it evident he did so
when seasonable; a circumstance he was very tender of, whose rule and example
it was never to reprove in anger, or out of time: it being his design to gain
as much upon the persons affections he dealt with, by the kindness of his
exhortations, as upon their judgments by the weight and evidence of them;
whence the little phrase, don't be simple, from him had more power to charm a
passion, than long harangues from others, whose just discourses of Piety and
Virtue, were derided when his very intimations were venerated: venerated I
should not have said, for he would say, he delighted to be beloved, not
reverenced: the distance of the last being not in his judgment consistent with
the freedom of the first. In a word, two qualifications he required in
Friendship. 1. Plain dealing apart from all jealousies and concealments, the
banes of correspondence. It were barbarous to condemn a Malefactor, (these are
his own Sentiments) more a friend, without being heard. 2. Generosity above all
mercenary returns. Love (he said) was built upon the union and similitude of
minds, and not the bribery of gifts and benefits; he admitting (as he
professed) retributions of good turns, not so much on any score, as that his
friend might have the pleasure of being kind: and scrupling the relief of a
person of Quality (whom he had supplied during the late times of trial) upon
the grand Restoration, for fear it might look rather like a design than a
Charity, until being convinced it would be a kindness, he was less concerned
what it might be called.

His Friendship was as wide as Virtue, Sect. His Charity.
and his Charity as spreading as Necessity, for which be exactly allowed the
tenth of his incomes as due, besides the Free Will offering at his weekly
Fasts^ and upon all occasions that offered themselves, being so much more
intent upon the poors condition than his own, that he would make his low estate
an argument for their relief; yea, as industrious as he was to conceal his
Charity, we find an 100 l. bestowed on one distressed person of Quality, 60 l.
on another, 20 l. on a third, and all out of a Stock that he had, no visible
means but this parting with it, and a blessing upon it to supply. Yet still did
he look by his Agents for new Pensioners, especially Sequestered Divines, their
Widows and Orphans, young Students, and the Banished, for whom he procured and
sent considerable sums year by year. His Charity had these excellent
qualifications. 1. It was as far as he and his intelligencers could observe
seasonably. 2. It was as suitato the modesty of his Pensioners, as seasonable
to their necessity. 3. It was cheerful, an instance of his usual observation,
That it was one of the greatest sensualities in the world to give, and that it
was the exceeding indulgence of God, that had annexed future rewards, to that
which was so amply its own recompense. 4. It was of the best he had, being much
concerned, that a Servant in the Family, troubled with the Gout, had, as he
directed, any worse than his own Plaster to ease him, although the store of
that was almost spent. And, 5. It was with that familiar and hearty kindness,
as became him, who would say, It was a most unreasonable, and unchristian
thing, to despise any for being poor.

Neither was it his care only to relieve poverty, Sect. His alms of Lending.
but to prevent it; by lending gratis (though he allowed Usury) to honest and
industrious men, several sums of money, and contriving how they might dispose
of them to their advantage, dismissing them with infinite affability and
kindness, and a prayer for Gods blessing.

Notwithstanding these profusions of charity, Sect. His generosity.
he had wherewithal to be gentile and liberal, rewarding at an highly ingenious
rate most presents above the value, with that satisfaction, that he would say,
Alas! poor soul, I Will warrant you he is glad of this little matter; and make
that opportunity of giving a part of the senders courtesy first; and freely
contributing to most public works; as fifty pounds toward the great Bible,
three hundred pounds upon the repair of his Parsonage-house, etc. Allowing
himself not above five pounds a year, upon no other principle, but thereby to
be liberal to those he loved better than himself, the necessitous and poor.

The Estate you will think was vast, Sect. His estate, and the managing of it.
that maintained these Expenses; yet 300 l. he had upon his remove from
Penschurst, improved by his Prebendary of Christ-church, with the sale of a
Lease his Father left him, to a 1000 l. and laid out in Leases for years, was
all. The books he Printed, considering the many Editions he had nothing for,
the charge of sending them to and fro, Sheet by Sheet, for his own and others
animadversions, and the Copies he bestowed on his acquaintance coming to very
little, and the private contribution accepted by him, when abundantly offered,
to less; even 20 l. of 50. a perfect stranger hearing of his imprisonment sent
him at Oxford, which he received with much reluctance, notwithstanding the
present exigencies. 1. Because he would gratify his own pride. And, Provost of
Q. C. Oxon. and Dean of Worcester.
2. Because he might not give the Gentleman the discomforture of seeing he had
made an unseasonable offer, so that it remains still a wonder, that in spite
of himself, he was at his death worth 1500 l. But that it is a little allay to
the miracle, that he said, The half of his estate being scattered, was more
than the whole. And Dr. Potter professed, his estate grew upon him
notwithstanding his Charge, his Hospitality, and prosuse Liberality, by trying
a conclusion Dr. Hamond taught at St. Paul's, in his Sermon called, The Poor
Man's Tything, That to give plentifully to the poor, was the surest way to be
rich, which he found true to miracle.

Yet Gods blessing takes not so much from the wonder of his growing rich,
Sect. His (...).
than his own easiness adds to it, for he made them he dealt with, their own
arbitrators (professing that this trash was not worth much ado) and their
integrity, their only obligation ( if they are honest (said he) there needs no
such caution; if knaves, he would not deal with them, or if he were surprised,
to that, all his circumspection could not prevent a Cheat; and (as he writes to
a friend that had been abused) I never suffered in my life for want of Hand and
Seal.) The best indeed he could have in those days of Usurpation, wherein he
offered to pay over again 50. or 60 l. rather than make Affidavit that he had
done it, before the illegal Iudicatories. Insomuch, as I cannot but insert the
reverend Dr. Fellt excellent observation, That it pleased God since he had
exemplified the advices of his Practical Catechism, to the duties of Alms and
Charitable distributions, in him also to make good, and signally exemplify the
assurance he then, and elsewhere made, in the behalf of Almighty God upon such
performance, the giving affluence of temporal wealth.

So much worth as we have described, would have made another proud, Sect. His
humility and condescen^ion.
but in this Worthy was most humble, and most condescending.

For, 1. In reference to himself.
(first) he submitted all his Writings, as to their truth and prudence, to the
censure of most of his friends, even the meanest, (saying, There was no man
that was honest to him, by whom he could not profit; withal, that he was to
expect Readers of several sorts, and if one illiterate man was stumbled, 'twas
likely others of his form would be so too, whose interest when he writ to all,
was not to be passed over. Besides, those less discerning Observators, if they
could do nothing else (he said) could serve to draw Teeth, i. e. admonish, if
ought was too sharply writ.) Engaging them all to lay aside all kindness, but
that greatest of being faithful; and saying of an eminent person, that had
retutned him a Complement instead of a Censure, That he had reaped this benefit
by the disappointment, to have learned never to send his Papers to that hand
again, as he did not to his dying day; yet after all these reviews and (...)
admitted to the subsequent Editions of his Books, he would profess himself
astonished at their reception into the world, especially, as he withal was
pleased to add, since others failed therein, whose performances were infinitely
beyond any thing which he was able to do.

In reference to others.
The less his esteem was of what he did himself, the more his value of what
others performed; extant, in a Book called, The whole Duty of Man, etc. Add to
this, his excessive affability to the meanest person, to whom he would come
without any delay (which he allowed not in himself, and chid in others, even in
his excellent Lady, when diverted by the attractives of his discourses, she
neglected the many Clients, either of her charity in Alms or Surgery) in
the midst of his beloved studies. This being the rule his obliging humanity
gave his friends, To treat their poor Neighbors with such a cheerfulness, that
they may be glad to have met with them.

The instances of his condescension are such as these, 1. One Houseman a
Weaver, Instances of his Condescension.
a pious but sickly man, he honored with his Practical Books, he importuned to
come to him for what he needed. He provided for him the same freedom, with the
good L. P. in case he removed (saying once to the Lady, Will you not think it
strange, I should be more affected for parting from Houseman, than from you?)
and he bequeathed him ten pounds at his death. 2. One Sexion of Penschurst, to
whom he sent his Books, keeping constant correspondence with him, though his
Returns were scarce legible, pensioning his Boy at School, and remembering him
in his Will.

3. One who happening on the Doctors Writings, was so affected with them, as to
leave his Family and Employment, and wait upon the Doctor himself for
directions in his Study, which he had with all other assistance, insomuch, as
that he is become now a very useful person in the Church.

4. The fourth shall be a hopeful young man at Oxford, whose love to Magic,
engaged him in bad Company, until the Dr. took him to his own reading some
books with him, particularly Homer, one of whose Iliads, was their Night
entertainment, and two on Holy Days; whereon the Doctor would say, with
reflection on the then debauches, Come it is Holy Day, let us be jovial, and
take the other Iliad.

5. A vicious man on his deathbed, desired to speak with the Doctor, which he
heard not till the party was departing, to his great trouble; At the
bruitishness of those (they are his own words) that had so little sense of a
soul in that sad state. Whence he observed, that by this example, others, and
in particular the companions of that unhappy persons vice, might learn how
improper a season the time of sickness, and how unfit a place a deathbed is
for that one great important work of Penitance, Which was intended by Almighty
God, the one commensurate work of his whole life.

6. One in the Voisinage mortally sick of the Small Pox, then fatal to most of
the Doctors complexion, desired the Dr. to come to him; he makes no more ado,
when satisfied that the party was so sensible as to be capable of his
instructions, assuring those that were fearful of him, That he should be as
much in Gods hands, in the sick man's Chamber, as in his own.

7. He kept a despairing person several days in his Chamber, attending and
answering, with unwearied patience, all those little scruples and arguments,
that unhappy temper too ready suggested; until the poor soul was settled by his
happy method, Wherein duty still preceded promise, and strict endeavor only
founded comfort. And to add no more, though to do good to all was his unlimited
design, yet to nourish and advance the early virtue of young persons was his
more chosen study; to whom he insinuated the beauty, pleasure, and advantage of
a pious life on the one hand, together with the danger and mischief of brutal
sensuality on the other; obliging them by civilities, which engaged them of
very gratitude to him, to their duty toward God.

And whence all this kindness for mankind think you? even from his esteem of
souls, Sect His ^al^e of souls.
expressed in these words (most emphatical in his delivery of them.) O what a
glorious thing, how rich a prize, for the expense of a man's life, were it to be
the instrument of rescuing anyone soul! Hence, hence his perpetual Study, his
constant Preaching, his daily Prayers, his practical and affectionate
Discourses, his Tears, his Cares, his Solicitousness (what to speak more
plainly, or more movingly, whether his extemporary wording of it was a defect,
etc. when his instructions failed of their des^^ed effect) hence his
instruction of the Children (in the Family he dwelt in) since they were capable
of it, to his dying day between prayers and dinner time; with grave
observations on their miscarriages, attended with suitable remedies; hence his
private Catechizing of the same Children in his Chamber on Sundays in the
afternoon, whereby he ensnared the Servants to receive those Lessons obliquely,
which their bashfulness would not have endured directly. Hence his invitation,
yea, importunity to all persons, to the very Scullion, to bestow their
leisure-hours in his Chamber, where he treated them with passing familiarity,
though amidst his infinite humility, he knew well how to assert the dignity of
his Place and Function, from the approaches of contempt.

Yea, so universal his design for virtue and piety, Sect. His instructions to
his Conve^ts.
that he had no sooner made Proselytes to his severe and strict way, than he
engaged all his Converts to restore their Brethren, and (in his own words) Not
to be ashamed of being reputed Innocent, or to be thought to have a kindness
for Religion; but own the seducing men to God, with as much confidence at
least, as others use, when they are Factors for the Devil; and instead of lying
on the guard, and the Defensive part, he gave in charge to choose the other of
Assailant: Adding, That this was their security, it being like the not
expecting of a threatened war at home, but carrying it abroad in the enemies
Country; and nothing in the Christian world (he judged) so dangerous as a
truce, and the cessation of hostility with all parties, and holding
intelligence with guilt, in the most trivial things (he pronounced) as treason
to our selves, as well as unto God; for while (says he) we fight with sin, in
the fiercest shock of opposition, we shall be safe; for no attempts can hurt
us, till we treat with the Assailants: temptations of all sorts having that
good quality of the Devil, to fly when they are resisted. And because a
pretense of humility and bashful modesty, might defeat all these instructions,
assuring them that that was arrant Pride, and nothing else. Three Principles he
Inculcated, 1. Principiis obsta, withstand the overtures of evil. 2. Hoc age,
be intent and serious in good; His Advises.
to which he adjoined a third, viz. Be furnished with a friend. Accordingly, at
a solemn parture, he discoursed to one of his disciples, thus: I have heard say
of a man, who upon his deathbed, being to take his farewell of his Son, and
considering what course of life to recommend that he might secure his
Innocence; at last enjoined him to spend his time in making Verses, and in
dressing a Garden; the Old Man thinking no temptation could creep into either
of these employments. But I in stead of these expedients, will recommend the
other, the doing all the good you can to every person, and the having of a
Friend, whereby your life shall not only be rendered innocent, but extremely
happy.

Yet this unimitable man was not more active for others good, Sect. His
Patience.
than patient under his own ills; whether first of contempt (being as little
displeased with his scornful opposites for being of his mind in their little
value of his person, as he was much concerned that they were not so in their
eager dissent against his person; in so much that in ten years converse,
neither his sanguine temper, nor his great temptations were observed to
transport his passion to any indecency:) Or secondly of pain, which (though he
would say he was of all things most a Coward to) yet he endured with eminent
constancy and perfect resignation; his first consideration being, what failing
had provoked the present chastisement, and his prayer that God would convince
him of it; nor only so, but tear and rend away though by the greatest violence
and sharpest discipline, whatever was displeasing in his eye, and grant not
only patience, but fruitfulness under the rod; adding his repeated submission,
Gods holy will be done, according to his beloved Doctrine of resigning our
selves, not to the will of God alone, but to his wisdom, both which he was used
to say were perfectly one thing in that blessed Agent (whence his Motto in the
most dismal appearances of Events (...) Even this for good.) His next
observation was of the Circumstances of the allay, as when it was the Gout,
that it was not the Stone or the Cramp; and when it was the Stone, it was not
as sharp as others felt. And in the intermission of his importunate maladies,
his third reflection was a transport of Thanksgiving ( that he who had in his
constitution the cause of so much pain, should yet by Gods immediate
interposing, be rescued from the effect) whereby you might discern what a
pleasant thing it is to be thankful, and how eternity may be well spent in
Hallelujahs.

Its easily presumed that the serious Christian that reads all this, would
gladly know the Rules and Principles whereon the good man raised his happy
serenity and calmness: to satisfy his useful curiosity, then his first Rule
was, Sect. The Principles whereupon he composed and settled his mind.
never to trouble himself with the foresight of future events, suficient ( he
resolved) to the day is the evil thereof, it being ( as he went on) the
greatest folly in the world, to perplex ones self with that which perchance
would never come to pass: But if it should, then God who sent it, will dispose
it to the best; most certainly to his glory which should satisfy us in our
respects to him: and unless it be our fault as certainly to our good, which if
we be not strangely unreasonable, must satisfy in reference to our selves and
private Interests. Besides all this, in the very dispensation God will not fail
to give such allays which (like the cool gales under the Line) will make the
greatest heats of sufferance very supportable, either the thing before us ( as
he would subjoyn out of Epictetus) is in our power, or it is not: if it be, let
us apply the remedy, and there will be no motive for complaint; if it be not,
the grief is utterly impertinent, since it can do no good. For ( this he
annexed of the same Authors) that every thing has two handles; if the one
prove hot, and not to be touched, we may take the other that is temperate. His
second rule was, to recollect his constant experiences of Gods dealing with him
in precedent Dispensations. His third was, quod sis esse velis, nihilque malis
(in his English) to rather nothing, and not only to acquiesce in the present
state as most necessary, but to be pleased with it as resolved the best; adding
his pretty question to the over-solicitous, when they would begin to trust God,
or permit him to govern the world? whereby the world and its Appendages hang
loose about this unconcerned Christian; that he never took notice when any part
dropped off or sat uneasy. His fourth was, the great pleasure he took in a
state of subjection; which, as he said, rescued him from the sollicitous
disquiet and discomposure of choice, and left him nothing but the easy duty of
obedience: yet when he could not discern where his obligation lay, he addressed
himself to God by his own and his friends Prayer and Fasting, his certain
Refuge in this as well as other Exigents. A tremulous and doubtful propensity
of mind to both, and neither side being in such disgrace with him, that he
would call it the deliberation of Buridans Ass. His fifth rule was, to keep up
a vigorous and lively Devotion, so much his basiness, that when an irremediable
drowziness seized upon him at Prayers, after a violent haemorrhage (though he
returned to every Response amidst his importunate infirmity) he very sadly
resented it, saying, Alas! this is all the return I shall make to this, merely
to sleep at Prayers.

His last Maxim was, that suffering was a blessing and a privilege, whence
these Divine Aphorisms in reference to the public, then in a dismal state for
its sin and the consequences of it; That prosperous iniquity would not be a
deliverance, but the most formidable judgment: That the Nation during its
pressures was under the Discipline of God, given up to Satan by a kind of
Ecclesiastical censure; and should the Almighty dismiss us from his hands, and
put us into our own, giving us up to our selves with a why should you be
smitten any more? this were of all inflictions the most dreadful. And these his
Maxims with respect to the sad consequences of the Cheshire-defeat, in answer
to the desponding sorrows of a friend, Sept. 2. Sir, yet there is not wanting
some gleam of light, if we shall yet by Gods grace be qualified to make use of
it. It is the Supreme privilege of Christianity to convert the saddest evils
into the most medicinal advantages, the valley of Achor unto the door of hope,
the blackest tempest into the most perfect (...). All kind of prosperity (even
that which we most think we can justify, the pursuance of the flourishing of a
Church and Monarchy) is treacherous and dangerous, and might very probably tend
to our great ills; and nothing is so entirely safe and wholesome as to be
continued under Gods Discipline; therefore let us adore, bless, and resign our
selves to Gods wisest choice. And these his resentments of that blessed
alteration, he as passionately feared as wished (suspecting his own hopes, and
weeping over his fruitions) his Majesty will be now brought to that uneasy, if
not unsupportable task of Ruling and Reforming a licentious people, to that
most irksome sufferance of being worryed with the importunities of covetous and
ambitious men; the restless care of meeting the designs of mutinous and
discontented spirits, resolving his most wished return only a blessing to his
people, not so to himself; but on the score of having opportunities through
glorious self-denyals to do good.
I have considered what other men would be better for this change, and I know
not any: as for the Church persecution was generally the happiest means of
propagating that, and she then grew fastest when pruned most: then of the best
complexion and most healthy, when fainting through loss of blood: as to the
Laity in all their several stations, they had so much perverted the healthful
dispensations of judgment, that it was most improbable they should make any
tolerable use of mercy; and lastly, in reference to himself, he resolved
affliction most conducible. I must confess (said he) near the approaching
change, I never saw that time in all my life, wherein I could so cheerfully say
my Nunc Dimittis, as now. Indeed I do dread prosperity, I do really dread it;
for the little good I am now able to do, I can do it with deliberation and
advice: But if it pleased God I should live and be called to any higher Office
in the Church, I must then do many things in a hurry, and shall not have time
to consult with others; and I sufficiently apprehend the danger of relying on
my own judgment. And his only triumph upon the defeat of Lambert, and that last
effect of gasping treason was that of his Charity, saying with tears in his
eyes, Poor souls! I bese^^h God forgive them. His Charity, I say, which was the
habit of his soul, which Virtue he said, commanded because he loved it; and
Vice enjoyed, because it wanted them; yet must all these Virtues dye, and that
last line that is drawn over all Perfections, must be the Period of his
Character. What Rules be recommended at his death.
Dr. Hammond departed this world April 25. 1660. commending that calm and
tranquillity to his Attendants he had exercised (being in his highest Agonies,
pleased with every thing that was done, and brought him) exhorting the young
growing hopes of the family, whose first innocence and bashful shame of doing
ill, he above all things labored to have preserved, to be just to the
advantage of their Education, and maintain inviolate their Baptismal Vow:
Enlarging to all about him the great advantages of mutual friendly admonition,
and bequeathing the excellent Lady (upon her request of his direction for her
whole life) that most comprehensive Duty, Uniform Obedience.

dye, having four Monuments as lasting as time and the world, which at their own
dissolution must resign him to a fair eternity.

This Apothegm (commended to Post^rity, as Dr. Hammonds resolution) That the
very condition of obeying the Lot, of not being to choose for ones self, the
being determined in all proposals by Humane or Divine Command, and where those
left at large, by the guidance of Gods Providence, or the assistance of a
friend, was the happiest state in the world.

brevity enforced me; because no Pen can more elegantly express that Person,
than his, who so severely practices his virtues. To the Church of Englands
honor and advantage be it spoken, in this last age, when ancient virtue had
lost its reputation, and was outshined by the success and gallantry of new
vices, it recovered its own amiableness in Dr. Hamonds person, and Dr. Fells

THE Life and Death OF Dr. RALPH BROWNRIG, Lord Bishop of Exceter.
BIshop Brownrig was a person of that soundness of Judgment, of that
conspicuity for an unspotted Life, of that unsuspected Integrity, that his life
was, Virtutum norma (as Jerome of Nepolian) ita in singulis virtutibus
eminebat, quasi caeteras non habuisset: So eminent in every good and perfect
gift, as if he had but o^e only. There was never any thing said by him, which a
wise, and good man, would have wished unsaid or undone.

He was born at Ipswich, a Town of good note in Suffolk, in the year of our
Lord, 1592. His Parents of Merchantly condition, of worthy reputation, and of
very Christian conversation. When he was not many weeks old, God took away ^his
earthly Father, that himself might have the more tender care of the Orphan; by
the prudence of his pious Mother, his Being not cast away, like the first (...)
of a Vessel, hardly (...) if once negl^cted.
youth and first years of reason were carefully improved for his breeding in
all good learning.

He was sent in his fourteenth year to Pembroke-hall in Cambridge. There his
modesty, pregnancy, and piety soon invited preferment; He was first made
Scholar of the House, and after Fellow, a little sooner than either his years
or standing in rigor of Statute permitted; but the College was impatient, not
to make sure of him, by grafting him firmly into that Society, which had been
famous for many excellent men, but none more than Brownrig. When Bachelor and
Master of Arts, Bachelor and Doctor of Divinity, and Bishop of Exeter; adorning
as well as deserving his Advancements.

When King James (that most learned Prince) was pleased to honor the University
of Cambridge by his Presence, and to make Exercises of Scholars, the best part
of his Entertainment; this person (then a young man) was one of those who were
chosen by the University, to adorn the reception of the King. The part he
performed was Iocoserious (of Praevaricator) a mixture of Philosophy, with Wit
and Oratory. This he discharged to the admiration, more than the mirth of the
King, and other learned Auditors, who rejoyed to see such a luxuriance of wit
was consistent with innocence; that jesting was confined to convenience and
mirth, married with that Modesty which became the Muses.

Among his learned and accurate performances in public, I cannot observe, that
when he took the Degree of Bachelor of Divinity, the Text upon which he chose
to Preach his Lain Sermon was Prophetic, and preparatory to his
after-sufferings, Phil. 1. 29. Vobis autem datum, etc. To you it is given on
the behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but to suffer for his sake.
Which eloquent and pious Sermon, he afterward was to fulfill indeed. Quod
docuit verbo confirmavit exemplo. He made his Doctrine good by his practice,
taking up the Cross of Christ, and following him.

He was preferred to be Prebend of the Collegiat Church of Eli, by the favor
and love of the then Bishop of that Seat, Dr. Felton, a very holy and good man:
he had also a good Living at Barlow, not far from Cambridge, a Country Village;
where he condescended, bringing out new and old out of his treasure, in A^ if
there were no Babes in the Church which could not dig^st meat nor pick bones.
his Preaching and Cathechising to ordinary capacities: (He often deplored the
disuse and want of Catechizing:) After that, this great Lamp was set and shined
in a Sphere more proper and proportionate, being chosen Master of
Katherine-hall. Here it was wonderful to see, how the Buildings, the Revenues,
the Students, and the Studiousness of that place increased by the Care,
Counsel, Prudence, Diligence, and Fame of Dr. Brownrig; who had such an eye to
all, that he oversaw none; frequenting the Studies, and examining even younger
Scholars, that they might be encouraged in Learning and Piety. He kept up very
much, as good Learning and good Manners, so the honor of Orthodox Divinity and
orderly Conformity: He kept to the Doctrine, Worship, Devotion, and Government
in the Church of England: which, he would say, he liked better and better, as
he grew older. If any, out of scruple or tenderness of Conscience was less
satisfied with some things, no man had a more tender heart or a gentler hand to
heal them, if worthy, ingenious, and honest. He would convince, though not
convert Gainsayers, and if he could not persuade them, yet he would pity and
pray for them, drawing all with the silken cords of humanity, the bands of a
man's love. He could endure differences among Learned and Godly men in Opinions,
especially sublime and obscure, without distance in affection. He thought that
Scripture it self in some points was left unto us less clear and possitive,
that Christians might have wherewith to exercise both Humility in themselves,
and Charity toward others. He very much venerated the first worthy Reformers
of Religion at home and abroad: yet was he not so addicted to any one Master,
as not freely to use his own great and mature judgment. He hoped every good
man had his Retractions either actual or intentional; though all had no time to
write them, as St. Austin did. He had the greatest Antipathy against those
unquiet and pragmatick Spirits, which affect endless Controversies, Varieties,
and Novelties in Religion to carry on a Party, and under that Skreen of
Religion, to advance their private Interests in public Designs. For the
Liturgy, though he needed a set Form as little as any, yet he had a particular
great esteem of it; 1. For the Honor and Piety of his Martyrly Composers. 2.
For its excellent matter and prudent method 3. For the good he saw in it to all
sober Christians, the want of which he saw was not supplied by any Ministers
private Praying and Preaching. Not that the Liturgy is unalterable: but he
judged all such alterations ought to be done by the public Spirit. As for
Bishops, he was too Learned a man to doubt, and too honest to deny the
Univerval Custom and Practice of the Church of Christ, in all Ages and places
for fifteen hundred years, according to the pattern (at least) received from
the Apostles; who without doubt, followed, as they best knew, the mind of
Christ. He was by the favor of K. Charles, and the great liking of all good
men, made Bishop of Exeter, Anno 1641. Doctor Young his old fri^nd, Pr^^ching
his Consecration Sermon on this Text, The waters (...) risen, O Lord, the
waters are risen; which inunde^ions of popular fury when Vice Chancellor of
Cambridge, he by his prudence set banks to a while; and by the pro^erity of his
parts and (...) ough.
Whereupon a certain man said, he wondered Dr. Brownrig would be made a Bishop,
whom he had heard sometime declare his judgment against Episcopacy. This being
related to the Bishop, he with some passion replied; I never thought, much less
said, as that person has falsely av^rred. I thank God, I took the Office of a
Bishop with a good Conscience, and so I hope by Gods mercy, I shall both
maintain and discharge it.

And howsoever this excellent Bishop enjoined not the benefit of the Kings
favor and munificence as to his Bishopric, or any other Preferment after the
Troubles of the times, yet he was ever most unmovable, royal respects of
Fidelity, Gratitude, Love, and Obedience. Accordingly when O. P. with some show
of respect to him, demanded his judgment in some public Affairs. The Bishop
with his wonted Gravity and Freedom, replied: My Lord, the best counsel I can
give, is that of our Savior, Render unto Caesar, the things that be Caesar's,
and unto God, the things that be Gods. With which free Answer O. P. was rather
silenced then satisfied.

This grave Personage, when forced to retire, was useful to those that were
worthy of him, and knew how to value him either as a Bishop, or a Divine, or a
Counselor, or a Comforter, or a Friend. Among those that gave him a Liberal
and Noble entertainment, Thomas Rich Esquire of Shunning in Berk-shire, desorveth
with honor to be thus Registered, that he was the especial Friend of Bishop
Brownrig. Indeed none could be hospitable to him gratis: he always paid for his
entertainments by his many excellent Discourses.

He was always when in health as cheerful (as far as the Tragedies of the
times gave leave) as one that had the continual Feast of a good Conscience; and
as content, as if he had a Lords Estate. All diminutions and indignities which
some men put upon so Worthy and so Venerable a Person, he digested into
patience and prayers. Thus he was in some degree conformable to the Primitive
Bishops, which were poor and persecuted, yea to the great Bishop of our Souls,
who for our sake made himself of no reputation.

About a year before he dyed, he was invited with much respect and civility to
the honorable Society of both the Temples, to bless them, as with his constant
residence, so with his fatherly instructions and prayers. To signify the
reality of their Love, and value to his Lordship, they not only allowed an
annual honorary recompense to express their thanks, but they provided handsome
Lodgings, and furnished them with all things necessary, convenient, and comely
for a Person of his Worth. Such as could hear him preach rejoiced at his
gracious words, such as for the Crowd could not come nigh enough to hear him,
had pleasure to stay and behold him, conceiving they saw a Sermon in his looks,
and were bettered by the Venerable Aspect of so worthy a Person. God was
pleased to exercise him with bodily pains, indispositions, and distempers,
sometimes with fits of the Stone; but under all these God supported him with
his grace, as always humble, devout, and pious, so for the most part sociable,
serene, and cheerful, till he had lived to his sixty seventh year.

He had frequent infirmities a little before his death. He would often say,
That it was a very cheap time to die, there being so little temptation to
desire life, and so many to welcome death, since he had lived to see no King in
the State, no Bishop in the Church, no Peer in Parliament worthy of that name.
He only hoped and prayed God that he would favor him so far as with a (...), as
to let him die without pain; and indeed he did. For after his Spirits were in
ten days decayed and wasted, he slumbred much, yet had vigilant Intervals, at
which time he gave himself to prayer, and meditation, and holy discourses: And
being full of the Grace and peace of God, and confirmed in it by the Absolution
of the Church, he rendered his precious soul to God that gave it, December. 7.
1659. Troubled with the Stone, Hyropick inclinations, and other distempers
incident to (...) bodies.


His body for Stature and Figure, was somewhat taller and bigger than ordinary,
yet very comely. No man ever became the Preachers Pulpit, or the Doctors Chair,
or the Episcopal Seat, better than he did, carrying before him such an
unaffected State and Grandeur (such benign gravity, and a kind of smiling
severity, that one might see much in him to be reverenced, but much more to be
loved; yet what was Venerable in him was very amiable, and what was amiable was
Venerable. His remains lie in the Temple-Church, with this following
Inscription, buried at the Charge of both Temples, to his great honor and their
greater. I know (says one, of his death) all accidents are minuted and
momented by Divine providence, and yet I hope I may say without sin, his was an
untimely death, not to himself (prepared thereunto) but as to his longer life,
which the prayers of pious people requested, the need of the Church required,
the date of nature could have permitted, but the pleasure of God (to which all
must submit) denied: otherwise he would have been most instrumental to the
composure of Church differences, the deserved opinion of whose goodness had
peaceable possession in the hearts of the Presbyterian party. I observed at his
Funeral that the prime persons of all persuasions were present, whose
judgments going several ways, met all in a general grief for his decease.

THE Life and Death OF Dr. JOSEPH HALL, Bishop of Norwich.
THIS Reverend Person (who has written most passages of this his life) being
July 1, 1574.
born at Ashby-de-lazouch in Leichestershire, of honest and well-allowed
Parents (his Father being chief Officer of that place under Henry Earl of
Huntington, the Lord of it) was so inured to seriousness and devotion by his
religious Mother, so improved in learning by his careful Schoolmasters, and so
promising in parts to the more nice observers of him, that in the fifteenth
year of his age, his Master and one Mr. Newly come from Cambridge, to be
Lecturer of that place.
Pelset, eminent in those parts, agreed together, to persuade his Father
charged with eleven Children besides, to a nearer and an easier way of his
education than Cambridge, whereto he was destined, (being devoted from his
infancy to that sacred Calling) under the last of these Gentlemen, who upon an
essay of his fitness for the use of his Studies, undertook he should in seven
years be as complete an Artist, Linguist, and Divine, as any University man,
his Indentures being Prepared, his Time being Set, and his Suits Addressed, for
the pleasing, but fatal project, as it fell out to him that succeeded, when it
pleased God (to whose providence the pious youth solemnly resigned himself in
this affair) that Mr. Nath. Who was born at the same time with him.
Silby, Fellow of Emanuel College, conceiving a good opinion of his aptness
and learning, and hearing the late projected diversion, set before his elder
Brothers eyes, then accidentally at Cambridge, the excellency of an Academical
life, with so much advantage, that falling on his Knees to his Father, he rise
not till promising the Sale of some of his own Inheritance, toward the charge,
he brought the good man to a passionate resolution, for the University.

Where with Mr. Henry Cholmely (for many years Partners of one Lesson, and for
as many of one Bed,) he spent two years at his Fathers sole charge, and four
years with his Uncle Sleigh of Darbies assistance (who would by no means suffer
him, so much against his own will at two years end, to be Master of that
School, whereof he had been so lately Scholar) when being Master of Arts, and
mentioned by his friend Cholmleys Father to the good Earl of H. who well
esteemed the Fathers service, and heard as well of the Sons hopefulnesse;
wherefore he demanded, not without some concern, why he was not preferred in
that College, where he was so much applauded; and being told his Tutor, a
person well known to his Lordship, filled up the place of that County, he
persuaded him to a resignation of his Fellowship, for an honorable Relation to
his Family, and the assurance of his favor, to whose place (notwithstand Mr.
Halls deprecation of the choice to Dr. Chadderton, upon the sudden news of the
Earls death, arrived the second day of their strict Election (saying
ingeniously that his youth was exposed to less needs, and more opportunities
of provision, than his Tutors more reduced years) he was admitted (the twenty
third year of his age) into a society, newly its self admitted to the
University (writes) he which if it has any equals, I dare say has no
superiors for good Order, studious Carriage, strict Government, austere Piety,
where he spent six or seven years more, with such contentment, as the rest of
his life has in vain striven to yield; his exercises being plausible,
especially his Position (for which he was first noted in the University) that
Mundus Senescit, a Position, says my Author, that was its own confutation, the
ingenuity thereof, arguing rather an increase than a decay of parts in this
latter age. His Rhetorique Lecture thronged, till sensible of his too long
diversion from his destined Calling, he entered not without fear the Sacred
Orders; wherein solemn his Performances in the University-Churches, and useful
his Instructions in the Neighbor-Villages, when Judge Popham entrusted with the
well endowed School of Founded by Master Blundel.
Tiverton in Devon, upon Dr. Chaddertons motion, whom he consulted, offered him
not so much the pains, as the government of it; for the acceptance whereof, he
with the Doctor attended the Judge at London, when a Messenger in the Street,
delivered him the good Lady Druryes Letter, with a tender of the Rectory of her
Halsted in Suffolk, which (telling Dr. Chadderton, that God pulled him by the
Sleeve to the East directly, to that Calling whereto he was destined, and must
go indirectly to by the West; and satisfying the Judge with the recommendation
of Mr. Cholmeley to that employment) he accepted cheerfully, and (an Atheist,
one Lilly, that estranged him from his Patron and Neighbors, being removed by
the Pestilence at London, whither he went to do ill offices between Mr. Hall
and his Patron, in answer, as he observes, to his Prayers to God to stop his
proceedings) enjoyed comfortably for two years, when having repaired his House;
and being by his affairs inclined to a Married state, as he walked from Church,
with a reverend Neighbor Master Grandidge.
Minister, he saw a comely and modest Daughter to Master George W^nniffe of
Brettenham.
Gentlewoman, at the Door of that House where they were invited to a
Wedding-dinner; and asking his worthy Friend, whether he knew her? was told by
him, he had bespoke her for his Wife, as upon due prosecution of the unexpected
providence she was for forty nine years after; the first two years whereof,
upon his noble friend Sir Edmund Bacons importunity, he attended him to the
Spaw in Ardenna, out of his Couriosity to make an ocular inspection into the
State of the Romish Church, with the allowance of his nearest friends, under
the protection of the Earl of Hertford, then Ambassador to Archduke Albert at
Bruxels, having provided for his charge.

Landing at Calais, after some cross winds at Sea, and passing, not without
horror, Graveling, Dunkirk, (those late dreadful prisons of the English)
Winoxberge, Ypre, Gaunt and Courtray, to Bruxels; the first observable he met
with, was an English Inns of Court Gentleman, run out of his Estate, Religion,
and Country, and turned Bigot and Physician; Immediately, at first meeting,
ravishing the learned Knight with Lipsius Apricollis his Relations of the Lady
of Or Shern^^ heav ill, (...) Sh^^phili.
Zichems Miracles, till Mr. Hall appeared in a habit more suitable to his
danger than his Calling, and asked what difference there was between that

it seems the Patients observed the like Magical times As Fridays Washing in
such a Ial^ll.
and washings. Whereupon, the Gentleman surprised, and disavowing that
learning, referred him to their Divines, the most eminent whereof was Costerus,
who having invited him to the College, at the Gate whereof the party saluted
him with a Deo gratias, lost time in a designed discourse of the unity of the
Church, out of which no Salvation; till he satisfied him, he came not thither,
with any doubt of his own Profession, but for the same of his Learning, and a
particular account of the aforesaid Miracles; in order to which, a weak
discourse of Divine and Diabolical Miracles, a choleric invective against our
Church for want of Miracles, with many other incident particulars; which Mr.
Hall modestly, yet effectually refuted that Father Baldwyn, who sat at the end
of the Table, as sorry a Gentleman of his Country (for all the while he was
accosted agreeably to his Habit with a Dominatio Vestra) should depart without
further satisfaction, offered him another Conference next morning, which upon
Sir Edmund Bacons intimation of the danger of it, he excused as bootlesse, both
sides being so thoroughly settled.

Thence, not without a great deliverance from Free-booters, a suspicious Convoy
and Night, they passed by the way of Naumaurs and Liege to the Spaw, where
finishing a second part of Meditations, to the first he had published, just
upon his travels, in his return up the Mosa, reconciling our reverent posture
at the Eucharist, to our denial of Transubstantiation, and answering some
furious Invectives against our Church, with an intimation of the Laws^
disabling him to return upon theirs. He incensed a Sorbonist Of the Carmelites.
Prior so far, that Sir Edmund Bacon winked upon him to withdraw; and in his
way to Brussels, describing our Churches and Baptism to some Italians, who
thought we had neither in elegant Latin bewrayed him so well, that he was
charged as a Spy, until he told them he was only an attendant of Sir Edmund
Bacon, Grandchild to the famous Lord Chacellor of that name in England,
traveling under the Protection of our late Ambassador, whom he waited on (not
without danger at Antwerp upon a Procession-day, had not a tall Brabanter
shadowed him) along the fair River Schield by Vlushing, where the curiosity of
visiting an ancient Colleague at Middleburgh, parted him from his Company, whom
the Tide would not stay for, and stayed him in a long expectation of an
inconvenient and tempestuous passage.

But ten pounds of his small maintenance being detained, a year and a half
after his useful extravagancies, he arose suddenly out of Bed and went to
London (upon the Overture of a Preachers place at St. Edmunds-bury) to persuade
his Patron to reason, who complemented him out of so ungainful a change, and
commending his Sermon at London to my Lord Denny (who had a great kindness for
him for those little Books sake he writ, as he said, to buy Books) wished him
to wait upon him as he did (when upon Mr. Gurney the Earl of Essex his Tutors
motion, he had preached so successefully the Sunday at the Princes At Richmond.
Court (where his meditations were veryacceptable) and on the Tuesday following
by the Princes order, that he gave him his hand, and commanded him his service;
and when his Patron, who knowing he would be taken up, wished him now at home,
gave him an harsh answer about Ministers rate of Competencies) with welcome,
and terms as noble as the mover for the acceptance of Waltham, wherein, and the
Princes service; he settled himself with much comfort and no less respect: his
Highness by his Governor Sir Thomas Challoner, offering him honorable
Preferment for constant residence at Court, and his Lord no less advantageous
for his stay at Waltham, where his little Delivered without book with the same
exactness they were Penned.
Catechism did much good, his three exactly Penned Sermons a week more: and his
select prayer, (without which he never performed any exercise from the
thirteenth year of his age to his daying day) most of all.

During the two and twenty years he continued at Waltham, four eminent Services
he went through.

1. The recovery of Wolverhampton Church (to which belonged a Dean and eight
Prebendaries) swallowed up by a wilful Recusant in a pretended Fee-farm for
ever, where being collated Prebend by the Dean of Windsor upon his Masters
Letters, he discovered counterfeited Seals, Rasures, Interpolations, and
Misdates of unjustifiable evidence, whereupon the Lord Elmrere awarded the
Estate to the Church, until revicted by Common Law; the Adversary Sir Walter
Leveson offered him 40 l. per annum; A special Verdict at King's Bench being
declared for them: upon the renewal of the Suit (his Colleague, in whose name
it ran being dead) the Foreman of the Jury who vowed to carry it for Sir
Walter, the very day before the trial, fell mad: His Majesty having upon his
Petition prevented the Projectors of concealment, which a word that fell from
Sir Walter intimated) Sir Walter offered, first to cast up his Fee-farm for a
Lease. Secondly, to make each Prebends place Ten pound more being allowed
Doctor Hall for his pains.
30 l. per annum, which Composition being furthered by Then Dean of Windsor,
and so Patron of the Church.
Spalato, and only deferred by two scrupulous Prebends till Sir Walters death,
the Lord Treasurer confirmed only with some abatement in consideration of the
Orphans condition, and the Prebend resigned by the publick-spirited Doctor
resigned to one Mr. Lee, who should reside there and instruct that great and
long neglected people.

2. The attendance in my Lord Viscount Doncaster, afterward the Earl of
Carlisles most splendid Embassy in France, whence returning with much ado
after a hard journey by Land, in Company with his dear Du Moulin, and an harder
by Sea, he was collated to the Long-promised Deanery of Worcester, which yet
the excellent Dr. Field Dean of Gloucester, was so sure of in the Doctors
absence, that he had brought Furniture for that spacious house.

3. His Majesty's service in Scotland, which he performed with that applause
for his Demeanor and Doctrine from Priests and people, that at his return with
the Earl of Carlisle before the King (upon supposition that the Country Divines
would supply the Stage-courses) some envious persons suggested to his Majesty
his compliance with that prejudicate people, whereupon he was after a gracious
acknowledgement of his service, called to a mild account; his Royal Master not
more freely professing what informations had been given against him, than his
own full satisfaction with his sincere and just answer, as whose excellent
wisdom well saw that such winning carriage of his could be no hindrance to his
great designs, and required him to declare his judgment in the five points in

with effects there, and approbation from his Majesty beyond his hopes.

Majesty advising and furnishing a Synod there, sent him as one of the four
British Divines to Dort, where his weak body agreeing not with the unquietness
of those Garrisoned Towns, after some pathetick Speeches and motions for
accommodation: after the expedient (called Sintentia 4. Theol. Brit.) for
reconciliation and the Elegant Latin Sermon (the night before he preached
which he was wonderfully refreshed and enlivened beyond what he had been a
month before) for Peace he retired first to my Lord Ambassador Carletons at
the Hague, and with his Majesty's leave Dr. Goad being substituted in his place
to England, taking his farewell of the Synod in these words.

Mountague offered to subscribe them on the one hand, and most Anti-monstrants

was before Luther? and we produce witnesses of it^ in every age with some
disadvantage, since our Church is not another from theirs, but the same more
Reformed^) the Church of Rome is an ancient and true Church, only it has new
Errors; an assertion, which with his former expedient, exposed him so far to
the zeal of narrow-sighted men, that an Apologetical advertisement, a rational
reconciler backed by Bishop Mortor, Bishop Davenant, Dr. Prideaux, and Dr.
Primroses unquestionable testimony, and his own moderation in silencing all the
Writers of both sides (as there were indeed to lay hold of any Controversy in
order to the public disturbance) were little enough to allay the jealousy of
his Lukewarmness and abatement of former zeal (when alas! he was only grown
older, and so wiser!) especially since it was but a little before that he was
made Bishop of Exeter (having refused Gloucester) where Providence settled him.

pursuance of their own right, and the trust reposed in them by his Majesty; and
that being not, as was intended, proposed either to his Majesty's Secretary, to

Brethren, Ian. 30. late in a bitter frosty night was Voted to the Tower, after
a Charge of High Treason (for owning his Parliamentary right) received upon his
Knees, where Preaching in his course with his Brethren, and Meditating, he
heard cheerfully of the Bonfires, Ringing in the City, upon their Imprisonment;
he looked unconcernedly on the aspersions cast on them here, and in Foreign

stopped, the Synodals were kept back, Ordination was restrained: (The very
Mayor of Norwich, and his Brethren, summoning the grave Bishop before them, an
unheard of peremptorinesse, for ordaining in his Chapel, contrary to the
Covenant.) And when they allowed him but a fifth part, Assessements were
demanded for all; extremities none could bear, but he who exercised moderation
and patience, as exemplarily as he recommended them to others pathetically and
eloquently, who often passionately complained of the sacrilegious outrages upon
the Church, but was silent in those unjust ones on himself; who in the midst of
his miseries provided for the Churches Comfort, by his Treatises of
Consolation; for its Peace, by the Peacemaker, Pax Terris, and Modest offer;
for its Instruction, by his frequent Sermons, as often as he was allowed; for
its Poor, by a Weekly Contribution to distressed Widows to his death, and a
good sum in the Place where he was born, and the City where he died after it;
for its Professors, by holy admonitions, counsels, and resolutions; for its
Enemies, by dealing with some of them so effectually, that they repented, and
one among the rest, a great Commissioner, and Justice of Peace, I mean Esquire
Lucas, who, though a man of a great Estate, received Orders at his hands, and
recompensed in injuries to the Church as Committee-man, by being a faithful
Minister of it to this day; and when he could not prevail with men, especially,
about the horrid Murder of his Gracious Sovereign, he wrestled with God
(according to his Intimation in his Mourners of Sion, to all other Members of
our Church) in a Weekly Fast with his Family to his death, the approaches to
which, was as his whole life, solemn, staid, composed, and active, both in
Press and Pulpit (his intellectuals and sensuals, the effect of his
temperance, being fresh to the last) till the Stone and Stangury wasted his
natural strength, and his The excellent Doctor Brown of Norwich.

learning, and piety, who came to crave his dying Prayers and Benedictions; one
whereof (a Noble Votary) he saluted with the words of an ancient Votary ( Vide
hominem mox pulverem futurum.) After many holy prayers, exhortations, and
discourses, he rouzed up his dying spirits, to a heavenly Confession of his
Faith, wherein his Speech failed him; and with some Struglings of Nature, with
the Agonies of Death, he quietly, gradually, and even insensibly gave up the
Ghost. (Having Vid^ C^lumb No^.

of himself.

1. His excellent Children, in some of whom we yet see and enjoy him.

2. His incomparable Writings, of which it was said, by one that called him The
English Seneca, That he was not unhappy at Controsies, more happy at Comments,
very good in Characters, better in his Sermons, best of all in his Meditations;
now Collected in three Volumes with his Remains.

And 3. In his inimitable Virtues so humble, that he would readily hear the
youngest at Norwich; so meek, that he was never transported, but at three
things. 1. Grehams horrid Apostasy. 2. The infamous Sacrilege at Norwich. And
3. The Kings unparalled Murder: So religious, that every thing he saw, did, or
suffered, exercised his habitual devotion; so innocent, that Which he called
his other soul.
Music, Mathematick, and Fishing, were all his Recreations; so temperate, that
one plain meal in thirty hours was his diet; so generally accomplished that he
was an excellent Poet, Orator, Historian, Linguist, Antiquary, Phisolopher,
School Divine, Casuist, and what not: no part of Learning but adorns some or
other of his Works, in a most eminent manner; I cannot express him more
properly than his worthy Sons, Heirs to his worth, and to his modesty, intimate
him with Pericles. Thucide^.

He was one that taught this Church the Art of Divine Meditation, one that
always made it his business to see and search into the things of God, with a
zealous diligence, rather than a bold curiosity.

Antiqua probitate, and simplicitate virum, and eruditis pietate, and piis
eruditionis laud Antecellentem, ita secundas doctrinae ferentem, ut pietatis
primas obtineret. Those that were most eminent for learning, he excelled in
piety; and those that were most famous for piety, he excelled in learning; this
Highpriests Breast was so richly adorned with the glorious Vrim, and with the
more precious Jewel of the Thummim.

The Church fared the better for his wrestling Prayers, and the State for his
Holy Vows. One he was of a serene, mild, and calm aspect, as smooth as his wit
and tongue; though living long, but once a Child in understanding, though
always so in humility and innocence, whereby he suppled those adversaries into
a moderation, that could not be persuaded to a conversion; they observing his
industry neither ceasing nor abating with his preferments, valuing his time as
much, and giving account of it as well as any man, not to his dying day waving
any pains agreeable to his Calling, till forbidden by men, or disenabled by
God; when it was observed, that he was as diligent a Hearer, as he had been a
Preacher.

He would not be Buried in the Church, but he Lives in it by his great Charity,
allowing a weekly Contribution to the poor among whom he lived, out of his
little remainder, which he observed, like the Widows Barrel of Meal, and Cruse
of Oil, to increase by being dispersed, leaving 30 l. a piece to the Widows of
the Town where he was born, and the City where he died.

2. His Moderation, which is known unto all men.

3. His Children, of whom I may say, as St. Ambrose does of Theodosius: Non
totus recessit, reliquit nobis Liberos, in quibus cum debemus agnoscere, et in
quibus cum cernimus, et tenemus.

4. His Works which praise him, as much as all men praise them, and to which we
may affix Nazianzens Character of Basils Works. (...).

THE Life and Death OF Mr. WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT.
NOT only all the Wisdom, but all the Wit of the Age (wherein both Wit and
Wisdom were at a fatal height) attended that Cause that commanded not only the
Arms of the most Valiant, but the Parts of the most Learned; these deserving
the Bays for the vast reason they urged in his Majesty's behalf, as the other
the Laurel for the great things they under-went for his Majesty's person, among
whom Mr. William Cartwright, Son of Tho. Cartwright of Burford in the County of
Oxford, born Aug. 16. 1615. bred at the Kings School in Westminster, under Dr.
Osbaston; and in Christ-Church in Oxford, under Mr. Terrent, deserves to be as
well known to Posterity, as he was admired in his own time, whose very
Recreations has above fifty of the choicest Pens to applaud them; his high
abilities were accompanied with so much candor and sweetness, that they made
him equally loved, and admired; his virtuous modesty attaining the greatest
honor by avoiding all.

His soul naturally great and capable, had, he said, three advantages to fill
it; great spirited Tutors, choice Books, and select Company; it was his usual
saying, That it was his happiness that he neither heard nor read any thing
vulgar, weak, or raw, till his mind was fixed to notions exact as reason, and
as high as fancy. Its a great care due to our first years, That generous
thoughts be instilled into us; imitation and observation raised his parts, and
an humor of expressing every excellent Piece he saw, and indeed each brave
notion he met with (and he was an exact Collector) whereby he translated not
only brave men's thoughts to his own words, but their very Heart and Genius to
his own constitution made up of strong Sense, compact Learning, clean, sharp,
full, and sure Wit; brave passions, even and high Language; in ^ine, a great
fancy, with as great judgment, that could do and be what it would: no man can
tell (as Aristotle said of AEschron the Poet) what this prodigious man could
not do.

None humored things and persons out of his own observation more properly. So
much valued at Court for his Especially in his admirable Royal Slave, his Play
and his Prophesi^, made 1636. to entertain the King and Queen at Christ-Church

Poetry, that the King and Queen enquired very anxiously of his health in his
last sickness; admirable his performances, wherein (as my Lord of Monmouth
Charactereth them) was wit for youth, and wisdom for the wise.

So admired in Christ-Church for his easy, natural, proper, and clear Oratory,
especially his Lectures on the Passions, which in his Descriptions seem but
varieated reason; those wild beasts being tuned and composed to tameness and
order, by his sweet and harmonious language: that Dr. Fell said, Cartwright was
the utmost m^n could come to.

So thronged in the Metaphysick School (where no performance ever like his, and
his learned Predecessor Mr. Tho. Barlow of Queens) when Aristotle ran as smooth
as Virgil, and his Philosophy melting as his Plays, and his Lectures on that
obscure Book which Aristotle made not to be (...) (...) (...). See Dr. Ba^hurst

understood as clear as his Poems; the abstractions refined, what was rugged
for many ages, lost its horror and pleased, and the thorns of Philosophy
turned Roses by him, that the Theater was thin to his School, and Comedy was
not half so good entertainment as his Philosophy.

So ravishing by the comeliness of his presence (for his body was as handsome
as his soul) and the beauties of his discourse in his Sermons made up of
learned and holy ecstasies, that (by a strength mixed with sweetness, Dr. M^in
upon him.
vigorous and fair) he winged up his hearers hearts to the same height with his
own, expressed strict virtue into the greatest pleasure, strowed the straight
way to ease and delight; chained up all thoughts to his, ravishing with a
Masculine vigor his hearers, not only by way of persuasion, but command. He

What Is in our souls his Verse controuls.
We quit our minds, and he commands our powers,
He shufstes souls with us,
And frames us thus, or thus;
We change our humors, as his discourse does flowers.


In fine, to have a person complete in the circle both of Arts, and Virtues.
Whose universal Genius did know

But these as modern faculties, his soul

said, had he read his own Eternity in that lasting Elegy given him by Mr.
Cartwright, or that other by his good friend Mr. Robert Waring, neither of
which pieces are easily to be imitated) dropping not a line against the Laws

please: in whom Poetry now expiring (as dying things contract all their
strength and vigor to one great action) collected all its rich Beauties, Sir
Edward (...) his Poems. Sir John Pettus upon his Poetry.

An universal Wit
All things, and men, could fit,
So shaped for every one,
As born for that alone:
Not as where Growth, Sense, Reason, one controuls,
But as if he had had three rational souls;
He wrote so brave a Verse that none knew which

His Language choice and true,
The whole Contexture wrought

To see all Learning (like unpolished Jewels framed into Figures) smoothed into
pleasure; and a Miracle of Industry and Wit sitting sixteen hours a day at all
manner of knowledge, and by the happy Alchymis of wit, turning the Axioms of
Aristotle, the Problems of Euclide, the sums of Aquinas, the Code of
Justinian, the Contexture of History, the learning of Rabbines, the Mythology
of Gentilism, the Fathers, Councels, Martyrologyes, and Liturgicks, and
Christians; the Poetry, Oratory, and Criticism of the world into a good Man, a
great Scholar, a most ingenious Poet and Orator, and an excellent Preacher, in
whom hallowed fancies and reason grew Visions, and holy passions Raptures and
Ecstasies, and all this at thirty years of age. When he dyed Proctor of the
University, 1643. of a Malignant Fever then raging in that Garrison, and

continue an age; and a blot upon our Nation and Religion that will last with
the world.

Dr. Lluelin on the Death of Mr. W. Cartwright.
THey that have known thee well, and searched thy parts
Through all the Chain of Arts,
Thy apprehension quick as active light,
Clear Judgment without night:
Thy fancy free, yet never wild, or mad
With wings to fly, and none to gadde;
Thy Language still in Rich, yet comely Dress
Not to expose thy mind, but to express.
They that have known thee thus, sigh and confess,
They wish they would known thee still, or known thee less.
To these the wealth and beauties of thy mind,
Be other Virtues joined,
Thy modest soul strongly confirmed, and hard,
Never beckned from its guard;
But bravely fixed midst all the baits of Praise,
Deeming that Music treacherous Lays.
Those put that Rate and Price upon thy breath,
Great Charles enquires thy health, the Clouds thy death:
For nobler Trophies can no Ashes call,
Kings greet thy safety, Thunder speaks thy fall.
THE Life and Death OF Mr. DUDLEY DIGGES,
YOunger Son of Sir Dudley Digges, Master of the Rolls and Fellow of All Souls

(the Beaumont to this Fletcher.) Whose thoughts and his thoughts dress
appeared both such,
That 'twas his happy fault to do too much.
And when by marking the arguments and reasons of their alteration, why that
phrase least proper, this passage more cautious and advised, he was able to
make his own by his own; which let it smile, but not giggle, inflamed by that
only way to be excellent, imitation; (When the great soul of the Author, lies
upon the capable soul of the Reader, as Elishas body upon the Child, fancy
upon fancy, reason upon his reason, till he be warmed and quickened into the
same great accomplishments, by an exact and unerring reason, that apprehended
things in the same order and coherence they subsist, whose Idea answered the
order of the world, as near (abating humane frailties) as that did the first
Idea; his regular thoughts, sober nature, made accurate by art, not gadding
confusedly to diverse objects, but proceeding rationally from one to another: By
a methodical study of choice and useful learning, overcame the Intelligible
World, as soon as Alexander did the Real, that is, at thirty; the product
whereof (besides University performances, crowned with University applause;
That he did best there, where all do well.) Performances wherein words had the
life and air of things; where humors appeared as lively in his expression, as
they did abroad in others actions; yea, common things grew proper in his
Charms, rather than Speeches, wherein his thoughts were so ordered, so
expressed, as if he did not discourse, but see; words and things falling into
their order, so naturally and easily, as nothing fell amiss; as if the Scholar,
as well as the Wiseman, were all things.

That life, that Venus of all things which we conceive or show, proportioned.
Decency was not found scattered in him here or there, but like the soul wholly
every where; exercises wherein he spoke not only fancy to please, but reason
to convince; vexing and filing the roughest subject, by the Chimistry and heat
of a great spirit into comeliness; not pouring in the Ore or Gross, but in
fair Coin, and choice distillations, dispensing his learning, well skilled when
to spare, and when to entertain. He gave the right blush and color unto
things, low without creeping, high without loss of wings smooth, yet not weak,
and by a through care, big without swelling, without Painting fair. I say,
besides Academical exercises, the only issue of this noble Gentleman's great
parts, and unwearied Studies, was a subtle and solid Treatise, in the beginning
of our Civil Wars, of the difference between King and Parliament; so full, that
they who have since handled that Controversy, have written plura non plus, yea
aliter, rather than alia, of that subject.

A choice Fever, called a New Disease in Oxford Garrison, seizing on him, and
other persons of pure spirits, and nobly tempered bodies, 1643/4. prevented him
in those great services he was qualified for in his generation, which indeed
deserved him not, being likely to have turned him out of the University, by a
Malignant Visitation, if he had not been called out of the world by a Malignant
disease. Of him and of the foresaid,

he had been so usefully a Fellow and a Tutor (but superior power guiding that

Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, in the Wardenship of the College, as he did
Dr. Monk in the Provostship of Eaton, an excellent Companion wherever he was
entertained in the time of the Troubles, when he was every where welcome, so
good his nature; and where ever he entertained since for then, he made

sometimes Scholar of the Charter^house, and Fellow of Corpus Christi College

good carriage, who coming by White Hall when the King was put to death, he laid
the horrid fact so to heart, that coming home to Master Heywoids house at
Westminster, whose Sister he had married, he fell into such an agony, that
going up immediately into his Chamber, he told his friends about him (though he
was then as well as ever he was in his life) that he should never stir out of
that Chamber alive, as his heart breaking under the great weight of his grief
for the horror of the act its self and his thoughts, (for he was a foreseeing
man of the sadness of the consequence of it) he did not, dying 1649.

THE Life and Death Of the Right Honorable, HENRY SPENCER, Earl of Sunderland,
THis Noble Person, whose Ancestor when created Baron of Wormeleighton in
Warwickshire primo Iacobi, as he said, for the report of his being the
greatest Moneyed man in England, was the fifth Knight of his Family, in an
immediate succession descended from the Spencers Earls of Gloucester and
Winchester, was himself, when made Earl for his great merit, in Court and Camp,
19 Car. 1. 1643. the thirty ninth Gentleman bearing arms successively in his
house, being allied as it appeared then to all the Nobility that time at Court,
but Duke Hamilton.

A taunt a Boy gave him when a Child, proved a sober Precept to him when a Man;
and the bare being upbraided that he would be a wicked and an useless Nobleman,
obliged him ever after to approve himself otherwise: When Monicaes St.
Augustines Mothers Companion called her Toss-pot in her anger, it gave her
occasion to be sober and temperate all her life. Bitter Jeers sometimes makes
wholesome Physic, when God sanctifies malice to do the office of good will. Mr.
Perkins having taken so much liberty in his younger years, as cost him many a
sigh in his reduced age, heard a Tutor in the next Chamber to him chiding a
Pupil thus, What, will you be such a Bake-hell as Perkins? and immediately upon
it was reclaimed, and the Quicksilver of his extravagant studies and courses,
fixed to a very great improvement.

Three days were very lucky to him, May 6. July 11. and September 19. and two
unlucky, Sept. 20. and Ian. 6. Great men have their great days, it was the And
the very same day was seven time somine^s to the (...) Carac^lia.
sixth of April whereon Alexander was born, the sixth of April that he
conquered Darius, the sixth of April that he won a battle at Sea, and a sixth
of April that he dyed on. On the thirtieth of September Pompey the Great was
born, on the thirtieth of September he triumphed for his Asian Conquest, and on
the thirtieth of September he dyed on. On the nineteenth of August Augustus was
adopted, on the nineteenth of August he began his Consulship, on the nineteenth
of August he Conquered the triumviri, and on the nineteenth of August he dyed.
The sixth of January was five times auspicious to Charles Duke of Anjou; the
24. of February four times happy to Charles the Fifth, as the twelfth of May
was to Charles the Eighth; and to say no more, the third of September has been
observable to England 1650. at Dunbar, 1651. at Worcester, 1658. at Whitehall,
and 1666. at London. He had a Tutor crooked with age, that streightened the
manners of his youth, arming him against those Customs (that are not knocked
but served into the soul) inuring him to good discourse and company;
habituating him to temperance and good order, whence he had the advantage of
others, not only in health, but in time and business: and diverting him with
safe, cheap, but manly and generous Recreations. The result of which Education,
was a knowing and a staid nature that made him a Lamb, when pleased; a Lion,
when angry; daring in the highest tumults, 1640. and 1641. to give the best
Counsel, and to oppose the worst; advising those that complained that his
Majesty was gone away, to lure him home by their loving behavior, and not do
as those troublesome women, who by their hideous outcries drive their wandering
Husbands further off. And when the House of Lords became the House of Commons,
by vile compliances with tumults; when the Lords to climb up to the peoples
favor, trampled on one another, the rabble bringing tales, and they belief,
he, though secure in his person, yet not safe in his relation and allegiance at
Westminster, follows his Sovereigns fortunes, as his Predecessors had done his
Ancestors; it was the first Lord Spencer of Wormeleighton that in Parliament to
another Lord, who told him (as they were discoursing of their Ancestors service
to the Crown) That at that time his Forefathers were keeping The best Sheep in

this Lord.
sheep; returned, That if they then kept sheep, yours were then plotting of
Treason: He pit ied not, but reproved them that bemoaned his Majesty's
distance, and whereas they expected to be comm^nded for their patience under so
great a punishment, he condemned them for deserving it, often urging that of
Seneca, Epist. 80. Nihil rex male parentibus majus minaripotest, quam ut abeat
de regno. The last words he spoke in the Parliament House at Westminster were
these; We had been satisfied long ere this, if we did not ask things that deny
themselves, and some men had not shuffled Demands into our Propositions, on
purpose that we may have no satisfaction: He brought 15000 l. and 1200 men to
his Majesty's relief, and the Earl of Northampton, his Countey man's assistance;
adding to his Estate and Friends, his Counsel and personal service, wherein in
dispute about a rising ground in the first Newbery fight, not far from his
Majesty, he fell. First, a good Patriot upon all other occasions (as one of
them at W^stminster observed) promoting the Trade, Manufactures, and
Privileges of this Country, and now standing by his Majesty, as he evidently
saw him stand for his Kingdom, saying (by a foresight and Prospect he had of
things suitable to the eminence of his place) that one seven years (Truth is
the Daughter of Time) would show that the King was the true Common-wealths-man.
Secondly, a true Nobleman that was virtuous, because it became him, as well as
because it was enjoined him: being above vice, as well as without it, looking
upon it as his shame and dishonor, as well as sin and offense. Thirdly, a good
Neighbor, the Country about him when he had occasion to make use of it, being
his friends that loved, rather than slaves that feared him. Fourthly, a
discreet Landlord, finding ways to improve his Land, rather than rack his
Tenants. Fifthly, a noble Housekeeper, to whom that ingenuity that he was
Master of himself, was welcome in others. Sixthly, an honest Patron, seldom
furnishing a Church with an Incumbent, till he had consulted the College he
had been of, and the Bishop he lived under. Seventhly, an exemplary Master of a
Family, observing exactly the excellent Rules he so strictly enjoined,
consecrating his house to a Temple, where he ordered his followers to wrestle
with God in Prayer, while he wrestled with the Enemy in fight; whence those
holy thoughts that went as harbingers of his soul to heaven, whereof he had a
glimpse before he died, through the chinks of a wounded body, when those noble
persons, Sept. 20. 1643. closed his eyes, that through weeping had hardly any
left themselves; leaving behind him a noble Lord, of whom Dr. Pierce that had
the tuition of him, gave this Character, That his choice endowments of nature,
having been happily seasoned and crowned with grace, gave him at once such a
willingness and aptness to be taught, as reconciled his greatest pains with
ease and pleasure; and made the Education of his dear Lord not so much his
employment, as his Recreation and Reward. And a noble Lady not to be mentioned
without the highest honor in this Catalogue of Sufferers, to so many of whom
her House was a Sanctuary, her Interest a Protection, her Estate a Maintenance,
and the Livings in her gift a Preferment; among whom the foresaid excellent
person acknowledged to her all the visible contentment of his suffering years,
a good portion, and At Bring^on in Northhamptonshire
a good people, which he enjoyed by her favor, and kept by her interest and
power.

Sussex.
Conqueror, to settle the Monarchy of this kingdom, and he went out of the
world maintaining it with his Interest; which was so great, that the Faction
pretended his Concurrence with them, a passage which puts me in mind of the
great power of his Predecessors, one of whom in Edward the first Kings time,
has this Memorandum of Record.

Memorandum,

THat Henry de Piere-point, on Monday, the day after the Octaves of St.
Michael, came into the Chancery at Lincoln, and said publicly, that he had
lost his Seal, and protested, that if any Instrument were found Sealed with
that Seal, after that time, the same should be of no value or effect. Indeed it
was his great Services when Sheriff 13. Iacobi, and greater when Justice of
Peace, (and King James in a Speech in Star Chamber, valueth a Justice of Peace
as much as one of his Privy-Councel, as it is as much to see Laws and Order
kept, as to make them; and to keep the peace in each part of the kingdom, as to
advice about the peace of the whole) composing differences by his skill in Law,
suppressing disorders by his great reputation, and promoting the good of his
Country, by his large prudence, and deep insight into things; that as he was
honored with King Charles the first his Writ, to be Baron in Parliament (a
favor his Ancestor Robert de Piere-point had in Edward the thirds time, but
did not enjoy, being summoned a Baron in Parliament, and dying before he Sat
therein) by the Title of Baron Piere-point, and Viscount Newarke, and
afterward 4. Caroli primi, Earl of Kingston, for his moderate opinions between
the extremes then prevailing in Parliaments, which he was able to accommodate,
as to State Affairs, as an experienced man; and as to Church Affairs, as a
Christian, and a great Scholar. Whence he would commend a general learning to
young Noblemen, upon this ground, because the great variety of Debates that
came before them, wherein the unlearned Gentry, either rashly offer dangerous
proposals to impose on others, o^ sloathfully rest in a tame yea and nay, being
easily imposed on by others. The effect whereof we found both in his and his
hopeful Son, the now Illustrious Marquess of Dorchesters learned and rational
Defenses of the Spiritual Function, and Temporal Honors, and Employments of
Bishops, 1641/2. which though they could not convert any of the obstinate
Anti-episcopal men (not a speech to satisfy their reason, but a grant to
gratify their interest must effect that) yet confirmed they the wavering
Episcopal party. When it came to pass in the Civil Wars of England, as it had
done in those of Rome, that the Seditious (Brutus and Cassius) were followed by
the lower sort of the people, Ex subditis Romanorum (says Dion) while Caesar's
Army consisted, Ex Romany nobilibus and sortibus.

This honorable Person, and his Eldest Son, attended his Majesty, the Father
with the Sword, and the Son with the Pen, more fatal to the Faction that the
Sword; and therefore the first men excepted out of Pardon, were such excellent
Penmen, as the Lords Viscount Newark and Faulkland.

Sir Edward Hide, Sir Edward Nicholas, and Mr. Endintion Porter, the quickness
of whose honorable Declarations and Replies amazed the Conspiracy, as the
smartnesse of them betrayed and defeated it; their writings being like truth,
naturally clear; and the Rebels like error, forced and obscure.

He brought to his Majesty 4000 men, of whose number 2000 were able and willing
to serve him with their Persons, and the r^st with their Arms, and Money, to
the value of 24000 l. and having the care of the Country, with his near
Relation the Duke of New Castle, he vigorously opposed the legitimate
Commission of Array, to the by-blow of the Militia, till he was surprised at
Gainsborough by the Lord Willoughby of Parrham, and being looked upon as a
person of great concernment to the Kings affairs (the Country calling him
usually the good Earl of Kingston) sent toward Hull in a Pinnace, which Sir
Charles Cavendish, who knew well the value of that noble person, as well as the
enemy, pursued, demanding the Earl, and when refused, shooting at the Pinnace
with a Drake, that unfortunately killed him and his servant, placed a mark to
his friends shot, who when they took the Vessel, put all the Company to the
Sword, a just, though not a valuable sacrifice to so noble a Ghost; which King
Charles the I. would have ransomed at as high a rate, as his Ancestor Robert
Peire-point was redeemed in Edward the III. time, who cost that King, when
taken at Lewis, 700 mark, the Ransom (as money went in those days) of a Prince,
rather than a Subject.

THE Life and Death OF Dr. THOMAS MORTON, Bishop of Duresm.
HE was of the same original and stock with that Eminent Prelate, and wise
Statesman, John Morton, Lo^d Chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury (by
whose contrivance and management the Houses of York and Lancaster For be it was
that managed Henry the sevenths escape, and marriage with Elizabeth, daughter
to Edward the fourth.
were united) as appears by his Coat-Armor, and R. Motton of Dorsetshire,
descended from one of the Executors of the aforersaid Cardinal, exquiring this
Bishop out upon the Princing of his first Book, and claiming kindred with him,
though he was so modest as not to look upon his Pedigree, when once presented,
though fairly rewarding the man that brought it.
Pedigree. He was born in the ancient and famous City of York, March 20. 1564.
his Parents were of good repute. Mr. Richard Morton, a well known Mercer, and
Mrs. Elizabeth Leedale (by whom the Valvasours and Langdales acknowledge
themselves to be of his Kindred,) by whose care he was brought up in Piety and
Learning; first at York, under Mr. Pullen, and afterward at Where Guy Faux

Hallifax, under Mr. Maud (of whom he always spoke with great reverence, as a
grave Man, and a good Scholar) and from thence, 1582. went to the University of
Cambridge, at the eighteenth year of his age, and there was admitted into St.
John's College, under Dr. Whitacre, wherein were so many eminent Scholars at
that time, as he was wont to say, It seemed to be a whole University of its
self. His Tutor was Mr. Anthony Higgon, afterward Dean of Rippon, who lest him
to the care of Mr. Hen. Nelson, Rector of Hougham in Lincolnshire, who lived to
see his Pupil pass through all the other Dignities he had in the Church, till
he came to be Bishop of Duresm, and a good many years after.

Being chosen Scholar of Constables Foundation, 1584. In the year 1590. he took
his Degree of Master of Arts, having performed all his Exercises with great
approbation and applause. Afterward he continued his Studies in the College
at his Fathers charge for above two years. March 17. 1592. he was admitted Into
Dr. Ke^sons Foundation.
Fellow, merely for his worth, against eight Competitors for the place; which
he was wont to recount with greater contentment to himself, than his
advancement to any Dignity he ever enjoyed in the Church. About the same time
he was chosen Logic Lecturer for the University, which place he discharged
with much art and diligence, as appears by his Lectures found among his Papers
fairly written.

In the same year he was admitted to the Order of Deacon, and the next after,
of Priesthood. Having received his Commission from God and the Church, he was
very ready to assist others in the way of charity; but not too forward to take
upon him the particular care of souls. And accordingly we find him for the
space of five years after this, continuing in the College, prosecuting his own
private Study, and reading to such Scholars as were committed to his Care and
Tuition.

Anno 1598. He took his Degree of Bachelor of Divinity, and about the same
year, being Presented, Instituted, and Inducted to the Rectory of Long-Marston,
four miles distant from his native City of York, he betook himself wholly to
the cure of Souls there committed to him, which he discharged with great care
and diligence; and yet he did not intermit his higher studies, the general good
of the Church, while he attended it. To that end he had always kept some person
to be his Assistant, whom he knew to Generally his own Pupils, as Mr. Jo.
Pierce, Prebendary of Leichfield, and Mr. Level of Durham.
be pious and learned. And this assistance was more necessary, because his
great parts and worth would not suffer him to enjoy his privacy in a Country
cure. For first, he was made choice of by the Earl of Huntington, then Lord
President of the North, to be his Chaplain, for his dexterity and acuteness, in
disputing with the Romish Recusants; for it was Queen Elizabeth's express
command to that Lord, to convince them by arguments rather than suppress them
by force; and this She expressed (as his Lorship was wont to say) in the words
of the Prophet, Nolo mortem peccatoris. But the Earl dying presently after, he
returned to his privacy at Marston, where he continued not long, before the
Lord Sheffield (who succeeded as Lord President) commanded him to hold a
public Conference before his Lordship, and the Council, at the Mannor-house in
York, with two Master Young a Priest, and Mr. Stillington a Layman.
Romish Recusants, then Prisoners in the Castle; which he performed with great
satisfaction to the Auditory, among whom were many of the chief Gentry and
Clergy of Yorkshire.

Anno 1602. Began the great Plague at York, at which time he carried himself
with much Heroical Charity. For the Poor being removed to the Pesthouse, he
made it his frequent use to visit them with food, both for their Bodies and
Souls. His chief Errand was to comfort them, pray for them, and with them; and
to make his coming more acceptable, he carried with him a Sack of Proviston
usually for them that wanted it. And because he would not have any body to run
any hazard thereby but himself, he seldom suffered any of his Servants to come
near him, but sadled and unsadled his own Horse, and had a private door made on
purpose into his House and Chamber.

In the year following, he with Dr. Cracanthorp, attended the Queens
Ambassador, the Lord Ewre, into Germany and Denmark, being desirous to improve
himself by seeing foreign Kingdoms, Churches, and Universities. In this Voyage
he improved his time so well, partly in furnishing his Library with Books at
Frankfort and elsewhere, but chiefly in his conversation with Particularly
Father Mulhufinus, who gave him a book of his own with this Inscription,
Prodomino Mortono Nich. Serarius Rector of the College at Men^z, wh^
mentions him civilly in a book he writ against Joseph Scaliger Becanus, the
two last desiring his prayers at parting, ex animo, though their Church thought
him an heretic, though Becanus galled by Arguments, slighted his Devotions.
Learned men, and his foreign Observations, that he always highly valued that
opportunity. At his return he was solicited by Roger Earl of Rutland to be his
Domestical Chaplain; which proffer he was more willing to accept for the
privacy he hoped to enjoy in a place where he was not known, for making use of
the Treasure of Books he had got in his Travels, and rather, because he was
brought so much nearer London than before, whither he must have many occasions
to go, for the putting forth of such Books as he had a design to write. For it
was not long after that he printed his first part of Apologia Catholica. About
which time the Archbishop of York, Toby Matthews (that most exquisite
Preacher) conferred upon him a Prebend in that Metropolitical Church.

Anno. 1606. He took the Degree of Doctor in Divinity, with the great
approbation of both Professors in Divinity, Dr. John Overall that profound
Scholar, and Dr. Thomas Playford that acute Disputant and acurate Preacher, who
were both of them very competent Judges of men's abilities. And about the same
time he was sworn Chaplain in Ordinary to King James, and by him made Dean of
Gloucester, and assumed by the Lord President of Wales for one of his Majesty's
Council for the Marches. In his first journey to Gloucester, he went by Oxford
at the Act-time, where he was incorporated and admitted to the same Degree that
he had in Cambridge, where also he was much taken with the exercises of Mr.
Daniel Featly then a proceeder, and carried great Friendship to him ever after.
At which time he fell into acquaintance with that famous Dr. John As he did
with Dr. Reynolds of Christ-Church College, and Dr. Airey of Queens.
King then Dean of Christ-Church, afterward Bishop of London, which afterward
grew so intimate, that the Bishop made choice of him to perform the last
offices to him both at his Death and Burial.

Anno. 1609. He succeeded Dr. George Abbot in the Deanery Where he g^ew
intimately ac^uainted with Doctor Lake, then Master of St. Crosses, Dr. Hanmer
Warden of Winchester, and Sibrandus Lubbertus Professor at Franeker in
West-Friezland, who dedicated to him his (...) against the 99. E^rors of

Convocation upon Matthew. 5. 13. Vos estis sat terra, with general applause, and
should have been Prolocutor, but in modesty declined it, and preferring a
Friend of his to it. In his abode at London he took his Lodging at Dean
Overals, who gave him the opportunity of a very early acquaintance with the
Learned Isaac Casaubon, then newly come out of France, and entertained by the
Dean. The love thus begun was never intermitted in their lives, nor obliterated
by death, as appears by Casaubons The Inscription written by Dr. Tho. Goad
Rector of Hadley in Suffolk.

time he had acquaintance with several eminen^ foraign Scholars and Divines; as

Diodati, Du Moulin, whose worth is very well known by their Learned works in
Print.

While he continued in Winchester, a certain great Person passionately told the
King, that Dr. Morton had spoiled one of the best Deaneries in England. It
concerned the Dean to vindicate his go^^ name from that foul and unjust
aspersion; And therefore acquainted his Brethren of the Chapter with it, they
were very forward to give a Testimonial under their Hands and Seals, That he
had been one of the best Deans that ever had been at Winchester in their times,
and some of them were very ancient.

Anno. 1616. July 7. He was So really did ^e nolle Episcopari^ That though
el^^ed 1615. he was not Consecrated till 1616. at Lambeth, very solemnly by
reason of the Marquess of Huntleyes Absolution performed there at the same time
before three Archbishops, twelve Bishops English and Scots, thirty Noblemen,
eighty Gentlemen of great Quality; Prince Radzivills Son, and another Nobleman
of Poland receiving the Sacrament of the Lords Supper at the same time.
Consecrated Bishop of Ch^ster: while necessaries were prepared for his journey
thither, he retired himself to Clay Hall in Essex, upon the earnest invitation
of his Noble Friend Sir Christopher Hatton, and there fell sick of a dangerous
Fever, but being happily recovered, presently put himself upon his journey
toward his great Work, and was met on the borders of his Diocese, and brought
into the City of Chester by such a great number of Knights, and other the best
Gentlemen of the Country, besides the Clergy, as may give a lasting testimony
to their honor, as well as his, in showing such a Religious respect to their
Bishop.

When he was settled (in his Bishopric and Rectory of Stopford, which he had to
keep Hospitality in that Hospitable County) he found all the inconveniences
which he foresaw, and some also which he could not foresee at so great a
distance; for beside the great number of Romish Recusants, which has always
been observed in this Diocese, he found another sort of Recusants (better
known by the name of Non-Conformists) who though they were not so many in
number as the other, yet had so much perverseness and obstinacy with them, as
made them equal, or rather superior in relation to the trouble he had with
them. To reduce these Vs^ng a fatherly mildness, together with strength of
argument, as appears by the Conference he had with the Non-conformists, since
Published and called, The Defense of three Innocent Ceremonies.
Recusants to their obedience to the Church, God blessed him with great
success, to the great As appears by the gracious testimony given him in his
Majesty's Declaratioon 1618. in these words, There is now no little amendment
in those Counties (meaning Cheshire and Lancashire) which is no small content
to us. The Declaration I mean, is that about Sports on the Lord's Day, which he
made some opposition to a while, and when he was overruled, he drew upon K.
James his ^rd^r and with Bishop Andrews his advice, the six limitation, to the
Liberty granted in that Declaration, which was the best way to bring the people
of that Country to Conformity.
content of his Majesty.

Anno 1618. March 6. At the motion of that great Pattern of Episcopal
perfection, Dr. Andrews, then Bishop of Eli (who was never known to do the like
for any other, and yet did this without his seeking or knowledge, that he might
have him his nearer Neighbor, as he said, of the same Province with himself,)
he was translated to the Sea of Coventry and Litchfield, (void by the
Translation of his old friend) Bishop Overal to Norwich. And here his trouble
was not so great as at Chester, though his Diocese was larger; because the
common sort of people were better principled by the care and vigilance of his
Predecessor. But yet he abated nothing of his former pains and industry, both
in Writing, Preaching, and Particularly with Spalato his friend, whom he
diswaded by Writing and Conference from his return to Rome, telling him the
entertainment he found there. Leich, tibi in animo convertere Papam. Spal. an
Diabolus est qui non possit converti Lich. nec tu Deus qui convertas nostri
concilium tridentinum Spal. novi nec credunt.
Conferring with them that were not wilfully obstinate in his Diocese, besides
Visitations and exact Confirmations.

Among the works of Charity performed by this Bishop while he was at that See,
memorable is the Education he bestowed upon one George Canner, (who like
another Didimus of Alexandria, or Fisher of Westminster, was born blind^) This
youth he brought up first at School, and afterward sent him to Cambridge,
where he maintained him, and his Uncle, to look to him at St. John's College.
After he had the Degree of Bachelor of Arts, he sent for him to his own Family,
and instructed him in the whole body of Divinity, and then admitted him into
Sacred Orders, placed him in a Cure in Staffordshire, which Cure the blind man
discharged diligently and laudably, being a very good Preacher, and being able
also to perform the whole office of the Church as it is appointed in the Book
of Common Prayer, only by the strength of his admirable Memory.

Anno Before this time he discovered a Boy of Bilson suborned to act the
Daemoniack by those that would have had the honor to dispossess him, with much
pains, wisdom, and patience, to the saving of a Woman's life, that the Boy
accused for bewitching him, for whose sake he prevailed with the Judges at one
Assize to have the oversight of the Boy at his House Eccleshall Castle till
the next.
1632. He was translated to the Sea of Duresm (void by the death of Bishop
Howson) a place of great Trust and Honor, as well as of greater Emolument. For,
besides the Spiritual and Ecclesiastical Affairs (as before) he had now the
care and management of all the Temporal Affairs within the County Palatine of
Duresm, by virtue of the Palatinate annexed for many hundred years to the
Episcopal See, in so much that it passed a Maxim there: Having power to dispose
of all Judges, Registers, Clerks, to make Sheriffs, Escheters, ^cudarics,
Coro^ers, Justices of Peace, Deputy Lieutenants, Colonels, etc.
Quicquid potest Rex extra Episcopatum, potest Episcopus intra. And in the same
he carried himself with so much Justice and Equity for ten years together,
before these late Troubles put a disturbance in the exercise of his Government,
that no complaint was made against him to the Parliament, except only the case
of Mr. (...) sued him for sa^e Imprisonment ungratefully, and to no purpose,
who was known moderate in his whole Government. 1. In his Fines, leaving it to
four Gentlemen of the Neighborhood, to make a moderate composition between him
and the Tenant. 2. In Wrecks, Deodands, and Wardships, so tender, that he took
only such an inconsiderable sum as preserved the Right of his Successors,
rather than increased his Revenue.
Smart, which yet had no relation to the County Pala^ine, neither could the
Charge be made good against him, who was but one of the High Commission. How
great his fatherly care was for the Spiritual care of the Bishopric, will
appear by his pious endeavors in settling Augmentations upon the smaller
Benefices; he had given a good example long before, while he was Bishop of
Lichfield, in abating a good part of his Fine to increase the portion of the
Vicar of Pichley in Northamptonshire, as you may see in Mr. Stephens his
Preface to Sir Henry Spelmans Book: and now in a Work of so much importance, he
applied himself for Counsel to three of the most Learned in the Laws, Lord
Keeper Coventry, Mr. Noy, Sir Henry Martin, who all concurred, that the Bishops
Authority over Churches appropriate, was neither taken away, nor any way
infringed, but that he may now appoint a competent Augmentation: having thus
fully informed h^mself of his just power in a matter of so high Concernment,
for the advancement of Christian Religion, and the good of Souls, he resolved
to put it in practice as far as God should enable him, and trust God with the
event.

He began at home with the Parish of Bishop-Aukland. Here he augmented the
stipend of the Mother Church, from 16 l. per annum, to fourscore; and the
Chapels belonging, from six pounds per annum, to thirty; intending to extend
the like Episcopal care in some proportion over all the rest of his Diocese:
but so Pious, Heroical a Work, became Abortive by the Scotch Invasion, etc.

We are now come to the precipice of this Reverend Bishops outward splendour,
though neither his glory nor happiness incurred the least diminution by his
future sufferings. For he was never more happy in his own thoughts, nor more
glorious in the eyes of all good men, then in being exercised in those
troubles, whereof the continual series of public Affairs afforded him a
perpetual opportunity from this time, till his death.

In one of the Tumults after the beginning of the Long-Parliament, this
Reverend Bishop was in hazard of his life by the multitude that were beckened
thither by the Contrivers of our late Miseries; whereof some cried, Pull him
out of his Coach others; nay, he is a good man; others, but for all that, he is
a Bishop. And he has often said, he believed he should not have escaped alive,
if a Leading-man among the Rabble had not cried out, Let him go and hang
himself.

the Members of Parliament, when the twelve ^ishops (whereof this was one)

of Coventry and Leichfield, at the Usher of the Black-rods house, when the
other ten went to the Tower. Our Bishop being after four months) discharged
from this his first Imprisonment, returned to his Lodgings in Duresm-house, and
there attended his Devotions and Studies, till such time as his adversaries
thought fit to give him another occasion to exercise his patience under a
second Captivity, upon occasion of This was the pretended occasion, but the
more real was his refusing to give up to the House of Commons, the Seat of the
B^sh^prick of Durham, appealing in that Case to the Lords-house. 1. Because it
was his own Seat, and not the Bishoprics. 2. Because of the several Patents
and Estates that depended upon it. 3. And because of the person that entrusted

Reverend Prelate, in a Book called, The Nature of Catholic Faith and Heresy;
that in a Speech against a Book brought in against the succession of Protestant
Bishops by some Presbyterian Lords, he should say, The Protestant Bishops were
Consecrated at the Naggs-head in Cheap Side: The untruth of which story, both
of the Book and of the Speech, is not only by a Protestation, under the Hand of
the Bishop before a public Notary, in the ninty fifth year of his age, July
17. 1657. declared against, ^ut under the hands of seven, that is all the
Bishops, and fifteen of the Temporal Lords then Sitting in the Parliamen, 1640.

Duresm-house till he was thrown out chence by the Soldiers that came to
Garrison it, a little before that horrid Fact was committed upon the Person of
our late Gracious King; and after that, being importuned by his honorable
friend, the Earl, and Countess of Rutland, he became part of their care and
family at Exceter-house for some short time; but being loath to live at the
charge of others, while he was able to subsist of himself, and thinking the air
of the Country might better suit with his declining years, he betook himself to
sojourn, first with Captain Saunders in Hartfordshire, and after with Mr.
Thomas Rotheram in Bedfordshire, till by the great civility, and earnest
importunity of that noble young Baronet, Sir Henry Yelverton, he went with him
to his house at East-Manduit in Northamptonshire, where he found all the tender
respect and care from the whole family, which a Father could expect from his
Children, till after a few months he rendered up his happy soul, into the hands
of his heavenly Father.

When the House of Commons had Voted for the Dissolving of Bishoprics, some
prevailed for a Vote of Yearly Allowance to present Bishops during their lives.
Our Bishop had 800 l. a greater sun^ than any other, per annum, Voted to him;
but while he was able to subsist without it, he never troubled himself in
seeking after it: but being pressed by necessities, having procured a Copy of
the Vote, found it to contain that such a sum should be paid, but no mention,
either by whom or whence. And by that time that he could procure the
Explanation of the Orders, not to make the Pension payable out of the Revenues
of his own Bishopric, all the Lands and Revenues of it were sold, or divided
among themselves; only by the importunity of his friends, he obtained an Order
to have 1000 l. out of their Treasury at Coldsmith-hall, with the which he paid
his debts, and purchased to himself an An^uity of Of the (...) Savile in the
m^n^rity of her Son Sir George, who when he came to years, confirmed and paid
it punctually at the tim^ and place appointed, offering the payment of the
quarter current at his death, if there had not been enough left to defray the
charge of his burial.
200 l. per annum, during his life, upon which he subs^^ed ever since.

No considerable Legacies could be expected in the Will of a person deceased,
who made his own hands his Executors while he lived; like his great Kinsman
Archbishop Morton in Antiq. (...) who chose rather to enrich his Kindred in his
life time, than at his death. Our Bishop had so much left him at his death,
that he gave 40 l. to one of his servants who then attended him (having
provided formerly for others) he left 10 l. to the poor of the Parish, and his
Chalice, with a Patin double gilt, to the Noble Baronet, in whose Family he
died, for the use of his Chapel; the rest (deducting some small remembrances)
he ordered for his burial, which was also sufficient for a Monument, though
far below his worth, yet suitable to his great modesty.

The chief Legacy of his Will must not be omitted, the testimony he gave, by a
kind of Encyclical Epistle to the Catholic Faith he died in, for the common
good of souls in the Church of England, particularly in his own Diocese, it may
be seen in the Funeral Sermon, where he concludes thus; My earnest exhortation
to them is, that they would still continue their former love (notwithstanding
all temptations to the contrary) both to Ow^ing the 3. ancient Creeds, the 4.
(...) general Councils, with the Scripture, within (...) a (...) general
Council.
the Doctrine, Episcopacy he believed was instituted by the Apostles, and
approved by Christ in the Revelations, as he did the succession of the English
Bishops; wishing the differences between us and Rome ^wled, by the practice the
first 500. years of Christianity: Priority of Order being all that the Fathers
allowed the Bishop of Rome.

He thought there might be Ordinations without Bishops where they might not be
had, not where they might. He said that wherever there is a Church, there
must of necessity be a Form of Worship, and ours w^^ he thought the best for
decency, and for Edification and Devotion: This was annexed in a Codicil to his
Will, April, 15. 1658.


Discipline, and Government, and Form of Worship, in this poor afflicted
Church; which, if I did not believe to be the securest way for the salvation of
sou^s, I had not ventured my own upon the same bottom.

His high esteem of the Sacred Liturgy of the Church of England attended him,
he ordering it, which he called the best Funeral Sermon, at his Burial (as I
may say) to his Grave. Great Fervor and Devotion he showed in the
Church-prayers; yea, so great, that he seldom answered with a single Amen. At
Prayers he never kneeled upon a Cushion, and always prayed upon his Knees, till
he was confined to his Deathbed, and even would never lie with his Cap on his
Head, if either he prayed himself, or others prayed by him, while he had
strength to pull it off with his own hands. Great Consolation he took in the
Church-preparations for his Long Home, viz. in profession of his Faith, and
Charity, and Repentance, in receiving the benefit of Absolution, and the
Viatioum of the holy Eucharist.

His rule for diet was, that we should observe none at all. He lived a great
number of years, and very few husbanded their time better, for he was never
idle with his good will. He was often at his Devotion and Study before four of
the clock, even after he had lived above fourscore years; and yet very seldom
went to Bed till after ten; and then had always a Servant to read some book to
him, till such time as sleep did surprise him.

And so had he always, when he traveled in his Coach, that his Journey might
not be too great a hindrance to his Study. He used to lie on a Straw-bed, till
he was above fourscore, and the Cramp hindered him.

He led his life in a holy and chaste Celibate, dying of an Hernia or Rupture.

To add somewhat of his Character.

1. His Patience. In the greatest trial of his temper that he had; the News of
the Vote, That the Revenues of the Church were to be sold, he only said: The
Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; Blessed be the Name of the Lord; which
he repeated three times over to the Company that he was in, and presently
retired himself to his prayers.

2. His Hospitality. He entertained the King and his Court, and (at least) the
chief Officers of his Army all at one time in the first Expedition toward
Scotland, which (in that place of great cheapness) cost him 1500 l. in one day.
There seldom came any Scholar to him, Foreign or English, whom he did not
liberally entertain and dismiss with a considerable sum of money.

3. His Beneficence. He built a Free School at Bishops-Aukland, and endowed it
with 24 l. per annum, which is more than he ever Where of one Lo of a good
memory was one, against whose Nonconformity be writ a large L^tter to the
College.
purchased to himself, for that was just nothing; besides that, he maintained
several at his own charge in the College. He gave many excellent Books to the
College where he had his Education, to the value of 4. or 500 l. with an
intention at last to bestow 100 l. per annum, during his life (had not the
times disabled him) to buy Books of special worth, and not for superf^uity.

4. His Almsgiving. While he was suffered to enjoy his Estate, he had his
Badg-men and Livery at a constant Table, besides what he gave at his Gate, and
upon other occasions; nay, so constant was he in this duty, even when he had so
much left, as to afford Bread for his own Mouth, that he had always a certain
number of poor impotent persons in a constant Pension, that came Weekly to him
for their Allowance, when he was not able to go himself among them to give it;
and this will be abundantly testified by the poor in all places where of late
he has lived.

5. His Devotion. He would often forgo, or at least much moderate his one Meal
a day, often deny himself some part of that small pittance allowed for sleep,
to rise of his Bed, and to spend in Prayer, as the Attendance in his Chamber
witness.

6. His Prudence, in the moderation of his Passions, wherein all moral virtues
are knit together, by which he was a pattern to his people of good works, and
an unblameable life, Tit. 2. 7.

7. His Mind above the World, and its filthy lucre.

8. His Vote in Parliament, etc. according to Conscience, and not either
Interest or Humor.

9. His Great Moderation in the Quin quar ticular Controversy, about which he
would declare nothing.

13. His grave and sober Speech, his sweet and grave Countenance, his decent
Habit, his upright and sprightful Motion, a vigorous Youth in old age.

11. His Temperance, using Wine only at Meals, unless it were for his stomach
sake, and his often infirmities.

12. The Excellent Government of his Family, into which several Persons of
Quality, as the Sons of the Earl of Lindsey, the Lord Fairfax (whose Son Sir
Charles was his Gentleman Usher) desired to be admitted for Education.

13. His Industry, so great, as if his labors were (as it is said of his
Kinsman, Archbishop Morton) his Recreation; and his Motto Severus his (who
died at York, where this Bishop was born,) Laboremus; or Julius Maximinus, Quo
major eo laboriosior.

14. His Acquaintance, the most grave and learned men of our own and foreign
Churches, Spanhemius, Rivet, Willius, etc.

15. His Retainers and Chaplains, the most Eminent men in either University,
and Bishop Brownrig was one of them, made by him Archdeacon of Coventry, and
Prebendary of Durham; the last of which preferments he held in Commendam, with
his Bishopric, till he died.

16. His aptness to teach by every thing he did, like Socrates, whom he
resembled in another particular, in that he usually confuted his Adversaries
always out of something they granted.

17. His Converts, Bishop Crofts of Hereford, the Lady Cholmeley, Dr.
Swinborne, Mr. Theoph. Higgens, and twelve eminent Papists more.

18. His Small Stature, actuated by a great spirit.

19. His affable virtues and parts.

20. His extraordinary, though secret mortification; all which virtues, and
performances rendered him a Saint in his life, a Doctor in his works, a
Confessor in his sufferings, and a Martyr in his charity, in visiting persons
Sick of the Plague; who being buried in Saint Peter's E^ston-mauduit, has this
Monument.

THE Life and Death OF Dr. THOMAS COMBER, Dean of Carlisle.
DOctor Thomas Comber, Son of Comber Clarenciaux King of Arms, was born at
Shermanbury in Sussex, on New-years-day, and Baptized on the day of Epiphany,
1575. the twelfth Child of his Father, as Bellarmine, Baronius, Scultetus, and
many eminent men were, who were the vigorous offspring of their decayed
Parents.

His first Education was at Horsham in the same County, under a (...) rather a
(...) who studying his meek, but active temper, as much as he did his Books;
rather mildly led, than severely drive him; to whom a frown was as bad as
correction, and a correction as bad as death, whose great industry, and happy
memory taking in all the learning instilled into him, and retaining all he had
taken in (twice reading sufficing him to gain any piece of an Author, at eight
years of age) furnished him with so much skill in Greek and Latin Poetry,
History, and Oratory, as with Mr. Titchburns his exemplary Tutors improvement
of him in Hebrew, Syriack, Arabic, besides Logic, Ethics, and a smattering
in the Mathematics, recommended him, after three years continuance in Trinity
College Cambridge, where he was admitted to Dr. Nevill, then intent upon
planting a good Nursery in that College (knowing that learning propagates by
example, and one good Scholar begets another, as one lights his Candle at the
Candle of his Neighbor) to be Scholar and Fellow of the Royal Foundation.

Where his proficiency was the effect 1. Of St. Bernards method, which was
written upon many of his Books; ut Legeret Intelligendi, fecit cupidites, ut
Intelligeret oration Impetravit; ut Impetraret quid (nisi vitae sanct it as
promeruit; sic cupiat, sic orat, sic and vivat, qui se proficere desiderat. 2.
The industry he commended to others in these Instructions, (...) shun Idleness
as the common, sewer that takes in all temptation: employ your selves well, or
you will be employed ill. 3. And the good example of other Students, and he
would use often that of Seneca, and magnum est quod a sapiente vi^o vel tacente
proficias; and the accomplished man now dexterous in Hebrew, Arabic, Coptick,
Samaritane, Syriack, Chaldee, Persian, Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, and
Italian, and well versed in the Greek and Latin Fathers, Schoolmen, Councels,
and Modern Writers. (Great Abilities very much sweetened by his great Modesty
and Humility) appeared first an exellent Tutor, bringing up his Pupils rather
as Friends and Companions, than Scholars; stealing his vast Learning to them by
Discourse and Converse, rather than inculcating it by Set-Lectures; and
training them up to virtue and knowledge, by his example more effectually, than
others did by Precepts, giving this reason for it afterward to other Tutors,
That young men admitted to the Company of those that were their Seniors, would
be decoyed into excellency, being ashamed to speak or do any thing below the
Company they kept.

And then a melting Preacher, preaching as much by his silent and grave
Gesture, composed to a smiling sweetness, as by his learned and honest Sermons;
(...). After that, having filled his own Country with his hopes and name, he
traveled three years secured from the Vices of foraign Nations, by his chaste
gravity, and sage prudence; and very capable of their virtues by exact
Observations, and good Company, being all the while he was in France at the
house of the Judicious, Learned, and Religious Mounsieur Moulin, the Buckler of
the Protestant profession. Frequent Disputes (at which he was so much of
Chrysippus his faculty, [in disputando pressus, concisus and subactus] that he
was employed at the command of our late famous King, to Dispute at St. Andrews
in Scotland in public with the Divines there, who admired him much for his
solid quickness and various Learning:) Holy Conference, the fruit whereof was
the conversion of several Jews (the good effect of Oriental Learning) and
particularly, one Bardesius by name, whom he convinced that it was impossible
to maintain the truth of the Old Testament, but by allowing the New and
friendly Communications; an instance whereof we have in the honorable mention
the Learned Morinus (in animad. in censuram exercit. eccles. in Pentat.
Samarit. p. 419.) makes of this worthy Doctor, haec verba Alius praeterea Codex
(Samaritanus) celebratur, and dicitur esse Archiepiscopi Armachani, and ab eo e
Palestina in Hiberniam exportatus, qui Leidensibus Academicis nonnullo tempore
fuit commodatus. Istum Codicem vir Clarissimus Thomas Comberus Anglus quem
honoris and officii reddendi causa nomino, cum textu Iudaico verbum e verbo imo
literam cum litera maxima diligentia et indefesso Labor comparavit,
differentiasque omnes juxta capitum and versuum ordinem digestas ad me misii
humanissime and officiocissime.

Being exquisitely accomplished by these methods, he was preferred by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Chaplain to his Majesty; and by his Majesty Master of
the College whereof he had been so worthy a Fellow; where he, wrapped up in
his studies, took only these cares upon himself. 1. That a good understanding
should be kept among the Fellows, preventing by his lenity and moderation,
justice and prudence, all Divisions; and suppressing by his A^^rity, all
Parties and Factions. 2. That Elections should be sincere respecting worth in
the meanest person, and not gratifying un^ worthiness in the richest; usually
answering powerful intercessor and importunate friends thus. Sirs, persuade
your Gardener upon your importunity to plant a withered and hopeless Herb or
Tree, if I should commit an error in the first Election, the error will
continue in the whole Foundation. I had rather maintain ^ Child of weak parts
anywhere else, than admit him to Trinity; the example will do much more harm to
the College, than the Preferment can do to the Child. 3. That young men's
studies should be methodical and useful, examining privately their
Proficiencies, and looking publicly to their Exercises, taking care to dispose
of them all, according to their respective capacities.

Anno 1631/2. He was Vice Chancellor of the University, where he was very
strict in observing the Statutes, very watchful over the public performances;
the jocose, that they should not be too loose or abusive; the serious, that
they should not be too perfunctory, and the Religious (whether Sermons,
Prayers, or Disputations) that they should not be (what they were but too apt
to be) too Factious; witness the dangerous Position of Mr. Bernard Lecturer of
St. Sepulchers at St. Mary's, which he speedily reported to Archbishop Laud,
and vigorously prosecuted in the High Commission: The Articles were these (for
otherwise he often absented himself from the Consistory when they made a man an
offender for a word.) 1. That Gods Ordinances blended with the Innovations of
men, cease to be Gods Ordinances. 2. That it is impossible to be saved in the
Church of Rome, without repentance for being of it. 3. That reason is not
limited to the Royal blood; and that he is a Traitor against a Nation, that
depriveth it of its Ordinances, etc. 4. That those who shamefully symbolize
with the Church of Rome, as some among us do in Pelagian Errors, and
Superstitious Ceremonies, are to be prayed either to their Conversion, or to
their Confusion.

But a while after these and other Principles which he thought fit to punish,
others thought fit to practice, whereupon having in vain strived against the
stream of a popular inundation, now overflowing its banks by Letters to his
friends, by public Petitions, and by supplies to his Majesty, (the honorable
Sir Charles Wheeler then Fellow of his house, managing the design for carrying
the Plate of the University to the King at York, conceiving it unfitting that
they should have superfluities to spare, while his Majesty wanted necessaries
to spend) and not knowing indeed in those times when the Countess of Rivers
house at Long-Melford, was plundered to the value of 20000 l. where to deposite
their Plate better than in his Majesty's hand, Heir to his Ancestors the
Founders Paramount of all houses, this worthy Doctor was the better fitted to
suffer comfortably, because he had acted in all his capacities (as Master of
the College, Dean of Carlisle, and Rector of Worpesden in Surrey) so
conscientiously, as he did, when for With him suffered the Reverend and
stupendiously learned Mr. Thorndike, Dr. Crawley of Agmionsham, Dr. Cowley, Dr.
Salman, Dr. Sherman, the two last bred at the Charte^-house, the last Author of
the sober book called, White Salt, and of the Potes Infallibility; a very
learned sober, and charitable man in the worst times, and because he had 80 l.
of his own, would not accept of his Fellowship in the best times^ eminent for
gathering Con^is butions to Bishop Waltons Bible, and other ^oyal and Wor^by
designs.
refusing the Covenant, and contributing to the Rebellion, he was imprisoned,
plundered, and deprived of all his Preferments. 1642. Possessing his meek and
calm soul in patience, humility, and faith, (which were a part of his Grace
before and after his Meals) ((...)) submitting to Providence, and kissing the
Rod, without any other reflection on the instruments of his sufferings, than God
forgive them; weeping indeed sometimes, [(...)] so melting is the good man's
disposition for the horror of the sins they went on in, but taking the spoiling
of his goods joyfully. Oh his frequent Ejaculations in English, Greek, and
Latin! his clear Prospect into the late Revolutions and Restaurations! his
extraordinary Comforts in the worst time, his constant Almes-giving and
Charity, his Fast and Letanies! the tenderness of his heart melting at several
passages of Scripture his dear Consort read to him! often saying, Happy are
they that believe, and not see! oh his constancy to friends, and love even to
enemies, preferring many of his Predecessors Servants merely because of the
pick between them two, being kind to them, only because their Master was unkind
to him. The calmness of his spirit under the rack of his torment, answering
those that asked him how he did constantly, Very well, I thank God; so great
the peace of a good man, that melted his own will into the will of God; O with
what flaming Devotion, and holy Reverence, he received his Viaticum, the Seal
of his Pardon, that (...), the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, a little before
his death, when in a cold frosty morning he took off all his Caps, and sat
upon his Bed bare-headed in honor of the Lord Jesus there Crucified before him;
immediately after crying Nunc Dimittis, and desiring to be dissolved, and to be
with Christ; only he sent, just as he was a dying, to his dear Consorts ancient
Parents, and an aged friend in the Town, to prepare for death, telling them and
his loving Wife, that he should be loath to be happy without them; suggesting
to her likewise, that when she saw him close his eyes, she should not be
troubled, but conceive that he was fallen asleep. He was buried, I think, in
Trinity College Chapel, March 29. 1653. the Revered Dr. Boreman Rector of St.
Giles in the Fields, Preaching his Funeral Sermon, to whom I owe this faithful
account of this blessed man, as I do the following Epitaph to the Reverend Dr.
Duport, Dean of Peterburgh.

THE Life and Death OF Dr. SAMUEL COLLINS, Regius Professor of Divinity at
Cambridge.
WHen I observe one Star exactly in the Firmament, others at first sight not so
discernable, offer themselves to my observation; taking the character of the
foregoing eminent ^ight in the University of Cambridge; others that shined
equally with him in the same Orb, and suffered as eminent an Eclips, appeared;
as 1. Dr. Samuel Collins (Son of Mr. Baldwin Collins, called for his piety,
pains, and bountiful Almes-giving, by Queen Elizabeth, Father Collins) was
born, August 5. (a day observable to him in many passages of his life) 1570. at
Eaton, where he was bred; and whence, after nine years study under a severe
Schoolmaster (whom yet sensible, how seasonably that severity fixed his too
nimble nature, thanked that Schoolmaster as publicly, as his predecessor Dr.
Whitacre, who when his Tutor took his Doctors Degree under him, thanked him
publicly, for giving him frequent Correction) with an admirable proficiency,
by reason (as he would say himself) of emulation and ambition, that provoked
him to learn; by the example of some leading Boys, that his Master kept in each
Form to draw on the rest; and to use his own word, to Co-extend their souls; by
a natural Memory improved by Art, taught him by his Father, and by his great
fancy, which helped him to a deep notion, and lively similitude of things, and
so to a more retentive memory of them.

A natural eloquence and facetiousness, symbolizing with, and so more tenacious
of any Elegancy he ever met with, in any Poet or Orator; especially, in his
beloved Ovid and Pindar, ^ully or Isocrates, and the modern Ciceronians, as
Longolius, Bembus, Politian, etc Some pieces of whom he read yearly to his
dying day, giving this reason for it to the young men, whom he advised to do
the like, Iisdem nutrimur, ex quibus constamus, those Authors enlarge and
quicken our parts, that first molded and formed them; and a decaying soul like
a decaying body, should go to its native air, and congenial author, to recover
its self. He was chosen Fellow by Dr. Roger Goad, who upon his smart
Translation of a piece in Hor^ce, at the Election (and by the way, he would
say, he improved himself much by translating himself, taking notice how others
translated one Language into another, and observing the Idiotisms and proper
Elegancies of each Author and Language) clapping his Hand on his Head, and
against six eminent Competitors, saying, This is my Child, that if he lives
(wise men dwell next door to Prophets) shall be my Heir and Successor; As he
was 1615. being chosen Provost, and 1621. Regius Professor of Divinity, having
deserved well of the Church, both by his excellent discourse against the
Papists, and his accurate Sermon 1608. at St. Paul's about the Non-conformists,
upon 1 Timothy 6. 3, 4, 5. Of the former of whom he converted seven, and of the
latter sixteen, by reason of his admirable wit and memory, which he would say,
Was a man's learning (for quantum memini, tantum scio) he was the most ^luent
Latinist of our age; Disputants encountering the torrent of his eloquence, with
no better success, than Caligula's Soldiers did, upon his Command with the
Tide; as clear, as fluent, not desiring to be thought deep, because muddy and
dark: Not at all affected with the endless disputes of our Times, which any
Sciolist may move, but the best Scholars cannot end, about Predestination, and
the other busy Articles, determining one day on the one side in those points,
and the next day on the other, as the Disputants put up their Positions;
telling his amazed Auditors, that both sides in those intricate Disputes,
however, aggravated by zeal and ignorance, were, if rightly understood,
agreeable with the Analogy of Faith. He would neither multiply needless
Controversies, nor compound necessary ones, being resolute and stable in
Fundamentals, those his fixed Poles and Axeltree about which he moved, while
they stood immovaeble; not tossed to and fro, with pro and con, upon the sea of
Controversies, as some others, so long, as the very ground seemed to move to
him, and his judgment grow skeptical and unstable, in the most settled points
of Divinity, though he brought some controversies near together, as those
mountains in Wales, whose hanging tops come so close together, that Shepherds
on the tops of several Hills may audibly talk together.

Being no curious searcher of nice Questions, no cunning Sector, (as Antonius
Pius, who had that name for his desire to Study, and examine the least
differences) remembering very well that Captain Martin Forbisher fetched from
the farthest Northern Countries a ships lading of Mineral Stones (as he
thought) which afterward were cast out to mend the Highways.

He defeated as well as escaped the arguments brought against him, not only
putting by the thrust but breaking the weapon; knowing well otherwise, that
though he might shut the Opponents mouth, he might open the difficulty the
wider in the hearts of the hearers; but he either fairly resolved the doubt, or
showed the falseness of the argument, by beggering the Opponent to maintain
such a fruitful generation of absurdities, as his argument had begotten; or
lastly, retorts it back upon him again. The first way unties the knot, the
second cuts it asunder, and the third whips the Opponent with the knot himself
tied. He always commended a clear Answerer above a cunning Opposer, because the
latter takes advantage of man's ignorance, which is ten times more than his
knowledge.

He knew that all arguments for errors were resolved into a fallacy, and
therefore he used every time to urge a new fallacy, that the young Divines
might be used to answer them; so dissembling himself, truths foe to be her
better friend, with Joseph, having sufficiently sifted the matter in a
disguize, he discovered himself; I am Joseph your Brother.

As his Latin was pure and elegant, making a smooth way over the Alps of
Philosophy, and School Divinity (using only such Threadbare School-terms, as
were Standers, fixed to the Controversy, to take off the covert fallacy might
have under the Nap of flourishing Language) so was his English plain when he
came to Preach, especially to a plain Auditory, with the Paraclesians
extracting Oil out of the driest and hardest bodies; knotty Timber being unfit
to build with, he edified his people with profitable and plain matter. His
three Spurs to virtue, were Satyr, Sarcasm, or Irony, and Panegyric; by the
two first shaming the ill-inclined, and by the last encouraging the
well-disposed: It was observed of him, that as his Tickets, giving notice of
his Reading on the School-doors, for forty years were never two together alike,
without some considerable difference in the Critical Language thereof; so his
Reparties were never upon two men the same, nor twice alike upon one man. He
escaped being Bishop of Bristol, which some Courtier, who would prefer him
downward, procured him out of spite, by his Friends: He With him were turned
out Doctor Charles Mason, the excellent Doctor Jo^ Pe^^^on, Ma^g, Prof. of
Divinity in Camb. Mr. of Trin. Coll. and Archdeacon of Surrey.
kept his Chair, when turned out of his other preferments, out of necessity by
his Foes; who had made the times such, that it was easy to find new Masters,
and new Preachers, but not so new Professors. Entreating them, after he had
complemented them out of a long time, to consider of the Covenant, to take his
Preferments if they would, for he would never take their Covenant; being so
happy in his Panegyric, wherein only he over-did; that he flattered two of the
Committee into Proselites to his persecuted Opinion, right like the Primitive
Martyrs, that smiled their very Persecutors into a Conversion, to undergo that
very Martyrdom for afflicted Christianity, that they were ready to inflict. He
died about 1651. being a Person of small stature, and therefore the more
vigorously actuated by his great soul, whose faculties, like Beams contracted,
are the more active and strong; leaving Esquire Collins, his accomplished Son
(a worthy Member of the present Parliament) Heir to his Eloquence, as he was at
last (after some difficulties occasioned by those Trustees that made an
advantage of the Doctors wary and politic settlement in regard of these times)
of his Estate. Indeed, as much exceeding his Father in English, as his Father
did others in Latin.

THE Life and Death OF Dr. WILLIAM BEAL.
PYramides are measured by their shadows, and this worthy Person is known to me
only by an Inscription, designed by a Mr. G. (...).
Relation of his upon his Gravestone.

Dr. William Beal, bred in Pembroke-hall under Dr. Jerome Beal, and Master of
St. John's in Cambridge, Chaplain to King Charles the First, who said publicly
of him in Saint Iohns-Colledge, after he had asked how he did? That he had a
kindness for him for his Integrity: Adding graciously, that where he once
loved, and took a good opinion, he was seldom moved from it. He wished, as his
Predecessor Whitacre, he had lost Learning, as he had got in after-supper
Studies, on condition, he might gain so much strength, as he had lost thereby:
And with the same Dr. Whitacre found the inconvenience of being imposed upon a
College whereof he was no Member; that he would say, A Society will hardly be
ruled by a Governor, but on the same terms the Welsh would be governed by their
King, that is, if he were born amongst them, and spoke their Language: Besides
that, it is a great discouragement to a Society, for the Members of it not to
be sure in their turns of their own preferments. In his choice of Scholars he
pitched upon Parts without good Manners, rather than good Manners without good
Parts; because Civility might, but Abilities could not be counterfeited: God
only can des^ry a good heart, but Men may discover a good head, and Discipline
might correct the loose (whose very looseness in youth was to him an argument
of their proficiency in their riper years, when wildness would become activity)
into temperance and sobriety, whereas nothing could make the Dunce a Scholar.
There was no Election in the House without his Prefence, no Admission without
his Examination, and no Audit or Progress without his own account; who aimed at
three things.

1. The Decency and Advancement of the College. 2. The Encouragement of
Tenants, and the Improvement of their Woods and Lands. 3. The Inuring of
Scholars to Discipline in their young days, that being accustomed to the yoke
in their youth, they might not start in their elder years.
For being active in gathering the University Plate for his Majesty, he was,
with the excellent Dr. Stern, now Lord Archbishop of York, sent, surrounded in
their respective Colleges, carried to London in triumph, in which persecution
there was this circumstance remarkable: That though there was an express Order
from the Lords, for their Imprisonment in the Tower, which met them at
Tottenham high-Cross (wherein, notwithstanding there was no Crime expressed)
yet they were led Captive through Bartholomew-Fare, and so as far as
Temple Bar, and back through the City into the Tower, on purpose that they
might be hooted at, or stoned; and so for three years together hurried from
Prison to Prison (after they were Plundered and With him were Sequestered that
incomparable Preacher, and sweet-natured man, Dr. Lake of Bishopsgate London,
the worthy and beloved Bishop Morgan of Bangor, the excellent Dr. Bote^er of
the North.
Sequestered, two words that signified an undoing) without any Legal Charge
against them, or Trial of them; it being supposed surely that they would be
famished at Land, and designed that they should be stiffled, when kept ten days
under De^k at Sea, or all failing, to be sent as Galli-slaves to Argiers, till
this worthy person was exchanged, and had liberty to go to Oxford to serve his
Majesty there, as he had done here, by a good Example, constant Fasts and
Prayers, exact Intelligence, convincing and comfortable Sermons, as he did all
the while he lived; till his heart broke to see (what he always feared, and
endeavored in vain to persuade the moderate part of the other side of) his
Majesty murdered, and he died suddenly with these words in his mouth, which
the standers by understood, with reference to the state of the public, as well
as the condition of his own private person. I believe the Resurrection.

Nor am I stirred, that thy Pale Ashes have
Over the dark Climate of a private Grave
No fair Inscription: such distempers flow
From poor Lay-thoughts, whose blindness cannot know,
That to discerning Spirits Graves can be,
But a large Womb to Immortality:
And a fair virtuous Name, can stand alone,
Brass to the Tomb, and Marble to the Stone.
THE Life and Death OF Dr^ RICHARD HOLDSWORTH.
A Divine, (and to confute the common slander fastened upon Ministers Sons) a
Divines Son, Richard Holdsworth, the Son of Richard Holdsworth, born at
Newcastle upon Tyne (where his Father was an eminent Preach^er, and bred there
under Mr. William Pearson (to whom he was committed, the youngest of his dying
Fathers Sons, at seven years of age) an exact Preacher in the same place. He
came very young to St. John's College in Cambridge, with very pregnant hopes,
and went away young with very great accomplishments; (the ornament of that
Society, whereof he was a Member; and the great Vote of it, insomuch, that they
endeavored to choose him Master.) First, to be Chaplain to Sir Henry H^bart,
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, where he was very honorably treated, and
thence to be Minister of St. Peter's in the Poor, London (which he had in
exchange for another Living, whereto an honorable Patron presented him, and
where-from a reverend Prelate (that was loath to loose him in the Country)
dissuaded him, in the West Riding of Yorkshire.) the Scene of his renowned
performances while he was alive, and the Grave of his virgin body, when dead.
There he filled not the Peoples ears with empty noise, but ravished their
Hearts with solid truths; here the Church rung not with the Preachers raving,
but with the Hearers groans; the Walls, Pillars, and Window^ dropping with the
Auditors sweat and tears extorted from them not by a furious thundering, but
by a zealous and hearty Eloquence, which awed Impiety, comforted the Religious,
was the delight of good Men, and a pleasant song even to Hypocrites; being
followed by all sort of people (who delighted in him, not as St John Baptists
Hearers did, (...), for a time) till the Civil Wars, when the times turning,
and he standing still, the People in the late Tumults, like those at Sea,
thought he, who was as immovable as the earth, moved and altered; and they,
whose Heads turned like Folks-heads at Sea, thought themselves the same.

Once he was Preaching to them, upon the Acclamation made to Her^d and the
Consequence of it, in Mer^^rs-Chappel; and they Hummed him so, that they could
not hear him; he cried out to them several times, I pray remember the Text; to
teach them to have no man's person in admiration. Another time they thronged to
hear his Sermon, and he dismissed them with the Prayers and a Homily of the
Church (Reading both in his Surplice) to inform them, that he preferred the
public Offices before his private Abilities; which though more fluent than any
Gifted-man about Town, tied himself to one sober Form of Prayer, and to one
grave Method of Preaching.

The Plague in 1625. when he first came to Broad-street, could not drive him
from his dear Flock; though another Murrain 1640. among the Flock its self (I
mean the late Herefies and Schisms) did.

But one Stage was not equal to so great Abilities, that could fill both the
Chair at Gresham-Colledge, on the one side of Broad-street, in as great
confluence of Scholars and Divines, as he did the Pulpit on the other side with
a great throng of Citizens. His learned labors returning upon him with fresh
applauses each week in both places, a specimen of the last whereof we have in
his learned Lectures, published P^inted by Mr. William Weirs and Mr Scot, at
the Princes. A^^es in Little Britain.
by the reverend, learned, and good-natured Dr. Richard Pearson, lately of St.
Brides London (who having power to Print them from one of the Doctors
Overseers, Bishop Brownrig, as he had, with much ado obtained leave of the
modest Doctor himself (who never Printed any thing, but one single Sermon, and
that not till a third Command from his Majesty (who otherwise was very
conscientiously observant of his least Order) that Pamphlet, called by the
Transcriber, The Valley of Vision; a Valley indeed, not for the fruitfulness,
but for the lowness (especially if compared to the pretended Authors high
parts) but little vision) Printed them with that care, that became an ingenious
man, who reverenced the memory of the Author, who was by Relation his Uncle, in
Affection his Father, in Favors his Patron, in his Academical Studies his
Tutor, and in his Ecclesiastical his Compass.

Entering on his Lectures 1630. with great expectation, and continuing them for
eight years above it, his own College St. John's Voted him Master; (and when
the perverseness of some, and the prevalency of others, defeated the College of
that Vote, the honor whereof his own modesty declined) Emanuel College gained
him at once, the most obliging, and the most resolute Master, that ever was in
that House, old Dr. Chadderton, that had resigned to Preston, and survived two
Masters, saying, That he was the only Master that ever he saw in that House;
and he carrying it so civilly toward the old Doctor, that he did nothing, and
went no whither about College Affairs, without Father Chadderton on his right
hand, telling him, That as long as he lived he should be Master in the House,
though he himself was forced to be Master of the House.

Until opposing the torrent of the late Civil Wars, as Vice chancellor for
three years together, by Preaching Loyal Sermons at St. Mary's, by Licensing
his Majesty's Declarations to the Press, by discountenancing evil Principles,
and propagating good ones, by forwarding Supplies to the King to suppress the
Rebellion, and by denying any to the Faction to maintain it, he was advised to
withdraw himself from that Tumult, which it was in vain to contend with; as he
did, first to the Country, and then to London (the best Hiding Place in the
kingdom) where being concealed a while, God Almighty thinking it not fit, that
so great a virtue should, in a time when there was so much need of it, be hid,
and drawing it out to be as exemplary in its sufferings, as it had been in its
other performances, he fell by accident, as he walked an evening, into their
hands whom he desired to avoid; for being known by a Captain of one of those
Guards that Watched each Street and Corner, he was brought before a
Close-Committee, and Committed by them, first to Ely-house (this profane War
turning Noblemens Palaces into Prisons, as it did afterward Gods Houses into
Stables) and afterward, to increase the charge, as well as the severity of his
Imprisonment, to lessen both his Liberty and Estate, to the Tow^r, which he
called David's Tower for four years together, where Archbishop Laud sent
particularly to this excellent person for his Prayers a little before his
death; and whence, not without a great sum of money, and as great intercession
of friends, on condition not to stir above twenty miles out of the City, to
enjoy only his choice Library, that escaped their fury, and his Parish in the
City, his College in the University, and a good Parsonage bestowed upon him by
the Earl of Rutland, being kept from him, the Title of Margaret Professor (but
the bare Title without the Profits and Emoluments of the Place) to which the
unanimous consent of the University Voted him, in the face of his enemies, in
his absence, and in his affliction.

Neither lasted these Enjoyments long, for not being able to forbear the Men,
(so sacred to him was his Majesty's Cause and Person, when they had the
Impudence to Vote no more Addresses to the King) for a smart Sermon against
them, he is put, as well as his Master, into safe Custody by the Juncto; who
Declared, That either he must be forbid the Pulpit, or they must forbear their
Seats; he being able, they said, to overthrow in an hour, what they had been
carrying on several years. But he continued performing Divine Service, and
Preaching as long as he had liberty, thought-full of men's souls, and his charge
of them; regardless of his own person, and the calamities of that: He was more
afraid of St. Paul's, Woe is me, if I Preach not the Gospel, than of St. Paul's
Chain, or of St. Peter's Bonds. The Life he lost, he found; and the more he
despised Liberty, the more he enjoyed it: Abroad he comes, the King writes for
him, and his other Chaplains, to come to him to Holdenby, and is refused; but
at Hampton Court the reasonable request was granted there, he that would not
accept of the Bishopric of Bristol, because he might with the more advantage,
being no Bishop, desend Episcopacy, accepted of the Deanery of Worcester; a
bare Title without profit, to show he waved not that Bishopric for its little
Revenue (saying (as some said of him) that he would not take a Bristol-stone)
when he took a dignity with none.

At Hampton Court he made bold to ask his Majesty, Whether he thought himself
safe with those men? (meaning Cromwell, etc.) and was answered by his Majesty,
Yeas, if they have any souls? The Monsters of Men having with Hands on their
Breasts, and Eyes lift up to Heaven, pawned their Souls and their Posterity
upon his Restoration.

As he had attended his Majesty at Hampton Court to comfort him, so with
several other Divines he waited on him at the Treaty in the Isle of Wight to
assist and serve him, in offering expedients for moderation, till all moderate
men were hurried to Prisons, and the most innocent Majesty to the Block; whose
Murder affected him so much, that he was never well after, either in body or
mind.

O what Fasts, what Watchings, what Tears, that unheard of Villainy cost the
good man, till a Black Jaundice prevailed over his whole body; and thence an
humor, that could neither be dispelled nor mitigated, settled into a Swelling
about his Throat, which with a slow Ague, arising from the Inflammation of the
foresaid Tumor, let out his sick soul, that could say, The hand of God was
light upon him, and that he had never tasted a sweeter Cup.

January 1648/9. He saw his Royal Master dying a Martyr, and August 1649. saw
him dying a Confessor; weeping for Charles the First, and expecting Charles the
Second; lamenting the present, and hoping for the ancient state of things in
Church and State: Insomuch, that when some comforted him, That he should be
taken away from the evil to come: No no, answered he, somewhat more vehemently
than ordinary, I foresee, I foresee from the good things to come. He
departed, praying for those things we now enjoy; wishing well to all men, and
desired of most.

Being a man of a neat personage, convenient stature, a comely aspect, grave
manners, a fluent wit, a short anger, an even and constant zeal, an unblameable
life, a noble and a charitable heart, exact performances, that trembled at the
Supra-lapsarians Opinions, defined Presbytery, a vast Schism in the Church,
bequeathed his Estate to pious uses, and his Books to the College, by the
hands of his three honorable Executors, Sir Rober Abdy, Sir Thomas Rich, and
Bishop Brownrig, who ordered his Funeral with great solemnity (Dr. Iefferies of
Pembroke Preaching at it, on Psalm. 102. 11.) and erected him this Monument with
great respect.

THE Life and Death OF Dr. EDWARD MARTIN, Dean of Ely.
DOctor Edw. Martin, who had six Ancestors in a direct line, learned before
him, and six Libraries bequeathed to him, though inclined to any thing more
than learning; Yet, as he would say, was he Hatched a Scholar, as Chickens are
at Gran-Cairo, by the very heat of the Family he was related to; his parts, as
his nature, inclining to Solidity, rather than Politeness; he was for the exact
Sciences, Logic and Mathematics in his Study, as he was for strict Rules in
his Conversation. His exact obedience to public establishments in his own
person, raised him to a power and trust to see them obeyed by others, being
incomparably well skilled in the Canon, Civil, and Common Law, especially as
far as concerned the Church in general, and in the Statutes of the University
of Cambridge in particular; to be bred under a good Governor, is the best step
to be one; he was therefore first admitted 1627/8. Chaplain to Bishop Laud, and
thence preferred Master of Queens College, and Rector of -- Government is an
Art above the attainment of every ordinary Genius; and requires a wider, a
larger, and a more comprehensive soul, than God has put into every body; he
would never endure men to mince and mangle that in their practice, which they
swallowed whole in their Subscriptions: owning a well-regulated and resolved
zeal in himself, and encouraging it in others; for (to use Dr. South on Tit. 2.
ult.
an excellent Persons expression in a Sermon, whereof our Doctor was a Copy)
not to support men in the ways of an active Conformity to the Churches rules,
he knew would crack the sinews of Government by weakening the hands, and damping
the spirits of the obedient. And if only scorn and rebuke shall attend men for
asserting the Churches dignity, many will choose rather to neglect their duty
safely and creditably, than to get a broken pate in the Churches service, only
to be rewarded with that which will break their hearts too.

Although he was so resolvedly honest, and upon such clear Principles
conscientious, that he tired the persecutions of his enemies, and outlived the
neglect of his friends, finding the satisfaction flowing from his duty,
out-ballancing the sufferings for it.

1. When Chaplain, much troubled by Archbishop Abbot, Sir H. Lynde, and Mr. P.
1. For Licensing a Book called, An Historical Narration of the Judgment of some
most Learned and Godly English Bishops, holy Martyrs, Confessors in Queen
Mary's days, concerning Gods Election, and the Merits of Christ's death,
November. 27. 1630. 2. For maintaining universal Grace and Redemption, in a
Passion Sermon at St. Paul's Cross about the same time.

2. When Master of Queens College, as much persecuted by the Faction for six
or seven years from Cambridge to Ely^ house, thence to Shipboard, and thence
to the Fleet, with the same disgrace and torment I mentioned before in Dr.
Beals life, for being active in sending the University-Plate to the King, and
in undeceiving people about the proceedings of the pretended Parliament, i. e.
in sending to the King that which should have been plundered by his enemies: and
preaching as much for him as others did against him; his sufferings were both
the smarter and the longer, because he would not own the Usurpation so much as
to Petition it for favor, being unwilling to own any power they had to Imprison
him, by any address to them to Release him.

And when in a throng of other Prisoners he had his Liberty, he chose to be an
exile beyond Sea at Paris, rather than submit to the tumult at home at London,
or Cambridge. If he was too severe against the Presbyteries of the Reformed
Churches, which they set up out of necessity, it was out of just indignation
against the Presbytery of England, which set up it self out of Schism. And when
he thought it unlawful for a Gentleman of the Church of England to marry a
French Presbyterian, it was because he was transported by the oppression and
outrage of the English. But being many years beyond Sea, he neither joined
with the Calvinists, nor kept any Communion with the Papists: but confined
himself to a Congregation of old English and Primitive Protestants: where by
his regular Life and good Doctrine, he reduced some Recusants to, and confirmed
more doubters in the Protestant Religion, so defeating the jealousies of his
foes, and exceeding the expectation of his friends. Returning with his Majesty
1660. he was restored to his own Preferments, and (after Dr. Loves death, the
natural Wit, and Orator, Master of Bennet College, Margaret Professor after
Dr. Holdsworth; in which place he was sure to affront any man that put up
Questions against the Doctrine or Discipline of the Church of Engl. in the
worst of times, and Dean of Ely) made Dean of Ely; in which dignity he dyed
1662/3 having this Memorial, That he had bred up his College so well in the
Principles, of Religion and Loyalty, that no one there from the highest to the
lowest, submitted to the Usurpers; for there, was a through Reformation,
neither Master, Fellow, not Scholar being left of the Foundation; so that
according to the Laws of the Admiralty it might seem a Wreck, and forfeited in
this Land-tempest for lack of a living thing therein, to preserve the propriety
thereof: a severity contrary to the eternal moral of the Jewish Law provided
against the Depopulation of Birds-nests, that the old and young ones should be
destroyed together. The Doctors Predecessors, Dr. Humphrey Tyndal Master of
Queens, and Dean of Ely, was, as is reported, offered by a Protestant party in
Bohemia, to be chosen King in Queen Elizabeth's Reign, and he refused it,
alleging, That he had rather be a Subject under Queen Elizabeth, than a
foreign Prince. And the Doctor himself was offered (as I have heard) honorable
accommodations by some in the Church of Rome, but he accepted them not, because
he said, He had rather be a poor Son of the afflicted, but Primitive Church of
England, than a Rich Member of the flourishing, but corrupt Church of Rome.

THE Life and Death OF THE LORD WILLMOT, Earl of Rochester.
THe Lord, Wilmot, born on All Souls day in Ireland, and bred Fellow of
All Souls in Oxford, received a Barony from his Ancestors, and conveyed an
Earldom to his Posterity; of whom a great man said, That he was, so Great a
Scholar, that he could give the best advice; and so good a Soldier, that he
could follow it the best of any man in England; none more valiant to return a
private affront with the hazard of his own Person^ (he gave a box on the ear to
one of the most eminent men in this Nation) none more patient in taking a
disgrace, the revenge of which might hazard the public safety. (He suffered
his Horse to be taken by the bridle, and himself to be led out of Command by a
Messenger from his Majesty in the Hoad of 700. Horse, over whom he was
Lieutenant General, in view of the Enemy, to the great dissatisfaction of the
Army, which was ready to Mutiny for the Lord Willmot, at that very time when
they should fight the Earl of Essex.) He was Captain of Horse many years in the
Low Countries, with great respect for his generous Courage and good Discipline;
and coming thence over, was made Commissary General of Horse in the Expedition
into Scotland. In Holland began that animosity between him and Goring, which
continued in England.

His sobriety indeared him to every Army he came to, and therefore rendered him
suspected and envied in most actions he performed. An excellent Commander of
Horse, and of himself, being therefore mistrusted, because he would not swear,
as if Dam-me had been the Oath of Allegiance. 1640. Aug. 28. When the Lord
Conway let the Scots over ^weed, Mr. Willmot was the first man that made head
against them, standing with a few prime Gentleman, when the rest of the Army
fled and threw down their Arms to the Enemies Horse and Cannon; so effectual,
that though being overpowered he could not defeat them, yet he stunned them so,
that instead of advancing with an Army, next day they submit with a Petition
exactly as Mr. Willmot guessed, whose opinion was, That one resolute action
against the Scots should min them who are lost by favors, and (...) by
severities. He acted like a Statesman when Commissary in the Expedition against
the Scots, telling my Lord Conway, That he saw his Majesty would be overcome by
the English at home if he overcame not the Scots abroad; and he spoke like a
Soldier in the Parliament 1641. where whispering with the Lord Peirey, and
Colonel Ashburnham, as they sat together upon the Vote of 300000 l. to be paid
the Scots, with 25000 l. advance, out of the money designed the English Army;
he stepped up and told Mr. Speaker, That if such Papers of the Scots could
procure moneys, he doubted not, but the Officers of the English should soon do
the like. A wise and brave Speech, that when the Army were informed by him how
the Parliament slighted them, they were ready to Rally them selves against the
Parliament as soon, that Rallied the multitude against the King; he and some
others putting themselves into a secret and sworn Juncto, to declare with the
Army, against the rude at fronts offered his Majesty, to the subversion of
Government; notwithstanding all the gracious Concessions made by his Majesty
for the support of it; but without success, Because, as his Lordship used to
say, Treach^ry got easily into the Bosom of that Prince, that had nothing but
Honesty in his heart. And because some were admitted into their Counsels
against Mr. Wilmots advice, who never engaged in a secret design, to which
there were above four together privy that knew one anoth^r.

He obstructed the Faction much in the House of Commons, and more when called
to the House of Lords, stopping their Careere with those Propositions for
Accommodation, which he offered at Westminster, 1641. and to show he was the
same man, guided not by Interest but Conscience, renewed at Oxford, 1644. and
making ^se of the sad News of the Irish Rebellion (in which affairs, having
considerable concerns in that kingdom, he was always of the Committee) to
prevent the English, with as much dexterity as others did to promote it.

But when (being Posted for a Straffordian) he had no longer any power to
moderate the Councils of the Faction in the City (after he had seen so many
injuries and indignities offered his Royal Person, so many affronts and scorns
put upon the Kingly Office, so many scandalous, seditious, and traitorous
Pamphlets against the Government, together with the Combinations and
Conspiracies, which the implacable malice, and insatiable ambition of some
persons had contrived) he went to suppress the Rebellion in the Field; (being
Voted a Traitor by those he endeavored should not be so.) At Edgehill he
advised, that there should be a good Reserve of Horse to secure the Battle, and
that the other Horse should by no advantage be drawn out of it; There being
nothing, he said, more dangerous than too eager a pursuit before a battle was
over. He ordered the Horse at The First Battle.
Newbery (being Lieutenant General under Prince Rupert) in so convenient and
spacious a place (Downs have been pitched upon as the most commodious Scene of
a Horse Engagement) advising them by no means to be drawn into any uneven and
straight places; with so strict an eye upon all advantages and N^u^f psa^
dicead^m (...) scc^^si^.
opportunities, and in such Ranks, that one Troop might be in Subsidiis
assistant to another, and no part stand naked, or fall in the singleness of its
own strength, but that one may second another from first to last; being aware
of Livies charge upon Cajus Sempronius, (Pugnavit incaute inconsulteque non
subsidiis firmata acic non equite apt locato,) the like he did at When at at
Edgehill he Winged the Foot with the Horse on all sides, taking advantage both
of ground and wind; the like he did at Round way down, decoying Hazelrigs
Horse to an advantage, and then beating them upon their own Foot, to the ruin
both of Horse and Foot, as be did take Marleburgh.
CropredyBridge, bringing off the Kings. Rear there with three Charges through,
with so much execution, as routed Sir William Wallers Horse and Foot, took all
his Ordnances and Gunners, (among whom one Weems a sworn Servant to his
Majesty, with the very Leather-guns his Majesty had paid for, saying, when
brought before the King, Good Faith, his heart was always with his Majesty) he
being hurt, and twice taken Prisoner, and twice rescued by Sir Frederick
Cornwallis, and Sir Robert Howard. And of the same nature was his Relief of
Banbury, when he surrounded the Besiegers in a Net of six miles compass, full
of snares and stratagems, flanked on all hands by his well-ordered Horse.

His being punctual in his Promise, careful in his Pay and Provision for his
Soldiers, tender of their Lives, disposing of them in the easiest way for
service, and the safest from danger; his condescension to satisfy every
particular Person, the reputation of his Integrity and Skill, the moderation of
his Principles rendered him as popular in the Army and Country, as he was
suspected at Oxford; whence, upon the breaking up of the Parliament there, he
went over to the Queen in France, doing what he could by a generous carriage
there, to credit that Cause he was not suffered to sight for. Often reflecting,
when he heard of the discontents afterward in the Kings Army, on that of
Caesar in the first of his Commentaries, S^scire, quibuscunque exercitus dicto
audiens non fuerit, aut male re gesta fortunam defuiste, aut aliquo facinore
comperto avaritiae esse convictum.

Its a remarkable passage, that in her Majesty's Letter to the Lord Digby,
Paris April 7. 1645. You think it strange, that Willmot is so well entertained
here, which is done according to the orders which I have under the Kings hand
and yours; its true, his good carriage here has merited his good
entertainment. Indeed his negotiations in France and Holland (where he was
formerly very well known by the Name of Willmot the English Gentleman) were not
less serviceable than his battles in England; for by virtue of them, and his
correspondence with the Lord Willoughby, there was a considerable Fleet of the
Revolted Ships, and his own, to entertain the Prince of Wales 1648. as their
Commander in Chief, attended by my Lord, the Lord Hopton, etc. And when for
want of pay and other miscarriages, that endeavor by Sea and Land to restore
his Majesty failed, he set on foot, and by healing Propositions, brought on the
Scots Treaty so far, as the admission of the King to the Government of that his
ancient Kingdom; whither after some services done in Ireland (where he had
great concerns, and a considerable interest) he went with his Majesty,
accommodating the several differences that Especially about the C^^euant,
wherewith they were three or four times entangled.
arose among a people serupulous and capricious enough of themselves, and
distracted by the sad face of things at that time, yet no way better to be
ruled in such times, than by an indulgence to them of an experiment, and trial
of the folly and vanity of their own ways; and modelling and forming their
Rough-hewn Armies and Designs: And despairing of any good in that Country upon
those men's principles, he advised the Attempt 1651. into England, to draw off
the Force then lying within that Nation, coming some months before in person,
under the name of Williams, to pre-dispose his friend in (...) king^^m and
Oxfordshire (where he had married the Lady ^^igh of Ditchl^y and doing eminent
service (though in no Command) by instructing them to secure the Passes, to
keep a (...) Disc^pline, and offering to March toward London: besides the
great example of his personal valor in six several desperate Engagement^
especially in the latter end of the Worcester Fight, to gain his (...) time to
retreat, with whom he went, by the conduct of a Scout he had made use of
formerly, to Boscobell; where parting (...) without (...), unusual to so

but finding the ways strictly guarded, retired to Mr. Whitegreaves, Mr.
Hu^^^^^, and Col. Lanes; where after several consultations had for his
Maje^ties safe transportation, my Lord bethought himself of one Mr. Elden,
formerly Captain in the Kings Army, and now a Merchant in lynn; that had
befriended the Lord ^erkley in the like care, with whom he had contrived the
Voyage, but that the Shipmaster they agreed with, tailed them; and then
supporting and directing his Majesty in all emergencies with an invincible
courage, his Lord h^p^^ him up and down, through in^inite windings and
turni^gs, till happening upon a Vessel in brighthelm^sted in Sussex, the Master
whereof was charmed by his Lordship, under pretense of selling his Coals at the
isle of wight, to carry them that way, and then, my Lord pretending that his
mind altered, after a well acted quarrel with the honest Master of the Vessel)
to the Coast of France; where he stayed not long with his Majesty, but being
Created Earl of Rochester, undertook a successful (...) to the Imperial Diet at
the Ratisbone, where he procured a considerable sum of money for the present,
and a very fair promise of the Emperors and the Princes assistance for the
future; and in his return settled a correspondency for the like purpose in
England; whither he ventured several times in person, particularly 1655. at
H^ssamMoor near York, where the appearance of Cavaleers at the day appointed
not answering expectation, my Lord and Sir Nicholas Armorer escaped from the
midst of three thousand men, that had as it were enclosed them, to Ailesbury,
and from the very hands of the Usurpers Instruments, thence into Flanders,
where he served the King of Spain very happily, that he might be able to serve
his Master, till he died, not long before his Majesty's Restitution, like
Moses, having after several years traversing a Wilderness, only a Prospect of
Caanan, and the land of rest and settlement.

THE Life and Death OF Sir BEVILE GREENVILE, Father of the Right Honorable, the
Earl of Bathe.
THere are two ancient Families in this Gentleman's name, the Beviles, that have
flourished six hundred years in Cornwall at Gwarnack. in his Christian Name;
and the Greenviles that have continued in great honor at Bediford in Devonshire
above five hundred years in his Surname: And there were the two eminent Virtues
of those Families, in his nature (his names being to him not only
significations of Honor, but intimations of Virtue, according to that
admonition given by Alexander to one of his Followers, Either quit your good
name, or leave your bad manners) meekness, wariness, good nature, and
ingenuity, the character of the one; valor and prowess, the known honor of the
other. His Ancestor Sir R. Greenvile assisted King William Rufus 1113. against
the Welsh Rebels, successfully dedicating the Spoils of the war to the honor
of Almighty God, in maintaining a Religious House. Sir Bevile Greenvile
attended King Charles the First against the English 1641. consecrating his
services to the Glory of God, and the settlement of the Church, usually saying,
That he counted it the greatest Note that one of his Sons is a sober, meek,
godly and exemplary minister of the Church of England, which puts me in mind
of Esquire Buchenhall, who used to say, what shall I say to Mar^in Luther,
hav^ng eleven Sons, if I make not one of them a M^^ister.
honor of his Family, that one of it, meaning Will. de Greenvile, above three
hundred years before, under Edw. the First, was Archbishop of York, and in the
Council of Vienna, next the Archbishop of Triers; being for his public spirit
and activity, especially in improving the Trade, maintaining the Privileges,
and keeping up the Discipline of his Country, called to advise with his Majesty
in Parliament, about the great affairs of the kingdom, he would not continue
there without him: But when he saw that he was more likely to be suppressed by
his Majesty's adversaries, than his Majesty was to be supported by his
friendship at Westminster, he withdrew, with many more Devonshire and Cornish
Gentlemen that deserved Queen Elizabeth's Character of these Countrymen, That
they were all born Courtiers with a becoming confidence) to give their Country,
by rational Declarations, the same satisfaction about the state of affairs,
that they had already in their own breast (forcing not the Country, till they
had convinced and persuaded it) asserting Authority the ligament of civil
society against violence, the public interest against private designs, liberty
against licentiousness and oppression, and this upon such moderate principles,
to widen rather than narrow their interest, and in so civil terms, as won those
generous people that were not to be forced; like complete Orators, making happy
applications to the several humors and Genius of all persons, with Alcibiades
shifting disposition as they altered place; yea, so prudentially did they
manage their expressions, that the men at Westminster should not despair of
their compliance with them, until they were in a capacity to appear against
them, when they had secured the Port-towns, the Fishing-trade for Herring and
Pilchards, Silver at Combmartin and Tin, ^or the meeting of which with
Sea-Cral^o save Wood, and k^ep the Tei^ from westing in the blessed. Sir Bevile
made several experiments.
the Mines, the Markets, for the Manufactures of that Country, Kersies,
Bonelace, and c. and settled as good a correspondence between Devonshire and
Cornwall by Sir Bevile Greenviles advice, as was before by Sir Theo.
Greenvile's device, who built Baddiford-bridge, as Sir Bevile secured it. They
appear in a great body near Pendennis, whereof Sir Nicholas Slaning, another
excellent Patriot of Cornwall, was Governor, and Launston the County-town of
Cornwall, which Sir Bevile Greenvile possessed himself of.

The Body he trained to war, he disciplined to piety (piety not like the
Cornish Diamond, counterfeit) and strictness, least as Pilchards in this
Country, being persecuted by their fellow-fish, the Tunny and Hake, fall into
the Fisher-mens Nets; so the Countrypeople abused by the incivilities of their
friends, the Cavaleers, might be taken in the Snares of their enemies the
Faction. As the Ambergreese, found sometimes in this Country, has a more
fragrant scent, compounded with other things, than when singly its self; so
this noble Gentleman gained a greater repute, when joining counsels and
endeavors with others, than when he acted alone. The neighbor Counties were on
fire, these Counties look to themselves. Sir Bevile wished that his Army were
all of them as good as his Cause, but it is not to be expected that all should
be Fish that are caught in a Drag-net; neither that all should be good and
religious people, who were adventurers in an action of so large a capacity as
this war was; some of the Devils Black Guard may be listed among Gods
Soldiers, yet there were fewer oaths among them, than in any Army then in
England. They say the Cornish-tongue affords but two natural oaths, or but
three at the most.

The sobriety of this Army (which Sir Bevile would say were greater, if less,
some being rather a burden than strength to it) made them valiant (its the foul
Gun and the guilty Conscience that recoils) as when Sir William Waller intended
to break the Western Association at Landsdown, was beaten out of his Lines and
Hedges by Sir Bevill, and not only so, but forced likewise out of an high hill,
fortified on all sides, the passage up very narrow and dangerous, between a
Wood, lined with Musketeers on the one hand, and Hedges on the other, gained
after four desperate Repulses by Horse, Foot, and Canon, by Sir Bevill, and
maintained with a Stand of his own Pikes, with a gallantry and honor admired by
his very enemies, until he was unfortunately ^lain in the Head of his Men, with
the excellent Sergeant Major Lower at his feet, and honorable Mr. Leake, the
Earl of Scarsedales Son, with his enemies Colors about his arms, to whom this
mention is due, Mr. Barker, Lieutenant Col. Wall, Mr. Bostard, Captain James,
and Cholwell, being found dead not far from him; both sides bewailing him, and
the whole University of Oxford honoring his memory with a Book of Verses,
whereof these I pitched upon for his Epitaph.

NOt to be wrought by Malice, By Mr. Will. ca^twr^ght.
Gain, or Pride,
To a Compliance with the Triving Side;
Not to take Arms for Love of change, or spite,
But only to maintain afflicted Right.
Not to dye Vainly in pursuit of Fame,
Perversely seeking after Voice and Name;
Is to resolve, Fight, Dye, as Martyrs do;
And thus did he, Soldier, and Martyr too.
He might (like some reserved Men of State,
Who look not to the Cause, but to its Fate).
Have stood aloof, Engaged on neither side,
Prepared at last to strike in with the Tide:
But well-weighed Reason told him, that when Law
Either's Renounced, or Misapplied by the awe
Of false-nam'd Patriots; that when the Right
Of King and Subject is suppressed by Might;
When all Religion either is refused
As mere pretense, or merely as that used.
When thus the fury of Ambition swells,
Who is not active, modestly Rebels.
Whence in a just Esteem to Church and Crown,
He offered all, and nothing thought his own:
This thrust him into Action whole and free,
Knowing no Interest, but Loyalty;
Not loving Arms as Arms, or Strife for Strife,
Nor Wasteful, nor yet Sparing of his Life.
A great Exacter of himself, and then
By fair commands, no less of other men.
Courage and Judgment had their equal part,
Counsel was added to a generous heart;
Affairs were justly timed, nor did he catch
At an affected fame of quick dispatch;
Things were Prepared, Debated, and then done,
Not rashly Broke, or vainly Overspun;
False Periods no where by design were made,
As are by those that make the War their Trade.
The Building still was suited to the Ground,
Whence every Action issued full and round.
We know who blind their men with specious Lies,
With Revelation, and with Prophecies;
Who promise two things, to obtain a third,
And are themselves by the like Motives stirred.
By no such Engine he his Soldiers draws,
He knew no Arts, but Courage, and the Cause;
With these he brought them on, as well-train'd Men,
And with those two he brought them off again.
When now the Incensed Legions proudly came
Down like a Torrent without Bank or Dam:
When understood Success urged on their Force,
That Thunder must come down to stop their Course,
or Greenvile must step in; then Greenvile stood,
And with himself opposed, checked the Flood.
Conquest or Death was all his thoughts, so Fire
Either O'rcomes, or does it self Expire:
His Courage work't like flames, cast Heat about
Here, there on this, on that side none gave out.
Not any Pike in that renowned Stand,
But took new force from his inspiring Hand:
Soldier encouraged Soldier, Man urged Man,
And he urged all; so much example can:
Hurt upon Hurt, Wound upon Wound did call,
He was the Butt, the Mark, the Aim of all:
His Soul this while retired from Cell to Cell,
At last flew up from all, and then he fell.
But the devoted Stand enraged more
From that his Fate, plied hotter than before;
And proud to fall with him, sworn not to yield,
Each sought an honored Grave, so gained the Field.
Thus he being fallen, his action Fought anew,
And the Dead Conquered, whiles the Living slew.
This was not Natures Courage, nor that thing
We Valor call, which Time and Reason bring;
But Diviner Fury fierce and high,
Valor transported into Ecstasy;
Which Angels looking on us from above,
Use to convey into the Souls they love.
Doctor Lluelin.
ANd with this constant Principle possess't,
He did alone expose his single Breast
Against an Armies force, and bleeding lay,
The Great Restorer of the declining day.
Thus slain thy Vasiant Ancestor did Lie,
When his one Barque a Navy durst defy;
When now encompassed round, he Victor stood,
And bathed his Pinnace in his Conquering blood,
Till all his purple Current dried and spent,
He fell, and left the Waves his Monument.
Where shall next famous Greenviles Ashes stand?
Thy Grandsire fills the Sea, and thou the Land.
And there is a third Greenvile, the Right Honorable John Earl of Bathe, Sir
Beviles Son and Heir (who having gone on so honorably all the War, the
Chronicle whereof swells with his name) pursuing those great Actions his Father
had begun in King Charles I. time, that my Lord Dighy and that King writing to
the Queen about making him of the Princes Bedchamber, declare him then the
most deserving young Gentleman in England, and waited upon King Charles I. so
faithfully, that as he had been witness of his Majesty's gracious intentions
and thoughts toward his distracted Kingdoms abroad in his banishment; so he
was the first Messenger between his Majesty and his Kingdoms in order to his
miraculous return home, who should be the instrument of the Sons Restoration,
but Sir Bevile Greenviles Son, who had so nobly dyed in defense of the Father.
And if there be any knowledge above among the blessed of what is done here
below among us: its, King Charles the Martyrs satisfaction, that his Son is
restored to his Throne; and it adds to Sir Bevill Greenviles bliss, that his
heir is the first messenger in the Kingdom met in Parliament, of the Gracious
Letters that accomplished that Restoration.

And here will be the most proper place to mention Sir Sir Richard Greenvile,
who went with 600 l. he had of the Parliament toward a design to Oxford.
Richard Greenvile, Sir, Beviles Brother, who staid with the Parliament till
two Treaties, and the great condescension of his Majesty brought him over first
to correspondence, and when an opportunity offered its self of performing his
Majesty a considerable service, by carrying over with him the Government of a
very advantageous Port-Town, to actual service, contributing very much by
possessing my Lord Roberts house, taking Lesterman Castle, and stopping most of
the Passes which he understood very well, to the famous straight wherein the
Earl of Essex was caught in in Cornwall: and a while after very active in
besieging Col. Weldens Brigade, and the Town of Taunton both at one time. As he
was upthe fatal defeat at Naseby in getting together 4 or 5 thousand Reformades
in the Counties of Devonshire and Cornwall, where he pursued his Majesty's
quarrel as long as he had either a Garrison or a Regiment, after the Treaty at
Tresilian-bridge, made between my Lord Hopton and Sir ^. F. for disbanding the
Western Forces, waiting on his Majesty that now is, to Scilly, Holland, France,
etc. where he was very instrumental in laying the model of the second, or the
Presbyterian War, understanding by a long converse with the Faction, their
interest and humor of most of them by Sea and Land; and that failing, he
followed his Majesty's fortune abroad while he lived, being accomplished as
well with ingenious Arts, that rendered him company for a Prince in time of
peace, as with those more severe, that made him serviceable to him in War; his
youth and Sir Beviles being bred up in Exeter College to all gentile habits of
Learning, Virtue, and Complaisance; yet in the midst of more soft pleasures as
well as harder services, his solid mind admits nothing scandalous either to
his Religion or Cause, both which a virtuous suffering, pityed by mankind
advancing, as well as heroic attempts commended by them; the first in the eyes
of all men, deserving that success which the last wanted: to which circumspect
converse he added frequent conferences to his Masters in the good opinion of
those near him; and an uninterrupted correspondence in the indefatigable way of
Ciphers, to keep them upright in their duty that were at distance, salving all
the strange Phenomenon of the Rebels success, and his Majesty's misfortunes in
entire discourses, which he kept of all transactions from first to last;
besides that, he gained his Country much honor by his services to the Crowns of
France and Spain, evincing that the King of great Britain in his very
Banishment had such Attendants (his Court even then was the Scene of the most
Heroic virtue in Europe) as could serve any Prince, and would one day restore
their own: the very sight of whom, and some discourse with Sir R. Greenvile,
etc. put many upon prophesying what we have lived to see particularly. The
Archbishop of Avignon sent a Scheme drawn up by one Oneal, a great
Mathematician, demonstrating that his Majesty should return 1660. to London
with as great triumph in peace, as his blessed Father was 1641. driven out of
it by tumults.

Neither did Sir Richard come over alone to the Kings service; for the
attractive of his example brought along another eminent Parliament Man that had
been very active in the West, by name Sir George Chudleigh, Sir George
Chudleigh and his Deelaration, and why be deserted the Parliament with young
Mr. Chudleigh, whose return broke the Earl of Strafford.
who 1643. declared, That Petitions of Right are commendable, and Remonstrances
may be lawful; but Arms, though defensive, are ever doubtful: my Lot (says he)
fell to be cast upon the Parliaments side, by a strong opinion of the goodness
of their Cause, which to my judgment then appeared to be so; Religion and the
Subjects Liberty seemed to me to be in danger, but the destruction of the
Kingdom cannot be the way to save it: nor can the loss of Christian Subjects,
nor the Subjects loss of their Estates by Plunder and Assessement consist with
Piety, nor yet with propriety: As for Religion, his Majesty (whom God long
preserve) has given us unquestionable security. I have cast my self at my
Sovereigns feet, and implored his gracious pardon. I will contend no more in
words or deed. And this my resolution with the indisputable grounds thereof, I
thought good to declare to my Friends and Countrymen, that they may understand
my sitting (he means at Oxford,) to proceed from no compulsion. He and his Son,
men of great Reputation in the West, redeeming their former miscarriage by very
eminent services in Counsel and in Arms; and by this time, we see the reason
why the men at Westminster who understood nothing but English, Proclaimed Sir
Richard Greenvile Traitor in three Languages, and they which hated Images
hanged him in Effigy, excepting him out of their pardon even for that very
reason, for which God took him to his, even because he repented.

Euge! virtus suis firmior erroribus
uti confracta solidior a sunt ut plurimum
ossa! nisi errassent Heroes paenitentes, fecerant minus.
To these I may add Chammo Greenvile of Pughill Cornwall, who is 657 l. deep
in their Books at Haberdashers, and Goldsmiths-hall; and Thomas Chudley of
Aishton Devonshire. 430 l.

THE Life and Death OF Sir CHARLES LUCAS.
HAD not his Ancestor Sir Giles Lucas appeared in the Roll of the Essex Gentry,
made 12 Hen. 6. 1433. nor his Kinsman Thomas Lucas Esquire been Secretary and
Counselor to Jasper Duke of Bedford and Earl of Pembroke 1385. had there not
been a succession of Knights and Squires, Sheriffs and Justices of that County
for eleven Kings Reigns; had he not been Brother to the most Illustrious
Princess Margaret Duchess of New Castle, a Lady admired in this Age, and to be
understood in the next, which will be convinced by her that there is no Sex in
the mind; and that the delicate Piece of the Creation we call Woman (having a
Male-soul as well as we) was not only made for dalliance; And to the Right
Honorable the Wose Loyalty cost him at Goldsmiths-Hall 3634 l. as Sir Rob.

Lord Lucas, the great instance of a learned, wise, and sober Nobility, who
intending with Horse and Arms to wait on his Majesty in the North, Aug. 22.
1642. was discovered, surprised, plundered to a great value, carried to London
and imprisoned there till he gave 40000 l. Bail to appear upon summons, and not
to depart London without leave. One of the first that suffered for his Loyalty
in his Country, and one of the forwardest (when he arrived at Oxford) where he
was made Baron Lucas of Shenfield, Ian. 3. 1644. 20 Car. I. in asserting it by
sober Counsel, and by a well-guided Arms in others.

Sir Charles Lucas had worth enough to raise a Family himself, being the (...)
ap^ean in the H^ad of the Army.
first that entered the breach at Breda the last Siege, when Cornet of Horse to
Sir Io. Coniers in the Low Countries; where the sweet generosity of his nature
to all men (his soul being universalized) especially those of his own noble
disposition (there one might have seen running (...), and he would ever have
emptied his soul into theirs. The greatness of his spirit, whose soul came into
the world (as the Chaldee Oracle phraseth it) (...), clothed with a great deal
of mind. more impregnated than others with rich notions, which by way of
Theory he comprehended exactly from books, and by way of practice from
experience and observation, together with his prudent reach, unwearied
patience, close watchfulness, settled integrity, circumspect activity,
advantageous temperance, and good conversation, gained the repute of the best
Commander of Horse in the world; in which capacity he had the Command of a
Colonel in the Show, as he called it, against Scotland; and of General of Horse
in the real War against the English, and that in the North assisting the Earls
of Cumberland and Newcastle, to form an Army where the best Horse were to be
raised; from whence after some notable defeats of the Lord Fairfax, which some
said were remembered at Colchester, he carried 2000. Horse to assist his
Majesty, with whom we find him eminent both for his direction and execution
about the hill near Newbery and E^born-Heath, which he maintained with one
Regiment well disposed and lined with Musketeers, and a Drake, with small shot
against the gross of E^^ex his Army^ the Leading-man of which he Pistolled
himself in the Head of hi^ Troop, giving close fire himself, and commanding
others to do the like. After this first battle of Newbery, and his recovery
from his seven wounds received there, being at Cawood Castle, when it was
assaulted, with extraordinary skill and valor he forced his way through the
enemies quarters to such places as he thought convenient, with such confidence
and magnanimity, that his very name became a terror in the North, raising by
the very Alarm three Sieges, and reducing two strong Garrisons.

At Where he was taken Prisoner.
Marston-Moor being commanded to lead the Kings Left Wing against the
Parliaments Right, consisting of Fairfax his Troops and Scots, he routed them
for two miles together with a violent Charge; and afterward saved most of
those that were saved in that fatal battle, making it his business to pick up a
Regiment of Veteranes, (saying, He must make much of a Soldier, for he was
long in the making; and not one in twenty lived to it.)

At Newark he gave as great a proof of his good Discipline, as he did of his
personal Valor; strict, though not severe in his Commands, being none of those
that reckoned it the very spirit of Policy and Prudence, where men refuse to
come up to Orders and Law, to make Orders and Law come down to them; and for
their so doing have this infallible Recompense, that they are not at all the
more loved, but much the less feared: and which is a sure consequence of it,
accordingly respected. Disobedience, if complied with, is infinitely
incroaching, and having gained one degree of Liberty upon indulgence, will
demand another upon claim.

Free in his rewards to persons of desert and quality; very zealous on all
occasions against the Rebellion, being usually known to deliver himself in
these words, That he preferred the style of Loyalty before any Dignity earth
could confer upon him. In his Charge serious and vigilant: remiss in nothing
that might expedite or improve his dispatch in Affairs of Government; as
compassionate as courageous, never killing the man he durst spare, and very
ready at all times to afford what himself could not receive, Freequarter; to
which I need add only his brave and successeful Attempt in the famous march
from Berkley Castle with part of his Regiment between Slym-bridge and Bev^rston
Castle, upon Col. Massies Garrisons, with his incomparable Gallantry at
Tidbury, his brave answer at Berkley Castle at the refusal of two summons, viz.
That he would eat Horseflesh first, and Mans-flesh when that was done, before
he would yield.

But having trod many uncouth parts for his Majesty's restitution, and breaking
his Parol with the General, upon good advic^ (had before to satisfy his
Conscience in that point) he formed an hopeful Association among the Gentlemen
of his own Country, (the beginning whereof was indeed so distracted, that he
advised them to retire quietly to their own homes, until they had a fairer
opportunity) who entreated him to command them (promising to live and die with
him one and all) as he did, securing them on all hands by a party of choice
Horse from the Incursions of the Enemy; and disposing them in Quarters most for
their advantage and safety all along, till (taking the Earl of Warwicks House
and Arms in his way) they came from Burnt-wood to Colchester, which shutting
the gates against him, he reduced with his very appearance, and when the next
day begirt, he entertained the Enemies whole Army with such Conduct and
Resolution in the hedges, and Suburbs round the Town, that had they all fallied
out as he advised them, they had (as some Prisouers acknowledged) bidden fair
for the overthrow of that whole Army. But the enemy falling next day to form a
Leaguer, he (considering there was no marching out of the Country about, being
Champion ground, wherein for want of Horse they would be instantly cut off)
Victualled and furnished the Town in spite of the Army from the Sir Cha^les
giv^ng out of his t^nderness to his Country, special order to drive nones
Cattle, but known enemies.
Stores and Country adjoining; and made its ruins above belief defensible (to
give time to other Countries, while the Army was there to Associate, expecting
the Northern relief) and likewise to weather the Army its self by hard duty,
unseasonable weather, and continual sallies, sending out some excellent Persons
to countenance the Levy of more Forces in other Countries, and keep
intelligence, from whom several small parties came in through the Leaguer: and
ordering all the Town Arms into the Magazine, and listing the Townsmen into
Companies.

July 7. Sir Charles and Sir George Lisle made a grand Sally, that cleared one
side of the Leaguer, Streets, Hills, Hedges and all, to the loss of near a
thousand six hundred killed, several stealing into the Town, and many running
home.

July 12. Sir Charles took care for a convenient distribution of the Provision
left among the Toward whom, as his Town.-to^n people, Sir Charles ^as very
tender and mercyful.
Towns-people and Soldiers, and of Declarations to be sent into Kent and
Essex, and to the Army, promising from his Majesty, Arrears; and Indemnity to
such as laid down their Arms, or would join with them toward the Peace and
Settlement of the Kingdom.

July 29. Sir Charles advised that the Horse should break out through the
Leaguer toward the North, but in vain, the false Townsmen, that should make
their way as Pioneers, deserting them.

August 17. He and the Lord Capell, in a Letter to the General, desired twenty
days respite, to inform themselves about their intended Relief; and that being
denied, the Relief failing, the great Northern Army beaten, their Ammunition
spent to a Barrel and a half of Powder, and their Provision to two Horses and
one Dog, the whole Kingdom stupid, and Sir Charles his admirable overture
(after a general protestation, that they would not accept of dishonorable
terms, nor desert one another) of a general Sally to perish nobly, or honorably
Relieve themselves, being (when all things were ready to a minute for the
executing of it) defeated, yielded; and by the Generals order retired to the
King's Head, till Sir Charles was sent for, with Sir George Lisle, Colonel
Far, and Sir Bernard Gascoin, to a Council of War, by which he was Condemned
to dye immediately: Sir Charles asking That brought the sad news.
Ireton, By what authority? and being answered, By a Vote of a Council of War,
grounded on an Order of Parliament, by which Order all that were found in Arms
were to be proceeded against as Traitors: Replied, Alas! you deceive your
selves, make us Tray^ors, you cannot, but we are Conquered, and must be what
you please to make us; and desired time to prepare himself till the morrow.
Which being refused, telling them he desired it not out of any desire of life,
or fear of death, for (said he) I scorn to ask my my life at your hands, but
settle his That he might not go out of the world with all his sins about him.
Soul and Estate, He told them, he should be quickly ready, as after a most
heavenly Prayer he was, saying, He had often looked death in the face, and now
they should see he durst dye. Adding (when he had pulled down his Hat, opened
his Breast, the dwelling of Courage and Loyalty, and set his Hands to his Side)
I am ready for you, now Rebels do your worst; whereat, being shot in four
places, he fell down immediately dead.

THE Life and Death OF Sir GEORGE LISLE.
SIR George Lisle, an honest Booksellers Son (great streams run sometimes from
muddy Springs) that having Trailed a Pike in the Low Countries, by keeping good
Society and improving Company, Ever (as he would say) consorting with those
most by whom he might accomplish himself best. By generous pleasing, and
naturally bounteous disposition; by his great skill (above his years) gained by
observation in the modern and ancient Militia, excelling in the Command of
Foot, as Esteemed the best in Europe.
Sir Charles Lucas did that of Horse: By the great sense he had of Honor and
Justice, was admitted into Inferior Commands in England, where his Valor
without Oftentation, his Just and Cheerful Commands, without a Surly
Imperiousness, rendered him so infinitely beloved and observed by his Soldiers,
that with his Discipline and Courage, he led as in a Line, upon any services
through the greatest danger and difficulty, that he was preferred to a
Superior; in which capacity he had one quality of an obliging and knowing
Commander, that never to the hour of his death would he Engage his Soldiers in
that Action, wherein he would not hazard his own person, as at the last Newbery
Fight (before his Majesty's face, who then Knighted him for it) leading his men
in his Whereupon they reported in London, that they saw a white Witch run up
and down in his Majesty's Army.
Shirt, both that they might see his Valor, and (it being Night) discern his
Person, from whom they were to receive direction and courage at
Brambdean-heath, where he gained and kept an advantageous Hill against all
Wallers Army, at the first Newbery Fight, where he Commanded the Forelorn-hope;
at Nazeby, where he and the Lord Bard led the left hand Tertia of Foot; and at
the two Garrisons he held with the last, surrendering them with Oxford. He was
approved and admired for his Judgment, Direction, Dispatches and Cheerfulness,
Virtues that had special influence upon every common Soldier; especially in
his three great Charges (in each whereof he came to the Butt^end of the
Musket) for the first whereof, his Word was The Crown; for the second, Prince
Charles; and for the third, The Duke of York; resolving to have gone over all
his Majesty's Children, as long as he had a Man to fight for them, or there was
a Rebel to fight against them. Being in most of the Sallies in Colchester, and
having three times scowred the Leaguer, with so much hazard, that he was twice
taken Prisoner, but rescued he was to second Sir Charles, Lucas, as (...)
always desired to imitate him; saying over his Corpse, How soon is a brave
spirit expired? we shall be together presently. Dispatching some Tokens to his
friends in London, and expostulating with them, that What a Christian note did
be leave in Mr. Dolmans house near N^n^ery that the p^^r, (...), help^ess men
should be cared f^r.
his life should be taken away in cold-bloud, when he had saved so many of
theirs in hot, and praying for his Majesty and the Kingdom, he entertained grim
death with a sprightly countenance, and heroic posture; saying, Now then
Rebels and Traitors do your worst.

It will be Embalming enough to these deserving persons, that King Charles the
First, upon the news of their death, wept. Monument enough, that the very
Parliament was amazed at it. Epitaph enough, that a great Man, and a great
Traveller too protested, That he saw many dye, but never any with more Soldier
or Christian-like resolution.

THE Life and Death OF ARTHUR Lord CAPEL, Father to the Right Honorable, ARTHUR
Earl of ESSEX.
HIS privacy before the War was passed with as much popularity in the Country,
as his more public appearance in it, was with Valor and Fidelity in the Field.
In our too happy time of Peace, none more Pious, Charitable, and Munificent. In
these more unhappy of our differences, none more Resolved, Loyal, and Active;
the people loved him so well, that they chose him one of their Representatives;
and the King esteemed him so much, that he sent for him as one of his Peers in
Parliament, wherein the King and People agreed in no one thing, save a just
kindness to my Lord Capel; who was one of those Excellent Gentlemen, whose
gravity and discretion, the King said, He hoped would allay and fix the Faction
to a due temperament (guiding some men's well-meaning zeal by such rules of
Moderation, as are best both to preserve and restore the health of all States
and Kingdoms) keeping to the dictates of his Conscience, rather than the
importunities of the People, to what was just, than what was safe, save only in
the Earl of Straffords Case, wherein he yielded to the public necessity with
his Royal Master, but repented with him too, sealing his Contrition for that
miscarriage with his blood, when he was more troubled for his forced Consent to
that brave Persons Death, than for loosing his own Life, which he ventured
through the first In the exposition whereof (said be) Divines othe^wise

Magistra^e, in obedience to whom I did what against the Law of England, and the
world. I a man, an Englisheman, a Peer of the Realm, must ^ye for.
War, and by his Engagement in the second. For after the Surrender of Oxford,
he retired to his own house, but could not rest there, until the King was
brought home to his, which all England endeavoring as one man, my Lord
adventured himself at Colchester to extremity, yielding himself upon condition
of Quarter, which he urged by the Law of Arms, That Law that (as he said on
the Scaffold) governs the World, and against the Law of God and Man (they are
his own words) for keeping the Which puts me in mind of one Master Whaley of
Northampton, a great z^^lot in the Cause, who when some in Essex his Army began
to ^^agger, would needs send them to Mr. Dod, just as he was a dying to be
resolved, who telling, them, that he was not able to speak to them, and bid
them look to what he had written upon the Fifth Commandment, where he had made
it clear from the Word of God, that it was damnable to raise Arne upon any
prewhatsoever against a Prince, in which opinion, he said, he would dye.
Fifth Commandment, dying on the Scaffold at Westminster, with a courage that
became a clear conscience, and a resolution befiting a good Christian,
expressing that judicious piety in the Chamber of Meditation at his Death, that
he did in his Book of Meditations in his Life; a piety, that (as it appeared by
his dismission of his Chaplain, and the formalities of that times Devotion,
before he came to the Scaffold) was rather his inward frame and habit, than
outward ostentation or pomp; from the noble Sentiments whereof (as the Poet
(not unhappily alluding to his Arms. A Lion Rampant, in Field Gules, between
three Crosses) expresses it.)

Our Lyon-like Capel undaunted stood,
Beset with Crosses in a Field of Blood,
As one that affrighted death, rather than affrighted by it. It being very
observable, that a learned Doctor of Physic, present at the Opening and
Embalming of this Lord, and the Duke Hamilton, delivered at a public Lecture;
That the Lord Capel 's was the least heart, and the Duke the greatest that ever
he saw, agreeable to the observation in Philosophy, that the spirits contracted
within the least compass, are the cause of the greatest courage.

Three things are considerable in this incomparable person.

1. His un-interrupted Loyalty, keeping pace with his life; for his last breath
was spent in proclaiming King Charles the Second in the very face of his
enemies, as known to him to be Virtuous, Noble, Gentle, Just, and a great
Prince; A perfect Englishman in his Inclination.

2. His great merit and modesty, whereof King Charles the First writes thus to
his Excellent Queen; There is one that does not yet pretend, that deserves as
well as any, I mean Capel; Therefore I desire Thy assistance to find out
something for him before he ask.

3. The blessing of In answer to his Prayer of Faith in his Letter to his wife
the day he died. God be unto thee better than an Husband, and to my Children
better than a Father. I am sure ^e is able to be so, I am confident he is
graciously pleased to be so.
God upon his Noble but Suffering Family, who was a Husband to his excellent
Widow, and a Father to his hopeful Children, whom not so much their Birth,
Beauty, and Portion (though they were eminent for these) as their Virtues,
Married to the best Blood and Estates in the Land, even when they and the Cause
they suffered for were at the lowest. Its the happiness of good men, though
themselves mis^rable, that their Seed shall be Mighty, and their Generation
Blessed.

A Religious man that H^ used to s^y, i^ he had been asked how many days in
(...) in (...)
used to say (as his Tutor Dr. Pashe, under whom he was bred at Clare-hall in
Cambridge) That when he had kept the Sabbath well, he found the greater

This excellent Personage declaring openly in the House of Lords, That the
Kings Majesty had granted so much for the security and peace of the Kingdom,
that they who asked more, intended the disturbance of it; following his Majesty
to York, and with other Lords attesting the integrity of his Majesty's
Proceedings there in order to Peace; and promising to assist him with his Life
and Fortune against all other pretended Authority, in case it came to a War,
notwithstanding a summons from Westminster, to which he and others made a civil
return; and an impeachment of High Treason for going from Westminster to York
at the Kings Command, whereof he took no notice, settling his Estate in Sir
Edward Capell and other Trustees, who I find compounded for 4706 l. 07s. II d.
Advanced his Majesty between eight and nine hundred Horse, and 12000 l. in
Money and Plate; and if he had had the happyness of being employed in his own
Country, the fatal error of that time, as he was far off in the borders of
Wales, we had heard more of him; however we find him subscribing the
Declarations of the Parliament at Oxford 1643. and the Messages for Peace from
the Army in the field; attending his present Majesty to cornwall, where he was
hurt in two or three several Engagements, once venturing himself very far to
save the Foot: managing the Correspondence between him and the Members at
Westminster, in order to an accommodation with great Caution against their
subtle design, who would divide the Princes Interest and his Fathers;
following him to Scilly, Iersey, and the Fleet then falling to him; whence he
betakes himself home to form the design 1647, 1648. that was then brewing in
the three Kingdoms for the safety and liberty of the Kings Majesty, offering
among others this consideration to a very eminent Person, viz. That this great
truth (that the imprisoning, killing, or deposing of any Supreme Governor who
is Gods Minister in a Nation, is against the Will and Word of God) should be
offered by the Clergy of England to be proved by Scripture; and (if not
regarded) to be sealed with their blood, and with the Joynt-attestation of all
Protestant Churches and Universities, as the great principle of Christian
Doctrine about the Peace and Government of Kingdoms and Nations. And as he
says in his Letter, Feb. 11. 1647. thinking of little else in this world than
what he should do for the preservation of his Sacred Majesty (than whose
sufferings there was nothing greater, he said, except his virtues) as a
Christian, a Subject, an Englishman, a Nobleman, and an obliged Servant; he
caused a Rumor to be spread of his design, which put the General upon calling
him in from his Parole, and upon his frank appearance he was dimissed till the
Parliament should send for him; so being free from his engagement (which was as
sacred to him as his Allegiance) he went to Colchester with all the Horse he
had, and there encouraged the Soldiers by his own example, going with an
Halberd on his shoulder to the watch and guard in his turn, paying six pence or
twelve pence a shot for all the Enemies Bullets the Soldiers could pick up;
Charging the first day of the siege a^ Head-gate (where the Enemy was most
pressing) with a Pike, till the gate could be shut; which at last was but
pinned with his Cane: and after the Murder of Sir Charles Lucas, and Sir
George Lisle, when Whaley and Ewres were sent to tell him and the rest of the
Lords and Gentlemen, that they should have quarter as Prisoners, answering them
himself, That since the condition of those two Gentlemen, and theirs in
reference to that service, were alike, they wished they had all run one hazard;
and they had thanked the General more for saving the Lives of the two Knights,
whom they had already executed, than for the grant of their own.

From Colchester, my Lord was sent to the remotest Prison they could imagine
from his own Country; and thence fetched up to the Tower, where (after a
handsome escape over the water to Lambeth (wherein he was betrayed by the
wretched Water-man that carried him over, who discovered him by his
munificence, the Gold he gave him) he spent not his time in thoughts for his
own Life, but for that of his Majesty's, conjuring a Lord then sitting, to
second their Vote against the Ordinance for Trial of his Majesty, with a
resolute Declaration to all Kings, Princes, States, Potentates, and Nobility,
to be signed by all the Lords, Judges, Lawyers, Divines, Gentry, and people of
England; and this he pressed with most pathetick Arguments, whereof one was
very remarkable, viz. That he understood by his dear-bought experience of those
men of the Enthusiasm, that let them but meet a well-grounded and justificable
Zeal, Courage, and Resolution, greater than their misguided fury to stem the
Torrent of it, they would recollect, and as he said, observing some hesitation
in their proceedings, who found it easier to Conquer a people, than to govern
them against their Interest by a small part of themselves; it being easier to
overthrow another Government, than to settle their own) in an excellent Letter
from the Tower, Ian. 9. 1648. full of a Noble and Heroic Spirit, which he
concludes with this expression, That it grieved him that he could do nothing
else but rub his fingers upon Paper, an employment that fitted not his Genius.
Give (says he) but the people an honorable example, they will follow you, and
vindicate both you and themselves from being as such a silly Generation, that
they should suffer themselves to be cozened out of their good, known, and
established Laws; and in the place of them be imposed upon by Imaginations and
Dreams: to which he added another Letter, Ian. 15. to a very great man in the
Army, every line whereof runs with this vigor, against their proceedings.

YOur Party is small and giddy, the thing its self is monstrous; the Lords and
Commons under whom you fought are against you, all Princes and Protestants will
abhor you, Scotland will be dis-united from England, Ireland will be lost,
Trade will be stopped by all Kings and States with people of so dangerous
principles: all Nations will be ready to invade us, many of the Judges to sit
upon the King will leave you, the Empire of the Sea will be lost, the Nation
will be infamous to Posterity, the Protestant, yea, Christian Religion will
receive a deadly blow to be revenged by all people that profess it: no man is
sure of his life or any thing he has, the most prudent Form of Rules the world
has known will be overthrown; a vast number of people are concerned in those
Rules, no example will be-friend you, all Potentates will be against you, and
the Prince to be murdered, so excellent and knowing in the Art of Government,
so loved, reverenced, and desired, that of all the Princes that that ever ruled
the people, that were so happy in the first sixteen years of his Reign, were
they to choose, would pitch upon him; and which is more, the only person in whom
his enemies may find security, being otherwise like to be torn to pieces by
their Fellow Subjects upon the least change; the express word of the great God
in whose hands you are, is against you (Prove. 8. 15. 1 Samuel 24, 5, 6. Prove. 24.
21, 22. Romans 13. 1 Pet. 2. etc.) the Laws of the Land, your own Judges; yea,
your own Oaths, Protestations, Covenants, Promises, and Pretenses all along fly
in your faces: the Prince, the two Dukes, and the numerous Royal issue should
deter you; the Precipice of endless Wars and Desolations you are at the brink
of, should affright you. Words big with his heart (which you may see at large
at the end of his incomparable Book of Meditations) as appears by this close. I
would to God my life could be a sacrifice to preserve his, could you make it an
expedient to serve that end; truly I would pay you more thanks for it, than you
will allow your self for all your other Merits; from those you have most
obliged, and dye

Your most Affectionate Friend.

How readily he would have dyed for him, we may see in his cheerfulness to dye
with him; for being brought before an High Court of Justice (as it was called)
within a month after, having offered brave Arguments from the Law of the Land,
the Government of the Nation, the nullity of their Court, the benefit of his
Peerage, and the Law that governed the world, meaning the Sword by which he was
promised quarter for life; he heard the Villains ridiculous Sentence with a
nobler spirit than they pronounced it; telling them, That they needed not have
used those formalities to murder him. And March the ninth, the day appointed
for the Assassination, having conjured his Lady in two Letters, That as she had
always hearkened to his advice, so she would then for his sake, and for his dear
Childrens sake especially, to moderate her sorrows and apprehensions for him; I
beseech thee (says the excellent Person) take care of thy health, sorrow not
unsoberly, unusually, but preserve thy self for the benefit of our dear
Children; to whom the occasion of my death will be as much honor, as my death
its self is now sadness. He kept himself in a very cheerful and well-composed
temper of mind, till his parting with his dear Lady, which indeed was the
saddest spectacle, writes a Reverend man, that ever I beheld. In which occasion
he could not choose but confess a little of humane frailty; yet even then he did
not forget both to Comfort and Counsel her, and the rest of his friends,
particularly in blessing the young Lord, whom he commanded not to revenge his
death, though it should be in his power, entreating the like of his Lady;
adding to his Son a Legacy out of David's Psalms, viz. Lord lead me in a plain
path, for Boy (said he) I would have you a Such as all the ^am^ly were observed
to be. Si^ Arthu^ Capel (...) so plain ^ man that a L^dsman co^ing to his (...)

plain honest man, and hate dissimulation.

This being over, which he said was the hardest part of his life in this world;
he dealt seriously with a Reverend Minister about his heart and his sins,
reflecting much upon his Cowardly compliance with (as he called it) and fear of
a prevailing party, his (...) my Lord of Straffords death, and then addressed
himself to the blessed Sacrament (as he would call it emphatically) (after a
private prayer of half an hour long, in an excellent method, very apt
expressions, and a most strong, hearty, and passionate affections for his Sins,
for his Relations, for the King, Church, and State, and for his Enemies) with
great Humility, Zeal, and Devotion, confessing himself much better, stronger,
and ^hearfuller for that heavenly repast: and after that, he desired the
Reverend Person that administered, to pray preparatively to his death, that in
the last action he might behave himself as might be most for Gods glory, for
the indearing of his dead Masters Memory, and for the advancing of his present
Masters Service; and that he might avoid the saying or doing any thing which
might savor either of vanity or sullenness.

Whence ascending the Scaffold in the Pallace-yard Westminster, and forbidding
all Effeminate tears about him, he very Christianly forgave his Enemies and
Executioner; very resolutely declared his Faith (dying in the blessed
Profession as he called it, of the Church of England) and his hope, professing
that he loved good works well, for which he had been suspected a Papist, but
his Anchor-hold, which was Jesus, loved him, and gave himself for him He very
courageously owned his late Masters Cause and Person, whom he declared there
(after a consideration he had, being a very excellent Scholar,) of all the
Images of Princes that ever were, that he was the most virtuous and sufficient
Prince known in the world; very heartily prayed for the Restoration of his
then Sovereign, his people, and the peoples Obedience, Peace, and Prosperity
under him, and very solemnly desiring the peoples earnest, but secret prayer
(with holy Ejaculations, that God Almighty would stench that issue of Blood;
adding, This will not do the business, God Almighty find some way to do it:)
And encouraging the Executioner to strike boldly, with noble expressions and a
generous reward, having ordered his body to be delivered to his Servant,
unstripped, he dyed with one blow, the great Pattern of true Christian
Nobility, doing his Majesty much service in his exemplary life, and like
Sampson, more in his Heroic death. The blond of Holy Martyrs is the seed of
their Cause.

THE Life and Death OF JOHN Lord BIRON, With his four Brothers.
A True Englishman of a French Extract, that had all the spirit of the great
Biron of France, but none of his fury; honest Sir John Biron (as Kings called
him, the Son of honest Sir John Biron, trusted with the peace of his Country
Notingham-shire, the 10 th. of King Charles I. as Sheriff, and of the Kingdom
the 17 th. as a Commander; he brought a great appearance to his Majesty's
Standard at Nottingham, and a round sum to his supply at Shrewsbery: He went
off upon the Vote about the Militia of the Kingdom from Parliament; and
indeared himself by And his giving the King warning to look to the Magazines of
each County, he finding not (...) barrels of Powder in his own (so dangerously
complying some were with that enemy) at the Scots Invast^ on.
bringing in the Arms and Ammunition of Nottingham-shire to the King. The
States committed to him the whole care of their Ordnance and Ammunition; and
therefore his Majesty commended to him the Lieutenancy of the Tower of London;
he had declared himself so freely against the Conspiracy, that the Parliament
would not be quiet till he had quitted his place to that old Low Country
Soldier, Sir John Coniers, being dismissed by his Majesty with this Character,
That he was a person against whom there could be no exceptions.

From Nottingham-shire, he passed with some Troops to countenance the
Commission of Array in other Counties, and particularly in Oxfordshire, to
secure the University from the Rebels; and the Scholars and their Plates for
his Majesty, when assaulted by the Forces of Northampton, and betrayed by the
Town of Brackley, so that he lost his Carriages and Cabinet, he writes to Mr.
Clark, of Craughton, in whose Custody they were, to restore them; Which if you
do (says he) I shall represent it to his Majesty as sty as an acceptable
service; if not, assure your self I shall find a time with advantage to re-pay
my self out of your Estate, and consider that as Rebellion is a weed of an
hasty growth, so it will decay as suddenly; and that there will be a time for
the Kings Loyal Subjects to repair their losses sustained by Rebels and
Traitors. Upon the sending of which Letter to the Parliament, and their
proclaiming him and his Adherents Traitors for their Allegiance to their
Sovereign, he marched to Worcester, a very commodiously situated place, taking
it in, and Garrisoning it, decoying thither the Lord Say, Colonel Nath. Fines,
and Sandys, into a trap by a mistake of Prince Rupert, for the Earl of Essex;
and gaining the first Victory and Reputation to his Majesty's Side and Party,
which was judged never able either to form an Army, or to aim at Victory.

How valiantly and warily he led on the Kings As he did at Roundway down.
Horse at the first Newbery Fight, when Col. Middleton protested there was no
dealing with Biron, who would give no advantage is well known; and how
prudently and industriously he pursued his Majesty's Interest about Wales,
where he was Field Marshall General, may be guessed by the Command given him of
that Important Place, both for passage into Ireland, and Westchester, and power
over the Circuit of four Counties for Contribution, where his Honorable and
Obliging Deportment, his judicious Works, his frequent Sallies, his great Word,

most Storms in Person, his great Art of keeping both Town and Garrison,
contented with Cats, Dogs, yea, and those failing, with but one meal in three
days, while there was any hope of Relief, refusing nine summons, and not
answering the tenth, till his messenger returned with assurance, that there was
no hope of relief, when he yielded upon the most honorable terms for himself
and the whole Garrison, that were given in England, except those he afterward
gained at Caernarvon, having endured a long and gallant Siege; the benefit
whereof he enjoyed, with a notable escape or two, to rally the decayed and
scattered spirits of the Kingdom into further attempts for his Majesty,
traveling invisibly and with incredible speed from place to place for a year
together, not sleeping four nights together in a place for a year, till the
fatal drowsiness hanging over the Kingdom, put him upon taking his rest too,
and withdrawing to France to follow his ingenious Studies, which the War had
interrupted in the course, but not in the effect of them; his admirable

Regum subditi and amici. THE Life and Death OF Dr. JOHN BRAMHALL, Lord
Arch^bishop of Armagh, etc.
HE was bred in Cambridge, in Sydney College under Mr. Hulet, a grave and a
worthy man, and he showed himself not only a fruitful Plant by his great
progress in his Studies, but made him another return of gratitude, taking care
to provide him a good Employment in Ireland, where he then began to be greatly
interested. It was spoken as an honor to Augustus Caesar, that he gave his
Tutor an honorable Funeral; and Marcus Antonius erected a Statue unto his; and
Gratian the Emperor made his Master Ausonius to be Consul: And our worthy
Primate, knowing the obligation which they pass upon us, who do Obstetricari
gravidae animae, help the parturient Soul to bring forth fruit according to its
seminal powers, was careful, not only to reward the industry of such persons so
useful to the Church in the cultivating infantes plamarum, young Plants, whose
joints are to be stretched and made straight, but to demonstrate that his
Scholar knew how to value his Learning, when he knew so well how to reward the
Teacher.

Having passed the course of his studies in the University, and done his
Exercise with that Applause, which is usually the reward of pregnant Wits and
hard, he was removed into Yorkshire; where first in the City of York he was an
assiduous Preacher, but by the disposition of the Divine Providence, he
happened to be engaged at North-Alerton in Disputation with three pragmatical
Romish Priests of the Jesuits Order, whom he so much worsted in the Conference,
and so shamefully disadvantaged by the evidence of the Truth, represented
wisely and learnedly, that the famous Primate of York Archbishop Matthews, a
learned and an excellent Prelate, and most worthy Preacher, hearing of that
Triumph, sent for him, and made him his Chaplain; in whose service he continued
until the death of the Primate, but in that time had given so much Testimony of
his great Dexterity in the Conduct of Ecclesiastical and Civil Affairs, that he
grew dear to his Master. In that employment he was made Prebendary of York, and
then of Rippon; the Dean of which Church, having made him his Sub-Dean, he
managed the Affairs of the Church so well, that he soon acquired a greater
same, and entered into the possession of many hearts, and admiration to those
many more that knew him. There, and at his Parsonage he continued long to do
the duty of a learned and good Preacher, and by his Wisdom, Eloquence, and
Deportment, so gained the affections of the Nobility, Gentry, and Commons of
that Country, that as at his return thither upon the Restoration of his most
sacred Majesty, he knew himself obliged enough, and was so kind as to give
them a visit, so they by their coming in great numbers to meet him, their
joyful Reception of him, their great caressing of him while he was there, their
forward hopes to enjoy him as their Bishop, their trouble at his departure,
their unwillingness to let him go away, give signal Testimonies that they were
wise and kind enough to understand and value his great worth. But while he
lived there, he was like a Diamond in the dust, (or Lucius Quintius at the
plough) his low fortune covered a most valuable person, till he came to be
discovered by Sir Thomas Wentworth Lord President of York, whom we all knew for
his great Excellencies, and his great, but glorious Misfortunes. This rare
person espied the great abilities of Dr. Bramhall, and made him his Chaplain,
and brought him into Ireland, as one whom he believed would prove the most fit
Instrument to serve in that design, which for two years before his Arrival
here, he had greatly meditated and resolved the Reformation of Religion, and
the Reparation of the broken fortunes of the Church. The Complaints were many,
the Abuses great, the Causes of the Church vastly numerous, but as fast as they
were brought in, so fast were they referred back by the Lord Deputy to Dr.
Bramhall, who by his indefatigable pains, great sagacity, perpetual
watchfulness, daily and hourly Consultations, reduced things to a more
tolerable condition than they had been left in by Schismatical principles of
some and unjust Prepossessions of others for many years before. For at the
Reformation, the Popish Bishops and Priests seemed to conform, and did so, that
keeping their Bishoprics they might enrich their kindred, and dilapidate the
Revenues of the Church; which, by pretended-Offices, false Informations,
Fee-farms at contemptible Rents, and ungodly Alienations, were made low as
Poverty it self, and unfit to minister to the needs of them that served the
Altar, or the noblest purposes of Religion; for Hospitality decayed, and the
Bishops were easily to be oppressed by those that would, and they complained,
but for a long time had no helper, till God raised that glorious Instrument the
Earl of Strafford, who brought over with him as great Affections to the Church,
and to all public Interests, and as admirable abilities as ever before his
time did invest and adorn any of the Kings Vicegerents: and God fitted his hand
with an Instrument good, as his skill was great. For the first specimen of his
Abilities and Diligence in the recovery of some lost Tithes, being represented
to his late Majesty of blessed and glorious Memory, it pleased his Majesty upon
the death of Bishop Downham, to advance the Doctor the Bi^^oprick of Derry,
which he not only adorned with an excellent spirit, and a wise Government, but
did more than double the Revenue, not by taking away any thing from them to
whom it was due, but by resuming something of the Churches Patrimony, which by
undue means was detained in unsitting hands; But his care was beyond his
Diocese, and his zeal broke out to warm all his Brethren; and though by reason
of the favor and Piety of King James, the escheated Counties were well provided
for their Tithes, yet the Bishop^icks were not so well, till the Primato, then
Bishop of Derry, by the favor of the Lord Lieutenant, and his own incessant and
assiduous labor and wise Conduct, brought in diverse Impropriations, cancelled
many unjust Alienations, and did restore them to a condition much more
tolerable; for he raised them above contempt, yet they were not near to envy;
but he knew there could not in all times be wanting too many that envied to the
Church every degree of Prosperity: So Judas did to Christ, the expense of
Ointment; and so Dionisius told the Priest when himself stole the Golden Cloak
from Apollo, and gave him one of Arcadian homespun, that it was warmer for him
in Winter, and colder in Summer. And so ever since the Church by Gods blessing,
and the favor of Religious Kings and Princes, and pious Nobility, has been
endowed with fair Revenues; inimicus homo, the enemy has not been wanting by
pretenses of Religion, to take away Gods portion from the Church, as if his
word were intended as an Instrument to rob his Houses.

But when the Israelites were governed by a (...), and God was their King, and
Moses his Lieutenant, and things were of his management, he was pleased, by
making great provisions for them that ministered in the service of the
Tabernacle, to consign this truth for ever; That Men as they love God, at the
same rate are to make provisions for his Priests. But this to no other end,
than to represent upon what Religious grounds the then Bishop of Derry did,
with so much care and assiduous labor endeavor to restore the Church of
Ireland to that splendour and fullness, which did much conduce to the honor of
God and of Religion. This wise Prelate rarely well understood it, and having
the same advantage and blessing as we have now, a Gracious King and a
Lieutenent, Patron of Religion and the Church, he improved the ^^posita
Pietatis, Tract. 25. in Sl. Matthew.
as Origin calls them, The Gages of Piety, which the Religion of the ancient
Princes and Nobles of this Kingdom had bountifully given, to such a comfortable
competency, that though there be place for present and future piety to enlarge
it, yet no man has reason to be discouraged in his duty; insomuch, that as I
have heard from a most worthy hand, that at his going into England, he gave
account to the Archbishop of Canterbury of 30000 l. a year, in the recovery of
which, he was greatly and principally instrumental. But the Goods of this World
are called Waters by Solomon; stolen waters are sweet, and they are too
unstable to be stopped: Some of these Waters did run back from their Channel,
and return to another Course than God and the Laws intended, yet his labors
and pious Counsels were not the less acceptable to God and to good Men; and
therefore by a thankful and honorable recognition, the Convocation of the
Church of Ireland has transmitted in Record to Posterity, their deep
resentment of his singular services, and great abilities in this whole affair.
And this honor will for ever remain to that Bishop of Derry; he had a
Zer^bbabel, who repaired the Temple, and restored its beauty; but he was the
Ioshuah, the High Priest, who under him ministered this blessing to the
Congregations of the Lord. But his care was not determined in the exterior part
only and accessaries of Religion, he was careful, he was prosperous in the
interior, to reduce that Divine and Excellent Service of our Church to public
and constant Exercise, to Unity and Devotion, and to cause the Articles of the
Church of England to be accepted, as the rule of public Confessions and
Persuasions here, that they might be populus unius labii, of one Heart and of
one Lip, building up our hopes of heaven upon a most holy Faith; and taking
away that Shibboleth which made this Church lisp too undecently, or rather, in
some little degree, to speak the Speech of Ashdod, and not the Language of
Canaan; and the excellent and wise pains he took in this particular, no man can
demonstrate or reproach, but he that is not willing to confess that the Church
of England is the best Reformed Church in the World. God by the prosperity of
his labors, and a blessed effect, gave testimony, not only of the piety and
wisdom of his purposes, but that he loves to bless a wise instrument, when it
is vigorously exerted in a wise and religious labor. He overcame the
difficulty, in defiance of all such pretenses as were made even from Religion
it self, to obstruct the better procedure of real and material Religion. These
were great things, and matter of great envy, and like the Fiery Eruptions of
Vesuvius, might with the very Ashes of Consumption have buried another man. At
first indeed, as his blessed Master, most Holy Jesus had, so he also had his
annum acceptabilem. At first the product was nothing but great admiration at
his stupendous parts, and wonder at his mighty diligence, and observation of
his unusual zeal in so good and great things: But this quickly passed into the
natural Daughters of Envy, Suspicion, and Detraction, the spirit of Obloquy and
Slander. His zeal for recovering of the Church Revenues, was called Oppression
and Rapine, Covetousness and Injustice; his care of reducing Religion to wise
and justifiable Principles, was called Popery and Arminianism, and I know not
what names; which signify what the Authors are pleased to mean, and the People
to construe and to hate. The intermedial prosperity of his person and fortune,
which he had as an earnest of a greater reward to so well meant labors, was
supposed to be the production of illiberal arts and ways of getting; and the
necessary refreshment of his wearied spirits, which did not always supply all
his needs, and were sometimes less than the permissions even of prudent
charity, they called Intemperance: Dederunt enim malum Motelli Naevio^ poetae;
their own surmises were the three Bills of Accusation, and the splendour of his
great (...), or doing of good works, was the great probation of all their
calumnies. But if Envy be the Accuser, what can be the Defenses of Innocence?

Saucior invidiae morsu, quaerenda medola est,
Dic quibus in terris sentiet aeger opem?
Our B.S. knowing the unsatisfiable angers of Men, if their Money or Estates
were meddled with, refused to divide an Inheritance amongst Brethren: It was not
to be imagined, that this great person (invested, as all his Brethren were,
with the infirmities of Mortality, and yet employed in dividing, and
recovering, and apportioning of Lands) should be able to bear all that reproach
which jealousy, and suspicion, and malicious envy, could invent against him.
But (...), said Sophocles: And so did he, the affrightments brought to his
great fame andreputation, made him to walk more warily, and do justly, and walk
prudently, and conduct his affairs by the measures of the Laws as far as he
understood, and indeed that was a very great way: But there was aperta
Iustitia, clausa Manut, Justice was open, but his Hand was shut, and though
every Slanderer could tell a Story, yet none could prove that ever he received
a Bribe to blind his Eyes, to the value of a Pair of Gloves. It was his own
expression, when he gave Glory to God who had preserved him Innocent. But
because every man's Cause is right in his own Eyes, it was hard for him so to
acquit himself, that in the Intrigues of Law, and Difficult Cases, some of his
enemies should not seem (when they were heard alone) to speak reason against.
But see the greatness of Faith and Prudence, and how greatly God stood with
him, when the numerous Armies of vexed people, Turba gravis paci placidaeque
inimica quieti, heaped up Catalogues of Accusations, when the Parliament of
Ireland, imitating the violent Procedures of the then disordered English; when
this glorious Patron was taken from his Head, and he was disrobed of his great
defenses; when the Petitions were invited, and Accusations furnished, and
Calumny was rewarded and managed with Art and Power, when there was above two
hundred Petitions put in against him, and himself denied leave to answer by
Word of Mouth; when he was long Imprisoned and Treated, so that a guilty man
would have broken into affrightment, and pitiful, and low considerations; yet
then he standing almost alone, like Callimachus at Marathon, invested with
Enemies, and covered with Arrows, defended himself beyond all the powers of
Guiltiness, even with the defenses of Truth, and the bravery of Innocence, and
answered the Petitions in Writing sometimes twenty in a day, with so much
Clearness, Evidence of Truth, Reallity of Fact, and Testimony of Law, that his
very Enemies were ashamed and convinced; they found that they had done like
Aesops Viper, they licked the File till their Tongues bled, but himself was
wholly invulnerable. They were therefore forced to leave their Muster-rolls,
and decline their Particulars, and fall to their (...), to accuse him for going
about to subvert the Fundamental Laws; the way by which great Strafford and
Canterbury fell; which was a device, when all reasons failed, to oppress the
Enemy by the bold Affirmation of a Conclusion they could not prove; they did
like those Gladiatores, whom the Romans called Re^iaries, when they could not
Stab their Enemies with their Daggers, they threw Nets over him, and covered
him with a general mischief. But the Martyr King Charles the First, of most
Glorious and Eternal Memory, seeing so great a Champion likely to be oppressed
with numbers and despair, sent what rescue he could, his Royal Letter for his
Bayl, which was hardly granted to him; and when it was, it was upon such hard
terms, that his very delivery was a persecution. So necessary it was for them,
who intended to do mischief to the public, to take away the strongest Pillars
of the House. This thing I remark, to acquit this great man from the tongue of
slander which had so boldly spoken, that it was certain some thing would stick,
yet was impotent and unarmed, that it could not kill that great same which his
greater worthiness had procured him. It was said of Hipp^sus the Pythagorean,
that being asked how and what he had done; he answered, Nondum nihil, neque
enim mihi adhuc invidetur; I have done nothing yet, for no man envies me. He
that does great things, cannot avoid the tongues and teeth of envy: But if
Calumnies must pass for Evidences, the bravest Hero's must always be the most
reproached persons in the world.

Nascitur Aetolicus, pravam ingeniosus ad omne;
Qui facere assuerat, patriae non degeneratis,
Candida de nigris and de candentibus atra.
Every thing can have an ill name and an ill sense put upon it; but God, who
takes care of Reputations, as he does of lives, by the order of his providence
confutes the slander, ut memoria justorum sit in benedictionibus, that the
Memory of the Righteous might be embalmed with honor: And so it happened to this
great man, for by a public warranty, by the concurrent consent of both Houses
of Parliament, the libellous Petitions against him, the false Records and
public Monuments of injurious shame were cancelled, and he was restored in
integrum, to that fame where his great labors and just procedures had first
Estated him; which though it was but justice, yet it was also such honor, that
it is greater than the virulence of tongues, his worthiness and their envy had
armed against him. But yet the great Scene of troubles was but newly opened, I
shall not refuse to speak yet more of his troubles, as remembering that St.
Paul, when he discourses of the glory of the Saints departed, he tells more of
their Sufferings, than of their Prosperities, as being that Laboratory and
Crysable in which God makes his Servants Vessels of honor to his glory. The
storm quickly grew high, and transitum a linguis ad gladios, and that was
indeed (...), Iniquity had put on Arms, when it is armata nequitia, then a man
is hard put to it. The Rebellion breaking out, the Bishop went to his Charge at
Derry, and because he was within the defense of the Walls, the execrable
Traitor Sir Phelim O Neal, laid a snare to bring him to a dishonorable death;
for he wrote a Letter to the Bishop, pretended intelligence between them,
desired that according to their former agreement, such a Gate might be
delivered to him. The Messenger was not advised to be Cautious, not at all
instructed in the Art of Secrecy, for it was intended, that he should be
searched, intercepted, and hanged for ought they cared: but the Arrow was shot
against the Bishop, that he might be accused for base conspiracy, and dye with
shame and sad dishonor. But here God manifested his mighty care of his
Servants, he was pleased to send into the heart of the Messenger such
affrightment, that he directly ran away with the Letter, and never came near
the Town to deliver it. This story was published by Sir Phelim himself, who
added, that if he could have thus ensnared the Bishop, he had good assurance
the Town should have been his own: Sed bonitas Dei praevalitura est super omnem
v^alitionem hominis. The goodness of God is greater than all the malice of men,
and nothing so could prove how dear that Sacred Life was to God, as his rescue
from the dangers. Stantia non poterant tecta probare Deos: To have kept him in
a warm house had been nothing, unless the Roof had fallen upon his Head; that
rescue was a remark of Divine Favor and Providence. But it seems Sir Phelim's
Treason against this worthy man had a correspondent in Town, and it broke out
speedily; for what they could not effect by a malicious stratagem, they did in
part by open force; they turned the Bishop out of Town, and upon trifling and
unjust pretenses, searched his Carriages, and took what they pleased, till they
were ashamed to take more: They did worse than Divorce him from his Church, for
in all the Roman Divorces, they said, Tuas tibi res habeto, Take your Goods and
be gone; but Plunder was Religion then. However, though the usage was sad, yet
it was recompensed to him, by taking Sanctuary in Oxford, where he was
graciously received by that most incomparable and divine Prince; but having
served the King in Yorkshire by his Pen, and by his Counsels, and by his
Interests, returned back to Ireland; where under the excellent Conduct of his
Grace the now Lord Lieutenant, he ran the risque and fortune of oppressed
virtue. But God having still resolved to afflict us, the good man was forced
into the fortune of the Patriarchs to leave his Country and his Charges, and
seek for safety and bread in a strange Land, for so the Prophets were used to
do, wandering up and down in Sheeps Clothing, but poor as they were, the world
was not worthy of them; and this worthy Man, despising the shame, took up his
Cross, and followed his Master.

Exilium causa ipsa jubet sibi dulce videri,
Et de siderium dulce levat patriae.
He was not ashamed to suffer where the Cause was honorable and glorious; but
so God provided for the needs of his banished, and sent a man who could
minister comfort to the afflicted, and courage to the persecuted, and
resolutions to the tempted, and strength to that Religion for which they all
suffered. And here indeed this great Man was Triumphant, this was one of the
last and best Scenes of his life: (...) The Last Days are the best Witnesses of
Man. But so it was, that he stood in public and brave defense for the Doctrine
and Discipline of the Church of England: First, by his sufferings and great
example, for verbis tantum Philosophari, non est Doctoris sed Histrionis. To
talk well and not to do bravely, is for a Comaedian, not a Divine. But this
great man did both; he suffered his own Calamity with great Courage, and by his
Wise Discourses strengthened the hearts of others. For there wanted not
diligent Tempters in the Church of Rome, who (taking advantage of the
afflictions of his Sacred Majesty, in which state men commonly suspect every
thing, and like men in Sickness are willing to change from Side to Side, hoping
for ease and finding none) flew at the Royal Game, and hoped to draw away the
King from that Religion, which his most Royal Father, the best Man, and wisest
Prince in the World, had Sealed with the best Blood in Christendom; and which
Himself Sucked in with his Education, and had Confirmed by Choice and Reason,
and Confessed Publicly and Bravely, and has since Restored Prosperously.
Millitiere was the man, witty and bold enough, to attempt a zealous and a
foolish Undertaking; and addressed himself with Ignoble, indeed but Witty Arts,
to persuade the King to leave what was dearer to him than his Eyes. It is true,
it was a Wave dashed against the Rock, and an Arrow shot against the Sun; it
could not reach him, but the Bishop of Derry turned it also, and made it fall
upon the Shooters head; for he made so Ingenious, so Learned, and so Acute
Reply to that Book; he so discovered the Errors of the Roman Church, retorted
the Arguments, stated the Questions, demonstrated the Truth, and shamed their
Procedures, that nothing could be a greater Argument of the Bishops Learning,
great Parts, deep Judgment, quickness of Apprehension, and sincerity in the
Catholic and Apostolic Faith, or of the Follies and prevarications of the
Church of Rome. He wrote no Apologies for himself, though it were much to be
wished, that as Iunius wrote his own Life, or Moses his own Story, so we might
have understood from himself, how great things God had done for him and by him;
but all that, he permitted to God, and was silent in his own defenses.
Gloriosus enim est injuriam tacendo fugere, quam respondendo superare. ut when
the Honor and Conscience of his King, and the Interest of True Religion was at
Stake, the Fire burned within him; and at last he spoke with his Tongue, he
cried out like the Son of Craesus, (...), Take heed, and meddle not with the
King; his Person is too sacred, and Religion too dear to him, to be assaulted
by vulgar h^^ds. In short, he acquitted himself in this affair with so much
Truth and Piety, Learning and Judgment, that in these Papers, his memory will
last unto very late succeeding Generations. But this Reverend Prelate found a
Nobler Adversary, and a Braver Scene for his Contention; he found that the
Roman Priests, being wearied and baffled by the wise Discourses, and pungent
Arguments of the English Divines, had studiously declined to Dispute any more
the particular Questions against us, but fell at last upon a General Charge,
imputing to the Church of England the great Crime of Schism; and by this they
thought they might with most probability deceive unwary and unskillful Readers;
for they saw the Schism, and they saw that we had left them, and because they
considered not the Causes, they resolved to outface us in the Charge. But now
it was that dignum nactus Argumentum, having an Argument fit to employ his
great abilities,

Consecrat hic praeful calamum calamique labores,
Ante aras Domino laeta trophaea suo.
The Bishop now dedicates his labors to the service of God, and and of his
Church, undertook the Question, and in a full Discourse proves the Church of
Rome, not only to be guilty of the Schism, by making it necessary to depart
from them, but they did actuate the Schisms, and themselves made the first
separation in the great point of the Popes Supremacy, which was the Palladium,
for which they principally contended. He made it appear, that the Popes of Rome
were Usurpers of the Rights of Kings and Bishops, that they brought in new
Doctrines in every Age, that they imposed their own devices upon all
Christendom as Articles of Faith, that they prevaricated the Doctrine of the
Apostles, that the Church of England returned to her Primitive Purity, that She
joined with Christ and his Apostles, that She agreed in all the sentiments of
the Primitive Church. He stated the Questions so Wisely, and conducted them so
Prudently, and handled them so Learnedly, that I may truly say, they were never
more materially confuted by any man since the Questions so unhappily have
disturbed Christendom. Verum hoc eos male ussit: And they finding themselves
smitten under the fifth Rib, set up an old Champion of their own, a Goliath to
fight against the Armies of Israel: The old bishop of Chalcedon, known to many
of us, replied to this excellent Book, but was so answered by a Rejoinder made
by the Lord Bishop of Derry, in which he so pressed the former Arguments,
refuted the Cavils, brought in so many impregnable Authorities and Probations,
and added so many moments and weights to his discourse; the pleasure of the
Reading of the Book would be greatest, if the profit to the Church of God were
not greater.

Flumina tum lactis, tum flumina nectaris ibant,
Flavaque de viridi stillabant ilice mell^.
For so Sampsons Riddle was again expounded; Out of the Strong came Meat, and
out of the Eater came Sweetness. His Arguments were strong, and the Eloquence
was sweet and delectable; and though there start up another Combatant against
him, yet he had only the honor to fall by the hands of Hector. Still haeret
lateri lethalis arundo; the Headed Arrow went in so far, that it could not be
drawn out, but the Barbed Steel stuck behind. And when ever men will desire to
be satisfied in those great Questions, the Bishop of Derry's Book shall be his
Oracle. I will not insist upon his excellent Writings, but it is known every
where with what Piety and Acumen he wrote against the Manichean Doctrine of
Fatal Necessity, which a late witty Man had pretended to adorn with a new
Vizor; but this excellent person washed off the Cerusse, and the Meretricious
Paintings, rarely well asserted the Aeconomy of the Divine Providence, and
having once more triumphed over his Adversary, Plenus victoriarum and
trophaeorum, betook himself to the more agreeable attendance upon the Sacred
Offices, and usually and wisely discoursed of the Sacred Rite of Confirmation,
Imposed Hands upon the most Illustrious, the Dukes of York and Slocester, and
the Princess Royal, and Ministered to them the promise of the Holy Spirit,
Ministerially established them in the Religion and Service of the Holy Jesus.
And one thing more I shall remark, that at his leaving those parts, upon the
Kings Return, some of the Remonstrant Ministers of the Low Countries coming to
take their leave of this great Man, and desiring that by his means the Church
of England would be kind to them, he had reason to grant it, because they were
learned men, and in many things of a most excellent belief; yet he reproved
them and gave them Caution against it, that they approached too near and gave
too much countenance to the great and dangerous errors of the Socinians. He
thus having served God and the King abroad, God was pleased to return to the
King, and to us all, as in the days of old, we sung the song of David, In
convertendo captivitatem (...), when King David and all his servants returned
to Jerusalem.

This great person having trod in the Wine Press, was called to drink, and as
an honorary Reward of his great services and abilities, was chosen Primate of
this National Church, in which we are to look upon him, as the King and the
Kings great (...) gerent did, as a person concerning whose abilities the world
had too great Testimony ever to make a doubt. It is true, he w^^ in the
declension of his age and health; but his very rui^^^ (...) goodly; and they
who saw the broken heaps of Pompey's The^^^ and the crushed Obelisks, and the
old face of beauteous Philaenium, could not but admire the disordered glories
of such magnificent Structures, which were venerable in their very dust. He
ever was used to overcome all difficulties, only mortality was too hard for
him; but still his Virtues and his Spirit was immortal; he took great care, and
still had new and noble designs, and propsed to himself admirable things. He
governed his Province with great justice and sincerity; Vnus amplo consulens
pastor gregi,
Somnos tuetur omnium solus, Vigil.


And had this Remark in all his Government, that as he was a great hater of
Sacrilege, so he professed himself a public enemy to non-residence, and would
declare wisely and religiously against it, allowing it no case, but of
necessity, or the greater good of the Church. There are great things spoken of
his Predecessor St. Patrick, that he founded 700. Churches and Religious
Convents, that he ordained 5000. Priests, and with his own hands Consecrated
350. Bishops. How true this story is, I know not; but we are all witnesses that
the late Primate did by an extraordinary contingency of Providence, in one day
Consecrate two Archbishops, and ten Bishops, and benefit to almost all the
Churches in Ireland, and was greatly instrumental to the Re-endowments of the
whole Clergy; and in the greatest abilities and incomparable industry, was
inferior to none of his most glorious Antecessors. Since the Canonization of
Saints came into the Church, we find no Irish Bishop Canonized, except St.
Laurence of Dublin, and St. Milachias of Down; indeed Richard of Armagh's
Canonization was propounded, but not effected; but the Character which was
given of that Learned Primate by Trithemius, does exactly fit this our late
Father; Vir in Divinis Scripturis eruditus, sccularis philosophiae jurisque
Canonici non ignarus, Clarus ingenio, Sermon Scholasticus, in declamandis
Sermonibus ad populum excellentis industriae: He was learned in the Scriptures,
skilled in secular Philosophy, and not unknowing in the Civil and Canon Laws;
he was of an excellent Spirit, a Scholar in his discourses, an early and
industrious Preacher to the people. And, as if there were a more particular
sympathy between their souls, our Primate had so great a Veneration to his
Memory, that he purposed, if he had lived, to have restored his Monument in
Dundalke, which Time, or Impiety, or Unthankfulness, had either omitted or
destroyed. So great a lover he was of all true inherent worth, that he loved it
in the very memory of the dead, and to have such great examples to intuition
and imitation of Posterity. At his coming to the Primacy, he knew he should at
first espy little, besides the Ruins of Discipline, a Harvest of Thorns and
Heresies, prevailing in the hearts of the people, the Churches possessed by
Wolves and Intruders, men's hearts greatly estranged from true Religion; and
therefore he set himself to weed the Field of the Church, he treated the
Adversaries sometimes sweetly, sometimes he confuted them learnedly, sometimes
he rebuked them sharply. He visited his Charges diligently, and in his own
person, not by Proxies and instrumental Deputations: Quaerens non nostra, sed
nos and quae sunt Jesus Christi; He designed nothing that we knew of, but the
Redintegration of Religion, the Honor of God, the King, the restoring of
collapsed Discipline, and the Renovation of Faith, and the service of God in
the Churches. And still he was indefatigable, and, even as the last Scene of
his life, intended to take a Regal Visitation. Quid enim vultis me otiosum a
Domino comprehendi? said one; he was not willing that God should take him
unimployed: But good man, he felt his Tabernacle ready to fall in pieces, and
could go no further, for God would have no more work done by that hand; he
therefore espying this, put his House in order, and had lately visited his
Diocese, and done what he then could to put his Charge in order; for he had a
good while since received the sentence of death within himself, and knew he was
shortly to render an account of his Stewardship; he therefore upon a brisk
Alarm of death, which God sent him the 1662.
last January. made his Will; in which, besides the prudence and presence of
Spirit, manifested in making a just and wise settlement of his Estate, and
Provisions for his Descendants, at midnight, and in the trouble of his sickness
and circumstances of addressing death, still kept a special sentiment, and made
confession of Gods admirable mercies, and gave thanks that God had permitted
him to live to see the blessed Restoration of his Majesty, and the Church of
England, confessed his faith to be the same as ever, gave praises to God that
he was born and bred up in this Religion, and prayed God, and hoped he should
die in the Communion of this Church, which he declared to be the most pure and
Apostolical Church in the world. He prayed to God to pardon his frailties and
infirmities, relied upon the mercies of God, and the Merits of Jesus Christ,
and with a singular sweetness resigned up his soul into the hands of his
Redeemer. But God, who is the great Choragas and Master of the Scenes of Life
and Death, was not pleased then to draw the Curtains; there was an Epilogue to
his life, yet to be acted and spoken. He returned to actions and life, and went
on in methods of the same procedures as before; was desirous still to establish
the Affairs of the Church, complained of some disorders which he purposed to
redress, girt himself to the work; but though his spirit was willing, yet his
flesh was weak; and as the Apostles in the Vespers of Christ's Passion, so he in
the Eve of his own dissolution, was heavy not to sleep, but heavy unto death,
and looked for the last warnning, which seized on him in the midst of his
business; and though it was sudden, yet it could not be unexpected, or
unprovided by surprise, and therefore could be no more than (...) which
Augustus used to wish unto himself, a civil and well-natured death, without the
amazement of troublesome circumstances, or the great cracks of a falling house,
or the convulsions of impatience. Seneca tells us, that Bassus Anfidius was
wont to say, Sperare se nullum lorem esse in illo extremo anhelita, si tamen
esset, habere aliquantums in ipsa brevitate solatii. He hoped that the pain of
the vast dissolution were little or none; or if they were, it was full of
comfort, that they could be short. It happened so to this Excellent Man, his
passive fortune had been abundantly tried before, and therefore there was the
less need of it now; his active Graces had been abundantly demonstrated by the
great and good things he did, and therefore his last Scene was not so
laborious; but God called him away something after the manner of Moses, which
the Jews express by Osculum Oris Dei, The Kiss of Gods Month; that is, as death
indeed fore-signified but gentle and serene, and without temptation.

To sum up all, he was a Wise Prelate, a Learned Doctor, a Just Man, a True
Friend, a great Benefactor to others, a thankful Beneficiary where he was
obliged himself: He was a faithful Servant to his Masters, a Loyal Subject to
the King, a zealous Assertor of his Religion, against Popery on the one side,
and Fanaticism on the other. The practice of his Religion was not so much in
Forms and exterior Ministries, though he was a great observer of all the
public Rites and Ministries of the Church, as it was doing good for others. He
was like Myson, whom the Scythian Anacharsis so greatly praised, (...) he
governed his Family well he gave to all their due of maintenance, and duly, he
did great benefit to Mankind; he had the fate of the Apostle St. Paul, he
passed through evil report and good report, as a deceiver and yet true. He was
a man of great business, and great resort: Semper aliquis Cydonis domo, as the
Corinthian said, there was always somebody in Cydons house. He was (...) he
divided his Life into labor, and his Book; he took care of Churches when he
was alive, and even after his death, having left five hundred pounds, for the
repair of his Cathedral of Armagh, and St. Peter's Church in Drogheda. He was an
excellent Scholar, and rarely well accomplished; first instructed to great
excellency by natural parts, and then consummated by Study and Experience.
Melancthon was used to say, that himself was a Logician, Pomeranus a
Grammarian, Iustus Jonas an Orator, but that Luther was all these. It was
greatly true of him, that the single perfections, which make many men eminent,
were united in this Primate, and made him Illustrious.

At, at, Quintilium perpetuus sopa
Vrget, Cui pudor and justitiae sorer
Incorrupta fides, nudaque veritas,
Quando ullum invenient parem!
It will be hard to find his equal in all things: Fort ass tanquam Phaenix
anno quingente simo nascitur (that I may use the words of Seneca) nec est mirum
ex intervallo magna generari mediocria, and in turbam nascentia saepe fortuna
producit, eximia vero varitate commendat. For in him was visible the great
lines of Hookers Judiciousness, of Jewels Learning, of the Acuteness of Bishop
Andrews. He was in more great things than one; and as one said of Phidias he
could not only make excellent Statues of Ivory, but he could work in Stone and
Brass. He showed his Equanimity in Poverty, and his Justice in Riches; he was
useful in his Country, and profitable in his Banishment. For as Paraeus was at
Anvilla, Luther at Wittenburg, St. Athanasius and St. Chrysostom in their
Banishment, St. Jerome in his Retirement at Bethlehem, they were Oracles to
them that needed it; so was he in Holland and France, where he was abroad; and
besides the particular endearments which his friends received from him, he did
do Relief to his Brethren that wanted, and supplied the Soldiers out of his
Store in Yorkshire, when himself could but ill spare it; but he received
public thanks from the Convocation, of which he was President; and public
Justification from the Parliament, where he was Speaker: So that although, as
one said, Miracul^ instar vitae iter, si longum, sine off ensione percurrere;
yet no man had greater enemies, and no man had greater justifications.

THE Life and Death OF Dr. ACCEPTED FREWEN, Lord Archbishop of York.
THE three last Archbishops of York, were men of as great sufferings as
enjoyments.

I. Dr. Richard Neile, born in Westminster, whereof he was Dean; and bred in
St. John's College Cambridge, whereof he was Fellow, going by the favor of the
Cecills, bred in the same College with him, through several Preferments and
Dignities, from the Vicaridge of Chesthunt in Hertford-shire, to the Deanery of
Westminster, and by the bounty of his two Royal Masters, who had the same
apprehensions with him about the Church (a public body (he would call it) not
only to be taught by Preachers its duties, but to be kept (as long as men are
men) by Discipline and Government from scandals) came by the intermediate
advancements of Rochester 1608. Coventry and Lichfield 1610. Durham 1617.
Winchester 1627. from the Deanery of Westminster, to the Archbishopric of
York 1632. was much envied for his Preferment, more for his Principles; most of
all for his Favorites and followings; the Parliament in 1628. threatening for
preferring Dr. Laud to be a Bishop, and the Faction 1641. charging Bishop Laud
for making him an Archbishop.

good Orator, made Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield 1643/4. a Preferment he
suffered rather than enjoyed; and after fourteen or fifteen years sufferings
and privacy with his Relations in London, upon his Majesty's Restoration,
Installed Archbishop of York. His particular temper was, that by his goodly
presence and great Retinue he hazarded the envy of people, to avoid contempt: a
thing (he would say) a man should avoid as death, it being an undervaluing of a
man upon a belief of his utter uselesness and enable; attended with an untoward
endeavor to engage the world in the same belief and slight esteem, a rising man
prevent, as ruin to be thought down, is the very Preface to be so; a contempt
like the Planet Saturn, has first an ill Aspect, and then a destroying
influence: and a Governor provide against as a deposing, what obedience can he
expect from them that give him not so much as respect; the carriage cannot
reverence the person over whom the heart insults: nor the actions submit, if
the apprehensions rebel. Reputation is power, which who despises, weakens; for
where there is contempt, there can be no aw, and where there is no aw, there
will be no subjection; and we have known that the most effectual method of
disobedience, is first to slur a Governors person, and then to overthrow his
power. He knew that though he must approve himself to wise men by his virtues,
he must take the vulgar that see not beyond the surface, with his carriage;
they as the Spaniard, being of opinion, that if you would know a man, you must
know him by his gate. He dyed 1663/4.

THE Life and Death OF Dr. SAMUEL MARSH, Dean of York.
DOctor Marsh, born Feb. 6. 1586. at Finchamsted in Herts, and bred Fellow of
All Souls, took to his book, and became a Scholar against the will of his
friends, and a Divine against his own, upon the same occasion that others
become Physicians, for being serupulous and inquisitive; he spent so much time
in settling his own soul, that before he was aware, he was immersed in that
noble Science and Art of saving others; Art, I say for it was his Motto, He
that wins souls is wise; and he did profess to a friend, as Bishop Williams
once did, that though he had gone through several honorable employments, yet he
would take more comfort in begetting one soul to God, (in travailing in birth
till Christ were formed in an immortal spirit) than in gaining all the honors
in the world to himself: he was one of those Reverend Divines the late King
desired to converse with in his solitude, and to advise with in his Treaties;
and one of them the Parliament feared most, making the Kingdom his Church when
he had none, and instilling every where wholesome notions, and rectified
apprehensions into men's minds, as likewise implanting the truth after godliness
in their hearts; teaching men not to be linked to this or that body of men in a
design, but with all good Christians in Communion: many were his (...) of St.
Dantians in the West.
afflictions, but (according to that Text he said he kept up the heart of his
Hearers with Preaching upon it) God delivered him out of them all: He could
have lived as a Physician, a Lawyer, as well as a Divine; he did (as Nazianzen
said of Philagrius) (...), play the Philosopher in his sufferings, calling his
tribulations (...) learned afflictions, full of great instructions, which
taught, he said, much real Christianity, and made his soul of a more strong,
able, and athletick habit and temper; speaking in his distresses, that he hoped
he had learned all that, for which God sent it; and that he thought God kept us
so long in that dispensation, under those pressures and sufferings, that
Patience might have its perfect work; and that the world might see what the
true Protestant Religion was able to do; what might, power, and virtue there
was in it, to bear up souls under the greatest misfortunes. This (would he say)
is the time to let men see, we can live up at the same rate, as we have
formerly discoursed.

Four things he had a special care of in the late times.

1. The Confirmation of well-affected People, and the grounding of their
Children from house to house, where he was the more welcome by the sweetness
and cheerfulness of his converse.

2. The furnishing of private Schools and Families, with those excellent
Scholars and honest Men, to whom Zenodotus his Proverb was very applicable in
those times, (...) Either he is dead, or he teaches School. Expressing himself
about that Care of his, as Sir Walter Mildmay did about Emanuel College,
whereof he was Founder, That he set Acorns, which others might live to see Oaks.

3. The restraining of the Kings friends, from rash and exorbitant expressions
or actions, That the Tyranny (to use his own words) might wear its self out
upon their patience, which might seed its self upon their peevishness.

4. To widen his Majesty's Interest, by matching his friends to some of his,
not implacable and more generous foes, who should espouse their Cause, as well
as their Relations intermarriages (as he observed by the care God took in that
case among his own people) being able to turn the humor of any Nation.

In fine, having saved the Plate and Books of Sion-Colledge in London when he
was President, having bestowed his own upon the Church to which he owed it
(hating to enrich private Families into Pride, with the public emoluments of
the Church, given to Piety) and having led an exact and an exquisite life,
(...) in a conversation so studied, that it was in all things consonant with
its self, in most unaffected gravity, wonderful simplicity, and a stern
Countenance, proportionable to the vigor and strength of his Soul: (...): a
look that was not one key below his intent, eager, and sprightly mind; wholly
careful of the things he hoped for, and regardless of the things he saw. He
died in a good old age, 1662/3.

Doctor Marsh his name puts me in mind of Dr. Thomas Paske, whom he used to
call his Glass, so faithful a friend he was in discovering to him his defects,
and so good an example in proposing to him a pattern of perfection. Against his
will Master of Clare-hall, Vice Chancellor of Cambridge, 1621/2. when the
contest was between Dr. Micklethwait, and Dr. Preston, about the Lecture at
Trinity Church in that University; without his knowledge made Magni^^minis
ombra, a great Title to a little p^^fit.
Archdeacon of London, Minister of Much-haddam in Hertfordshire, and St. Mary
Magdalen Bermondsey. A Gentleman that did nothing so cheerfully, as suffer for
his late Majesty and his Son eighteen years; Modestly refuse first, and then
unhappily miss a Bishopric under his Majesty that now is, and dye. The right
square man, and honest (...).
Cube, that throw him where you would, fell upon his base; denying himself, he
enjoyed the world; none being able to deal more severely with him, that he did
with himself; no condition afflicting him, because no condition surprised him;
according to his usual saying, That distresses were like Cockatrices, if they
see you first, they kill you; if you see them first, you kill them. Si tantum
sperare dolorem, -- and prefer soror potero. Disappointments kill some, but
as the Consumption did Dr. Butler, who died of it (as he said) because he never
feared it. No wonder he was not ambitious of gain and preferment, who was so
civil in the in joyment of it, that he would say, He would not go to Law with
his Parishioners for any part of his Tyths, because, if he lost their love (as
he must do if he were contentious) he lost all probability of doing them that
good for which he had all his Tyths: Protesting that he had rather gain his
Neighbors by spending all his Tyths in Hospitality, than lose one by laying it
all in his Purse. Wherefore I hope he will see as many of his People happy
about him in heaven, as he saw of his Scholars and Pupils eminent here on
earth; three Bishops, four Privy-Counsellors, two Judges, three Doctors of
Physic, one day appointing to Reverence that Person, to whose Rules and
Examples they owed their Merit, as they did to their Merit their Greatness;
being much beholding to his Method, Rules, and Choice Books; more to his
Watchful Observation, and most of all to his excellent Company. He died 1662.
leaving this character of his modesty behind him, That as the Lion out of state
will not run, so he out of humility would not perform any action while many
looked on.

With him suffered in London,

William Wats of Cajus-Colledge in Cambridge, and St. Albans Woodstreet London,
well skilled in the Lyturgies and Rituals of the Primitive Times, to which he
desired to reduce his own time; setting forth Matthew Paris, and other ancient
M. SS. of former times, and keeping a Swedish Intelligencer, or an Exact
Collection of his own times: One that imitated the piety, as well as the
postures of the First Christians; not only conforming his Hands and Knees, but
chiefly his Heart to their pattern; not making the Ceremonial part of their
Lives only Canonical, and the moral part Apocryphal; imitating their Devotion
not in the Fineness of the Stuff, but only in the Fashion of the Making. He
knew the time, place, and occasion of the backsliding of several parts of the
Primitive Church into Superstition, and of ours into Confusion; what was
Dogmatigal in the Fathers, and what Figurative, Opinionative, or Conjectural.
He owned others the Founders of most of his Notions, and himself only one sent
into the world, to clear and improve what others had invented. He Preached an
excellent Sermon of the Ancient way of Mortification, and lived it. His
conjecture at the consequence of things, was as good as his aim at a Mark;
being as judicious a Man, as he was an exact Archer, that opening Recreation of
a Scholar, as he called it. This excellent Scholar and good man, who would
think it, was Sequestered from his Living, and Plundered of his Estate, his Wife
and Children turned out of their House, and forced to fly out of the City.

Next him Mr. W^ston of Allhallowes Lombardstreet, who knowing It was as had
being a Fwaning Spaniel, as a dumb Dog) because he walked uprightly, and would
not creep or crouch, using no Arts to gain them, but pious Living and painful
Laboring; and because his smart Preaching made some galled back winch, they
persecuted and imprisoned him, when he prayed for, and pitied them; saying,
Hadwe Ministers not desired to claw the People, that we might get above one
another, the People had not had power now to trample on us! Oh its fit the
People should make it their business to conform themselves to our Doctrines,
and not we to their Humors. Often meetings, and a good understanding among our
selves had prevented these calamities.

Honest Dr. Halsey of St. Alphage, whose great fault was, that Westons
Chaplain; heart-broken with his own and the public calamities. Among other
indignities he suffered, he had his Cap pulled off, to see whether he was a
Shaven Priest, in a grand Committee. A grave and courteous man, neither
affectedly retired or austere, nor carelessly and openly familiar; a man that
was loath to ask a courtesy, and never denied any: He was an excellent
Preacher, because an excellent Liver; and an excellent Scholar, because he knew
himself. One of whom it was observed, he never met a poor man, but he had an
alms to offer him; nor a weak man, but he had a comfort to relieve him; any
man, but he had an advise to give him. And that he seldom dreamed, and if he
did, (...), the good Oneirocritick found the day following that event, whereof
he had warning the night before; and he would say, he was confirmed that he was
immortal, because he dreamed, being sure that the soul which was awake when the
body slept, would live when the body was dead.

He read Prayers always himself, to show his respect of them, and likewise to
prepare him for Preaching, saying, That if he Tolled the Bell on one side, it
made it afterward Ring out the better in his Sermons.

Mason of St. Andrews Undershaft, that wise Master Builder in Gods House, as
King James called his near Relation Mr. Henry Mason, the worthy Author of the
excellent book De Ministerio Anglicano, that digested all the errors of his
times in judgment and practice, into a common place: instructing his As above
Conscience, Fasting, Truth, Peace, etc.
people in the truths opposite to them; and so convincing them of their errors;
never directly mentioned a beloved error, till he had fully possessed them of
the contrary truth; finding much fault with them, that jerked and girded at the
popular errors of the times, because they might provoke, but could not reclaim
the people; exasperate, but not reform them. A good man, and a good man's
friend, Dr. Iackson, Mr. Mede, etc.

Clewet, who said he went never from his Company, but much the better for him;
profiting more by an hours discourse with him, than a weeks study by himself;
learning, if nothing else, yet silence and reservedness from him who dispensed,
rather than spoke his words; pausing with a reflection upon what he had said,
before he said any more; a way of three advantages to him; 1. Because so he
might correct the error of a former word. 2. He might take occasion, and matter
for a following word: And 3. Likewise observing by the looks and carriage of
him he spoke with, frame his speech accordingly. Dr. Clewet (Chaplain to the
Right Reverend Father Bishop King, to whom he administered his last holy
Viatieum (in which respect he was a good See Dr. H. King, now the excellent
Bishop of Chichesters incomparable Sermon at St. Paul's, Nov. 25. 1621.
witness against the Popish slander of that Reverend Prelate that had lived so
renowned a Protestant, dying a Papist) by the same token, that when he had read
the Confession used at that holy Ordinance, the Bishop desired him to read it
over again) Archdeacon of Middlesex, Minister of Fulham in Middlesex, and St.
Anne Aldersgate London; and a Justice of Peace of more business in ending
Controversies; that any ten within London and Westminster, both these were
outed, the one vexed, the other Sequestered out of his livings; it was Dr.
Clwets saying, when he heard the reproaches cast upon him, that reviling was no
Hurt to a good Conscience, as flattery was no Cure to a bad one.

Chambers of St. Andrews Hubbard, Dr. Isaacson of St. Andrews Wardrobe, Dr.
Grant of St. Bartholomews, Dr. Graunts Son, who was the eminent Schoolmaster
of Westminster, and Dr. Graunts Father, who is Minister of Isleworth, Mr.
Warfield of Bennet Finke, Mr. Basly of St. Fosters, Mr. Freeman of
Garlick-hithe, Dr. Hill of Katherine Coleman, and Mr. Kibbuts, Mr. Leech of
Mary-le-bow. Dr. Iermin, Judge Ienkens Brother, of St. Martins Ludgate, Mr.
Jones of Milke-street, Dr. Gifford of St. Michael Bassishaw, Mr. Bennet of St.
Nicholas Acons, Dr. Cheshire of St. Nicholas Olaves, Mr. Chibbald of St.
Nicholas-Cole-abby, Mr. Haines of Olaves Hart-street, Mr. Tuke of Olaves Iewry,
Mr. Marbury of St. Peter Pauls-Wharse, Mr. Adam of St. Bennets Pauls-Wharse,
known by his Sermons on St. Peter, Mr. Eccop of St. Pancras Soper-lane, Mr.
Vochier of St. Peter's Cheapside, Dr. Littleton, Sir Edward Littletons Brother
of the Temple, Mr. Pigot of St. Sepulchers, Mr. Rogers of St. Botolph
Bishops-gate and Finchley, who dyed since his Majesty's Restoration, Mr. Heath
of Newington, Dr. Stamp of Stepney, dead in exile beyond Sea, Dr. Wimberly of
St. Margaret Westminster, all Sequestered, most of them Plundered, and many of
them forced to fly.

Mr. Ephraim Vdall of St. Austines Parish Sequestered, and his Bedrid Ephraim
Vdall was condemned to be hanged in Queen Elizabeth's time; Musculus in Germany
was the first that taught the plain, but effectual method of Doctrine and Use
in a Sermon; Ephraim Vdall the Father, added reasons to that method, and
Ephraim Vdall the Son first used the way of Soliloquie, and Question and
Answer; he was a great Catechist, and a great Preacher of Restitution. A bold
man that told the Faction in a public Sermon at Mercers-Chappel, You much
desire Truth and Peace; leave your lying, and you may have truth; lay down your
undutiful Arms, and you may have peace: and more in another Sermon he preached
at St. Paul's in the height of the Rebellion against taking up Arms on any
pretense against Kings, called, Noli me tangere. He once a year preached one
Sermon to teach his people to benefit by his former Sermons, as they say there
is one Law wanting yet, and that is a Law to put all the other good Laws in
Execution.

Dr. Philip King, younger Son to Bishop Io. King of London, H. King of
Chichester, whom good nature made a most facetious Companion, a quaint Orator
and Poet; and an excellent Christian (being not of those men's Religion, who as
the Poet told his Mistress, had so much Divinity, that they had no Humanity)
take Christianity for a Meek, Charitable, Peaceable, and a good natured
Religion, sequestered from his Rectory at Botolph Billings-gate, his Prebend of
St. Paul's, and Arch-Deaconry of Lewis, and forced to fly to save his Life, and
when he had nothing to lose but his life, he dyed 1666.

Mr. Hansley, preferred Chaplain to Bishop Iuxon upon a Rehearsal Paul's,
Archdeacon of Colchester, Minister of St. Christophers London, and Albury in
Surrey, forced away through the harmless picture of good nature, even because
he was not spirited for the Cause, as they told him. He died 1666. in the
Hundreds of Essex, where only he could safely, because there he died daily. To
whom I may join his very image, honest Mr. Humes of St. Dyonis-Backchurch, who
was turned out, as one said, because they suspected his learning would not
comply with their ignorant courses, nor his meekness and moderation with their
disobedience; whose great Preface-word to his Sermons, was, Hear with meekness
and humility the Word of God, etc. Well beloved for his holy Ventriloquy, I
mean, his speaking from the heart to the heart; and respected for that he
dwelled not in Generalities in his Sermons, but drew his discourses into
particular Cases of Conscience, wherein he determined the just points of their
liberty, what they might lawfully do, to keep them from Negative Superstition;
and of their restraint what they might not lawfully do, to keep them from
boundless licentiousness: Pertinent in his Quotations of Scripture in his
Preaching, because the Hearers might profitably retain all he Quoted, and he
seriously peruse them; Reasons were the Pillars of his Sermons, and his apt,
but grave Similies and Illustrations, the Windows that gave the best light.

Sam. Stone of St. Clement East-cheap, and St. Mary Abchurch, Prebend of St.
Paul's, Sequestered, Plundered, and (because he had a shrewd faculty in
discovering to the people the fallacies the holy cheat was carried on with,
witness his excellent Sermon on Prove. 14. 8. The folly of fools is deceit)
imprisoned at Plymouth, whence his letters sent to encourage his friends, were
those of St. Paul's, very powerful, though his bodily presence was weak. He died
1665.

John Squire, Vicar of St. Preferred thitherly Dr. Arlmer Arch deacon of
London, to whom he was nearly allied.
Leonard Shoreditch, for asserting Prayers more necessary than Sermons in the
Sickness time; for writing himself Priest (which was no more, as he would
pleasantly observe, than the contraction of the word Presbyter) for spending so
much time (as he did much) in Preaching a Rationale upon the Common Prayer
(saying truly, that those prayers are not liked because not understood) and
vindicating the Government, Discipline, and Ceremonies of the Church; for
Preaching zealously against the Scots Invasion, and declaring as vehemently
against the English Rebellion; Preaching truly, and bidding them remember it
when he was dead and gone, that they themselves would repent it, Sequestered,
Imprisoned, 1. In Gresham College with diverse eminent Citizens of London. 2.
In Newgate. 3. In the King's Bench, his Wife and Children in the mean time
turned out of those doors (at which he had relieved so many thousands) and
Plundered: In his Imprisonment enjoying the greatest freedom (his soul, as he
would say being himself, which could as little be confined to one place, as his
body could be diffused to many) to confirm and comfort his Fellow Prisoners,
and upon all fair opportunities to undeceive his Fellow-citizens.

Mr. Ward of St. Leonard Foster-lane, was of the same bold temper, guilty of
the same fault with Mr. Squire, viz. calling a Spade, a Spade, and the Scots
Traitors in his Clerum at Sion College, and liable to the same punishment; for
after a Recantation enjoined him, he was Sequestered, Plundered, and forced to
fly to Oxford, where it is said he died for want. He was never Plaintiff in any
Suit with his Parishioners, but to be Rights Defendant: When his dues were
detained from him, he grieved more for his Parishioners had conscience, than
his own damage: being willing rather to suffer ten times in his Profit, than
once in his Title, where not only his Person, but his Posterity was wronged;
and when he must needs appeal from his Neighbors to his Superiors he proceeded
fairly, and speedily to a trial; that he might not vex and weary others, but
right himself: during necessary Suits, neither breaking off, nor slacking
Offices of courtesy to his Neighbors.

Dr. William Fuller a general Scholar, well skilled in his own and Babel in a
confusion, met in his soul in a method; a deep Divine, and Master of all those
Rules which the experience of 1600. years had gathered together for the
reducing of Divinity into a method, whereby a man might readily upon any
occasion meet with full satisfaction in any point he desired: a methodical,
pathetick, and sententious When the people were never so impatient. one Sermon
of his would (...) them.
Preacher. Not like Scaliger in his book, De Art^ Poetica, giving exact rules
for composition, but composing well himself, his invention keeping pace with
his judgment; giving this rule to young Preachers, whereof he bred as many
under him in the Church, as he did Scholars in the University; that they should
write exactly, till they attained to a style when young, which they might be
Masters of in their age; a grave man, whose looks were a Sermon, and affable
withal, carrying it within his jurisdiction, as God does in the world with
Reverence and Love; in so much that the Right Honorable the Lord of
Bridge-Waters Father, His Son-in-law was Tutor to my Lord.
who left it to him to provide Chaplains to his House, and Tutors to his
Children; would say it did him good to see him within his House: Such a Pattern
of Charity himself, and so good a Preacher of it, that he was with Chrysostom,
called the poor man's Preacher; Sequestered, Plundered, and Imprisoned in Ely
House, where he preached so comfortably, as if to use Mr. Noyes words of
another, He knew the mind of God; And being thence, I think, upon exchange
dismissed to Oxford, he Preached there so seasonably, that King Charles would
say of him and some others there, That they were sent of God to set those
distracted times in their Wits by the Sobriety of their Doctrines, and the
becomingness of their good behavior.

Ephraim Pagit of St. Edmund Lumbardstreet, that in his Haerescography
discovered so much of the errors of the times, that he could not quietly enjoy
his Living and his Conscience; one so well skilled in Physiognomy, that he
never looked on Iretons face but with tears, as Julius Scaliger never saw his
Infant son Audectus but with grief, as sorrow struck with some sad Sign of ill
success he saw in his face; though some say, That cannot be read in men's faces
which was never written there, and that he that seeks to find the disposition
of men's souls in the figure of their bodies, looks for letters on the backside
of the book. His Sermons were as pleasant as profitable, tickling his Auditors
to good, and making a bait of pleasure.

Childerley of St. Dunstans in the East, so aged, that being past Preaching for
thirty years together, at the end of the thirtieth year Preached his friends
Wedding Sermon, and his own Funeral: the aged Swan thus sings and dies, yet
lives to suffer the loss of his Living, who, for many years having lost his
sight, was sequestered from the world. When his Windows were shut in the evening
of his days without, he lighted a Candle within, being the better able to
Meditate (as the Philosopher that put out his Eyes to Study) because he could
not see; when we shut an Eye we aim best: He would say, virtue had a joy, that
if weighed with that the vicious call so, he could say as the Poet,

Continence has his joy, weigh both, and so
If Rottenness have more, let Heaven go.
Brown of St. Faiths, and Dean of Hereford; a man of so Ecclesiastical an
aspect, and of so happy an Art of Preaching, that as he passed, those that
reviled his brethren, reverenced him, such a Majesty carries a lovely virtue,
that those who cannot practice it, cannot but love it. Much deliberation there
was before he was Sequestered, yet at last it was resolved, because he gave
offense to a good woman, Mrs. Charnock by name, at White Hall, where he was
Chaplain, by bowing to the Altar, as a Popish Priest had done before (though
its not likely that a Popish Priest should come and bow before the Altar at
White Hall) the good woman saying, she hoped she should never live to see the
day, whereon a Popish Priest and a Protestant Minister should use the self-same
gesture and posture. His phrase in Preaching was plain and natural, not being
darkened with the affection of Scholastical harshness, or Rhetorical
flourishes, so easily expounding his Notion, that it was evident he clearly
understood them; (obscurity in the discourse is an argument of darkness in the
mind) his expression was close and not obscure; plain, but neither vain not
tedious; popular, but not novel, using not suspicious phrases, least he might
seem to insinuate strange Doctrines. The Committee sends for him to suffer, and
at the same time God sends for him to dye: so St. Augustine died the day before
Hippo was taken, Ambrose before Millain, and Paraeus before Heidelberg.

The exact Scholar Dr. Styles of St. George Buttolph-lane, and St. Gregory's by
St. Paul's. A person excellent at examining Schools, he was so good a
Grammarian; and Consciences, he was so good a Casuist: His Lectures at St.
Paul's, were for the peaceable and regular matter of them, a pattern to all the
Lectures in Town; in all which he would say, when he had digested his matter,
he had studied his expressions, which he confined not himself to, because that
weakened the Judgment, dulled the Affections, and overburdened and vexed the
Memory. A man cannot ordinarily be so much affected himself (and consequently
he cannot so much affect others) with things he speaks by rote; as when he
takes some liberty to prosecute a matter according to his more immediate
apprehensions, by which (besides a (...) a becoming Orators confidence) many
particulars may be suggested that were not before thought of, when he does
expiate upon any subject, according to the working of his own affections, and
the various alterations that may appear in the Auditory.

With him lived his exact Pupil Mr. Edlin, turned out of St. John Zachary by
the Faction, and yet chosen into Bassishaw by the People; one that was too hard
for the pretenders in their own Bow, viz. Preaching, and wearied them with
meekness and patience; being a Willow in temper, though an Oak in heart: With
an even and an holy Conversation he lived to hear many wishing for that
Episcopal Government which they had overthrown, and to see that Kingship longed
for in 1656. that was Voted down 1648. teaching his people the honest duties of
Religion, while others were taken up with the empty notions of it. Come, would
people say, let us go and hear Mr. Edlin, for he will teach us to live.

Charitable Mr. Isaac Calf, forced to give up St. Leonard Eastcheap, Chadwell
in Essex, where the liberal man devised liberal things, viz. an Almes-house for
poor people at Lewsham in Kent, with a comfortable maintenance, where Mr.
Abraham Calf his Brother Built and Endowed (as I am informed by the Reverend
Dr. Hardy Dean of Rochester) a Free-grammar-school by, and a Writing-school in
the Town, with an annual maintenance for seven Scholars, to be sent from thence
to the University. A strange thing, that they who were Sequestered erected
Foundations of Charity, as fast as they who enjoyed their Sequestrations,
pulled them down; with Mr. Colfe. Let Posterity take notice of Mr. James Palmer
B.D. of St. Brides, who went up and down to look for poor Ministers widows that
were sequestered, though sequestered himself; enquiring for objects of charity,
when he looked as if he were an object of charity himself; entreating others to
look after Sufferers, but trusting none to relieve them but himself, when he
would come suddalnly and look into their Cupboards, dropping twenty or thirty
shillings at a time in a poor Family. As every poor place was his Hospital
while he lived, so he built and endowed a new Almshouse over against the New
Chapel at Westminster, for twelve poor People, provided for there from head to
foot, for body and soul; he himself feeding their souls by daily Prayers and
weekly Preaching, till he died 1659. born at Westminster, bred at Magdalen
College in Cambridge, constant Preacher at St. Brides for many years, where he
got a safe Estate by plain frugality, while others might get a greater by craft
or cruelty.

Sam Baker, and Dr. William Bray, both bred together under the exact Logician
Dr. Chapel at Christ College in Cambridge; both come together to seek their
fortunes in London, both hitting the Puritan vein, preferred Lecturers; and
growing infinitely popular, and followed, both together taken off, the one to
be Chaplain to Archbishop Laud, and the other to Bishop Iuxon; and no sooner
favored by the Government, but deserted by the Populacy; both preferred, the
one, Dr. Baker to be Prebendary of Canterbury, and Parson of St. Mary-hill; the
other, Dr. Bary to be Prebendary of Canterbury, and Vicar of St. Martins in the
Field, both sequestered together, and both hated upon the same grounds, viz. Mr
U^al, of whom before, had his Church the most thronged of any men in London,
Preaching thrice a week, besid^s a Monthly Preparation Sermon; visiting his
people from house to house, being assable and pea^eable, until he published,
The Coal from the Altar, against Sacrilege and communion, comeliness for
^ailing the communion Table, when he was spent with Labors, was sint for to be
imprisoned, and his beel-rid Wise laid in the ^p^n sheets that had not been out
of her ^^din 4 years before.
because they would not license every Fantastic pretender against Popery and
Arminianism; both having great advantage against their adversaries, having been
of them, and likewise plucking them by the long Locks of their immoderate
boasting, and touching them to the Quick; (an Hypocrite lies pat for a jearing
man's hand to hit) and Dr. Baker was a Badger in his Jears, where he did bite,
he would make his teeth meet. Dr. Baker died about the year 165-. Dr. Bray,
1644. to whom I may add Dr. Pocklington, who died, 1646. and Dr. Weeks a
Devonshire Gentleman, Chaplain formerly to the Duke of Buckingham at the Isle
of Rhee; a cheerful man, that was good at making a Jest, but made not a trade
of Jesting; Q. Elizabeth being desired to see a Dancing Master dance, said,
Pish, it is his Profession, I will not see him. The fault general of these and
other Bishops Chaplains in those times, was, that they were willing to keep the
Press sober between the Bigots of the extreme opinions in Doctrine and
Discipline. To whom I may add meek Dr. Heywood, Fellow of St. John's in Oxford,
a general Scholar, and an excellent Tutor, Rector of St. Giles in the Fields,
and Prebendary of Westminster, forced to keep School under his Son, then Fellow
of Oriel College (there being no Art or Quality, as Music, Arithmetic,
Writing, etc. but he was as able to teach, as if he had been Professor of it)
until he was restored with his Majesty. The same man still, the same Nathaniel
in whom there was found no guile. He died 1664. and was buried at Westminster,
where is buried another there of his temper, Dr. Lamb, carrying innocence in his
name and nature; a sententious and acute Preacher, of St. Mary-hall in Oxford,
Household Chaplain to the Right Honorable Thomas Earl of Southhampton for many
years: after the King came in, Probend of Westminster, and Rector of St.
Andrews Holborn, where he was overChurched for his voice, and over-Parished for
his temper: He died 1664. Both these good men, though having attained an exact
style by penning, they easily retain it in discoursing, yet never came up to
the Pulpit but they could say with Luther, Etst jam senes and in concionando
exerciti simus, tamen timemus quoties suggestum conscendimus. Such another
modest man, the shining of whose face, like that of Moses, was seen to others,
though unknown to himself, the highest Star seems least, and the fullest Ear
boweth down its head, was Mr. Tabor of St. Margarets Lothbury, plundered,
sequestered, his poor wife and children turned out of doors, he imprisoned in
the Kings Bench, and afterward dying in Hertfordshire in want; being rich in
Faith, and having been so in good Works. Mr. M^den of Mildred Poultry, that was
seen never angry, as the Caspian Sea is said never to ebb or flow, all arts
used being not able to provoke him, but one, and that was a hideous oath sworn
in his presence, which stirred him, he said, because he thought it would have
moved the very stones about him, and the house over their heads; he would not
make a strange combustion in the state of his soul, by setting the Beacons on
fire at the landing of every Cock-boat; it being both a disparagement to the
value, and an impeachment to usefulness of that passion to be spent upon any
occasion, making people believe sometimes that its used upon none at all. Being
sequestered here, he was preferred beyond Sea, being of reputation every where
but in his own Country.

Dr. Walton of St. Martins Orgars, born in Yorkshire, bred in Peterhouse
Cambridge, beginning at London first with Mr. Stock, and then being noted for a
man of strong parts, great activity and diligence, an extraordinary reach and
prudence, whereby he could command any Learning, though he had not much studied
it; preferred for himself: very judicious in laying his design, and
indefatigable in pursuing it; witness his prosecution of the affair of the
London Tyths from 1630 to 1640, making so learned, so exact a An Abstract
whereof is Printed by Mr. Garthwait, and the Manuscript is in Mr. Spence of
Sion College his keeping.
Collection of Customs, Prescriptions, Laws, Orders, Proclamations,
Compositions about those Tyths for many hundred years together, in an
irrefragable Tract, that the Judges declared that there was no dealing with the
London Ministers, if Mr. Walton pleaded for them: A stout man that understood
himself, and therefore feared no man, though being assaulted, sequestered, and
plundered, he had been killed, had he not fled to Oxford, where he laid the
ground for the most Heroic design of the Polyglot Bible: while he expected the
Tides and Returns of business, he filled up the empty places of his leisure
with study; learning some Languages, as Julius Scaliger did Greek at 40: what a
torture was it to him who flowed with streams of matter, then to learn words,
yea, letters drop by drop? but nothing was unconquerable to his pains, who had
a golden Wit in an iron Body.

The War being over, and God having ended the Controversy for that time (for
reasons best known to his infinite wisdom) in a way that cut off the most
eminent Divines and Scholars of the Church of England, from that Calling to
which they were set apart. This public spirited Gentleman, for the glory of
God, the clearing of the holy Scriptures in those days of Enthusiasm, the
employing and supporting of persecuted Scholars, in a way honorable to the
Church, and themselves, then under reproach, drew a draught of the Work
(comprehending the Hebrew, Chaldee, and Greek Originals, with the Samaritan
Pentateuch; the Samaritan, the Greek Septuagint, the Chaldee, the Syriack, the
Arabic, the AEthiopick, the Persian, and Vulgar Latin Translations, the
Latin Translations of the Oriental Texts, and Versions out of the best Copies
and Manuscripts, with many additions to the Spanish and French Bibles, and a
new method (giving the Text, and all the Translations in one view) with several
learned Discourses, various Lections, (about which our Doctor has a learned
Tract against the suggestions of Dr. Owen) Annotations, Indexes, all suitable
to so great a Work. This draught was by Sr. George Ratcliff, (that Promoter of
all honorable Designs) showed the King abroad, who encouraging it with a
countenance worthy a Prince, set the Doctor, with the Bishop of London Dr.
Iuxons leave and license, and all the other Bishops then living consents, upon
the completing of it, as he did, beginning 1653, and finishing it 1657, with a
Grammar preparatory to it, agreeable to his Motto, Getting Subscriptions under
Noble Persons hands for copies to be delivered, and making Sir, William Humble
Treasurer.
Labor and Constantia. For which, and his other services, as his late
Majesty's Chaplain in Ordinary, he was upon his present Majesty's Return, (to
whom he dedicated the Book) preferred to the Bishopric of Chester, a Diocese
he had but newly reduced by his discreet practices, rational conferences, great
reputation, and unwearied pains, to some measure of regularity, when it pleased
God he died, 1661. When their work is done, God sends his servants to bed. He
lies buried in Toward the upper end of the Quire in the South Isle.

not only to this noble design, the Persian New Testament, lying upon his
performance, but to Learning it self; his industry that translated the New
Testament into Persia, to convert that Nation, a design some in this age may
deride, the effect whereof another age may admire; he that sees the Acorn set,

Greek (so vast a stoage had his thoughtful soul for Words and Languages)
standing in competition upon Andrew Downs his death for the Greek Lecture,
having given the earnest of very great expectations for the propagating of
Religion and Learning, being able to be the Interpreter general (not only for
the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, or the wise men to Herod, but) to mankind, and
serve instead of the universal Character, being by the way the likeliest man to
make one; this humble and affable man, this Iuventutis Cantabrigiensis, Doctor
ac Pater as one calls him, dyed at London in the sixtieth year of his age,
and lies buried in St. Bottolphs Church near Aldersgate.

2. Dr. Gerard Langbaine, born at Kirk Banton in Northumbeland, Scholar,
Fellow, and Provost of Queens College in Oxford, an in genious man, witness
his Greek and Latin Poems, and Speeches; a great Linguist, translating the
Review of the Counsel of Trent, translated out of French, a choice book,
declaring the dissent of the Gallican Churches from that Council; and Longinus,

A large soul, finding that as our Swaddling of Children too close about the
Breasts occasioned their being short breathed; so the tying of young wits to
narrow Systems and Methods, made them narrowly learned, not fond of the School
Rudiments he was initiated to, and utterly neglecting the University Rules he
was confined to; he spent his time in making a General Survey of all Learning,
and drawing up an Index Materiarum of all Books Printed, and M. SS. he could
meet with in the world, to understand which he learned most Languages, so far
as to understand their Grammar and Dictionary (and no further, except Greek,
Latin, Hebrew, and Saxon) being much assisted in that Study by an Analogy of
all Tongues, given him by a learned friend in his younger years, whereby he
made one Tongue help him to understand and remember another. His industry was
great, in the mornings attending his Philosophy, and in the afternoons
Collecting Materials for such subjects as he would receive satisfaction in; his
body strong, his natural and artificial memory exact, his fancy slow, though
yet he made several sallies into Poetry and Oratory, both to relieve his
severer thoughts, and smooth and knit his broken and rough style (made so by
the vast matter it was to comprehend) (being taught by Ben Johnson, as he would
brag, to relish Horace) but judgment sure; his nature communicative: A good

Customs and Usages of the World, in that point; his Vxor Hebraica, de Synedriis
Lex naturae secundum consuetudines Hebraick, being Monuments of his insight in
the Jewish learning; his books de Diis Syris, being an instance how well he
understood how the Heathen Fables was the corruption of Sripture-truth, and how
the Gentile Learning might be made subservient to Christian Religion; his Book
of Tyths, Printed 1616. gave offense, for the Preface of it disparaging the

and historical part; Mr. Nettles of Queens College Cambridge, a great
Talmudist, for the Judaical part; by Mr. Mountague and Dr. Tilsley, Archdeacon
of Rochester, for the Greek and Latin learning, with the Ecclesiastical
History) the fiercest storm, says one, that fell on Parsonage Barns since the
Reformation; but he omitted that 28. Ianu. 1618. before four Bishops, and four
Doctors of Law, and a Public Notary, he tendered his submission and
acknowledgment for his presumption in that Book, under his Hand, in these very
words.

My good Lords,
I Most humbly acknowledge my error which I have committed, in publishing the
History of Tithes, and especially, in that I have at all, by showing any
Interpretation of holy Scriptures, by meddling with Counsels, Fathers, or
Canons, or by whatsoever occurres in it, offered any just occasion of Argument,
against any right of maintenance of Iure Divino, of the Ministers of the
Gospel; beseeching your Lordships to receive this ingenuous, and humble
acknowledgment, together with the unfeigned protestation of my grief, for that
through it I have so incurred both his Majesty's and your Lordships
displeasure, conceived against me in behalf of the Church of England.

John Seldom.


Which his submission and acknowledgment being received, and made an Act of
Court, was entered into the public Registrie thereof by this Title following,
viz. Officium dominorum contra. Joh. Seldenum de inter. Templo Land. Armiger.

I am loath to think, that the Play Ignoramus Acted at Cambridge, 1614. to make
some sport with Lawyers, was the occasion of this History published 1616. to be
even with Divines; but apt to think that the latitude of his mind, tracing all
parts of Learning, did casually light on the Rode of this Subject, handling it,
as he did all others, with great freedom; according to the Motto written in all
his books ((...)).

The foresaid Submission was accompanied with an humble Letter afterward, with
his own hand to Bishop Laud, wherein many expressions of his contrition, much
condemning himself for Writing a book of that nature, and for Prefacing such a
book with insolent reflections of that kind: And this Letter seconded with an
Apology in Latin to all the world, to clear himself from the least suspicion
of disobedience to Government, or disassection to the Church; and that Apology,
backed with a Dedicatory Epistle to Archbishop Laud, expressing great reverence
to his Function and an honorable respect to his Person, for his great design
for the advancement of Universal Learning, and the truly Catholic Religion;
whereupon the recommended him for Burgess to the University of Oxford, in the
Long Parliament; which, and an intimate acquaintance with the honorable Io.
Vanghan, Esquire of Troescod, to whom he Dedicated some of his Books, and Bishop
Usher, who Preached at his Funeral, he reckoned the greatest honors of his
life. He was outed that Parliament (to use his own words) by those men that
deposed his Majesty.

Dr. Matthew Grissith, born in London, bred in Brazen-nose College Oxford,
Lecturer at St. Dunstans in the West, under Dr. Donnes inspection, whose
favorite he was; Minister of Maudelins Fish-street London, by his donation.
For telling the Citizens, that they sent in their Bodkins, Thimbles etc. to

Sequestered, Plundered, Imprisoned in Newgate, and forced to fly to Oxford,
whence he returned, continuing Prayers and other Ordinances in London,
according to the Established Laws of the Church of England during the
Usurpation, enduring seven violent Assaults, five Imprisonments, the last of
which was at Newgate, 1659. for a Sermon, Called fear God, and honor the King,
Preached at MercersChappel (pardon one big with his Loyalty, if he Longed for
his Majesty's Restoration, before the Design of it was ripe) he died Minister

To whom I will subjoyn his neighbor Mr. Chostlen of Frydaystreet, Assaulted in
his house, Sequestered, Plundered, Imprisoned, first in one of the London
Compters, and afterward in Colchester-Goal. And gentile Mr. Bennet of St.
Nicholas Acons, who (as Bishop Usher would say, he Preached Perkins so long
till he was able to imitate him) Preached Seneca and St. Bernard so much, till
they attained a sententiousness as happy as theirs, and art of Preaching, that
is, of Collecting, Composing, and Delivering their discourses by having those
things, whereof they themselves had only some imperfect confused Notion, fully
and clearly represented to their view, from the discoveries that other men have
made after much study and experience.

Tho. Howel, born at Nanga-March near Brecknock in Brecknock-shire, bred
Scholar and Fellow of Jesus College in Oxford; smooth and meek in his
Conversation and his Sermons, by both gliding softly and unperceivably into the
hearts of all that knew him, but those that first vexed him out of St. Stephens
Walbrook London, where he was Minister; and afterward sequestered him for going
away: whereupon his Majesty promising himself good effects of his clearness,
candor, solidness, sweetness, eloquence, and good repute, recommended him to
the Diocese of Bristol, 1644. where like He being made a Scythian Bishop, found
but 15 Christians in his Diocese, and left but 15 Heathens there.
Gregory Thaumaturgus, he found few well-affected to the Church, and left few
disaffected; upon which account that honorable City, as I have been told,
has taken care for his childrens comfortable Education, out of gratitude to
their Father in Christ. A man not only flourishing with the verdure and Spring
of Wit, and the Summer of much Learning, and Reading; but happy in the Harvest
of a mature Understanding, and a mellow Judgment in matters Politic and
Prudential, both Ecclesiastical and Civil: one who, like Diogenes, confuted the
Enemies of his Function, not his Person, (...) by circumspect walking. He died
about the year 1646. and his brother Mr. James Howell of the same College,
mentioned by Sir Kenelm Digby in his discourse of the Sympathy Cure of Wounds
at Montpelier, with so much respect, Secretary to the Lord Scroop when
President of the Council in the North; relating to my Lord Conway in the
Marriage-Treaty with Spain, many particulars whereof may be met with in his
familiar Letters, which, as all private Letters, do give the best History I
meet with in that and other affairs of that Time; Assistant to Sir. R. Mansel
in the Glass-Works, and in some place about the Clerks of the Council before
the late Civil Wars, when he was imprisoned in the Fleet; where, and in other
places of his suffering, he wrote 49 Books, most Translations out of He has

he conversed with; many men's excellent parts are kept low for want of a well

The presence of a Bishop at a Marriage, is a License; and his appearance
before the War was, among his Neighbors, countenance enough to any action: the
good he did by the holy Ingenuity of his private Visitations (wherein his
discourses were quick and cheerful) was not inferior to the effects of his
public administration; those indeed making way for these, and by his inviting
looks (far from the threatening aspects of some men) to both the predominant

constitution to those habits; (like the black and yellow Jaundies) leaving a

first, Let

Dr. Heylin dwell by him, a Gentleman born in Oxfordshire or Berk-shire; happy
in his good Education under Mr. Hughs School master of Burford, to whom he
dedicated a Book in gratitude 1656. and under Mr. Frewen in Magdalen College
in Oxford, where he was Demi and Fellow, being delighted from his Childhood in
History, he studied Historically, taking in all sorts of Learning in the way of
History and Chronology; the first specimen was his Geography in 40. Printed
1621. Dedicated to Prince Charles, and improved (upon a Fellows shouldering him
as he went along King street in the beginning of the Troubles, and saying,
Geography is better than Divinity, i.e as he understood, he had better success
in writing Geography than Divinity) to a large and exact Folio, the best now
extant.

Having made his way to the Court, and traveled into France^ (of which Travels
he has given us an account in his Survey of (...)) he was admitted to the Earl
of Denbigh's attendance, when he was sent by his Majesty into Guernsey and
Iers^y 1628. where he made such observations to present Bishop Laud, to whom he
then (...) himself, as might let him see, he was not altogether incapable of
managing such public business, as he might afterward think fit to entrust him
withal; which succeeded so well, that in a short time after, the Bishop
recommended him to his Majesty for Chaplain in Ordinary, and by degrees
employed him in such affairs of moment and weight, as rendered his service not
unuseful to the Church or State; his Lordship aiming at primitive Purity,
enjoining him to draw up the History of the Controversy then in being^ as

upon the Creed; clearing up the truth by the Histories, Laws, Counsels,
Fathers, and other Writers of the Church; and discovering the Occasion,
Original, and Progress of every Error. An Employment that raised him many
Adversaries; as,

1. Dr. Prideaux, who when Mr. Heylin stated these two Questions in the Schools
1627.

An Ecclesia unquam suerit Invisibilis? An Ecclesia possit errare?
In the Negative, and made good the first, not by the visibility of the Church
(as Dr. Prideaux in his Lectures had done) in the Berengarians, Waldenses,
Wiclivists, Hussites, (among whom the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy failed) but in
Asia, Aethiopia, Greece, Italy, yea, Rome it self, where Bellarmine himself
mantained many Fundamental Points very well against Ancient and Modern
Heretics, concluding thus (utinam quod ipse de Calvino ste semper errasset
nobilissimus Cardinalis) cried him down for Papicola, Bellarminianus,
Pontificius; and when 1633. he stated these Questions.

An Ecclesia habeat Authoritatem, 1. In determinandis side Controversis? 2.
Interpretandi Scripturas? 3. Discern^^^^ Kitus, and Caeremonias? in the
Affirmative, according to the ^oth. Article of the Church of England, in the
truest Edition of them, which Mr. Heylin (when the false one published in the
Harmony of Concessions at Geneva 1612. was urged) sent for into the Schools;
the like expressions, for which Dr. Prideaux had three checks from the King and
the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Heylin clearing himself so well in the point
of popery by his Sermon on John 4. Our Fathers worshipped on this Mountain; and
by his Sermon on the Parable of Tares, that some of the Court (who before had
been otherwise persuaded of him) Did not stick to say that he had done more
toward the subversion of Popery in those Sermons, than Dr. P. had done in all
the Sermons he had preached in his life. 2. Dr. Hackewell in several bitter
passages against his book of St. George, and his Antidotum Lincolniense,
published in the beginning of the Long Parliament, not only to confute, but
destroy him. 3. Dr. Benard upon some expressions that sell from him about the
Article of the Church of Ireland, and Bishop Vshers advice about the Earl of
Stafford. 4. Bishop Williams, against whom he writ his Autidotum Lincolni^^se,
who when he was Preaching struck the Pulpit at Westminster with his staff, and
called to him to proceed to another point. And 5. the Parliament, to whom he
gave very great satisfaction in all those points objected against him; until
the Tumults growing high, he was forced to fly to Oxford, where his Majesty
commanded his constant attendance, when his course was over, for a service of
very great Importance; whence going to Winchester, Windsor, and at last settling
at Lacies Court near Abingdon and Oxford, he continued maintaining his Masters
Cause and Truth by Argument, when it was lost by Arms, never dismantling the
strong hold of his Principles, nor yielding up his reason to those men to whom
his Person was subject, as well as his Estate, for which he paid Composition

of every History that came out, writing several exact Histories of his own;
with no other assistance than a poor A^^anuensis, as he writ to Bishop Skinner
that understood no Greek, and but very little Latin.

A bold and an undaunted man both among his friends and his foes, but one in
whom my Lord of Canterbury, Laud, put so much Confidence, that he sent for him
one day, and weeping, told him of the increase of Popery, and an honorable
Person lately perverted by them in Wales, entreating him who was then young
when he should be called into their places that were now old, to have a strict
eye upon that party, giving him rules to that purpose. In fine. Dr. Heylin died
with the choicest Collection of of ancient and modern History of any man in his
time, and with the greatest zeal to serve the King and Church with that
Collection, and buried in the North Isle of Westminster-Abby, with this
Monument over him.

Dr. Daniel Featly, Minister both of Lambeth and Acton, the one in Middlesex,
and the other in Surrey, bred Fellow of Corpus Christi in Oxford, whereof his
Father was a Servant; who the third New-years-day in his life Presented him a
Pie to the Reverend Doctor that was his Godfather, and he dedicated him to the
Church; taking care for his Education in that University, in or near which he
had his Nativity: where his judgment grew so accute, and his fancy so florid,
that for his Elegant and rational performances in the Schools, Bishop Morton
then accidentally at Oxford, admitted him to his intimate friendship. The
College put him upon the Admirable Panegyric of the Founder; Dr. Reynolds
chose him for one of the witnesses of his death; the House enjoined him being
then Dean of Arts, the making of his Funeral Oration, as afterward he did
himself, the writing of his Life: The Church then in Upon Archbishop Bancrofts

a Convocation pitched upon him being then twenty four years old, to write that
Life of Bishop Jewel that is set with Bishop Overalls Preface before his
Works, as they were then Presented before King James; the University made him
Rehearser 1610. Doctor afterward, Bishop Io. King, Mr. Bates of Trinity, Mr.
Dunster of St. Mary Magdalen, and Mr. Ozbaston of Christ-Church, being the

Dr. Hacket, Bishop White, being the Preachers, an employment he the easier
performed the great Task he urged to impose upon himself, being the Rehearsing
emphatically of the choicest Pieces for Oratory and Poetry he could meet with,
every morning next his heart taking some smart Periods till his Authors were
turned to his constitution; these his happy Exercises, with his ready and exact
skill in all Arts and Sciences, which he had in numerato for any present
occasion (being a perfect Master of his Learning) either of accute Disputing,
or Elegant Preaching, or convincing Conference, recommended him to the retinue
of Sir Tomas Edmunds when he went Leiger Ambassador into France, where at
Fauxburgh St. Germans 1610. 1611, 1612. his Sermons about Apostasy and halting,
Confirmed thirty two persons of good worth in the Protestant Religion; his
Discourses of the benefit of Afflictions, comforted eight persons under
sufferings for that Religion: and his Sermons of Idolatry and Corruptions,
converted eighteen to it; besides that, his three Disputations there (upon some
grounds and Collections he had made out of the Papists own writings, he having
by the advantage of his Memory and Logic, an admirable faculty of overthrowing
an Adversary His g^and Sacrilege of the Church of Rome about the Cup, his

by his own Concessions or Principles) are confessed by Holden to have done
more harm to the Popish Cause, than thirty three he had read of before. Indeed
he had three things that would make a stupendous Disputant.

1. A calm temper, enjoying his Adversaries frets, and taking advantage of his
disorders.

2. A voluble tongue used to discourse in the Club, that always attended Dr.
Featley.

3. His rubbing over every year his Memory with Definitions, Divisions and
Maxims, both in Philosophy and Divinity. In so much, that he was upon his
return taken in to be Chaplain to Archbishop Abbot, by whom he was instructed
with the Licensing of Books, the examining of Clerks, and the drawing up of his
Brother Bishop R. Abbots Life, his Consecration Sermons, and other occasional
Exercises while he was in this capacity, are extant; and his respectful and
quick dispatch of every man with satisfaction (taking care that none should go
away sad from his Lord) fresh in many men's Memory, as are applauded Clerums,
and his admirable Exercises, for his degree; all instances of what an holy Wit
and sanctified Learning could perform; by the Archbishop he was prefer^ed to
Lambeth, where, and throughout Southwark, London, and Westminster, he was, as
appears by his many occasional Ser'mons much respected.

1. For his Disputations with, and Writings against Popery; especially, when
Bishop White had wisely cast the Net to take Fisher, Dr. Featley helped to draw
it out.

2. For his constant Preaching, having not missed the morning Sermon, as then
observed, for five years together, so even and constant grows the excellent man.

3. The savouriness of his Sermons, not altogether Wit, for that had been to
feed his Hearers with Sauce instead of Meat; nor altogether with Disputation,
for that were to feed them with Stones instead of Bread; but setting before
them wholesome Doctrines, in an exact method, and an acute expression.

4. His Faithful adherence to his Flock during two great Sicknesses, in one of
which he Composed that excellent Piece so often Printed, called, The Handmaid
to Devotion.

5. His value of good men, particularly Mr. Tho. Gataker (whom he carried
always in his Bosom, as he did him an overseer of his life) Son of Tho. Gataker
Minister of St. Edmund Lumbard-street, Scholar of St. John's, one of the first
Fellows of Sidney College, who grew a good Divine by Family-exercises at Mr.
Ailoffes house in Essex, and an excellent Scholar by private Lectures, begun
his Ministry at a small Vicarage under an old man near Cambridge, continued it
in Sir Will. Cooks Family in London, and at Lincoln's Inn, for ten years, and at
Rotherith in Surrey (whither he was recommended by Sir Henry Hobart and Sir R.
Crew, to prevent an Abby-lubber) and where as in Lincoln's Inn he reformed
Sabbath-Abuses, and Preached freely a Catachetical Lecture every Friday
throughout the body of Divinity) for forty two years. One whose memory was the
best Library extant, whose family was an Academy for Englishmen and Foreigners,
with whom he compared Studies every night, to his and their great advantage:

times Married, Visitor of three public Schools, seen ten of his assistants
eminent Ministers in the Church, gone through the body of Divinity in his
Family nine times, having written twenty two Books in Latin, and sixteen in
English of his, and revised above an hundred Books of others, bewailing the
Schism, which in the Assembly he endeavored to moderate. He died July 27.
1954. in the eightieth year of his age. ^ say Dr. Featleys value of good men,
was a fifth particular, that endeared him to many good people.

Anabaptists; taking a good method, Catechizing them first, to discover their
ignorance in the Grounds of Religion, before they disputed to show their
Opinions in the Controversies of it; and adding to his arguments against them
(what was indeed the shrewdest argument) an History of them; and several

Paul's Epistle, undertaken by him in bonds, where they were most written, upon
an humble Letter written to him from the whole Assembly) till a little before
he died he was removed to Chelsey-Colledge, whereof he was the third and last
Provost; making no other reflection upon his sufferings, than the answer he
gave Mr. White the Chairman, when he told him he must suffer.

To make up this Catalogue complete, I will conclude with,

1. Dr. Cattesford, Rector of Hadley and Monks-Ely in Suffolk, Sequestered for a
strict observation of the Canons, for entreating the people to repair to their
Ministers for Ghostly Comfort and Advise, for refusing to read the Parliaments
Declarations, or approve of their Proceedings.

2. Dr. Roberts, Fellow of Trinity College, and Rector of Hambledon in the
County of Bucks; a grave and modest man, a general Scholar, and an accurate
Preacher, Sequestered for declaring it unlawful upon any pretense to raise Arms
against the King; a Doctrine which he made good by the Testimonies of all the
Fathers, and Modern Divines; and was told, that if they were alive now, they
would be of another mind.

3. Dr. N. Andrews, Rector of Guilford, and Vicar of Godliman in Surrey,
Sequestered for saying, that long Sermons went beyond St. Peter's Sword, cutting
off both Ears; and that the surfeit of the Word is most dangerous, and that
Prayer was as good as Preaching; and for lifting up the Bread and Wine at the
consecration of it with reverence; together with his dislike of reprobation,
and refusing to publish their Orders about destroying the Ornaments of the
Church.

4. Dr. Io. Mountford, Rector of Austie, in the County of Hertford, Sequestered
for saying that God was present by the presence of his Grace in the places of
his Worship, and therefore he reverenced God when he came into such a place,
usually ordering that part of the 43. Psalm, Then shall I to the Altar go, of
God, etc. to be sung as he went to second Service; for tying Lecturers to
Catechize within his Jurisdiction, for religiously adorning his Church and
Chancel.

5. Dr. James Mountford, Rector of Tewing, in the County of Hertford,
Sequestered for bringing his people to order and discipline, as Kneeling at
Communions, and for teaching, That if the King were an Idolater, we should not
(as the Apostles did not) take Arms against him; together with refusing to
contribute to the Parliament Cause, and discouraging them that did.

6. Dr. Iefferies, Fellow of Pembroke-hall in Cambridge, Chaplain to Archbishop
Abbot, Vicar of Feversham and Ticehurst in Kent, a methodical Scholar, and a
melting Preacher, Sequestered for Preaching that the Episcopal Government was
Apostolical; that Bishops, Priests, and Deacons under the Gospel, answered to
Highpriests, Priests, and Levites under the Law; as the Presbyterians did
Corah, Dathan, and Abiram; for not admitting the House of Commons Lecturer into
his Church, and not observing their Fasts: a mirror of patience under tortures
of the Gout racking his whole body: He died at Mr. Challenor Chutes house, who
said he would plead for Bishops as long as he had a tongue, 1658.

7. Dr. Io. Gorsuck of Walherne in Hertford-shire, Sequestered for sending a
good horse to serve his Majesty, and a bad one to serve the Parliament.

8. Mr. Ed. Thurman, Rector of Hallingbury in Essex, for pressing his
Parishioners to receive the Communion orderly at the Rails.

9. Dr. Edward Marten, Minister of Houghton-Conquest in Bedford-shire, and of
Dunnington in Cambridge-shire, Sequestered for blessing God for the examples of
the Saints departed, and Preaching much upon holy Reverence and Obedience; as
likewise for lending and giving his Majesty money, besides those turned out in
both Universities, for refusing the Covenant, and disowning the Parliaments
Authority to Visit the Universities, whereof his Majesty was by their Statutes,
Visitor, as his Predecessors were Founders in Oxford.

Dr. Samuel Fell, Student, Prebendary, and Dean of Christ-Church, Margaret
Professor of Divinity, a strict observer of Discipline, and a great pattern of
Charity, having eluded the first commission of the Visitors by a prudent demurr
and delay, and with excellent Called the Reasons of the University of Oxf.
which all the Parliament Divines refused to answer.
Reasons penned by Dr. Saunderson against the Covenant, and by Dr. Langbain
against the Visitation honorably neglected; the second turned out so
violently, that his sick Wife was carried out in a Chair, to make way to a
Presbyterian successor, as his was a little while after (Digitus Dei) to make
way for an Independent one. Dying heart-broken, not for his own sufferings, but
his Majesty's; he left a Son heir of his zeal, the Reverend Dr. Io. Fell now
Dean of Christ Church, who kept up the Devotions and Orders of the Church of
England in his Brother-in-law Dr. Willis, the accurate Natural Philosopher and
Physician at Oxford, Lodgings and House, supported the Members of it by a great
part of his Estate, and kept up the honor of it by his example.

Dr. Robert Sanderson, of the Noble Family of the Sandersons in Yorkshire and
Lincolnshire, bred under a methodical Master at Lincoln School, and an exact
Tutor at Lincoln College, who improved his pregnant Wit, his large
Understanding, his faithful Memory, his solid Judgment, made more so by method
and a deep Apprehension, his hopeful Seriousness, his silent Sedentary, and
astonishing Industry, to that exactness, which stuck to him to his dying day
(and he would observe that exactness or strictness in laying the grounds of
Learning, had their respective influences upon the superstructure.) In his
younger days he learned an Art of Memory, for being enjoyed, when young, to
learn what he understood not, he was compelled to make use of similitudes, and
to remember those things he knew not, by thinking upon something like them he
knew. Being Serious in his Design, Prudent in his Study, Industrious in his
Way, Clear in his Apprehension, Searching in his Disquisitions, Serene,
Orderly, and Methodical in his thoughts; Sober and Civil in his Carriage (his
Tuition having added to his great parts, that Humility, Meekness, Modesty,
Obedience, and Civility, as advantaged by his good Disposition, rendered him to
his last, Submissive to Superiors, Obliging to his Equals, Tender to his
Inferiors, Affable and Charitable, (good Discipline in youth begets an habit of
Obedience in riper years) his thoughtful Soul struggling with the Intricacies,
Perplexities, Darkness, and Confusion of Nature; and intent upon a genuine
Apprehension of things, rather than a toilsome Collection of words, save so
much Grammar as enabled him to speak his mind properly; so much Rhetoric, as
to express it Perswasively; and so much Logic, as might order, guide, and
direct his thoughts Methodically; in apprehending things Distinctly, in judging
of them Exactly, in finding out the truth that lies in them Successfully, in
discovering the errors, deceits, and fallacies imposed upon us, about them
Evidently; and urging the truths found out Convincingly. His way was,

1. To write the Rules his Tutor suggested, or his Books afforded (for he writ
most he read, or heard, as he said, To stay his active and young soul upon
things, till he had distinctly conceived them.

2. To debate the Rules he writ with his friends, whereof he always kept a Club.

3. To practice them upon some question or other, till they became as his
native reason, as his own soul, whereby he attained afterward in all cases a
great happiness to comprehend things deeply and fully, State Controversies
exactly, to lay them before others clearly, solidly, compendiously, and
impartially; to find out the merit of a cause, the right state of a question
exactly, reasoning convincingly and demonstratively, alleging closely and
pertinently, with observations choice and prudent, deductions clear and
genuine, expressions apt, suitable, weighty, and accurate; and the whole
discourse even and steady, made up of abstract notions of reason, experience
and religion; being sure to state the words in a question or case. What is
controverted (as there will be very little when words, and things are well
understood) must be clearly laid down (would he say) as it is understood on all
hands, and convincingly proved by a proper reason from the nature of the thing,
or uncontrouled authority, pressed and cleared from all evasions, cavils, and
Subter-fuges; which cavils must be proposed faithfully, and honestly, and
answered briefly, fully, ingeniously, heartily, and modestly. Insomuch, that as
he composed a new Logic, an excellent way of reasoning; so he was many years

Index materiarum, where to put his reading and meditations, drawn by himself,
by him) he made it his business to know, rather distinctly and exactly, than
much; though he that digesteth a few things thoroughly and methodically (so much
does one part of learning well understood, depend upon, and illustrate all)
knows every thing. His Fellowship he reckoned a great advantage, by good
converse, to improve his first years of prudence and discretion; and his Pupils
(among whom the Lord Hopton was one) a great help by giving him opportunity to
observe the several weaknesses of reason, and the respective remedies. Eleven
hours was his usual allotment for study, though there was hardly a minute of
his time but was full of his affairs either of necessity, civility, or study.
It cost him so much sad thoughts to go through any subject in his unnering and
accurate way, that as he writes in his Preface to the book of the Obligation of
Conscience, that he could do nothing until he needs must; his mind running up
and down till penned up, and confined by necessity; of which he used to say as
Pythagoras:

(...). Having attained a grave and comely carriage, a plain and solemn garb,
becoming a man that always meditated some good and great design; an even,
calm, and deliberate, serious, and well-ordered habit of words and action; an
innocently fa^^tious converse, tempered and allayed with gravity, good
counsels, and an excellent example; a temperance and moderation made up of
Epictetus his two words, Sustine, and Abstine; none in judgment more for

lawful, and none in practice more Cautious in those things that were not
expedient.

Having his youthful heat abaded and fined into a mature prudence, and an exact
Learning, and his soul knit into compleatness and resolution, resigning his
Fellowship in a way agreeable to the will of the Founder, and the present good
of the College and the University, as well as the future benefit of the
Church; in compliance with the expectation of the University and the Church,
together with his own inclination (who would always say, That employment was
improvement) he was for many years Minister of Booth by Pagnel in Lincolnshire.

Where 1. his care was to settle and maintain friendship and love among people
of the same Inclination, Profession, Study, and design; the greatest relief
among the cares and troubles of the world was great, and by his skill in Law
and business successful, he being the great Referee See the cas^s of Love, etc.
lately set out, and supposed to be his.
and Casuist of that Country.

2. His Sermons were rational and just discourses upon pertinent Scriptures,
the Occasion, Coherence, and other Circumstances whereof he weighed duly; the
various reading he considered industriously, the explication he made out of the
choicest Authors^ and the most proper Learning, clearly pithy and pertinent
Observations, Learned, Moral, and Divine: as he went on in explication he
dropped judiciously; pitching upon the great Observations couched in the
several parts usefully and distinctly (not liking the wresting of the Scripture
(for a truth) lost custom in that taught us to wrest it to an error) bottoming
them upon their proper Grounds and Reasons, orderly as they lay in the Body of
Divinity and of Learning, and improving them to the respective duties of
Morality, or Christianity, rationally inferred skilfully; drawing first the
Schem of his Sermon, and then filling it up with all sorts of Learning, he
having the principles at least of every Art and Science.

3. His Exposition of the Church Catechism was constant and practical.

4. His Preparations for Sacraments were solemn.

5. His and his Families attendance on the Prayers of the Church, was exemplary.

6. His endeavors to keep Peace, Charity, and Hospitality by his precepts and
example, were successful.

7. His Visits edifying.

8. His directions not to relieve the wandering poor as charitable, as his Alms
to the regular ones; he being as severe in restraining the disorderly
Vagabonds, as compassionate in relief of the orderly poor.

9. The great satisfaction he gave to his Neighbor-Gentry in his Learned
converse, being (as he advised young Ministers to be in this knowing age) well
seen in History, Geography, Mathematics, Mechanism, Physic, Law, Herauldry,
endeared him to the whole Country; especially his happy way of reducing all
sorts to that great rule, What you would have others do unto you, do you unto
them. And seldom failing in Correspondence and Visits, those great advantages
for a good understanding and love.

10. The directions and comforts he collected for the use of the sick, and the
dying, full and exact.

11. The good Works and undertakings he set his publick-spirited acquaintance
upon, generous and profitable.

12. How proper his discourses at Visitations from Reason, Experience, and
Religion, for Order, Peace, Unity, and Obedience, and the Authority of public
Laws and common good against private Pretenses, Reasons, Interests, and
Designs; as long as he assured them withal, that the things enjoined were in
their nature safe, and in their use free; to this good end he reduced most of
his studies, which he managed with plenty of accute, and weighty matter, with
variety of reading, with full and pertinent citations, with clear and copious
expressions, powerful demonstrations made up of Scripture-strength, of
Counsels-weight, of Fathers-consent, and of Historick light, Fundamental Laws,
Essential Religion, with a prudent discovery of the proportions of Order and
Policy, of the boundaries of Government; the great Principles of Peace, the
Quintessence of the Roman, Grecian, Imperial, and Civil, Canon, and
Ecclesiastical Laws streined into ^is great platform of Peace, Unity, and
Settlement.

13. How practical and necessary the Duties, and Cases he handled both in the
Court, and ^ros^ Sermons. King Charles the^ being used to say that he brought
an Ear to hear others, and a Conscience to hear Sanderson.

14. How exact a view would he draw of all judgments in the Controversies
likely to be debated (of some of which there are Tables like Pedigrees still
extant) in all Disputations, (as those for his Bachelors, and Doctor of
Divinity Degree, which he managed so well, that the Professor Dr. Prideaux
would say of him, that none states a question more punctually, resolves it
more satisfactorily, answers all Objections more fully, than that clear and
solid man Mr. Sanderson) in all Convocations from 1644. to 1662. (for he was

complains to the Honorable Mr. Boil 1659. who by Dr. Barlow offered an
honorable salary to encourage him to proceed in his Casuistical study) which
troubled him most, rendered useless (only he satisfied private friends by
Letters in such emergent Cases as had reference either to those times or their
own Affairs, till his Majesty's Restoration, when being made Bishop of
Lincoln, he labored much to keep every sober man within the Communion of the
Church, taking great pains with dissenters, and exercising as great patience
toward them as the Law did permit, and sometimes more. Church censures during
the time he was Bishop, he used with great Reverence, and upon great occasions
to reduce them to their Primitive Esteem and Veneration: Good men he found in
Orders, he was careful to prefer, and as careful not to admit any but good men
into Orders; strictly charging his Clergy to look to their Certificates, that
(for the Churches sake) they would give them not out of courtesy, but
conscience; taking care how they became Sureties (as Judah for Benjamin) for
the young men to their Father.

This idea of a good Prelate among men the most sober, among Christians, the
most religious; among Preachers, the most exact; among Scholars, the most
useful; among Ministers, the most faithful; among Governors, the most moderate;
among Confessors-the most patient and constant; having discharged his
conscience, honestly, served his Prince successfully, assisted the Church
industriously, gone through all Charges renownedly, leaving nothing behind him
justly to be blamed, or sinisterly to be suspected, died 1662. bequeathing to
posterity Principles See his excellent Preface to Bishop Ushers Book of Power

for him, take these two Testimonies:

1. Bishop Vshers. And I proposed the case to the judicious Dr. Sanderson,
George Sanderson of Gunth^ope Lincoln, Compounded for 140l.
who grasped all the circumstances of it, and returned that happy answer that
met all my thoughts, satisfied all my scruples, and cleared all my doubts.

2. Doctor Hammond. That stayed, and well-weighed man Dr. Sanderson, conceives
things deliberately, dwells upon them discreetly, discerns things that differ
exactly, passes his judgment rationally, and expresses it aptly, clearly,
and honestly.

III. Dr. John Prideaux, born at Hartford in Devonshire, bred Fellow and Rector
of Exeter College in Oxford; in which University, he was Kings Professor and
Canon of Christ-Church for 30. years together; till he was almost grown to the
Chair, he had sat so long and close therein; so loath was the Church to lose
his pains, by his He succeeded Bishop Jo. Thorneburgh born in Magdalen-Colledge
in Oxford, acceptable to Queen Elizabeth who preferred him Dean of York and
Bishop of Limbrick, for his comely presence; and to King James who made him
Bishop of Bristol and Worcester for his Chemical Extraction and merry he^^t,
which contributed much to his long life, lying in an old Castle in Ireland, the

preferment; so true is that Motto of Mulcaster, A good Servant is a good
Slave. Though of all men he who kept his leather Breeches that he came to
Oxford in, in that Wardrobe where he lodged his Rochet in which he went out of
it, was not likely to forego either his Humility or Industry for his
advancement: by drawing for his own use Systems of each Art and Science
(whereof his Greek Grammar and Logic, both but a fortnights work, are a
Specimen and Essay) and thereby knew how to dispose methodically of his
infinite, (for he was Helluo Librorum, not only forced to eat his Books for a
livelihood in the late Times, but having digested them for his accomplishment
(an Encyclopoedy and Miscellany of all Learning) in better; which otherwise had
layn so confusedly in his soul, that he could not have had it ready as he had
to pour out upon all occasions, there being no subject which from his Common
Places (whereof his Fasciculus Coniroversearum, his Synopsis Conciliorum, his
Easy and Compendious Introduction for reading all sorts of History, are
Instances) he could not speak fully and properly to. His skill in Tongues was
great, yet waiting on his greater skill in things, aiming at two things,
expressiveness His style was manly for the strength of it, maidenly for the
modesty, and Elegant for the phrase.
and perspicuity; (for whereunto serves that (...) but to speak reason, and to
be understood?) sweetning both his style and converse with a becoming
festivity, which was Aristotle's, and, not St. Paul's (...); pleasing the more,
because of the bluntness of his behavior with all persons; took well, because
it was a sign of the plainness of his heart: So admirable his Memory, that he
retained what^ ever he had read (to the least Poem, yea, or Ballad extant) or
heard, but Injuries; which though he resented (for the present, for he being
immersed in so many affairs, was subject to the like passion with other men)
yet upon the least expression of ingenous repentance, he not only pardoned,
but admitted the person into the former degree he was in before the affront; so
that we might say of him, as Henry the Eighth would of Bishop Cran^er, That the
only way to get into his favor, was to do him a shrewd (...): Good policy,
(however it may seem to the wisdom of this world) because good Christianity;
which as he practiced toward others, so he found it from others; for when he
had fallen into the Kings displeasure about Hodges and Ford, appeals from the
Vice Chancellor Dr. Smith, to the University 1632. his plain excuse (Nemo
omnibus horis sapit) was more effectual, than others long Harangues. So
charitable he was, that he relieved the poor; which he said, he was bound to do
as they were Gods Image, and men; and Christ's Image, that is, poor men, till he
was one of them himself: So tender of young men's reputation that answered under
him, unless they were self-conceited Paradox-mongers, (for then he would let
them swoun before he gave them any hot water) that he was so a staff to them,
as that the standers by did not see, but that they went upon their own legs.
And when he pressed (a better Christian than a Clerk) with an hard Argument,
and was answered, Reverende Professor, Ingenue confiteor me, non posse
respondere huic Argumento, he replied kindly, Recte respondes; being much
against foul languages that made the Muses, yea, the Graces Scolds; saying,
that such purulent spittle argued exulcerated lungs. In his determinations he
opened the history of a Question, and stated the words of it, that the
Disputants might not end, where they ought to have begun in a difference about
words.

His Answers were quick, as Dr. Saundersons were slow and sure being never put
to it as Melancthon was at Ratisbone by Eccius, who told him, That seeking the
truth rather than his own reputation, he would with Gods assistance, answer his
Argument on the morrow. In some questions of large prospect and concernment,
not playing the Fencer only, to entertain the company; but the Dueller, as for
life and limb: put gall in his Ink when he had none in his heart, to cure the
Ring-worms of the Church.

His Body was so strong by the natural temper of it, as well as by the moderate
Shocting and Bowls.
Recreations and Diet he allowed it, that three men in the College lost their
own lives, by endeavoring to equal his Industry. His Sermons at Court, and the
University with his Lectures, were learned and honest: His Parish and Popular
Sermons Catechetical; his Overtures at Ierusalem-Chamber (where the lopping of
some Excerscencies in the Church, by the moderation and mutual compliance of
the Divines of both sides meeting there 1641. might have saved the felling of
the Church its self) as appears by the Paper of their Proceedings, (which was
the Rule for the late Alterations made in the Common Prayer 1662.) printed
1642. and subscribed by the Archbishop of Armagh, the Bishop of Lincoln,
Bishop Brownrig, Bishop Morton, Dr. Ward, Dr. Saunderson, Dr. Hacket, Dr.
Featley, and Dr. Prideaux. The Propositions he designed for the Assembly, and
the Treaty at the Isle of Wight, (but that his conscience would not permit him
to come to the first without the Kings consent, nor his poverty to the other
without relief and supply) were satisfactory to all sides. He was one of those
seven men of unblemished reputation, that his Majesty, though late, preferred
(to support Episcopacy, rather than to be supported by it) Bishop of Worcester
1640. He died of a Fever 1650. bequeathing See a Book called Bishop Prideaun

Poverty and Piety as his last Legacy to his Relations, and was buried at
Bredon in Worcestershire, August 16. with such a train of persons of all
qualities at his Funeral, that (says my Author) such as denied Bishops to be
Peers, would have conceived this Bishop to have been a Prince. His Son Col.

what he said himself, which was a courtesy to the truth he spoke, and an
excuse and mitigation to his error; as when out of Zeal against Popery, (to the
hatred of which, and the love of God, Dr. Holland the Rector of Exeter, used to
recommend the House on all occasions of parting from them) he mentioned
Gondomer in a Sermon, he was put in the Tower close prisoner for some days; an
eminent Courtier importunately begged the disposal of his Church-preferments:
No (said King James) I mean not thus to part with the man; Who perceiving his
Suit hopeless, vowed most solemnly that he did it only to try his Royal
Resolution, protesting that his Majesty had not one of more merit among all his
Chaplains. Indeed he was observed to run (with emulation) without envy in the
race of Virtue, even with any of his Order, striving to exceed them by fair
industry, without offering proudly to justle their credit, much less falsely to
supplant their reputation; having a gift of enticing all neatly to what they
knew best, so pleasing his companions, and pleasing himself, stealing by
discreet turns of speech from others treasure;

times of Art and Nature, lived to think it would perish upon the sudden decay
in this Nation of both; that University of Oxford that was an instance of that
Opinion, became likewise the occasion of this thought, where he that was near
kin to great Bodley, was denied the benefit of the Library; he that had built a
Chapel in Exeter College, at a thousand pound charge (though he had no higher
preferment than the Arch-deaconry of Surrey to maintain a wife and several
children) could not die Rector of that College whereof he had been Fellow, and
which he desired should be his Sanctuary while he lived, and his Grave when he
died. He that for opposing the Spanish Match was Un-chaplained and banished the
Court, was for discountenancing English Rebellion Dis-Rectored, and dismissed
the University. He had some Contests with Dr. Heylin about St. George's
Saint-ship, and suffered with him about the Saint-ship of some modern persons.
He has written an exact Comment on the 101. Psalm, to direct Kings how to
govern their Courts; And he gave all persons an excellent Example, in the
government of his own Family, to whom he often repeated that of Mr. Herbert:

Pitch thy behavior low, thy projects high,
So shall thou humble, and magnanimous be;
Sink not in spirit, who aims at the Sky
Shoots higher much, than he that means a Tree.
A grain of Glory mixed with Humbleness,
Cures both a Fever and Lethargickness.
Francis Maunsell, Fellow of All Souls, as excellent for his sufferings, as for
his Extraction, descended from the Knightly Family of the Maunsels in
South Wales; who being chosen Principal of Jesus College in Oxford, resigned
the Place once to Sir Eubule Thelwall, one of the Masters of Chancery, for the
good of the House, (where that worthy Knight made a Court in a manner four
square built, and Wainscotted the Hall, perfected the Chapel with a curious
and costly Roof, etc.) was forced to leave it another time to an usurper that
undid the Foundation; and then being restored 1660. he quitted it the third
time to Dr. Ienkins, one of the Judges for the Admiralty, whose Industry,
Activity, Insight into Business, Devotion, and Integrity might recover it. The
same Doctor Ienkins, whom he (being of opinion that it was not fit Gentlemen
should have any thing to do with the Faction) employed to bring the young
Gentlemen of South Wales (such as Sir Sackvil Crow's son, Sir Edw. Maunsel,
etc.) up to Loyalty, and Orthodox Learning, as he did him, now to bring up the
whole College to order, discipline, and decency. Being torn to pieces almost
with the Wind-collick, which he endured with a patience above his nature, and
having given many good advices to young Gentlemen, (whereof these are the most
remarkable, that the mind should be always bent and plodding, for he would
say, slackness breeds worms; keep your own virtues, and by observation and
imitation naturalize other men's; a good digestion turns all to health) he
died 1661. leaving the College what was more suitable to his sequestered
estate, than his public spirit.

in the late times, bestowed his leisure times on Dr. Maunsel, Dr. Bailey, Dr.
Say, in the University, and on his friends (by Letters, a way he much delighted
in) without. He died 1656. having spent most of his suffering time in
reconciling differences among his indiscreet friends, and in encouraging hope
(which he would say was at the bottom of the box) among his desponding
acquaintance; a person that was not sensible of his oppression, because he was
not subject to passion.

With Dr. Smith, were Dr. Ailworth of All Souls, Dr. Edward Hide Trinity
College in Cambridge, Rector of Brightwel in Berk-shire, and a grave Preacher,
as long as he was permitted, to the great satisfaction of good people at
Holywell in Oxford, writing good Books, such as The Christian Legacy, and A
Vindication of the Church of England, and giving good instructions to young
men, such as he designed Nurseries for the Church of England, recommending to
them a methodical Learning, an exemplary zeal at their devotion, and a strict
life; making great use of Bodley's Library while he was permitted, and when
forbidden, retiring to his own. He died at Salisbury 1658. (where I think his
Reverend Brother is Bishop) of the Stone; under which God exercised his
patience, as he did under the usurpation, his faith and heroic charity. Whose
advice was, by all means use to be alone, be acquainted with your selves, and
keep your selves discreetly in a capacity of serving the Church; for he would
say, did all men comply, the Church would be at a loss for Champions to defend
her at present; and were all obnoxious, the Church might be at a loss for
Worthies to propagate it for the future.

Dr. R. Kettle, and Dr. Hannibal Potter, both Presidents of Trinity^Colledge,
men that if they could not play on the Fiddle, that is, if they were not so
ready Scholars, yet could build and govern Colleges; and make, as
Themosticles, a little City, or College, a great one; the Whetstone is dull
its self that whets the things. Dr. Metcalf was a better of St. John's in
Cambridge, than Dr. Whitacres, because the first, though a Sophister, put a
fallacy upon him cosensu diviso, ad sensum compositum, found the College
spending scarce 200 Marks per annum; and left it spending by his own, and his
friends benefactions, a thousand: and the other, though a great Scholar,
following Studies, and remitting matters to others, to the general decay of the
College. The Government of a College is commended by the proficiency of the
Students, among whom its honor enough to the House to mention,

1. Mr. William Chillingworth, born in Oxford, and so falling out of his
Mothers arms into the Muses lap; a general Scholar, made ready in himself by
teaching others, taking great delight in directing and encouraging young men,
and in disputing with the elher; so accute and subtle a Disputant, that the
best disputation that ever was heard in Oxford Schools, was when he, Mr. Halke,
and Dr. Hammond disputed together. Admirable at opposing, and overthrowing any
Position, though solid and wary enough at answering; and Dr. Potter being
sickly, sent for him to reply to Mr. Knots Answer to his Book of Charity:
whereupon having obtained leave to travel, he resolved to find out Mr. Knot
himself, and agreeably to his great spirit, designing to answer, not only that
Book, but all that could be said for Popery, to dive by converse and dispute
with the choicest Romanists in the world, to the bottom of all the Intrigues
and Quirks of that Controversy; to which end he entered himself of one of their
best Colleges, (whereof upon the stupendous reach of his reason, he became
presently Sub-Rector) continuing there until by continual discourses (wherewith
he tired them all) he had distilled the quintessence of their reason into a
book, answering it upon his return (in the Book called [ The Religion of
Protestants a sa^e way to salvation] which was never answered, but with a War
sent amongst us) with the extract of Catholic reason, called by unreasonable
men (that make Christianity a Supersedeas for Humanity) Socinianism, approved
by Dr. Fell, Dr. Bayley, and Dr. Prideaux his adversary, who compared his Book
to a Lamprey, fit for food if the venomous string was taken out of it. As great
his faculty in reclaiming Several Gentlemen's Wives of his acquaintance.
Shismaticks, as in confuting Papists, seldom either discoursing or preaching,
but he convinced the parties he spoke or preached to: His great skill in
Mathematics, whereby he drew several regular Fortifications against Gloucester
and elsewhere, (being called The Kings little Engineer, and Black-art-man)
fixing and clearing his reason in all subjects he had occasion to insist upon.
His counsel was, that young men should be sure to be good Artists, and then
(the Arts knitting together all other learning) they would be good Scholars. He
was taken prisoner by the Enemies Forces, who found him sick, and by hard usage
hastened his death, 1645. being buried at Arundle-castle, with this Character
from an adversary, That his Head was made for contrivances, and his Heart (for

2. Mr. Anthony Farington Bachelor of Divinity, an excellent Tutor and Governor
while Fellow of that House; an imitable Preacher for High Rhetoric, Copious
Learning, and Moral Instructions, while resident in the University; a grave
Pastor, and charitable Neighbor, while Vicar of Bray, and Preacher at Windsor;
and so honest and orthodox, that the old Proverb (true of his predecessor, who
kept his Vicaridge under Henry the eighth, Edward the sixth, Queen Mary, and
Queen Elizabeth; saying, He was no Turncoat, keeping always to his principles,
which was this, that he would live and dye Vicar of Bray, and turn his Mill
with the Wind, rather than loose his Grist;) could not be applied to him [ The
Vicar of Bray will be Vicar of Bray still.) He, after Ireton, who had been of
the same House with him, had revenged a piece of discipline he exercised upon
him for his ominous knavery, in affronting his superiors (whereupon Mr.
Farington said many years before the war, that he would prove either the best
or the worst instrument that ever this kingdom bred) with a cast of his
Military Office, in Plundering him, and Quartering himself in a spite, mean as
himself, upon him. He was, with many children, turned out of all, likely to
have been starved, had not the honorable Sir John Robinson, and his good
Parishioners at Milk-street, entertained him charitably in those sad times;
when being about to write Mr. Hales his Life, 1658. he ended his own, leaving
two Volumes of nervous and elegant Sermons behind him, together with the memory
of an holy, honest, rational, sober, modest, and patient Confessor.

His moderate expedients did much in the College, while he was Fellow, to
reconcile differences; and his even carriage at Lambeth^ where he was Chaplain
1640. to mitigate prejudices, permitting none that came to him as a Licenser to
go away unsatisfied, either with a slurr put upon (what they cannot endure a
contempt of) their pains, though never so despicable; or a disrespect upon
their persons, though never so mean; 1643. he was forced to fly from his
Livings and Dignities, when it pleased God (by the promotion of Dr. Frewen to
the Bishopric of Coventry and Lichsield) to open a way to him into his
Presidentship, which he held till 1646. when being ejected with his Brethren,
he had a very hard time of it, his charity not foreseeing the future miseries,
though never exceeding, yet making even with his Income (youth may make even
with the year) though age, if it will hit, shoots a Bow short, and lessens

saying We must believe he is there, though we must not know how; that he was

enjoin his Carpenters and Masons not to omit a days work, at the building of
Wimbledon-house in Surrey, though the Spanish Armado 1588. all that while shot
off their guns, whereof some might be heard to the place. It was a bold loyalty
and charity in this Doctor to send all his plate to the King (saying he would
drink with Diogenes in the hollow of his hand, before his Majesty should want)
when he did not know but all his estate should be seized by the enemy; and to
give so much to the poor, when he had a Wife and many Children to provide for;
yet having heard H^monds poor man's Tyching.
in a Sermon at Saint Paul's, that to give to the poor was an infallible way to
be rich our selves, he did (as a good hearer should) try it, and found it true.
A strict Puritan he was, when Preacher at Abingdon, in his Doctrine, and always
one in his Life: His excellent Book against the Papists, called Charity
Mistaken, 1634. was not only learned, but what is sometimes wanting in Books of
that controversy, in each phrase weighed and discreet, submitting it to the
censure of his friends, before it came under the eye of the world; as was his
Consecration Sermon, at the Instalment of his Uncle Bishop Potter of Carlisle,
1629. The cavils against both which (malice snarling where it could not bite)
he answered not, partly because of his sickly body, which was impatient of
study; and partly because of his peaceable temper, not much inclined to
controversies; But chiefly because (he would say) a controversy would be ended
by writing, when a fire would be quenched with oil. New matter still rises in
the agitation, and gives hint to a fore-resolved opposite of a fresh
disquisition; silence has sometimes quieted misraised brabbles, never
interchange of words; and indeed he was not worthy to be satisfied, that would
after such satisfactory discourses yet wrangle.

THE Life and Death OF WILLIAM St. MAUR. Duke of Somerset.
WILLIAM St. Maur, Marquess of Herford, Duke of Somerset, and Knight of the
most Noble Order of the Garter; noble in his extraction, being restored, to use
his Majesty's words (because he had merited as much of his Majesty's Father and
Himself, as a Subject could do; and he hoped none would envy the Duke, because
he had done what a good Master should to a good Servant) created Duke of
Somerset 1660. 12. Car. 2. an Honor his good Grandfather in Edw. 6. time had,

Edward 6. Was none of those malcontents, who by the sins of their riper
years, make good the follies of their youth, and maintain oversights with
Treason: As he was patient under his Imprisonment for the one, so he was active
in his Services against the other; not more dutifully submitting to the
severity of King James (for a marriage without his Majesty's privity or
consent, with the Lady Arabella Stuart, nearly related as himself to the Crown)
than Loyally assisting (by several Declarations for the King and Bishops in the
Long-parliament) by his attendance on his Majesty at York, to be a witness to
the world of his Majesty's proceedings, and subscribe with other Lords his own
Allegiance, and a resolution to oppose others Treasons; by his raising the 21.
Counties.
Western Country by his interest, and yielding the Command of the Army he had
raised (as the Kings first General against the Earl of Essex) to more
experienced Commanders (though he had been a Soldier abroad) out of prudence,
governing his Majesty, then Prince, under his Tuition, with discretion and
moderation; by bringing his Majesty 60000 l. of his own and others to set him,
by securing for him forty five Inland Garrisons, and six Sea-towns; by waiting
on his Majesty in his Privy Counsel and Parliament at Oxford, and in all his
treaties and negotiations, and offering himself, when there was no other
remedy, to dye for him; by supplying his present Majesty, and his Friends, with
near 5000l. yearly, one year with another during the Usurpation, for which
services he paid at Goldsmith-hall 1467 l.) the necessities of King Charles in

at York; but it is as true, that (when he discovered the bottom of the design)
he did of his own accord disown the unnatural Plot in London 1641/2. where the
King advanced him to the tuition of the Prince; and he went himself to the
defense of the King, at what time such his popularity, that he raised an Army
himself; such his humility, that he yielded the Command of it to another, as if
he knew nothing but others merits and his own wants; being own of those men,
that admire every thing in others, and see nothing in themselves. His face, his
carriage, his habit favored of lowliness without affectation, and yet he was
under what he seemed. His words were few and soft, never either peremptory or
censorious, because he thought both each man more wise, and none more obnoxious
than himself; being yet neither ignorant nor careless, but naturally meek;
lying ever close within himself, armed with those two masterpieces, Resolution
and Duty, wherewith he mated the blackest events, that did rather exercise than
dismay that spirit that was above them, and that mind chat looked beyond them;
the easiest enemy, and the truest friend; whom extremities obliged, while he,
as a well-wrought Vault, lay at home the stronger, by how much the more weight
he did bear. He died 1660. full of honor and days, the exact pourtract of the
ancient English Nobility.

As was his Brother Sir Francis Seymor, a wise and religious person, a great
Patriot in the beginning of King Charles his reign for three Parliaments
together (in the first year of whose reign he was High Sheriff) as long as the
people desired reason; and as great a Courtier toward the latter end of his
reign, when he saw some projectors, under color of the peoples good, plotting
Treason. He was indeed one of the Lords (being Created Baron of Trowbridge in
Wilt-shire Tebig 1640. 16. Car. I.) that Petitioned his Majesty against several
grievances taken notice of in the Long Parliament; and he was one of them who
at York, Oxford, and Vxbridge, (for he was at that Treaty) made it evident,
that that Parliament its self, by its Factions, was become a grievance; he
himself keeping a middle way, between the Kings Prerogative, and the Peoples
Liberty, so widening his Majesty's interest to the utmost latitude and extent.
For all which, and for neglecting the Parliaments Summons to return, he and his
Son Charles paid in way of Composition. 2725 l. 00 s. 00 d.

Since for his past Loyalty, and present serviceableness, made Privy-Counsellor
to his, Majesty King Charles II. and Chancellor to the Duchy of Lancaster; in
which places he died 16^4/5. As the Persians look not upon their children until
they are ten years old, so he wished men, not to trust too much to their
present settlement, till it had attained seven years.

on his own shoulders; and knowing that Gentility sent to Market, will hardly
buy a Bushel of Wheat; added to his honorable descent most Scholar-like
accomplishments, and good husbandry, by the same token, that he bought that
estate of Sir William Constable (an unhappy man, that forgot the honor of his
ancient Family) before the war for 26000 l. which Sir William afterward begged
of his Comerades, during the Usurpation, for nothing.

Sir Marmaduke was esteemed a serious and wise man, and therefore he was able
to do his Country great service, when he stood for the Liberty of the Subject,
as he did all along in the first years of King Charles I. and the King as
great, when he saw it necessary to support his Government, as he did 1642. when
he brought in the whole County of York (being Sheriff that year) to Petition
his Majesty to accept of their assistance; and all the Clergy of the North, to
vindicate his Majesty's Cause by their Subscriptions, as the Laity had done by
their Contributions.

His first exploit was with the honorable Sir Francis Worsley of ^^^leton in
Yorkshire, Colonel of his Majesty's Army, till taken Prisoner as he was
settling the Array; who was so good a paymaster, and so civil a man in the
Army, that he might leave that saying in Yorkshire, which his Countryman Sir

eminent was his great care and vigilance. His next was settling the
Contributions and Quarters of the Country in the easiest method, saying, That
he durst anger the Parliament, but he durst not displease his Countrymen;
after this he furnished his Majesty with 3000. Northern-horse, at three several
times, preserving indeed all the horse that were left after the fatal sight at
Marston-Moor (having before routed 1500. Scotch horse before the City of York)
and rolling with them till they were a considerable Brigade, by that time they
came to Hereford, Relieving the adjacent Garrisons as he marched along; but the
most famous action in all these wars, was his marching with 2000. horse from
Oxford through all the Enemies Quarters and Army, to Routing Col. R^ss^er at
Moulton Monb^ay, and the besiedgers, though twice in number to his ti^^d forces
Relieve ^omfret 1644. ordering his march so prudently, that under the Enemies
Colors he was there before they were aware of him; and so courageously, that
he came back disputing nine Passes and after twelve Skirmishes ma^gre all the
opposition made against him; routing first and last in that famous Expedition
9000. men. A little before Naseby fight, my Lord declared for breaking into the
Associated Counties, and so through them to the North, to chase away the Scots,
when that battle was resolved on, where he said, when he was desired to Lead
the Left Wing of Horse in that sight, that by reason of the Leicester Plunder,
the averseness of his men from fighting, save in their own Country, and the
tired condition of the whole Army, would ruin his Majesty, as it did, he being
never able to make head for him, but once afterward 1648. when with Sir
Phillip Mem. Th^^ Sir Edward Musgrave of Layton Camb. paid 1974 l. composition.
Musgrave, having surprised Carlisle and Berwick, he joined 3000. brave English
to Hamilton's Scots, beating Lambert back to Appleby, and taking several strong
holds by the way, as he had done the kingdom, had his advise been hearkened to
in marching directly to York, and so to London, whereas they wandered in
Cumberland and Westmerland (as Colonel Stuart, when afterward upon the Stool
of Repentance for that Expedition, being asked gravely by the Ministers,
whether by his Malignancy he went not out of the way? answered that he went
wrong to Westmerland, when he should have gone to York) that Scots Army being
beaten as soon as seen, there being no more effectual resistance made by the
16000. horse and foot under Hamilton (of whom the King said when he heard, that
he was Commander in Chief, that he expected no good from that Army) than was
made by Sir Marmaduke with the 2000. English that he had raised and commanded;
Sir Marmaduke Langdale was taken Prisoner, and by caressing his Guards made an
ingenious and bold escape to his Majesty beyond Sea; where he carried that
seriousness in his countenance, (he was a very lean and much mortified man, the
enemy here called him Ghost, and deservedly they were so haunted by him) that
gravity in his converse, that integrity and generosity in his dealing; that
strictness in his devotion, that experience, moderation, and wariness in his
Counsel, that weight in his discourse, as much endeared to strangers his Royal
Masters Cause, and his own person in all the Countries he traveled; as he did
many and all the Armies he engaged in, as he did in most then afoot in Europe,
till he was restored with his Majesty 1660. when appearing in Parliament, as
Baron Langdale of Holmes, till his Majesty by the Act of Indemnity, and
disbanding the Army was fully settled, he returned to his considerable Estate in
Yorkshire, satisfied for 160000. l. loss in his Majesty's service, with the
conscience of having suffered it in a good cause, and acquitted himself
bravely, and played the man, -- if thou do ill, the joy fades, and not the
pains; if well, the pain does fade, the joy remains: His Discipline was strict
and exact; It was present death to wrong the meanest person in the least thing,
where he had any Command; saying, that he must make the people believe that his
Army was raised to protect them; and therefore it was not fit in an Army of
his, wherein every Soldier was a Gentleman. He died 1661.

Sir Thomas Glemham having most of the noble blood of England German Wars,
(then the great Nursery of our English Gentlemen) he was the fitter for service
in our wars, being an admirable Commander of Horse, and a discreet and watchful
Governor of a Garrison; forcing York, he was made Governor of it, and Commander
in chief of his Majesty's Forces upon the borders, whence he writ to Argyle as
smart a discourse as was written during the wars about the Scots. Invading
England against their Allegiance, the late Pacification, and the many
obligations of his Majesty upon them, upon the invitations of a few
inconsiderable men, that carried on designs of Innovation, contrary to the
known Laws, Government, Liberties, and Privileges of the Kingdom; disabusing
those parts, and people, as to the ^alse rumors, and aspersions spread by the
Scots, among them. Against whom, and all the Northern Forces, whom he made to
shrink like Northern Cloth: He kept the City of York 18 weeks, till after he
had gallantly withstood 22 Storms, Counter-mines 4, slain 4 or 5000 of the
enemies, he was forced after the fatal Battle all Marston-moor, which he would
not have had fought, to surrender up the City (upon very honorable conditions
for themselves, and good for the City and Country, whose Trade, Freedom,
Estates, and Government, were secured in the Articles, as their Persons were at
the surrender,) July 16. 1644. As he did the Garrison of Carlisle, (after 9
months seige, in which time, he kept it to astonishment, against Pestilence,
He was the first man tha^ taughs Soldiers to ^a. Cats, Dogs, etc
Famine, and all the power of Scotland) upon the same terms to the Scots; and
the head Garrisons of Oxford (upon the Kings order, the noblest terms that ever
Garrison was delivered on to Sir Tho. F. his Army) over which, his Majesty
placed him, because of his moderation, sobriety, popularity, good temper,
reputation, and his skill in fortification; many additions to the works of that
Garrison, being made With the assistance^ ^f his Countr^y-man Dr. Raw^nson,

by him, whereof one was of most dangerous consequence to the enemy, viz. the
breaking of the ground before the Trenches into pits full of stakes, that
nei-Horse nor Foot could attempt the Works, nor a close seige, especially in
the Winter-floods, be laid to them.

After an Arrest in London, contrary to the Oxford Articles, and sometimes
Imprisonment in the Fleet, thereupon he passed to Holland, and there falling
sick (Sir M.L. and he for some reasons, little frequenting the Court) died some
twelve years ago, by the same token, that a Horse-farrier that belonged to him
formerly in the North, being commended to him for a great Doctor in Holland,
the honest man when he saw him, desired to be excused; calling for a more
expert Physician; and telling him privately, entreating his privacy, that the
doses he used to administer to the Northern Horse, did agree infinitely well
with Dutch bodies. His Brother the Reverend Dr. Glemham is now Dean of Bristol,
and Bishop Elect of St. Asaph.

always in action, till he was overpowered by Sir H. Chapter at Gis^orough, where he

toward his Majesty, after some cautious pauses, to sound the villains, made
use there of some old Commissions he had under his Majesty's hand, for which
being brought before a packed Court of his enemies, he was condemned to be
murdered, June 8. 1658. (notwithstanding that he there discovered the juggle

with all his heart) he cleared himself of all the imputations of a design to
burn the City, ^earing that he should not dye in his Majesty's favor for dying
under a suspicion of such a thing so unworthy of him; and disowned their
authority, preparing himself for that death, he had so often looked in the face
both in England and in France, (for he Commanded in both kingdoms) with a
becoming frame and temper, ennobled with honorable and devout circumstances, by
the assistance of a faithful Minister, that honored his Family; and in the
company of many Reverend and Noble Friends, with the Offices of the Church of
England every day, from his first imprisonment to his death, July 10. 1654. all
with as much reverence, zeal, thankfulness, holy sorrows and joys, as his great
soul could hold. When with a religious confidence took his leave cheerfully,
and particularly of all his honorable and good friends, he passed through the
Guards, on whom he bestowed money twice bare-headed, out of an humble respect
to the people, that pitied him on each side, till he rather leaped up than
ascended the Scaffold upon Tower Hill smiling, with a pretty glance of his Eye
(which was a natural loveliness in him) on the Executioner, and his Instrument,
and saying, Welcome, honest Friend, that will do the deed I Will warrant it. And
being refused by the Sheriffs, Edward Sleigh, and Thomas Allen, to speak to the
people, Let us, says he to the Reverend Minister with him, speak to God, as
they did for half an hour afterward; professing he died a faithful Subject to
King Charles II. (for whom, he said, he would lay down, if he had them, a
thousand lives) and a Son of the Church of England, for both whose Restoration
he prayed; and desiring the people to remember a poor Sovereign abroad, who (he
said) deserved to be remembered, bowed himself to the stroke of death, with
Christian meekness and courage extraordinarily mixed together; the same time
and place, but not with the same weak spirit that Don Pantaleon sa dyed wih,
who for fighting with Mr. Gerard on the New-Exchange (where one Mr. Greenaway
no ways concerned in the quarrel was killed) was brought to dye with him
(though on a different occasion) on Tower hill.

Minister of theirs sent under pretense of comforting, to trepan him, passing as
severe a sentence on his Soul as they had done on his body) dying as they would
tell him, and he confessed confidently, instructing the Soldiery in the
dangerous principles they went on in; and professing his adherence to the King
and the Church, desiring that none should be disheartened at his death, being
assured that sanguinis Martyrum (which he said they shed as the Heathens did in
their bloody sacrifices) should be semen Ecclesiae, commending his soul to Gods
mercy, and his numerous family to his providence, saying, He was sure the King
should be restored, and that his poor family should be better provided for than
it could be by him; he and Mr. Gerard leaving these principles behind them. 1.

Murderers that passed sentence upon him; setting the foulness of their fact
with as much power on their Consciences, as they did his Loyalty upon his
Person, and praying as heartily for the Kings person then in danger, as for his
own soul, doing all he could honorably to save his life, that he might not be

Allegiance, comforting himself with that saying of Pope Nicholas, Martyrum

Levens. This Learned Gentleman descended of an ancient Family in Oxfordshire,
Lewis Levens of Heslington York, paid for composition 316l. and Lewtian Lewins
of Ruthall York 130l.
near Bolley, within a mile of the University. His Education was truly
generous, his Profession the Civil Law, wherein he was graduated a Doctor, and
in which he was excellently known before these Wars.

He continued most part of the War at Oxford, and his own adjacent dwelling,
till such time as the surrender of the said City into the hands of the
Parliament, where he had the same terms, and was concluded in the Articles of
that Capitulation; which being forced to accept and lay down his Arms, he again
reassumed his wonted studies.

But after the Murder of the late King, this Gentleman (very considerable in
his numerous acquaintance, prudence and integrity) considering the confusion,
impendent ruin of Church and State, became engaged for the Son our present
Sovereign, as before for his Royal Father; several Consultations and private
Meetings were held by him and others in order to his service; to which purpose
he also received Commission from the King then in France, for several Officers
of these Forces designed to be raised, and other instructions as the Affairs
proceeded. But the sagacious industry of the Parliaments spies lighting upon
some glimpses of this business, which they followed so close, that they
discovered Dr. Levens to be the chief Agitator and Manager of the plot, in
whose breast the Cabal was principally lodged.

An Order thereupon was made by the Council of State, and a Warrant signed by
Bradshaw the President, to seize and bring him before them, and to search his
Chamber, and break up his Trunks for Papers; (he then being at London, the
place most expedient for the design) which accordingly was done, a file or two
of Musketeers guarding and securing the House, where the said Papers were;
among which there were blank Commissions signed by the King, to the purport
aforesaid, were found with him and carried to the Council, who thereupon
ordered him to be proceeded against as a Spy, and referred him to a Council of
War. Accordingly he was soon afterward tried by a Court Martial, where he not
excused himself, but acknowledged their Allegations against him, and the
Justice of his Cause, of which he told them he was no way ashamed, but if it
must be so, he would willingly lay down his life in the owning of it. He told
them moreover, he was indispensably bound by the Laws of God and this Kingdom
to do what he did, and so referred himself to them. They very earnestly pressed
him to reveal the other parties engaged with him, and gave him fallacious hopes
of life, if he would freely declare them; but those offers prevailed not with
him, being resolved to suffer and take all upon himself, rather than to ruin
others, whom they could not fasten upon without his discovery.

So the Court proceeded to Sentence, which was that he should be hanged over
against the Exchange in Cornhill in Exchange time; which after some little
preparation was executed, he being brought in a Coach from the Mews with the
Executioner Vizarded with him, and a Troop of Horse to guard him to the said
place, where the Sheriffs received him into their charge. After he alighted,
and some words passed between them concerning the said discovery, he told them
they should not expect it, and desired them to forbear any further trouble to
that purpose; and so ^ascending up the Ladder, where he prayed very fervently
for the King and the Church, and commending his soul into the hands of his
Redeemer, and so concluded his last breath on the eighteenth of July 1650.

expressed himself very sensible of the Parliaments ill requital of him, and his
desire to be represented as a Loyal Subject to King Charles II. and likewise
offered him the model of a design and engagement, entered into by the
Buckingham, Dorset, and Kentish Gentry, with Overtures of Money to go over and
promote the said design with his Majesty in Sir John Gells, Sir Guy Palms, Sir
Io. Curson, Sir Thomas Whitmore, Mr. Fitz Herbert, and Sir Andrew Knovelaes,
and the aforesaid Gentlemen's names, appointing Col. Andrews to go to Graves-end
to meet with the Kentish Gentlemen, whereof none came there; where the betrayed

Chichley, who were casually with him; and being brought to Land. examined

therefore set down a plain Narrative, being sensible, as he said, that Bradshaw
had set a spy upon him for four years together; after which examination, and
being confronted by Sir Io. Gell, who was trepanned as well as himself, he was
kept close Prisoner for sixteen weeks together in the Tower, and after a
Rational, Learned, Accurate, and brave Plea in the behalf of the Freemen of
England against the Authority of the High Court of Justice, sentenced to be

of Isaac had banished all other fears: after holy preparations for death, with
the assistance of Dr. Swaddling, the Sequestered Minister of St. Botolph Aldgate,
who thanked him for his three days converse with him, excellent Letters and
Discourses to his Friends, (for he was an exact Orator) a Divine Will, where
having little else left, he bequeathed good Instructions to, and prayed for his
only Daughter Mavilda Andrews; a satisfactory account of his Faith and Charity,
in the clear way of Dialogue to the Doctor, (to whom he had unbosomed himself
in private) before the people; earnest prayers both of his own and the Doctors,
(who professed himself his Scholar, rather than Instructor) comforting himself
in the honorable kind of his Death answerable to his Birth and Quality, in the
good Cause of it wherein he said, his Judgment was satisfied, and his
Conscience settled, and in the blessed issue of it, hoping it would bring him to
the presence of Christ, King Charles, and his good Lord Capel: (no face of the
many that looked on him he observed, but had something of pity in it) he was
enrolled in the noble Army of Martyrs with such incredible constancy, that it
much confirmed his friends, and amazed his foes. One of the greatest of whom
said, Alas poor innocent, a better Speech from a private person, than a public
Magistrate, bound by his Usurped place not only to pity, but protect afflicted
Innocence, especially in so sweet and amiable a nature as Mr. Andrews, whom all
good men did love, and few bad men did hate; all men knowing that all his fault
was (to use his own words) a believing nature wrought upon by treacherous men;
whereof one, I mean Bernard, was hanged four years after wards at Tyburn, for

between the Sons of God and the Daughters of men (Copulations unlawful, not
because they were too near, but because they were too far akin,) and Monsters

justify the mischiefs of Hell.

THE Life and Death OF GEORGE Lord GORING, Earl of Norwich.
DEscended from the Ancient Sussex Family of the Gorings, Sheriffs of that
County successively from Edward the Fourths time, to King James; bred in
Sidney-colledge in Cambridge, to which he was a Benefactor, the second year of
King James 1603. Subscribing (I suppose, upon the Importunities of his Mother,
much addicted to that party) the Millemanus Petition about Church Government,
concerning the reason of which subscription King James used to make good sport
with him; till, being ashamed of himself, he went in Sir Francis and Sir Horace
Veres Company into the Low Country wars, where by his resolute attempts, and
good faculty in projecting, either in the way of Entrenching in Garrisons, or
Incamping in the Field, he attained to the Command of the best Regiment of Foot
(Veteranes all, that he was very chary, knowing there was a great deal of time
requisite to make a brave man) in which Command he continued there till he was
called by his Majesty to Command against the Scots; in which business, and the
design of bringing that Army to London 1640. and 1641. to bring the Parliament
and Tumults to reason, the old irreconcilable differences upon a Duel in
Holland, between him and my Lord Willmot, made no little obstruction.

In the beginning of our English wars, he was made Captain-Governor of the
Garrison and Fort of Portsmouth, where he caught the Countrymen that assailed
him in a Net, till he was overpowered, and for want of Relief, by the Kings
Order, forced to yield, and take a Pass for Holland; whence (using his old
interest there effectually) he returns December 15. with a good sum of Money,
great store of Arms, some Piece of Ordnance, and fourscore old Commanders,
joining to the Earl of New Castle, and rendering him formidable, and assisting
him in settling the Contributions of the Country, till the fatal fight of
Marston-moor (which was begun against the Lord Gorings mind, though managed in
the left wing, which he Commanded, with success, beating the right wing of Sir
Tho. Fairfax, and the Scots Horse upon the Lord F. and the Scots Foot, with
great, if not too much execution) after which, with that incomparable Soldier
Sir Richard Greenvill, he laid the Plot for entrapping Essex in Lestithiel,
with 1500. horse, stopping all provision from coming in at Saint Blase, and
reducing them to streights, by keeping their horse and foot close together;
about which time, making use of their distress, he set on foot the
Subscriptions for an accommodation, August 8. 1644. The next news we hear of
him, after a Consultation about carrying on of the war, between him, the Lord
Hopton, and the Lord Gerard, (who left all he had, sticking to his Majesty in
all conditions since the Restoration) at Bristol, was the siege of Taunton,
the taking of Wellington-house by storm, the clearing of the passage for the
King from Oxford to Bristol, to break into that Association; interesting the
States Ambassadors, Borrel of Amsterdam, and Reinsworth of Vlrecht, both made
Barons by his Majesty, in the Kings Cause, forming the Protestation in the
Western Counties, in opposition to the Covenant; hampering the Forces of
Gloucestershire with his horse and dragoons, whither he brought his Majesty,
writing to him afterward not to fight at Nazeby, until he came to him with
4000. horse; and pursuing the siege of Taunton (where he fomented the tumult of
the Clubmen, lending them some Officers) till the whole Parliament Forces
coming upon him, after a stout and cunning maintenance of several Passes that
divided the Enemy, and Lines and Hedges that secured the Men, who retreated
nobly to Bridge-water, with 2000. in spite of 14000. men, and thence to the
North of Devon-shire, where being able to do little good (his Soldiers having
no Pay, observing no Discipline, provoking the Country against them, as much as
they did the enemy; and he, in the Dutch way of good fellowship, loosing
opportunities, which admit no after-games) he slipped away, under pretense of
leading some French Forces that were promised into Holland, with some
contributions in his Pocket, to assist the Prince of Wales; (for whom he gained
all the civilities imaginable in the States Ports, Counsels, Treasuries,
Magazins, and Armies) and with whose Commission he returned, to form the
general design all over England, 1648. for his Majesty's Restoration;
particularly in Kent and Essex, where by chance, he met the Commissioners in
his way to Sussex; the loyal Inhabitants whereof (in pursuance of the Petition
for Peace, which some of them had lost their lives in the delivery of) he
(having given direction for seizing all the Arms and Ammunition of the
Country) modelled into an Army, that moved up and down, to encourage the
Loyalty of the whole Country to an insurrection, confining the factious as they
went, giving out Commissions to several Land-officers (when upon Who was at a
vast charge to entertain the Reforma^es from all parts.

accepted the charge of General, which the Duke of Richmond had waved) and
dispatching Letters to the Sea-officers, and Messages for Arms and Ammunition
into France and Holland, with a Copy of the Engagement; taking in Deal and
Sandwich, together with Provisions, securing the Passes, and Rendezvouzing at
Barham-downs, three miles from Maidston, where he was proclaimed General in the
head of the Army; in which capacity he would have quartered his Army close
together, but was fatally overruled by a Counsel of War, of generous spirits,
rather than experienced Soldiers, to whom always, after the delivery of his
own opinion, he referred himself) to let them lie at large, whereby they were
dispersed, and made liable on all sides to the enemy, without any possibility
of relief from one another; the reason why such a number of them was cut off at
Maidston; after which Engagement, leaving some to secure the Country about
Rochester, the General marched toward London; for the Lord Mayor and
Common-counsel promised assistance, where finding all things against him, and
nothing for him, after two or three nights absence in viewing the nature of the
Essex Engagement, in his own person, for he would trust no body else, and
finding the disorders, at his return, of his Forces by continual alarms and
want of rest, disposed of them to the best posture for refreshment (he himself
having had no sleep in four days and three nights) and then marched them, to
quicken the backward Levies at Chelmsford, not far from which place, to
encourage them, he drew them to a Rendezvous; and to regulate them, divided the
Volunteers that came in, into Troops, whence marching to Colchester, not with
any design to stay there, but being surrounded, he made such provisions of
Victuals, raised such Works, made such Sallies, kept such Guards, and bore up
the hearts of his men by such Orders, Examples, and Declarations, that he
maintained an unwalled old Town eleven months together against the Parliament,
General, and Army, till all hopes of Relief was cut off; and all Provisions,
even the Horses, Dogs, and Cats were spent.

and (after the death of his Mothers Brother, Edward Lord Denny) Earl of Norwich

Clerks of the Counsel, upon the Marches of Wales; the Motto of the Bohemian
Nobility, that sided with Frederick Prince Elector Palatine, viz. Compassi

of the prosperities of his Majesty's Restitution, as he had done of his
adversities and afflictions, till he died suddenly at his Inn in Bren^ord
Middlesex. 1663.

In his Company it is fit to mention, 1. Sir John Owen of Klinenney, in
Caernarvon-shire, Vice Admiral of North Wales, a Gentleman of a noble and an
undaunted spirit, and great interest in his Country; which he led thrice to
the assistance of his Majesty, first 1642. continuing in the service with much
respect from the greatest men, pleased with the Integrity and generosity of his
spirit in the Army; much love from the meanest, paying, using, and fighting his
Soldiers well in 7. Battles, 9. Seiges, and 32. Actions, leading to the most
hazardous undertaking; and bringing off from the most desperate onset; till
1646.

Secondly, 1647. and 1648. making as considerable a party in North Wales, for
his Majesty's Restoration, in spite of the Sheriffs and other Officers. Of
those Countries at Talerheer, Caernarvon, (where after a smart fight, he was
taken Prisoner, sentenced at London, but for want of evidence at that distance
against one; so well beloved, pardoned.

Thirdly, 1659. raising Anglesea, Caernarvon-shire, and Merioneth-shire, at the
same time that Sir G. B. and Sir T. M. did Cheshire, Denbigh-shire, and
Flint-shire, etc. besides what he did a little before he died, 1665. with great
pains and charge, raising 4. or 500. excellent Soldiers for his Majesty's Sea
Engagment, and all this without any other design, than the satisfaction of a
great Spirit, intent upon public good, ready since his Majesty's return to beg
for others, scorning it for himself. One motive urged to save his life, 1649.
was, that he would be as quiet alive, as dead; if he once passed but his word!
Free above all in his Company, never above himself or his Estate, observing Mr.
Herberts Rule.

Spend not on hopes, set out so,

Competitors, as an expe^dient to end the Controversy) when King; well beloved

Poetical studies sweetened his modest nature, and that his Government, besides
Imprisonment in the Tower for the Protestation; the loss of all his Spiritual
preferments, he patiently laid down 500 pound for his Temporal Estate. To whom
I may add worthy Mr. Owen of Wrexham, the Church whereof he had

the reason why with our Savior (who could say, Who of you accuses me of sin?)
he preached with Authority, giving strict measure to his people, and yet making
more strict and severe to all Clergymen and himself; having a great command
over all his affections, easy and bountiful, moderate (To avoid litigiousness,
which render so many Ministers useless) in demanding his dues; taking care not
to make the name of the Church a pretense to covetousness, never conditioning
for before, and seldom receiving wages after the Administration of any
Ordinance, very careful against the least appearance of Pride, or any
concernment in the Affairs of the world, exact in the knowledge of himself,
that he might understand others; more careful of duty than fame, and therefore
sweetly and temperately undergoing the Obloquies of those times, which he would
say could not speak worse of him, than he thought of himself; being a great
Artist in patience, Christian simplicity and ingenuity, being none of those (he
said) though he had a good one that trusted more to their Memory, than to Truth.

East Side of Spiene in the second Newbery fight to secure the Kings Guards in

or Sequestered for it) and returning upon the Restoration home, where upon the
29 th. of May 1660. he led 300. Noblemen and Gentlemen in his plain Gray-Suit
before his Majesty to London, with whom he continued, being after the Earl of
Norwich Captain of the Guard of Pensioners, and dying 1666. in a good old Age,

His Son the Lord Wentworth, a Gentleman of a very strong Constitution and
admirable Parts for contrivance, and especially for dispatch (much addicted to

little, and studying when others were a-bed) very ready in our Neighbors and
our own Affairs, Interests, Intrigues, Strengths, Weaknesses, Ports, Garrisons,
Trade, etc. continuing in his Majesty's Service from the time he went when
Prince to raise the West, (where he gave by his Addresses to the Country and
Carriage in it, great instances of his Abilities) to his dying day, Sir George

at Lestithiel, to have gained the King and Parliament Armies to join for an
accommodation) upon honorable terms, being allowed himself twenty five Horse
and Arms, with 8. men; and scorning the Civilities offered by the Parliament as
it was called, he repaired to his now Majesty to promote his Overtures in
France, Holland, and the Fleet where he was in the Quality that much became him
of Master of the Ceremonies, attending his Majesty throughout the Scottish
Treaty at Breda in a very useful way; and in the Scottish regency all along to
the Battle of Worcester, in a very prudent and active way, whence escaping
wonderfully as his Majesty did, taken with Lesley about Newport, he served his
Majesty in a well-managed Embassy in Denmark, where besides present supplies
for his Majesty, he made a League Offensive and Defensive, between the Dane and
Dutch against the English; and in a brave Regiment, which with the Honorable
Lord Gerards, etc. lay 1657. quartered about the Seacoasts, as if they
intended an Invasion. Besides that, both beyond Sea and at home, he was one of
the Lords of his Majesty's most Honorable Privy-Counsel, dying 1665. Leaving
this Character behind him; That he had a great dexterity in representing the
worst of his Majesty's Affairs, with advantage to those Princes and People that
measured their favors to him, by the possibility they apprehended of his
returning them; so keeping their smiles, who he knew, if they understood all;
would have turned them into srowns: And the ancient Barony of Wentworth extinct

are in Lancashire and Cheshire, Letting their Land at the old Rent) people

remarkable countenancing both of See M^. Herles Ded. to him of his Medit.

Rupert in Cheshire, Lancashire (particularly at Bolton, where he saved many a
man's life at the taking of it 1644. and lost his own 1651.) and Yorkshire,
especially at Marston-moor, where he rallied his Countrymen three times, with
great courage and conduct, saying, Let it never be said, that so gallant a Body
of Horse lost the Field and saved themselves. Whence he escaped to the Isle of
Man, watching a fair opportunity to serve his Majesty; to which purpose,
entertaining all Gentlemen of quality, whose misfortune cast them that way, and
so keeping in Arms a good body of Horse and Foot, he seized several Vessels
belonging to the Rebels, and by Sir John Berkenhead kept constant
correspondence with his Majesty; at whose summons, when he marched into England
1651. he landed in Lancashire, and joined with him, adding 2000. Gentlemen,
with 600. of whom he staid there after his Majesty to raise the Country, but
being overpowered before he got his Levies into a consistency, after a strange
resistance, which had proved a Victory, had the gallant men had any Reserves,
he Retired much wounded to Worcester, at which Fight exposing himself to any
danger, rather than the Traitors mercy, he hardly escaped, showing his Majesty
the happy hiding place at Boscobel (which he had had experience of after the
defeat in Lancashire) and there conjuring the Penderells by the love of God by
their Allegiance, and by all that is Sacred, to take care of his Majesty, whose
safety he valued above his own, venturing himself with other Noblemen after
Lesley, lest he might discover his Majesty, if he staid with him, and his
entire Body of Horse, with whom he was taken at Newport; and notwithstanding
Quarter and Conditions given him, against the Laws and Honor of the Nation,
judged by mean Mechanics at Chester (being refufed to make the Ancient,
Honorable, Sacred, and Inviolable Plea of Quarter and Commission, before the
great Mechanics at Westminster) and thence (with the Tears and Prayers of the
People all along the Road, who cried, O sad day, O woeful day, shall the good
Earl of Derby, the ancient Honor of our Country, dye here!) conveyed to Bolton

The Right Honorable Henry Somerset Lord Marquess of Worcester. A Nobleman,
worthy of an honorable mention, since King Charles the First, that firm
Protestant, who could not be moved from his Religion (though he was in the
heart of Spain, and France was in his bosom) either by power or love, said of
him, when going under his Roof at Naseby fight, that he found not so much faith
(as he did in him, though a Papist bred at Saint Omers, and traveled for many
years in Spain and Italy) no not in Israel. For it was he, whose frugality
(whereof his plain Freeze clothes at Court were a great example) enabled him,
and his Loyalty (which he said whatever other Romanists practiced, was
incorporated into his Religion, often relating with pleasure that Gospel for
the day, when the Imperialists beat the Bohemians, was, Reddite Caesari quae
sunt Casaris, and Deo qui sunt Dei) urged him, when his Majesty's Protestant
Subjects made him afraid, and ashamed to stay in London, to send men with ready
money (when the King wanted it, and the Country People would do no more without
it) to bear the charges of his Majesty's, and his Followers carriages, and
other accommodations to York; besides that, he was seen to give Sir John Biron
5000 l. Sterling to raise the first horse that were raised for the King in
England; and his own Officers 40000 l. Sterling to raise two Armies The first
in Brigades reaching from Wales to Oxford, clearing Monmouth and Gloucester of

pains, the close imprisonments, the many iminent dangers of his life (and most
of these hardships endured when he was eighty years of age) and the great
services he performed in South Wales, where the greatness of his fortune and
family, improved by the sweetness and munificence of his person, raised him an
interest, that kept those parts, both a sanctuary to his Majesty's The stream

the whole kingdom, besieged him, who hearing of his Son, the Lord Glamorgans
landing with considerable Irish forces, writes to them, That if they would make
him undelaid reparations for his Rents they had taken, he would be their quiet
Neighbor; adding, that he knew no reason he had to render his House (the only
House he had, he being an infirm man) and his goods to Sir Thomas Fairfax, they
being not the Kings to dispose of; and that they might do well to consider his
condition, now eighty four years of age. At last, upon very honorable Articles

war, being allowed them to make their composition) surrendering the very last
Garrison in England or Wales, that held out for his Majesty; for whom the
Marquess lost his great estate, being Plundered and Sequestered, and in his old
age Banished his Country, being excepted out of all the Indemnities of his
enemies; and, as I am told, left out of the care of his friends, among whom he
died poor in Prison, whither he was fetched in a cold Winter 1648. supported
only by his cheerful nature, whereof his smart Apothegms and Testimonies, as
when his Majesty had pardoned some Gentlemen upon their good words, that had
prejudiced his service in South Wales, the Marquess told him, That was the way
to gain the Kingdom of Heaven, but not his Kingdom on Earth; and used to
reprove him out of some old Poet, as Gower Chawcer, etc. often repeating that
passage of Gower to him, A King can kill, a King can Save,
A King can make a Lord a Knave,
And of a Knave a Lord also.

Ragland, glancing on a Marble-pillar, in the withdrawing Room, where my Lord
used to entertain his friends with pleasant discourses after meals, hit his
head, and fell flat on the ground, he said, That he was flattered to have a
good headpiece in his younger days, but he thought he had one in his old age
which was Musquet-proof. Excusing a vainglorious man, as he would put a
charitable construction upon most men's actions, he said, That vainglory was
like Chaff that kept a man's spirit warm, as that did the Corn; Adding, if you
set a man on his Horse, let him have his Horse. When a conceited Servant told

protesting, that in three years he saw not a man drunk, he heard not an oath
sworn, and though it was half Protestant, half Papist, he observed not a cross

active in raising Irish forces for his Majesty, having made the pacification
there (wherein it was thought he went beyond his Commission) as his Father was
in raising the Welsh; nay, indeed Commanded the Welsh to Gloucester and other
plaees with success, in the years 1642, 1643. as he would have done the Irish,
had he not been obstructed 1644. (as he writes to the Lord Hopton, etc.) to the
Relief of Chester; for which services he was Misunderstood by his friends,
Sequestered and Banished by his enemies, continuing with his Majesty in that
condition till his Restoration: A great Mechanic, eminent both at home and
abroad for the Engines and Waterworks, he was Author of the benefit of one of

defeat he gave one day at Rowt^n heath, September 24. 1645. three miles off
Chester, to Pointz; who being reinforced next day, and Sir Williams Command
being bestowed elsewhere, totally overthrew his Majesty's forces, Sir William
hardly escaping to Ragland, and thence to Ireland, where having formed a
considerable Army, and encamped them under my Lord of Ormond before Dublin (all
Ireland besides being reduced) by the neglect of the Ingeneer, who had the
charge of the Guards, he was surprised, and fighting desperately, to gain the
whole Army time to Rally, was killed, August 22. 1649. when as Commissary
General of the Horse, he had not long before drawn up most part of his Troops,
with a considerable body of Foot, to cast up a Work at Baggot Rath, which would

THE Life and Death OF JOHN Lord DIGBY, Earl of Bristol.
THis Noble man was the younger Son of an Ancient Family of the Digbies, long
flourishing at Coleshull in Warwickshire, who to pass by his Infancy (all
children are alike in their Long-coats) in his Youth, as his Son did, gave
pregnant hopes of that eminency, which his Mature Age did produce; and coming
to Court with an Annuity of fifty pounds a year, besides a good Address, and
choice Abilities, both for Ceremonies and business. He kenned the Ambassadors
craft, as well as any man living in his time, employed by King James in several
services to foreign Princes, recited in his Patent, as the main motives of the
Honors conferred upon him; among which the Spanish Match, managed by him from
1616. to 1623. was his masterpiece; wherein, if his Lordship dealt in
generalities, and did not press particulars, we may guess the reason of it from
that expression of his: I will take care to have my Instructions perfect, and
will pursue them punctually. If he held affairs in suspense, that it might not
come to a war on our side, it may be he did so, with more regard to his Master
King James his Inclination, than his own Apprehension: If he said, that
howsoever the business went, he would make his fortune thereby; it rather
argued the freedom of his spirit that he said so, his sufficiency that he could
do so, than his unfaithfulness that he did do so. This is certain, that he
chose rather to come home, and suffer the utmost displeasure of the King of
England, than stay abroad, and enjoy the highest favor of the King of Spain.
He did indeed interceed for Indulgence to Papists, but it was, because
otherwise he could do no good beyond sea for the Protestants. The worst (says
a learned Protestant, that conversed with him much at Exeter, during the siege
of it, and was invited to live with him beyond Sea after it, he saying, that as
long as he had a Loaf, the Doctor should have half of it) I wish, such who
causlessly suspect him of Popish Inclinations, is, that I may hear from them
but half so many strong arguments for the Protestant Religion as I heard from
him, who many years after the contract with the Duke of Buckingham, which (the
Duke fearing his preventing policy, as he did the Dukes afterpower) became a
drawn battle under the Kings displeasure, and (as the Court-cloud makes the
Countries shine) in the peoples favor; yet bestowed his parts and interest in
the beginning of the Long-Parliament, upon the vindication of the Church, as
appears by his excellent Speeches for Episcopacy, (...).
and the peace of the kingdom, as he showed in his admirable discourse 1641. of
(...) Mallo^, be was (...) to the Tower.
an Accommodation. The reason which (together with a suspicion that he was the
Author of most of his Majesty's Counsels and Declarations) enrolled him always
among the excepted persons, in the number of whom he died banished in France
about 1650. having met with that respect in Foreign, that he missed in his
Native Country.

1. For whatever was at the bottom of his actions, there was resolution and
nobleness at top, being carried from Village to Village after the King of
Spain, without the regard due to his person or place; he expressed himself so
generously, that the Spanish Courtiers trembled, and the King Declared, That he
would not interrupt his pleasures with business at Lerma for any Ambassador in
the world, but the English, nor for any English Ambassador, but Don Juan.

2. When impure Scioppius upon his Libel against King James, and Sir Humphrey
Bennets complaint to the Archduke against him, fled into Madrid; my Lord
observing that it was impossible to have justice against^ him from the
Catholic King, because of the Jesuits, puts his Cousien G. Digby upon cutting
him; which he did over his Nose and Mouth, wherewith he offended, so, that he
carried the mark of his blasphemy to his Grave.

3. Where he was an extraordinary Ambassador in Germany upon his return by
H^ydel^ergh, observing that Count Mansfield Army, upon whom depended the
fortune of the Palsgrave, was like to disband for want of money, he pawned all
his Plate and Jewels to buoy up that Sinking Cause for that time.

There were besides him of this Family these famous men.

1. Sir John Digby, a Sommerset-shire Gentleman, of good education beyond Seas,
Owing, he said, his accomplishments to hardships.
and of a great temperance and conduct at home, careful of removing the
jealousies got among the people, being of the Earl of Bristol's mind in that,
that it is easier to compose differences arising from reasons, yea from wrongs
than from jealousies; and that the nicest point in all Treaties is security.
Commanding a Tertia of the Kings He had been long bred a Soldier in the
Spanish Army.
Army, which he raised in Sommerset-shire, with great vigilance, activity, and
charge, spending 25000 l. from the time he waited on his Majesty at Nottingham
1642. having put the Commission of Array in execution in Sommersetshire, to the
time he 1645. received his deaths wound, in a gallant action at Langfort in the
foresaid County, whereof he died.

2. His Brother, for parts as well as blood, Sir Kenelme Digby, both bred
abroad, and both out of gratefulness faithful to King Charles, who restored
them upon his Queens Intercession, to what their Father Sir Everar^ Digby,
engaged in the Powder Plot, forfeited to King James. A Gentleman of a strong
body and brain, witness his Book of Bodies, and the Immortality of the Soul;
his soul being one of those few souls that understand themselves; together with
his sudden Notes on Religio Medici, of a great correspondence; see Dr. Wallis
Commercium Epistoli. Of a fluent invention and discourse, as appears from his
long discourse at Montpelier in France, and his entertainments of the That is

Ladies of the several Nations he traveled in; of a great faculty in

of one of the Princes whereof, it is reported, that having no Children, he was
very willing his Wife should bring him a Prince by Sir Kenelm, whom he imagined
the just measure of perfection. The rest learn from this Epitaph on his Tomb
1665. (when he died, and was buried with his incomparable Lady at
Christ-Church, London, to which he had been a great Benefactor.)

Under this Tomb the Matchless Digby lies,
Digby the Great, the Valiant, and the Wise;
This Ages Wonder for his Noble Parts,
Skilled in six Tongues, and learned in all the Arts;
Born on the day he Died, the eleven of June,
And that day bravely fought at Scanderoon.
It Is Rare, that one and the same day should be,
His day of Birth, of Death, of Victory!

3. Colonel John Digby, the excellent Archer and Improver of Aschams
Toxophelus, but many talk of Robin Hood that never shot in his Bow.

4. Mr. Kenelm Digby, eldest Son of Sir Kelnelm, who was then imprisoned at
Winchester-house, slain at Saint Neots in Huntingtonshire, in whose Pocket was

Martial men it is observed made for, and worn with her, began and expired with
Queen Elizabeth; peaceable and soft spirited men with King James; and honest
publick-spirited Patriots with King Charles I.

6. Sir Herbert and Sir Thomas Lunsford, both of Lunsford Sussex, the first,
said by the enemies, to be the fairer, the ^ther the shrewdest adversary; the
reason why the ones abilities was drowned by the others activity, one grain of
the practical man was in all ages too heavy for a pound of the barely knowing;

Thomas was feigned by the Brethren a devourer of Children) both bred in the

Lieutenant of the Tower 1639. and displaced to please a jealous multitude, a
Prisoner there 1641 for attempting, as was pretended, to draw up a body of
Horse, and seize the Magazines at Kingston upon Thames. His first encounter for
his Majesty was at Westminster, upon the Rabble that came down to cry no
Bishops, where he and some other Gentlemen drawing upon them, scattered them,
as he did them often afterward in the course of the Wars, when they were
modelled into Armies, losing his Brother Col. H. Lunsford by a Most of the

Mothers belly, that was killed with a Canon, though it is sad to see Valor
subjected to chance, and the bravest man fall sometimes by the most
inconsiderable hand. It was their Fathers observation in Queen Elizabeth's time,
that God so equally divided the advantage of weapons between Spain and us, that
as their Bilboa Steel makes the best Swords, so our Sussex Iron makes the best
Guns.

THE Life and Death OF EDWARD Lord LITLETON, Lord Keepter of the Great Seal of
England.
ELdest Son to Sir Edward Littleton of Mounslow in Shrop-shire, one of the
Justices of the Marches, and chief Justice of Northwales; himself bred in Where
he dyed 1644. and was buried.
Christ-Church Oxford, and at the Temple in London, one of the Justices in
North Wales, Recorder of London, Solicitor to King Charles the I. Term Mich.
Anno 15. Car. 1. Sergeant at Law, and chief Justice of the Common-Fleas 1639/40
Privy-Counsellor and Lord Keeper, and Baron of Mou^slow, 1640/41. Honors he
gained by his discreet management of the Duke of Buckinghams Charge, and other
Affairs in Parliaments 1625. 1626. 1627. 1628. between the jealousy of the
people and the Honor of the Court, that Sir I. Finch would say of him, He was
the only man for taking things by the Right handle; and Sir Edward Cook, that
he was a well-poized, and weighed man, and deserved by sending the Which Mr.
siliot, after 3. hours Conference with him im^private, got from, according to
an Oath he had taken when admitted Lordkeeper, to deliver up the Se^l when ever
the King sen^ for it. The saction had taken it from him before, but that he had
always in appearance Voted according to the sense of the best affected in the
House.
Seal first, and then going himself after it to the King at York, whence his
presence did but countenance the Rebellion in London; for the Lord Willoughby
of Parham pleaded in answer to a summons sent him by his Majesty, that he was
about settling the Militia according to the Votes of Parliament passed as legal
by Sir Edward Litleton Lord Keeper, and Sir John Banks as Lord chief Justice.

An action of important service to his Majesty, not only confirming all his
proceedings with the right Seal; but likewise occasioning the Adjournment of
the Term, the suing of all Original Writs from Oxford, the invalidity of
unsealed Parliament Proclamations, the impossibility of issuing out new Writs
of Election for Members of Parliament, and thereupon the danger of the
dissolution of that Parliament, especially since the making of the new Seal,
was a matter of so dangerous a consequence, that a Member of their own desired
the Sergeant that drew up the Or^^nance for the new After they had in v^in
sam^^ne^ him to re^^^ w^^in 14. days with the Sea^, (...) of High T^^^eson.

Sir Ed. Litleton is descended of Sir Tho. Litleton Author of the book of
Tenures commented on by Sir Edw. Cook, and of so much repute, that the Iudg^s
in K. J^^^s's ^^me, declar^^ that his Case was not to ^e qa^stioned.


Seal, not to be made too hasty in that business before he consulted the
Statute 25 Edw. 3. Where counterfeiting of the Great Seal is declared High
Treason; To which the Sergeant replied, That he purposed not to counterfeit the
old Seal, but to make a new. His very name carried an hereditary Credit with
it, which plaineth out the way to all great actions; his Virtue being
Authorized by his Nobility, and his Undertakings enobled by his Birth, gained
that esteem which meaner men attain not without a large compass of time and
Experience: Worthless Nobility, and ignoble worth lie under equal disadvantage,
neither was his Extraction greater than his Parts; his Judgment being clear and
piercing, his Learning various and useful, his Skill in the Maxims of our
Government, the Fundamental Laws of this Monarchy, with its Statutes and
Customs singular; his Experience long, and observing, his Presence and
Eloquence, Powerful and Majestic, and all be^itting a Statesman and a Lord
Keeper, who was besides a Soldier. For I think these Verses were made upon him.

His Brother Dr. Litleton, Master of the Temple (a man endued with Prudence,
the Mistress of Graces, without which they are useless to others; and Humility
the preserver of them, without which they perish to a man's self, who used to
say, that Ambition being the great principle that acts more or less in all men,
that Government was more or less happy, that did more or less intend the
employing of Able-men (to keep them from running out) suitably to their
ambition) who being Sequestered of all, paid yet out of his nothing for his

of Cutsmore, as I take it in Rutland, a man of so great integrity (giving for
his Motto in his Rings when made Sergeant, Term Mic. 7. Septimo Car. I. Lex
regis, vis regis) that when it appeared to him that the people encroached too
much upon their Sovereign, he prosecuted them severely (witness Sir Io. Eliot,
etc. and others for their extravagancies in the Parliament 1628.) as Solicitor
and Attorney General to King James and King Charles the I. when he doubted his
Majesty was advised to press too much upon the subject, he rather than go
against his Conscience, quitted his place of chief Justice of the Kings Bench,
Sept. 14. 10 Caroli, pleading at the Bar in that Court where he had sat on the
Bench, until again (the rare example of one playing an after-game of favor,)
His Majesty made him one of the Justices of the Kings Bench, 9 Dec. 16 Car. I.
where he behaved himself with so much plain honesty, that 1. A Lady commencing
an unlikely Suit against her Husbands opinion, and living in the Shire-Town,
invited Judge Heath to a great entertainment the very day her Cause was to be
tried, after which immediately going to the Hall, he gave sentence according to
evidence and right against her, whereupon she saying to her Husband, that she
would never invite Judge again, was answered by him, Never invite honest Judge
again. 2. And John Lilburne being tried before him (for his Rebellion, when he
had been taken at Brentford) at Oxford, made frequent use of his words at
another trial before them, he had fought at London, viz. God ^orbid Mr.

Robert Holborne, a Gentleman of those good inclinations, which flowing with
good blood, rendered him in his first Addresses acceptable to the world, wherein
having before him the good example of his Learned Ancestors; he attained to
that exactness in Law, as with the amiable accomplishments of his nature, made
it very easy for him to do well, which is a man's main business to gain upon
men's affections; becoming with little labor, and without thinking excellent by
good precept, and continual care correct his defects, so as to gain a general
esteem, and a good opinion, being sensible of Mr. Herberts Rule:

Slight not the smallest loss, whether it be
In love or honor, take account (...);
Shine like the Sun in every Corn^r: See
Whether thy Stock or Credit swell or fall,
Who say I care not, those I give for lost,
And to instruct them it will not quit the cost.
Being of the Long-Parliament, he was unwilling to join with them in their
Debates for War, and retired to Oxford in the Treaty there, at Vxbridge, and
the Isle of Wight, to consult and offer those things that make for Peace, for
which he paid 300 l. when living at Covent Garden, being not admitted, as were
not any of the King followers, to study at any the Inns of Courts upon (...)
their return home after the Wars.

Sergeant W. Glanvile, born at (...)
Tavistoche in Devon shire (a County happy that it beeds so many Lawyers, but
more happy that it has little need of them, having the fewest Suits, and most
Counselors of any County in England) a Gentleman that had so much deliberation
and weight in every thing he spoke, that he was heard with much respect in all
the Parliaments, whereof he was either Member or (...)
Speaker, ^^cering prudently and watchfully in all their weighty Consultations
and Debates; Collecting judiciously and readily the sense of that numerous
Assembly, propounding the same seasonably, and in apt Questions for their final
Resolutions, and presenting their Conclusions and Declarations with Truth and
Life, Light and Luster, and full advantage upon all occasions, as a man of an
excellent Judgment, Temper, Spirit, and Elocution, till the last and long one,
when those men for whose Liberties of Voting he had argued (...)
formerly, allowed him not the Liberty of his Vote, when he urged that Law
against them, which he had, when they were more moderate in their courses,
urged for them; wherefore he retired with above half the sober Members of
Parliament to Oxford, where having discharged his Conscience, he returned to
London to suffer for (...). He that suffered patiently Imprisonment on
Shipboard for speaking his mind freely in some State-points against a
boundless Prerogative 1626. suffered as quietly six several hard Imprisonments,
one of which was two years in the Tower, for declaring himself as honestly in
some Law-points against a Treasonable popularity, till the good man, true to
his honest principles of Loyalty, was against the will of the Lower House, who
yet laid no charge against him, Bailed by the Upper-House, shining the brighter
for being so long ecclipsed, insomuch that when the ignorant Faction did not
think him worthy to be a Common-Lawyer, the Learned University of Oxford,
whereof he was a worthy Member, chose him her Burgess in one of the Usurping
times of the Pseudo-Parliament; it was his honor that he was then chosen to
represent an University in Parliament, and it was his integrity that he was no^
then admitted. He suffered in the Cause of all Englishmen, and pleaded the
Cause of many of them; particularly, my Lord Cravens, though banished, and Sir
John Stawell though a Prisoner, till the whole Nation became as free as his
Soul: He dying 1660. a great enemy of Tobacco, because of Sir Water Rawleighs
testimony of it, that he saw the Spanish Negroes throwing the running of their
sores and boils in the leaves as they lay in a swet, say His Tract about
plan^ing Tobacco in England.

John Banks born at Keswicke, and bred at Gray's Inn, attaining to great
experience by soliciting Suits for others; and a great Estate by managing
those of his own, laughing at many at last that smiled at him at first, leaving
many behind him in Learning, that he found before him in time. He was one whom
the Chollor of S S S worn by Judges and other Magistrates, became very well, if
it had its name from Sanctus, Simon, Simplicius, no man being more seriously
pious, none more singly honest. When Sir Henry Savile came to Sir Edward Cook
then at Bowls in Archbishop Abbots behalf, and told him he had a Case to
propose to him, Sir Edward answered, if it be a Case in Common Law, I am
unworthy to be a Judge, if I cannot presently satisfy you; but if it be a
point of Statute Law, I am unworthy to be a Judge if I should undertake to
satisfy you without consulting my Books. Sir John Banks, though ready without
his Books on the Bench, yet always resolved Cases out of them in his Chamber;
answerable to his saying to Dr. Sibbs, A good Textuary is a good Lawyer as well
as a good Divine.

A Gentleman he was of singular modesty, of the Ancient freedom, plain
heartedness and integrity of mind: very grave and severe in his deportment,
yet very affable, in such sort, that as Tacitus says of Agrippa, Illi quod est
Rarissimum, (...) facilit^s authoritatem, nec s^veritas amorem diminuit, his
knowledge in the Law and inward reason of it was very profound; his experience
in Affairs of State universal and well laid, patient he was in hearing,
sparing, but pertinent in speaking: very glad always to have things represented
truly and clearly, and when it was otherwise, able to discern through all
pretenses the real merit of a Cause. Being a Religious and moderate man, he
became of good repute with the people, and being an able man he was taken
notice of by the King, who Knighting him, in August 10. Car. I. when Reader of
Gray's Inn, and the Princes Solicitor, made him in Mr. Noys place Attorney
General; and in Hill. Term 16 Car. I. Chief Justice in Sir Edward Litletons
place; in which place he continued at London till his presence being made an
Argument for Illegal proceedings, he went himself, and drew several others he
had interest in, to Oxford. His prudent and valiant Lady with her numerous and
noble Offspring retiring to her House, Corfe-Castle in the Isle of Purbeck in
Dorset-shire, and when besieged there by Sir Will. Earl, and Sir Tho.
Trenchard, who wanted this Castle only to make the Seacoast their own, keeping
it against three surprises, a Proclamation Interdicting her the common Markets,
the clamor of the common people thereabouts, the intercepting of 200. weight of
Powder; strict Watches set about it a while, with forty men, ye^ but five at
first, and then by the benefit of a Treaty, wherein she yielded up the four
small pieces to the Enemy, on condition she might have her house; and so making
her adversaries more remiss, gained an opportunity to reinforce the Castle
with Commanders, Ammunition, Provision, and Soldiers, who notwithstanding the
endeavors to corrupt them with Bribes, and the Plunder of the Castle;
notwithstanding the enemies taking the Town and Church, the Oath to give no
Quarter, the Engines they made, the Supplies of war, sent in every day by the
Earl of Warwick, their encouraging the Soldiers, first with money, twenty pound
a man; and afterward with Drink and Opium, to (...)
Scale the Walls in a desperate Assault, kept it six weeks, till August 4.
1643. when the Besiegers ran away, leaving their Horse, Arms, Ammunition
behind them; the vallant (...)
Lady her self, with her Daughters and Maidservants, maintaining one Post in
the Castle, Captain Laurence, Sir Edwards Son, and Captain Bond keeping another.

Sir John died December 28. 1644. and in the 55. year of his age, having one
Monument in Christ-Church.

Oxford, bred in the Inner Temple, London: A Gentleman that won much upon all
men, by a natural grace that was upon his person and actions; and upon his
Clients, by his Integrity, Condescension, and Watchfulness. Other Lawyers are
for the increase of their own number, he spent a great deal of his time to
consider how to reduce them, especially the Atturneys and Solicitors (the
supernumeraries whereof, he would say, make no other use of Laws, but to find
tricks to evade them; or (making them right Cobwebs) to ensnare the people, and
the Law too, being more for promoting good Orders to execute old Laws, than for
preferring ^ills to make new ones. The Faction had no other quarrel with him,
than the Clowns had with Sir John Cavendish in Wat Tyler and King Richar^ the
Seconds time, because he was learned and honest; for being made Recorder of
London, Term. Hill. 11 mo. Car. I. they charged him, 1. For directing the Lord
in setting up the Kings Standard, and impressing men against the Scots. 2. For
promoting Ship Money, the Loan, and Tonnage, and Poundage. 3. For prosecuting
seditious Libellers, Petitioners and Rioters. And 4. For procuring his Majesty
that noble entertainment 1641. upon his return from Scotland, from the City, to
amuse the Parliament. 5. For drawing and carrying on some more sober Petitions,
than were usual in those times, whereupon he retired to York, and thence to
Oxford, where he Sat in the Parliament, assisted in the Treaties, offering
always three things. 1. A Committee to state the differences. 2. A particular
consideration of those things wherein the people are to be relieved, and the
King supported. 3. A mutual Security against all future fears and jealousies.
For which services to his Country he was forced to quit it.

Robert Foster of the Temple, made Sergeant, and succeeding Sir R. Vernon as
Pusney Judge of the Commons bench 15. Car. I. Term. Hill. as the King signified
by Sir Io. Finch, for the good opinion he conceived of him, and the good report
he heard concerning him; discharging his place, notwithstanding the
disadvantage of succeeding so popular a man as Sir George Vernon was, and the
difficulty of pleasing, at that time, both Court and Country, with great
commendation (those persons agreeing in a Sympathy for him, that had an
Antipathy each to other) as he did, after twenty years trouble, the place of
Chief Justice of the Kings bench 12. Car. II. in the place of Sir Thomas Millet
a great sufferer (I think, that Sir Thomas Millot of Exon, who, with his Son,
paid at Goldsmiths-hall 871/.) and an excellent Justicer, who by years and
other infirmities, was disabled from exercising that place, though surviving
two of his successors) when it was time to prefer neither a Dunce nor a Drone,
but able and active men; such as he was, who could Fence as well at Law in his
elder years as at Sword and Buckler in his younger. The Land (upon its
wonderful settlement under his Majesty, and the never to be forgotten
disbanding of a twenty years standing Army) swarming with people that had been
Soldiers, too proud to beg, and too lazy to labor, and having never gotten,
or quite forgotten, all other Calling, but that of Eating, Drinking, and
Sleeping, and it being hard for Peace to feed all the idle months bred in War.
Sir Roberts severity broke their knots, (presuming much on their Felonies)
otherwise not to be united with the Sword of Justice, possessing his Majesty
against the frequent granting of Pardons, as prejudicial to Justice, rendering
Judges obnoxious to the contempt of insolent Malefactors; so by the deserved
death of some hundreds, preserving the lives of, and lively-hoods of more
thousands. He died 1663/4.

as office, being as severe for executing the Laws (witness his several checks
given Justices, the great observators of Law and Peace, to whom he would urge
that of King James in his Speech in the Star Chamber, That he did respect a
good Justice of the Peace, as he did those next his person, as much as a Privy
Counselor) as his predecessor was for executing Malefactors; and as strict in
bringing up ancient Habits and Customs, both of the Inns of Courts, and the
Courts of Justice, as in keeping up the ancient Justice and Integrity,
following Sir Nicholas Hyde, I think his Fathers, steps (according to the
observation, that Lawyers seldom dye without a Will, or an Heir) who died
1631. as Sir Robert died 1665. Judge Foster and he dying suddenly, if any do
so that dye preparedly. As did about the same time.

Sergeant Hodskins, a very witty, as well as a very judicious man, Thuanus his
Father was, Vt bonus a Calumniatoriobus, tenuiores a potentioribus, doctos ab
Ignorantibus opprimi non pateretur. As Judge Walter used to say, when Baron
Denham his associate in the Western Circuit would tell him, My Lord, you are
not merry enough, merry enough for a Judge. So Sergeant Hodskins, when observed
very pleasant for one of his years, would reply, As cheerful as an honest man.
(Henry Hodskins and John Hodskins of Dors. paid for their Loyalty 571l.) The
Sergeant changed his temper with his capacity, most free as a private friend,
and most grave and reserved as a public person.

David Ienkins, upward of 58. years, a Student in Gray's Inn near London, of so
much skill, when a private and young man, that my Lord Bicon would make use of
his Collections in several Cases, digesting them himself; and of so much repute
in his latter years, that Attorney Noy, Herbert, and B^nks, would send the
several Cases they were to Prosecute for his Majesty, to be perused by him,
before they were to be produced in Court. All the preferment he arrived at, was
to be Judge of South Wales, a place he never sought after, nor paid for the
Patent, being sent him without his knowledge, and confirmed to him without his
charge; in which capacity, if Prerogative of his dear Master, or the Power of
his beloved Church, came in his way, stretching themselves beyond the Law, he
would retrench them; though suffering several checks for the one, and
Excommunication for the other: Notwithstanding that, he (heart of Oak) hazarded
his life for the just extent of both, for being taken prisoner at the surprise
of Hereford, and for his notable Vindication of the Kings Party and Cause, by
those very Laws (to the undeceiving of thousands) that were pretended against
them, as the violators of the Law; particularly for aiding the King 25. Edw. 3.

instilling successfully into the latter principles of Allegiance, by showing
them that all the Parliamentary Ordinances for Indemnity and Arrears, were but
blinds for the present, amounting not to Laws which they could trust to for the
future, without his Majesty's concurrence; whose Restoration he convinced them
was their unavoidable interest, as well as their indispensable duty; carried
first to the Chancery, secondly, to the King's Bench, and at last, to the Bar of
their House, the authority, of all which places he denied, and though he and

6000 l. and paying for him in way of composition 2000 l. besides the many
troubles he endured for him (among others, many years absence from his dear and
sick Wife:) and the several services he performed to him, the last whereof was
his appearance a Civil Lawyer to assist his Majesty at the Treaty at the Isle
of Wight, whence returning home sad (a sunk heart cannot be buoyed up again) he
dyed at Cheswicke Middles on the Lord's Day, and in effect in the Church 1648.

married to two Gentlemen of his Name and Kindred.

Sir Thomas Reeves, born at Little-langton in Dorset-shire, and bred in
New-Colledge in Oxford, Dr. Ducks Colleague at the Treaty in the Isle of Wight,
Judge Advocate, and Dr. Zouch his Colleague in the Admiralty, so well skilled
in Common Law, as well as Civil, and in Divinity as both, that he could have
practiced at Westminster as well as Doctors-Commons, and at the Pulpit of St.
Paul's as well as the Consistory; being capable of the Ministry-maintenance, for
which he pleaded with much Law and Learning, more Reason and Equity in his
Vicars plea. A plea, says my Author, oftener made than heard, oftener heard than
pityed, and oftener pityed than redressed, so unequal is the contest between a
poor Vicars plea, and wealthy Impropriators purse. His general Learning and
polite Latin (no hair hanging at the neb of his Pen) appears in his most
critical Books of Sea Fights, his Valor (though Ancient) in our late Wars gave
good evidence of its self in several Land-battels. Dr. Duck in the trial of
combat between the Lord Rey and Ramsey 1631. before the Earl Marshal, spoke in
the Kings behalf as if he would, as he did afterward suffer for him, and Dr.
Reeves in my Lord Reys behalf, as if he had not been his Advocate onley but his
Second. He dyed where he was born 1652.

Sir John Lamb, a man of his name so calm in public, that none saved him,
exposing indeed his Person to a Parliament, but (as the like accident preferred
Sir Walter Raleigh) discovering his parts, so that Bishop Williams brought him
off from his troubles, and on to his Preferment. First getting him Knighted,
and then advanced to the Deanery of the Arches: Sir John being opposed by the
Bishop about an Officials place in Leicester, which he carried against him,
fell fowl with him about Puritans, whom the Bishop indulged, and Sir John
prosecuted, though both at last suffered by them, Sir John hardly seven times
in these Wars escaping for his life at his House in Northamptonshire, whence
coming to hide himself in London, he dyed in the Bell-Inn in St. Martins lane
London, sundry losses by plunder, having paid after for composition 628 l.

Sir Henry Martin, born in London, bred in New-Colledge Oxford, l. a year,
which made him a Student; where as he would say 80 l. would have made him a
Gentleman, pleading in his Chamber by Bishop Andrews advice (who directed him
to the study of the Civil Law) the important Causes transmitted to him weekly
from Lambeth; he attained to a great faculty in amplifying and aggravating,
extenuating any thing at the Court, wherefore he became an eminent Advocate in
the High Commission (no Cause coming amiss to him, who was not now to make new
Armor, but to buckle on the old; not to invent, but to apply Arguments to his
Client) and was made Judge of the Prerogative for Probate of Wills, and of the
Admiralty, in Causes concerning Foreign Trade, whence King James would say
pleasantly of him, That he was a mighty Monarch in his Jurisdiction over Land
and Sea; the living and the dead, in the number; of which last he was for fear
and grief 1642.

Dr. Thomas Eden, born at Ballington-Hall in Essex, Fellow and Trinity-Hall in
Cambridge, where he always concurred with the old Protestants in his Votes; (in
censuring extravagant Sermons, etc.) and joined issue with them in his
suffering, only he that was so excellent an Advocate for others, pleaded so
well for himself, that he was permitted to dye in Cambridge, where he bestowed

1000 l. (since nothing was left him to live on elsewhere, his Places of
Chancellor of Ely, Commissary of Sudbury and Westminster, Professor of Law in
Gresham-Colledge, being Sequestered) as he did 1646. leaving Sir James Bunce a
great Agent and sufferer for his Majesty, being twelve years banished, his
Executor; on this score, being an utter stranger to him: Sir James asking the
Doctors advice about a ^lause in a Will wherein he was Executor, and being told
by him that it was capable of a double sense, replied, Tell me what you think
in your Conscience is the very mind of the Testator, which I am resolved
whatever it cost me to make good. Dr. Cowel observed of Dr. Eden, that had a
happy name, which commends to a Favorite that might be easily pronounced.

Morrison and Dr. Goad, both of Kings, great Civilians, and great sufferers,
the first a great friend of Bishop Williams, the second of Bishop Laud, at
first the Faction was not perfect in the art of persecution, being more loose
and favorable in their language of Subscriptions; but afterward grew so
punctual and particular therein, that the persons to whom they were tendered
must either strangle their Consciences with the acceptance, or lose their
Estates for the refusal thereof.

Richard Lane, a Gentleman not lost in the retiredness of a good judgment; but
being able to expose his merit as well as gain it by a quick fancy, sending
before a good Opinion of himself, to make way for his Person, with this
Caution, That he took care he should not sink with two great an expectation.
Whence in an Assembly, wherein they used to Epithet every man with reference to
their most obvious defects or virtues, he was called Tho. Wary; and with good
reason, he keeping his converse as among Superiors within the compass, modesty,
and reverence, so among equals within the Rules of a sweet and honest respect;
it being, he said, both to command our own Spirits, and endear our friends, a
great art not to be too familiar, or presume too much on the goodness of other
natures, upon that of a man's own; besides, that he thought it injustice to give
our familiars the froth of our Parts, reserving the more solid part for
strangers, though he exposed not his good humors but upon an equal Theater, a
man's esteem rising not from showing himself, but from keeping himself regular
and equal, as well in mean and common, as in great and extraordinary actions,
pretending to nothing he had not, left being discovered (albeit when once men
have a good opinion, they seldom take pains to disabuse themselves) he might be
suspected in what he had, and being sure of Correspondents, knowing that a
single interest or abilities would sink under Court-affairs. He was preferred
the Princes Solicitor and Attorney in the best times, and his Father Keeper of
the Seal in the worst, not parting from his Majesty till he did with his own
soul; dying with a good Conscience abroad, with more comfort, than if he had
dyed with a good Estate at home; having discharged his place under a distressed
Sovereign with much courage as well as skill, leaving this opinion behind, that
Projectors of new Engines were not to be too much encouraged in a populous
Country, since by easing many of their labor, they out more of their
livelihood, and so though beneficial to private persons, are pernicious to the
public, to which what imployeth most, is most advantageous.

John Bennet, as much persecuted by the Parliament, as by the High Commission.

THE Life and Death OF Dr. WILLIAM JUXON, Lord Archbishop of Canterbury;
BOrn at Chichester in Sussex, and bred in St. John's College in Oxford,
whereof he was Fellow and President; his deep and smooth parts (as appears by
his Speeches and Poetry on public Occasions, particularly on King James his
death) exceeding his years, and yet his modesty and other virtues so exceeding
as to hide his Parts, had not he been discovered for Preferment by the Perfume
of his worth, as the Roman Gentleman was by the sweet Odor of his Clothes for
punishment. Bishop Laud had taken great notice of his Parts and Temper when he
was Fellow with him, but greater of his Integrity and policy, when a stickler
(in the Suit about President-ship of the College) against him. When observing
him a shrewd Adversary, he thought he might be a good Friend, being though
Doctor of Law, yet a great Master of Divinity, all hearing him Preach with
great pleasure and profit, so much he had of Paul and Apollos, of learned
plainness, and an useful elaborateness: when he preached (says one that heard
him) Of Mortification, Repentance, and other Christian Practicks, he did it
with such a stroke of unaffected Floquence, of potent Demonstration, and
irresistible Conviction, that jew Agrippaes, Festaes, or Felixes, that heard,
but must needs for the time and fit, be almost persuaded to be penitent and
mortified Christians. Dr. Laud finding him shining in each place, he was as the
Divine Lights in their Orbs without noise, his Birth so Gentile, that it was no
disgrace to his Parts, though not so Illustrious, but that his Parts might be
an Ornament to him; his Virtues so modest, that they hid themselves from
others, and so humble, that they were not known to himself: A temper as little
moved with others injuries, as with his own merits; fit to Rule others, that
commanded its self; Recreations Innocent and manly, traversing Hills and Dales
for Health and for Instruction, studying God at home, and Nature abroad;
fitting himself by generous Exercises for generous Employments, to which he
knew a body comely, quick, and vegel with Exercise, was more suitable than a
mind dulled with studies. Though when he came to his Throne, over affections,
the Pulpit, or his Chair of State, over reason his College, it appeared that
his severe pleasures that refreshed his body, loosned; but melted not his
mind. I say, sagacious Dr. Laud, finding him every way, rather than designing
him, his successor, brought him out of his privacy, as Pearls and rich metals
are out of obscurity, to adorn his Majesty's Court, his modesty gaining him
that respect which others seek by their ambition. To have one near the King he
could trust in his old age, made him Dean of Worcester, and Clerk of the Closet
first, after that Bishop elect of Hereford, and then after himself Bishop of
London, and Lord Treasurer. In the first of which places, being to have Saint
Paul's combat with Beasts, he used Saint Paul's art, became all things to all,
and as those that were of old exposed to Beasts, overcame by yielding, being
most mild, and most vigilant; a Lamb, and a Shepherd. The delight of the
English Nation, whose Reverence was the only thing all Factions agreed in, all
allowing that honor to the sweetness of his manners, that some denied the
sacredness of his Function; being by love, what another is in pretense, an
universal Bishop; the greatest, because the last Bishop that was ruined, that
insolence that stuck not at the other Bishops, out of modesty, till 1649. not
meddling with him. The other charge of Which no Clergyman held since Bishop
Gray, who was Lord Treasurer 9. Edw. 4.
Treasurer (whereby all lay upon him, both what the good Worship, and the bad
Religion, and Money, which was now safe under the Keys of the Church) so the
Romans Treasury was in their Temple, and the Venetians have the one Guardian of
their City and Money, St. Mark) he in the midst of large Expenses, and low
Revenues, managed with such integrity, handling temporal wealth with the same
holy temper he did the most spiritual Mysteries, that the Coffers he found
empty, he in four years left filling; and with such prudent mildness, being
admirably master of his Pen, and Passions, grace having ordered what nature
could not omit, the tetrarch humor of Choler. That Petitioners for money (when
it was not to be had) departed well pleased with his civilly languaged denials,
and though a Bishop was then odious, and a Lord always suspected, yet he in
both capacities was never questioned; though if he had, he had come out of his
trial like his gold, having this happiness, in an age of the bravest men, to
see more innocent than the best, and happier than the greatest; and if it was a
comfort to them to suffer for their too great, and to the Commonalty unknown,
and therefore suspected virtues; it was more to him, to be loved for that
integrity, which could be unk^own to few, and hateful to none.

He was above others in most of his actions, he was above himself in two.

1. His honest advice to save my Lord of Straffords life, who having appeared
before a Parliament, was set at last before him; who though he heard Noblemen,
yea Clergymen too, pressing his death for the safety of the people, the
highest law, they said, the King, the Church, the Commonwealth; asserting his
life by law and right, which is above all these: And that brave Maxim, like
another Athanasius of Justice against the world. Fiat justitia, and ruat coelum
and terra; Ecclesia and Respublica.

2. His holy attendance on his late Majesty (who gave him the title on his
death of That honest man, whereof before in his Majesty's Life and Death.
Recollecting there all his virtues, to see what the excellent King, with a
recollection of all graces, was to suffer; with a clear countenance, at least,
before his Majesty, choosing to disturb nature, rather than the King, looking on
what his Majesty, with a cheerful countenance, endured. Thus the Sun at our
Saviors Passion (whereof this a Copy) that was Ecclipsed to others, shined
clear to Christ. It was much to see the King dye with so undaunted a spirit; it
was more to see the Bishop behold him with so unmoved a countenance; but so it
became him, whom his Majesty had chosen his Second, in that great Duel,
committing to him the care of his soul, both departing in himself, and
surviving in his Son; and with it his memory, and what was more, his Oblivion;
with which, and the other holy suggestions of that Royal soul, he came down
from the Scaffold, as Moses did out of the Mount, with Pardon, Peace, and New
Law to a sinful people, after the breaking of the old.

After God had preserved him through the many years mise^ies of the usurpation,
and the inexpressible torment of ^his disease, the Stone, which he endured as
cheerfully as he did his pleasures; having patience to bear those pains, which
others had not patience to hear of, to deliver that message to the Son, which
he received from the Father, he Crowned King Charles II. April 25. 1661. at
Westminster, and went June 1663. to see King Charles I. Crowned in heaven;
having seen the Church Militant here settled 1662. he was made a Member of the
Triumphant 1663. full not only of honor and days, but of his own wishes too;
leaving near 10000 l. to augment the St. John's Revenue at Oxford College,
Repair St. Paul's and Cant^rbury Cathedrals, and finish the building of the
New-hall at Lambeth which he had begun; besides directions throughout the
Province to repair Churches and Church-aedisices, improve Vicarages, and
establish peace. July 9. he was buried in St. John's, with as great solemnity as
the University could afford; Dr. South making an excellent Oration upon the
occasion in the Divinity Schools, and Dr. Levens of St. John's, the like in the
College; Crete being not more proud of the Grave and Cradle of Jove, nor the
King of Spain of the Suns rising and setting in his Dominions, than that House
may be that Dr. Iuxon and Dr. Laud was bred there. As he had gone on in the
same course, acted on the same principles, enjoyed the same honors, so he lies
in the same Grave, with his friend and patron Archbishop Laud.

Dr. Walter Curle, born in Strafford near Hatfield, my Lord Cecil's Scots, as
his Agent; and in settling the estate he had from the Queen of England, as his
Steward. And by whom he was made Auditor of the Court of Wards to Queen
Elizabeth and King James, and his Son preferred in Christ-Colledge and
Peter-house in Cambridge. His Lord gave him a good Living, as a Scene of his
abilities, and his good carriage in that place, (wherewas no quarrel grown into
a Lawsuit during his time, where he did nothing below his Function, and
something in a resolute suppressing of all houses of debauchery above it,
regulating the dis^rders he found there, by the rules of Christian piety, and
the known measures of Laws, gaining many dissenters from the Church by wise and
meek discourses, and by a good example leaving the obstinate to the wise and
merciful disposition of the Laws) commended him to his Majesty's immediate
service, as Chaplain; who preferred him to the Deanery of Lichfield, in which
capacity he was Prolocutor of the Convocation 1628. afterward made Bishop of
Rochester 1628. and then Bath and Wells 1629. upon his friend and
contemporaries death Bishop Maw, and at last of Winchester, after his Patron
Bishop Neils Translation to York; a charitable He was Lord (...) to King
Charles 1.
reliever in all places of Gods poor, his living Temples; and a careful
repairer of his Temples and Houses, his dead poor. Much maliced, because a
strict asserter of the Churches authority, yet not hurt, because wary in the
exercise of his own; insomuch, that at the yielding of Winchester, where he was
during the war, Peter's and the Faction, that hated his Function, were very
civil to his person; having ignorance enough not to understand his worth, and
not malice enough to disparage it. After he had given most of his estate to his
Master, and lost the rest, promoting the Polyglot Bible, and any thing that
seemed serviceable to the afflicted Church; He died 1650. deserving the
character of one of his Bishop ^ush, Harps^ield Hist. Eccles. Aug. 15. ^aecul^

and after the discharge of some Offices there, that are bestowed on the
deserving, both as rewards and trials, Fellow of All Souls. 4. Employed as
Proctor of the University, where the comeliness of his presence, the gentleness
of his carriage, the variety and smoothness of his learning, brought him first
to the notice, and then to the service of the most learned and eloquent Earl of
Dorset, who recommended him to his Majesty, first for his own service as
Chaplain, and after he made him Dean of Christ-Church, for his Sons the Princes
and the Dukes of York as Tutor, to whom the Countess of Dorset was Governness;
managing that trust by very prudential Lectures in his own person, and by the
pleasant Instructions of the choices wits in the University, as Mr. Cartwright,

Bishopric of Salisbury; and his great sufferings with, and services (at
Oxford, where he set Dr. Hammond and others to vindicate the King and Church,
and at the Isle of Wight, where by his excellent Converse and Sermons he
comforted his Majesty himself) for King Charles I. made him capable of many
Letters of Trust (one about supplying the Church with new Bishops upon the
decay of the old, about which service his Lordship and four more (whereof the
Reverend Bishop King was one) had several Consultations and Propositions from
Charles II. during the Usurpation, and of the Bishopric of Winchester, and the
noble places of Prelate of the Garter, and Lord Almoner, after the
Restoration. When having seen the two things he so much desired to see, his
Sovereign restored to his Crown, and the Church to her Rights, he departed in
peace, April 1662. leaving (besides the charity of his Sovereign, which he
disposed of to suitable objects) great Legacies to Christ-church and All Souls
in Oxford, to the Cathedrals of Chichester, Salisbury, and Winchester; and a
conspicuous Monument of his charity, the Almes-house at Richmond, the place of
his last retirement, erected at his peculiar charge, together with his
exemplary virtues.

1. His excellent parts, and comely deportment, making him acceptable to the
King and Court (A man fit to stand before a King, Prove. 22. 29.) whilst able
to come thither; and when disabled, rendering him worthy several Royal Visits
made by his Majesty to him in person, both to see him in his weakness, and to
comfort him amidst his pains; kneeling at his beds side a little before he
died, and begging his blessing, which he bestowed, with one hand laid upon his
Masters head, and the other lifted up to heaven.

2. His bountiful heart as large as his fortune, his generous way of living and
hospitable table.

3. A free and open disposition, E^^s. de Aug.

1648.) aiming not at the delight of the Ear, but the information of the
Conscience.

Dr. William Roberts, Fellow of Queens-colledge in Cambridge, and Laud by his
activity under Bishop Bayley, in enjoying Church Discipline, and preferred by
him for discovering 1000 l. concealed Church-goods. He was made Bishop of
Bangor 1637. sequestered of all his estate spiritual and temporal 1649. restored
1660. and died 1664. being succeeded by Bishop Price, Colonel Price of Rhulas

1. Baffling the Itenerants, particularly Vavaser Powell, at the Disputation in
Montgomeryshire, where he rendered him as ridiculous by his false Latin, no
Logic, and little Sense, as he was before odious.

2. Rightly principling the most ingenious young Scholars of those times.

3. Keeping up the Offices and Ceremonies of the Church.

4. Maintaining a good correspondence with the Orthodox at London, and among
the Gentlemen of the Country; for which services, and his sufferings, he was
Consecrated Bishop of Saint Asaph, October 28. 1660. in which place he died
1666. Being observed a discreet and moderate man in all Convocations, as in
that 1640. when he made a motion for a new Edition of the Welsh Bible, set out
sixty years ago by Bishop Morgan, but in several places misprinted; which I
would some again consider of: And in the Convocation 1662. when he concurred
effectually in drawing up the Act of Uniformity, and making the alterations in
the Commonprayer, then set out; the form for Baptizing those of riper years,
being, I think, of his composing.

for protesting against the Laws that Passed in Parliament, during the tumults;
and one of the two, that for his painfulness and integrity, for his moderation
and wariness, had the most favorable imprisonment for that protestation, being
Committed only to the Black-rod, while the rest went to the Tower. His virtues
having indeed the vices of the times for his enemies, but not the men.

George Cook, a meek and grave man, Brother to Secretary Cook, in temper as
well as blood, born at Trusley in Derbyshire, bred in Pembroke-hall Cambridge,
Beneficed at Bigrave in Hertfordshire, where three houses yielded him almost
300 l. a year, advanced to the Bishopric of Bristol 1632. and to that of
Hereford 1636. wherein he died 1650. much beloved by those that were under him,
and yet much persecuted about the protest in Parliament 1641. and other
matters, by those that where above him; insomuch, that he, who was thrist it
self, had wanted, had not his Relations helped out his merit; and he been as
Honorable, as Pious and Learned. He dropped Sentences as easily, as others
spoke sense; happy in expressing as well as conceiving (though as Plotin, he
was (...), wholly taken up with his mind) a serene and quiet man above the
storm, the result of that unsettledness of lower minds.

Dr. John Towers, born in Northfolk, bred in Cambridge, Fellow Queens College,
Chaplain to Will. Earl of Northampton, and by his Donation Rector of
Castle-Ashby in Northamptonshire; and upon his recommendation Chaplain to King
Charles the I. successively Dean and Bishop of Peterborough; he endeavored to
put the humors of the times out of countenance, by acting of them in his
younger days, and by punishing them in his elder; but both failing, dying about
1650. under great torments in his body, and great afflictions from the times,
he suffered cheerfully what he could not amend effectually, thereby showing
that he could suffer as handsomely as he could act; When rich only in Children

of Trinity College in Cambridge, as he was afterward by Bishop Andrews,
Bishop Vaughan, and Bishop Williams made successively Prebendary of Windsor,
Dean of Rochester, and Bishop of Gloucester 1624. maintaining several Heterodox
Opinions in his Sermons at Court, for which he was checked 1626. dissenting
from the Canons 1640. for which after three admonitions (pronounced by Bishop
Laud in half an hour) to subscribe, he was to his great honor imprisoned; and
of all the Bishops since the Reformation, was the only man whom the
miscarriages of the Protestants Scandalled into Popery, a harmless man, pitiful
to the poor, Hospitable to his Neighbors, and compassionate to dissenters:

make his; he gave directions in one Draught how Impropriations might be
recovered to the Church, to make it much the richer, and no man a jot the
poorer. He was a great incourager of Sir Henry Middletons design of bringing
the New River-water, through so many difficulties to London, as David's Worthies
did the Water of Bethlem to his Majesty: (...), without which says one, we
should have burnt with the thirst, and been buried with the filth of our own

Dr. John Warner, born in St. Clements Danes Westminster, bred in Magdalen
College Oxford, to which he is a great Benefactor, preferred Prebend of the
Church of Canterbury (to which he gave a Font most Curious and most Costly, the
first gift by a private hand to that Church in latter times) and Rector of St.
Dyonis Back. Church London, on which he bestowed a yearly Pension, advanced
Lord Bishop of Rochester, in which he built an Almshouse with 20 l. a year a

Sequestered of all his Spiritual Estate, and compounding for his Temporal, which
being very great by his Father a Citizen of Londons thrift, and greater by his
own (who would say for his frugal and close way, that he eat the craggy Necks
of Mutton, that he might leave the poor the Shoulder) enabled him to relieve

John Ganden a Ministers Son in Essex, bred first at College Cambridge, and
afterward Tutor to the Strangwayes in Wadham College in Oxford, by the
comeliness of his Person, the vastness of his Parts; strangely improved by his
astronishing industry, bestowing most of the seasonable hours of day and night
on study, and the unseasonable ones, on Mechanisms; (to keep his soul always
intent, as appears, by making the exquisite Commonplace Cabinet, with other
Rarities of his own left behind him) the majesty and copiousness of his
Elocution, the seriousness and greatness of his Spirit, admitted him with
advantage upon an Act-Sunday to the Pulpit at St. Mary's, upon a solemn

Relations, affecting his great accomplishments recommended him, and after one
Marriage that intervened, providence made way for him) and the Earl of Warwick

Essex 1644. thirdly, at the Temple London 1659. and at the Bishopric of Exet^r

about the King and Church; the first of whom he vindicated in a pathetick
Remonstrance delivered the General, the second he asserted vigorously in its
Doctrine and Discipline, in his Hieraspistes 1653. pleaded for seriously in its

Discourses in Parliament; many young Noblemen, as Mr. Richard, Heir apparent
to the Earldom of Warwick, etc. had their Education in his Family; more
Scholars and Clergymen owe their parts to his direction; several Citizens were
enriched by his Correspondence, who was as great a Merchant as a Scholar, as
great a Courtier and Statesman as either; and indeed, the great Restoration
was not a little furthered by his universal acquaintance and ubiquitary
activity not be paralleled, but by his Brother Mr. Gauden his Majesty's
Purveyor for the Navy, an employment to be managed by no one man with such an
universal satisfaction as it is now, but by himself: and 1668. they say Sheriff
of London. In fine, he was born for great things, having such a Copia verborum,
and those so full, pregnant, and significant, joined with such an active fancy,
as rarely accompanyeth so sound a Judgment and so deep an Understanding; Such a
public Spirit and ready Parts, that besides the many motions, he made for the

see into the depth, and soon turn round all the sides of business, so as to be
full and clear in his Resolutions and Debates, dexterous in his advice upon all
straits, his Learning being so concocted into an active wisdom, that he was fit
for any Employment, understanding things so well at first sight, that he seldom
had a second thought, generally standing to the resolution and determination of

stateliness of his Speech, the ingenuity, aptness, freedom, and gravity of his

beauty well dressed, or goodness appearing in a fair and cheerful Summers day,
becoming him as smiling does a good Man, and a good Conscience, or flouring a
laughter as we say does a generous, pleasant, and spiritful liquor; the apt
facetiousness of his native and fluent Wit, making way in converse for his more
serious and weighty Conception, as did his Catholic love, tender of all (even
(as appears by his discourse of the Oaths imposed upon them) of the poor
Quakers themselves) but fond of worthy and good men, that he picked up all over

and satisfying the dissenting Brethren.
in Cambridge, and Lord Bishop of Chester, well known in the late times by his
clear resolutions of the Cases in difference between the King and Parliament,
between our Church and Rome on the one hand, and Geneva on the other, in all
which there were such weight of Arguments, such clearness of Expression, and
such piety and seriousness of Spirit, that two Adversaries confessed that that
Cause never looked so clearly and devoutly in any writings as in Dr. Ferns, and
as well known by his Sermons at Oxford, then pressing Humiliations, holy Vows
and Resolutions, and at Cambridge and London, pressing the keeping of those
Vows: He dyed within few Months after he was made Bishop 1661. being buried at
Westminister without any other Monument than his Name, of whom I may say:

Dr. William Bedle, bred in Emanuel College in Cambridge, preferred Henry
Wotton as Chaplain of his Embassy to Venice, at the same time that Mr. James
Wadsworth his entire friend, bred in the same College, and Bene^iced in the
same Diocese with him, was sent with another Ambassador into Spain, Mr. Bedle
as Sir Henry Wootton testified (upon Bishop Vshers recommendation of him from a
private Minister in Suffolk, for many years to the Provostship of Dublin
College) to King Charles the I. behaved himself so well, that Padre Paulo took
him into his own bosom, with whom he did command the inwardest thought of his
heart, from whom he professed to have received more knowledge in all
Divivinity, both Scholastical and positive, than from any he had conversed with
in his days: Mr. Wadsworth (though the most zealous Protestant of the two)
miscarryed so far, that he turned Papist; Mr. Hall, afterward Bishop Hall,
accosted him with a loving Letter, but Mr. Bedle (upon Mr. Wadsworths opening
to him the Motives of his Conversion, which he would not to Mr. Hall) with
solid Arguments to be seen in their mutual Letters extant, which are
Controversies of love and Meekness, as well as Religion; much was the
expectation it seems by a Letter of Mr. Hall to him, his Parts and Conferences
had raised; and great the satisfaction he gave when Bishop of Kilmore to that
expectation by his Christian temper, his great repute for Learning and Zeal,
his strict Life, observing exactly the Ember-weeks, the Canonical hours, the
Feasts and Fast-days of the Church, besides his private Devotion, his Patience
and Charity so exemplary, that the very Romanists, whereof not a few in his
Diocese did ever look upon him with respect and Reverence, testifying it by
concealing and safe protecting his Person in the Horrid Rebellion in Ireland,
when they could not secure his excellent Books and Writings, among whom the
Bible in Irish Translated by him, with many years Labor, Conference, and
Study: He dyed 1642/3.

John Hales, born, as I take it, in Kent, bred Fellow of Merton College
Oxford, where he was Greek Professor, preferred first Chaplain to Sir Dudley
Carleton, when he was at the Hague about the business of the Synod at Dort,
whereof being sent thither to that purpose, he writ a daily and exact account
completed as appears in his Remains by Dr. Balcanquell; and where upon
Episcopius his well-pressing of 3 John 16. he would say, There I bid John
Calvin good night: and then Fellow of Eaton, and Prebendary of Windsor; in the
first, of which places he was Treasurer which is strange, such his Integrity
and Charity to his loss in point of Estate; and Fellow, such his prudence in
avoiding the Oaths of the times without any snare to his Conscience. A Person
of so large a capacity, so sharp, quick, piercing, and subtle a Wit, of so
serene and profound a judgment beyond the ordinary reach, built upon
unordinary notions, raised out of strange observations, and comprehensive
thoughts within himself, and so astonishing an industry, that he became the
most absolute Master of Polite, Various, and Universal Learning, besides a deep
insight into Religion; in the search after which he was Curious, and of the
knowledge of it studious, as in the practice of it, (The best way to understand
Christian Religion, is to observe it, we learn by doing those things we learn
to do) sincere, being as strictly just in his dealings, so extraordinarily
kind, sweet, affable, communicative, humble and meek in his converse; so
inimitably as well as unusually charitable, giving away all he had but his
choice Books, and forced to sell them at last: That he was as good a man as he
was a great Scholar; and to use the Reverend Dr. Pearsons words of him, It was
near as easy a task for any one to become so knowing as so obliging. He had so
long, and with such advantage and impartiality judged of all Books, Things, and
Men, that he was the Oracle consulted by all the Learned men in the Nation, Dr.
Hammond, Mr. Chillingworth, etc. in Cases that concerned either, whereupon he
used to say of Learned men's Letters, That they set up tops, and he must whip
them for them. Its pity he was so averse, notwithstanding so general an
importunity, from communicating his great thoughts by writing partly from an
humor he had, as his intimate friend Mr. Faringdon observes, to draw the Model
of things in his head, and never write till he needs must, and partly from his
growing and unlimited thoughts; but chiefly from the exactness he required in
others, (taking a great liberty its seems by Dr. P. of judging not of others,
but for himself) and exacted of himself, being seldom pleased with his own Only
Mr. Faringdon says he spoke of his Sermon, Di^i Custodia^^, with complacency.
performances, that there are no Monuments of his Learning (save the great
Scholars made by his directions and assistance) extant but Sir H. Savile;
Chrysostom, which he corrected with great pains in his younger days, and
illustrated with admirable Notes, for which he is often honorably mentioned by
Mr. Andrew Downs, Greet Professor of Cambridge, and a Collection of some choice
Sermons and Letters made by Master Garthwait.

Dr. William Chapel, a native of Lexington in Nottinghamshire, Christ-colledge
in Cambridge, upon Bishop Vshers importunity Provost of Trinity-colledge in
Dublin, and the Lord Deputies observation of him, Lord Bishop of Cork and
Rosse; a man of a very strict method, being an incomparable Logician; and of a
very strict life, being an excellent man, famous for his many and eminent
Pupils; more for the eminent Preachers, made so by his admirable method for the
Theory, and Praxis upon 2 Timothy 3. 16. for the practice of Preaching; so good a
disputant, as to be able to maintain any thing; but so honest a man, that he
was willing to maintain only, as he would call them sober truths. Harassed
between the Rebellion in Ireland and England, where it was imputed to Bishop
Laud as a crime, that he preferred Bishop Chapel, and to him that he was
preferred by him, being thought a Puritan before his preferment, and a Papist
afterward (though he was the same godly and orthodox man always) he died 1649.
dividing his estate equally between his relations, to whom he was obliged in
nature; and distressed Ministers, for whom he had compassion as a fellow^
sufferer; of whom I may say, as it was of Dr. Reynolds, that it must be a good
heart that kept so good a head employed, rather in rescuing old truths, than in
broaching new errors.

Dr. John Richardson extracted of an ancient and worshipful Family Cheshire,
brought up in Dublin, and made Bishop of Ardah in Ireland, peculiar for a very
grave countenance, and his being extraordinary textuary; by the same token,
that they who would not let him Preach on the Scripture in the late times,
desired his help to Comment upon it; for his is the painful Comment (in the
larger Annotations) upon Ezekiel. Many the gifts in these times bestowed upon
him, and much in Alms (his deep poverty abounding to the riches of liberaliy,
as our Savior relieved others, though living upon others relief himself) when
living; and considerable his Legacies, especially to Dublin-colledge, when
dead, which happened in the year of our Lord 1653. and of his age 74. being
observed never to have desired any preferment, but to have been sought for to
many; it being his rule to discharge his present place, well knowing that God
and good men use this method, viz. to make those, who have been faithful in a
little, Rulers over much; as he was, to the great benefit of the places he
came, where being as good and dexterous a Lawyer as Clerk, he compounded
Differences, discharged Annuities and Pensions, set up Presidents of Frugality,
built Houses that he long Inhabited not. Dido being feigned in love with Aeneis
when dead many years, to salve the Anticronism, it is said, it was with his
Picture; truly I never saw this Reverend Prelates Picture, but I was in love
with him for his Portracture sake in Paper, as I am with God for his Image sake
in him.

Mr. William Lyford Bachelor of Divinity, He proceeded 1631.
born and bred in Piesmer in Berk-shire, preferred first Fellow of
Magdalen-colledge (to which he restored in way of Legacy, what he had taken for
the resignation of his Fellowship (to his great grief many years) in a way of
bribe; and thence by the favor of the Earl of Bristol, who had a great value
for him, Minister of Sherburne; where he divided,

1. His people to two parts.

1. The weak, which he Catechized and Principled in the Doctrines of the
Church, for many years before the wars, whereof he drew a Scheme since.

2. The strong, whom he confirmed by his exact Sermons, his modesty visible in
his comely countenance, and the meekness and prudence of his spirit in his
courteous behavior.

2. His time, into nine hours a day, for Study, three for visits and
conferences, three for prayers and devotion, two for his affairs, and the rest
for his refreshment.

3. His estate into one third part, for the present necessity of his family,
another third part for future provision, and the third for pious uses; and his
Parish into twenty eight parts, to be visited in twenty eight days every month;
leaving knowledge where he found ignorance, justice where he found oppression,
peace where he found contention, and order where he found irregularity,
planting true Religion apart from all fond Opinions; the reason why, though I
have heard (at a solemn Assembly 1658. at Oxford) him charactered for a man of
an upright life, great gravity, and severity (by the same token, that it was
wondered there, that so holy a man, so much acquainted with God as he was,
should dote so much (these are their own words) on such sapless things, as a
King, Bishops, Common Prayer, and Ceremonies) and he to win them over, used
much their more innocent Phrases, Expressions, and Method; yet he suffered much
from the Faction in his Name and Ministry, dying 1653.

William Oughtred, a native Scholar and Fellow of Eaton, bred in Kings-colledge
Cambridge, and (his Mathematical Studies (wherein by Study and Travel he so
excelled, that the choicest Mathematicians of our age own much of their skill
to him, whose house was full of young As Sir William ^ackehouse son, Mr.
Stokes, Dr. Will. LLoyd, Mr. Arth, Haughton, who had much ado to prevail with
his modesty to publish his Trigonometria.
Gentlemen, that came from all parts to be instructed by him) leading him to a
retired and abstracted life) preferred only by Thomas Earl of Arundel to
Albury in Surrey, where having a strong persuasion upon principles of Art (much
confirmed by the Scheme of his Majesty's return in 1660. sent his Majesty some
years before by the Bishop of Avignon) that he should see the King restored; he
saw it to his incredible joy, and had his Dimittis a month after, June 30,
1660. and the 86. year of his age. Much requested to have lived in Italy,
France, Holland, when he was little observed in England; as facetious in Greek
and Latin, as solid in Arithmetique, Astronomy, and the sphere of all
Meatures, In the Mathematical way.
Music, etc. exact in his style, as in his judgment, handling his Cube, and
other Instruments at eighty, as steadily, as others did at thirty; owning his,
he said, to temperance and Archery, principling his people with plain and solid
truths, as he did the world with great and useful Arts, advancing new
Inventions in all things but Religion. Which in its old order and decency he
maintained secure in his privacy, prudence, (...)
meekness, simplicity, resolution, patience, and contentment.

Dr. Richard Stuart, a Gentleman of a great extraction and good education,

England, (where was born Mart^^ de Pate-shull, who being a Divine, was the best
Lawyer of his time, and Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; As he being a Lawyer

time, made successively Dean of Chichester, Provost of Eaton, Dean of Saint

where he Preached the excellent Sermon of Hezekia's Reformation in vindication
of ours, and a discreet propagator of it; having with that public spirited man
Sir Georg-Ratcliffe, gone very far in making an accommodation between the
Iansenists and the Reformed, a sit man for such a noble design, considering the
moderation of his principles; his breast being a Chancery for Religion, the
Sweetness of his Temper, the Acuteness and Depth of his Reason, the Charm of
his Rhetoric and Fancy (he having been formerly, upon all occasions, as great
a Poet and Orator, as he was then a Divine) and the full Smartness of his Style.

Dr. Io. Nicholas, a Wiltshire man, I suppose, in the late times Prebend of
Salisbury (where he excellently Preached Bishop Davenants Funeral Sermon) and
since Prebend of Westminster, and Dean of Saint Paul's, to whose piety and
moderation the Church is as much beholding, as the State to his Brother Sir
Edward Nicholas, who attended both his Majesty and his Father, as a faithful
Counselor and Secretary, in their best times and worst. A man in no Art or
Science showed its self formally, such his modesty; but all were eminently,
such his ability. He dying And buried, I think, in Salisbury.

He was very active and prudent in coporating with those Loyal persons that
attempted his Majesty's Restoration, and in assisting the Bishop of London in
the Churches Reformation 1662. being fetched up to London for his quick and
sweet way of managing Church Affairs, wherein he was so well instructed by his
Patron Bishop Morton, in his many years attendance upon him; and therefore no
wonder that his Majesty valued him so much, as to be willing to redeem his life
(they are his own words) with the exchange of one that had endeavored to
deprive him of his own; and sustain it (otherwise likely to perish in prison)
when his enemies had robbed him even of bread for his own mouth.

Dr. Nicholas Monk, Brother to his Grace the Duke of Albemarle, born of an
ancient Family in Potheridge Devonshire, and bred under an excellent Tutor in
Wadham-colledge in Oxford, being a Private, but well-beloved Minister in his
own Country, as his Brother was a private, but much observed Soldier in the
Low Countries; he came to serve God in the capacity of a Bishop in the Church,
as his Grace did to serve the King, in the highest capacity that ever Subject
did in the State. From Sir Hugh Pollard, Sir Thomas Stukley and others, he
being always loyally affected himself, he took a journey 1659. from Devonshire
to Scotland, conferring with Sir (...), and the good I expect from you, will

perform what he shall promise his Army (whereof he shall still keep the
Command) upon the word of a King, July 21. 1659.
John Greenvile, now Earl of Bath, in his way at London; and engaging Sir
Thomas Clerges, who conveyed him safe on Shipboard, so fully instructed how
to manage his negotiation with caution, that with Dr. Samuel Barrow, Sir R.
Knight, Dr. John Price, and Dr. Gumbles assistance, he was able to persuade his
Brother to march into England, upon Sir George Booths Declaration; and when
that failed, to send to Sir Thomas Clerges, to tell him, That if the Parliament
would assert their own authority against the Army, he would come into England
in their defense, as he did under that color to their ruin; his Reverend
Brother in the mean time transacting an exact correspondence between him, and
all the West of England; particularly, recommending to him Sir William Maurice,
as a faithful and prudent Counselor. For which services he was made Provost of
Eaton, and Bishop of Hereford, where he died 1661.

Dr. William Paul, born I think that (...) who was taken up 30. years after his

a Citizen of London in East-cheap; All Souls in Oxford, an accute Scholar. I
have heard Dr. Barlow say, that he answered the Act, when proceeding Doctor,
the most satisfactorily of any person he heard, and he heard many in his time;
and his Sermon a little before the wars (upon that Text, Then Paul stood upon
Mars-hill, and said, I perceive, that in all things ye are too superstitious)
at an Episcopal Visitation of Oxfordshire, was extraordinary. Minister of
Brightwell in Oxfordshire for thirty years, Prebend of Chichester, Dean of
Lichfeld, and Bishop of Oxford 1663. dying there 1665. A shrewd man in
business, whether of Trade, Husbandry, Buying and Improving of Land, Disposing
of Money; carrying a great command over the factious about him by his money
(which he could lend to advantages, to the most considerable men of that party)
in those sad times, when others of his Order submitted to them; exceedingly
well versed in the Laws of the Church and the Land, and admirably well seen in
the Intrigues and Interest of State.

Dr. Matthew Wren, born near Cheap Side in London, descended Northumberland,
brought up in Pembroke-hall in Cambridge; where the accuteness of his
Philosophy Act (before King James, when he distinguished upon his Majesty, that
his Dogs might perform more than others by the Prerogative) pleased his
Majesty, and with other learned performances known to the Bishop, recommended
him to be Chaplain to Bishop Andrews; his Education under him furnished him
with such experiences in the affairs of the Church and State, that he was
advanced Chaplain to Prince Henry, and his painful, but exact Preaching in that
Court, brought him to Prince Charles his service, his prudent conduct of the
religious part of their Journey into Spain, made his way to King James his own
service, as afterward to King Charles; where in his he had, 1. Two Parsonages
to exercise his charity upon the poor, his munificence upon the Churches,
Houses, and Housekeeping; and his excellent arts of Government upon the
people. 2. One Prebendary, to enter him into Church affairs. 3. The Master-ship

exactly, according to the old Injunctions of the Realm, the Canons of the
Church, and the Laws and Statutes of the place; of all which, his Visitation
Articles were an exact Collection. For which, by men ignorant and impatient, he
was cried down into Prison, without ever being heard, for fifteen years
together, by a Parliamentary power; and by the same power (as St. Paul, Act.
16. 39. was entreated out of his bonds, by them that put him in) discharged
out, out-living by a strong constitution, used to hardship, never seeing Fire
in the coldest time, nor bating the hardest Meat in his weakest years; seldom
a bed till eleven a clock at night, and always up at five in the morning, at
his hours walk, without either Fire or Candle, and continual Study diverting
his thoughts, whereof his Accurate and Critical Vindication of the Scripture
against the Socinian Glosses, is a very great instance, Printed at the end of
the Critica Sacra, a small part of a vast Treasure of such choice observations.
If he discoursed, he did it to his last, with a vast comprehension and memory
of particular and minute circumstances, though at never so great a distance of
time or place. If he had relation to any College, as he had to Peter-house,
and Pembroke-hall, and, I think, St. John's Cambridge as Visitor, and
Charter House as Governor, he looked to the concernments of each place
narrowly, he encouraged hopeful men in them bountifully, and kept up the
interest of the Church, as he did every where, strictly; if it was a time of
Parliament or Convocation, he attended them carefully and constantly; for he
knew that a Vote may sometimes save or loose a kingdom. (C) Twenty (...) of St.

This Eminent Prelate dying 1667. above 80. years of age, was buried in a
Chapel erected at his own charge, in Cambridge, with the greatest solemnity
seen in the memory of man, performed by the whole University, ordered by an
Herald.

Dr. John Pearson, Master of Trinity-colledge, and Margaret Professor, making
an excellent Funeral Oration upon the occasion; and all the Company (besides
that, they laid the rich Miter and Crosier upon the Altar) making the greatest
offering that ever was seen in the University.

I wish him so good an Historian of his life, as he had been of the Church, if
he had undertaken what Bishop Andrews imposed upon him, before he understood
Sir Henry Spelman was about it, viz, The Collection of Counsels, and so good an
Epitaph.

David LLoyd Dr. of Law, born in Mongomeryshire or Shropshire, All Souls Oxon,
sometime Comptroller of the Earl of Derbies house, and Chaplain to his Family,
Warden of Ruthen, Denbighshire, and Dean of St. Asaph; an ingenious Gentleman,
of greater spirit than estate, well esteemed of by the neighbor Gentry where
he lived, and not understood by the populacy; a great agent and sufferer for
his Majesty, well understanding how to take off his enemies, and engage his
friends. He died 1662/3.

Dr. John Barneston born of a good Family in Cheshire, to which
Brasen-n^se-colledge in Oxon, to which he was a benefactor, founding there a
Lecture for Hebrew, where he had been an excellent Proficient in Greek, that
that College, which is so eminent for Philosophy, should be as excellent for
the Tongues. Chaplain to Chancellor Egerton, to whom he was Counselor; and
Residentiary of Salisbury, where he was an hospitable Housekeeper, a cheerful
Companion, and a peaceable Man; by the same token, that a Churchwarden being
brought before him by the Parish in a Consistory, for having lost the Chalice
out of his House, which should have been kept in the Church, he perceiving that
the Churchwarden had carried it home with an honest intent, not to Imbezzle,
but to scour it; ended the controversy thus, Well, I am sorry, that the Cup
of Union and Communion, should be the cause of difference and discord among
you. Go home, and live lovingly together, and I doubt not, but either the Thief
out of remorse will restore the same, or some other as good will be sent you.
Which by a charity, as secret as the offer was prudent, was performed, not only
on the Doctors motion, but his charge too, who rested in that peace he lived,
when the whole Nation was imbroiled in a war, 1642.

About which time died Mr. Io. Bois, who credited Elesmeth in Suffolk by his
Birth, Hadley School, and Saint John's College in Cambridge by his Education,
Boxworth in Cambridgeshire, where he was Parson; and Ely-church, where he was
Prebendary by his preferment. His voluntary Greek Lecture read a Bed early in
the morning to young Scholars (whereof Mr. Gataker was one) improved him much,
and the young men of those times more; King James his Translation of the Bible,
wherein he was an eminent instrument; Sir Henry Savils Chrysostom, whereof he
was the Supervisor; and the choice Notes and Criticisms, that go up and down
among learned men, whereof he was the Author, will preserve his memory in the
world, as long as it is either religious or learned.

Bishop Andrews, who made it not his business to find preferment for men, but
men for preferment, stole those they had upon him, and Mr. Nicholas Fuller, in
a way equally agreeable to their modesty and merit.

As Bishop Laud did for Mr. Edward Symonds, a native of Cottered in
Hertsordshire, Scholar of Peter-house in Cambridge, and Minister of Little
Rain in Essex before the wars; so strict his life, and so plain, piercing, and
profitable his preaching (whereof some very pertinent Sermons extant are
instances) that he was looked upon as a Puritan; yet in the wars, so early his
care in vindicating his Majesty, in a Book bearing that Title; in principling
his Country against Rebellion, in some controversies with Stephen Marshall,
whom he after visited in his Bed at Westminster, telling him, That if he had
taken him for a Wild Beast, he would not have rouzed him in his Den; and
afterward in being instrumental to set forth his late Majesty's true (...),
that he was Sequestered of his Living, and forced first to Worcester, then to
Exeter and Barnestable, after that to France, and at last to London, where he
died 1649. being buried in St. Peter's Pauls-wharfe, where he often preached and
elaborately; for being requested once to Preach upon a small warning, and told
that the plain Auditors would be best pleased with his plain performance; he
answered, I can content them, but not mine own Conscience to preach with so
little preparation.

The Earl of Kildare being accused before Henry the eighth, for burning the
Cathedral Church of Cassiles in Ireland, professed ingeniously, That he would
never have burned the Church, if some body had not told him, that the Bishop
was in it: Several persons being urged with their severity to this good man,
answered, He had never suffered so, had he not been a stubborn Kingling and
Prelatist. Tanti non est bonum, quanti est odium Christianorum.

Edward Simson, born April 13. 1578. at Tottenham-high-crosse in Middlesex,
where his Father was the faithful Minister, who having bred himself to a
competent skill in Latin, sent him to Westminster under Mr. Cambden, to learn
Greek at fourteen, as he did him to Trinity-colledge in Cambridge, to
accomplish himself with the Arts and Sciences at eighteen, whereof being Master
at twenty five, as Bachelor of Divinity at thirty two: when after vast
instances of his proficiency in Critical and Historical Learning, whereof his

Great Britain) Printed 1652. at Oxford, a vast heap of Commentaries and
Glosses upon the most known Authors lying in his Study, and several Treaties,

worn out in the hands of private friends, gave a very good account; he was
preferred for four years Chaplain to Sir Moyle Finch, and upon his death (whose
Funeral Sermon he Preached with great applause) returning to the University for
three years, Preacher in a private Parish at Cambridge, and then Commencing
Doctor at forty, advanced Rector of Eastling, in the Diocese of Canterbury, by
the Viscountess Maidston, Sir M. Finches Relict, and Prebend of Coringam, where
being a man of an erect and tall, though not very strong body, a cheerful soul,
a strong memory, and quick senses to his last, he continued with infinite
satisfaction to all his Neighbors (being complai^ant as well as studious) but
the ignorant, thirty years, dying suddenly (if his death who had lived so well
73. years, might be thought sudden) for he went to bed over night, not to
awake till the great morning, sleeping his last even without a Metaphor 1652.

Farnaby, that excellent Gramarian, Rhetorician, and Critic, as appears by his

here, and oftener beyond Sea (his life being taken up in making those excellent
Collections) he had been forty years instilling those principles of Loyalty and
Religion into young Gentlemen, for which, with those Gentlemen he suffered; it
was a good sight to see Sir Thomas Moore when Chancellor, condescend to ask
blessing humbly on his knees in the middle of Westminster Hall of his Father
then Puisne Judge; and it was a sad sight to see so many Bishops and Doctors at
Where he was a Pris^ner as he was in the Fleet, etc.
Ely-House, thank plain Mr. Farnaby for teaching them those Maxims, Loyalty in
the School, Affliction by his Patience, which he had taught them in the
Grammar School by his Lectures. The War spent him many of those thousands he
had got in Peace, he throwing, as the Mariners, his Goods overboard, to secure
himself and his Conscience, keeping a calm within in the middle of a storm
without; The Parliament not forcing from him so much, but he sent in more to
the King. His discovering the false Glosses and Comments put upon words and
things in those times, was as good service as the light and clearness he gave
to the words and things of the oldtimes; and when he could not correct the
times to duty, he retired, though with trouble to his old way of breeding up
young Gentlemen that should hereafter alter them, planting a Nursery (in the
advantageous way of Boarding and Schooling, which he always managed together,
and he would say it was not worth the while to undertake them asunder,) for the
next Age that would make amends for this, being Master of a grave Prudence to
calm the unswayed humorsom Children; and a good Spirit and fancy to raise the
depressed Genius of others, fixing and reducing each temper, as Socrates did
Alcibiades, to an usefulness. One that understood Greek and Latin Authors, so
as to understand himself.

John Pottinger, the Famous Master of Winchester, who has bred so many
excellent men of late, Fellow of New College (as Dr. Ailmer, Dr. Sharwicke,
Dr. Ailworth, Mr. Turner, Mr. Ken, etc.) able by their great Parts to master
that Faction that with force mastered him. The very discipline and method of
his excellent School, was able to instill learning (like a Watch once well set
that goes always) even without him to the dullest capacity, and his fancy,
parts and encouraging temper, put life into that Learning; instilling not the
Learning only, but the Life of Authors, especially Homer into his Scholars, who
came generally to the University in my time with more vigorous parts, than
others went out fit; although otherwise he was a man as once Tully spoke, qui
opprimi potius onere officii maluit quam illud deponere, yet what pains he took
to resign when his Conscience and Employment could not consist together; and
much troubled between his unhappiness, that he could not serve his Generation,
and his temper that would have its liberty, having quitted his place 1653/4. he
enjoyed not long his life.

Lambert Osbaston, suffering more for his Conscience by the Faction, than he
had done for his waggery by the Government; he went beyond Canterbury, but he
could not go beyond Westminster, where many of his own Scholars (that he made
not only Scholars, but men; teaching his charge not only their Books, but
themselves, breeding them to Carriage and Address, as well as Learning, and
infusing a spirit with his notion) were as severe to him as he had been to
them. Some favor they showed his Person for his former services, which he
repented; but Sequestered all his Preferments for his present integrity, in
pressing all those he had an interest in (even Bradshaw himself upon his
Deathbed) to repent. He was turned out of one Living in the Country for
insufficiency; and yet employed at most examinations at Westminster for his
parts, where he made boys do that which men durst not, tell truth to Oliver,
then their Nose and Face, he being not pedantick in his carriage and discourse,
was by some not thought rich in Learning, because he did not Jingle with it in
his discourse. He gave the best alms to the poor, learning never paying boys,
because their Parents did not pay him, encouraging poor Children to be painful
in School, but never poor Scholars idly begging before it. Mr. Bust the
admirable Greek Schoolmaster of Eaton, never suffered any wandering Scholar
(Rogues in the front of the Statute) to come to his School, privately
relieving, and publicly chiding such, left his boys might be discouraged to
those that had taken pains at School for maintenance, come beggars out of the
University. He never dulled a quick head by mawling it, nor awed a fluent
tongue into stuttering by affrightment, nor commuted correction into money, nor
debased his Authority by contesting with the obstinate, turning such out when
he could do them no good, and they might do others much hurt, studying the
Childrens dispositions, as they did their books: the invincibly dull he pityed,
consigning them over to other Professions, Ship-wrights, and Boat-makers, will
choose those crooked pieces of Timber, which other Carpenters refuse. The dull
and diligent he encouraged, he had been a Child himself, if he had corrected
nature as a fault in Children: the ingenious and idle he quickened, the
ingenious and industrious he doted on, not only pardoning, but being infinitely
pleased with a well-humored fault, that discovered parts as well as youth, and
was an ingenious error.

Mr. John Cleaveland, owing his Birth and School-breeding to Hinckley in
Leichestershire; the heaving of his natural fancy by choicest Elegancies in
Greek and Latin, more elegantly Englished (an exercise he improved much by) to
Mr. Vines then Schoolmaster. His University Education to Christ's College,
where he was Scholar; and St. John's where he was Fellow, besides his being an
exquisite Orator, and a pure Latinist. The first recommending him to the honor
of making those public Speeches of his to his late Majesty, the Prince, the
Prince Palatine, etc. lately published, and the other preferring him to the
place of Rhetorick-Reader: he was a general Artist, and universal Scholar, that
had the patience to squeeze all the proper Learning that had any coherence with
it, into each fancy, which ran like the soul it dwelled in in a minute, through
the whole Circle both of Sciences and Languages, by the strength of an
exercised memory that conned out of book all it read; Mr. Cleaveland reckoned
himself to know just so much as he remembered, his fancy in his elaborate Pieces
of Poetry, wherein he excelled, summing whole books into a Metaphor, and whole
Metaphors into an Epithet, walked from one height to another in a constant
level and Champion of continued elevation: he ventured his Person and
Preferment Being turned out of his Fellowship.

Advocate, and his life at Oxford, where he managed his Pen as the highest

on the one hand) on the one side to draw out all good inclinations to virtue;
and the smartest Satyrist, (witness the Rebel Scot, the Scots Apostasy, the
Character of a London Diurnal, and a Committee-man, blows that shaked
triumphing Rebellion, reaching the soul of those not to be reached by Law or
Power, striking each Traitor to a paleness beyond that of any Loyal Corpse that
bled by them; the Poet killing at as much distance, as some Philosophers
heat-scars lasting as time, indelible as guilt-stabs beyond death) on the
other, to shame the ill from Vice, sinking in the common ruin of King and
Kingdom: he was undone first, and afterward secured at Norwich, because he was
poor and had not where withal to live, whereupon he composed an Address to
the Pageant Power at Whitehall of so much gallant Reason, and such towering
Language, as looked bigger than his Highness, shrinking before the Majesty of
his Pen (the only thing that ever I heard wrought upon him that had been too
hard for all Swords) representing that of his Master and Cause, like Faelix
trembling, Paul flattered one of the meanest of three Nations, that he Ruled,
and ominously sent him to study the Law, which he saw would prevail, it being
in vain to suppress that was supported by the two greatest things in the World,
Wit and Learning.

This great Wit (great in his easy veins and elaborate strein, no less to be
valued by us, because most studied by him) dyed at Gray's Inn April 29. 1658.
and being carried from thence to Hunsdon-House, was buried on May Day at
Colledge-hill, Dr. John Pearson his good friend preached his Funeral Sermon,
who rendered this reason why he cautiously declined all commending of the party
deceased, because such praising of him would not be adequate to any expectation
in that Auditory, seeing some who knew him not would think it far above him,
while those who knew him must needs know it far below him.

Richard Crashaw, his Father had done so well in the Temple where he was
Preacher; and he promised so much where he was a Scholar, that two great
Lawyers, I think Sir Henry Yelverton, and Sir Randolph Crew took him to their
care, the one paying for his Diet, the other for his Clothes, Books, and
Schooling till he was provided of both in the Royal Foundation at
Charter House, where his nature being leisurely advanced by Art, and his own
pretty conceits improved by those of the choicest Orators and Poets, which he
was not only taught to understand, but imitate and make, not only their rich
sense his own, but to smooth his soul as well as fill it, for things are rough
without words, their expressions too; the essays Mr. Brooks (his worthy Master
still alive, whose even, constant, and pursuing diligence and industry, did
wonders in that School) imposed upon him, on the Epistles and Gospels, at
School, were the ground of that Divine fancy, so famous in Whose ^ay of

Herbert of our Church, for making Poetry, as Divine in its object, as in its
Original, and setting wit disparaged in talking out most of its gallant Genius
on Fables, Women, Drollery, or Flattery; upon a matter and subject as noble as
its nature, making his Verses not in his Study at St. Peters-house, but in his
Devotions, wherein he spent many a night, at St. Mary's Church; warbling his
Hymns for St. Ambroses his Saints, under Tertullians Roof of Angels; having no
other Helicon, than the Jordan of his eyes; nor Parnassus, than the Sion where
dwelled his thoughts, that made the Muses Graces, and taught Poems to do what
they did of old, propagate Religion, and not so much Charm as Inspire the Soul.
Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Spanish, French, Italian, were as familiar to him as
English. Philosophy came as plausible from him as his Speeches or Sermons;
those thronged Sermons on each Sunday and Holiday, that ravished more like
Poems, than both the Poet and Saint (two A. C.
of the most sacred names in heaven and earth) scattering not so much Sentences
and Ecstasies, his soul breahing in each word, was the soul of the Assembly, as
its original is of the World. Poetry, Music, Drawing, Limning, Graving,
(exercises of his curious Invention, and sudden Fancy) were the subservient
recreations of his vacant hours, not the grand business of his soul; his diet
was temperate, to a Lesson exactness, whence his memory was so clear, that he
had ready at his service the choicest treasures of Greek and Latin Poets,
those Gibeonites to draw water to the Tabernacle. The Divine Poet, that had set
a Language (made up of the Quintessence of Fancy and Reason) for the Angels (as
the Schoolmen state their way of discourse) to converse in; seeing Atheism
prevailing in England, embraced Popery in Italy, choosing rather to live in the
Communion of that corrupt Church, in the practice of fundamental truths,
confessed to be then mixed with some errors, than to stay here, where was
hardly the face of any Church, after the overthrow of those to make way for all
errors; being resolved to any Religion, than that which taught a holy Rebellion

words, Reading makes a full Scholar, as appeared by his discourse, called, The
Greek brought into the Temple: Conference a ready Scholar, evidenced in his
successful contracts in these times with both papists and Sectaries; and
meditation a deep Scholar, as is legible in his excellent discourse (so much
commended by the Reverend Dr. Pierce) of In^allibility; so conscientious a man,
that because he had a small estate of his own, derived to him by providence, he
would not return to his old Preferment, his Fellow-ship; and so modest, that he
looked not after any new; being infinitely more happy in his rational and
sublime self-satisfaction, whereby he neglected the lower advantages of his
Majesty's Restoration, than others have been in their thoughts since, that
made it their business to enjoy them.

Abraham Cowley, bred at Westminster (under the Reverend Dr. Busby, whose name
will be deeply woven into the history of this age, most of the eminent Prelates
and Statesmen owning their Abilities to his admirable Education, and their
Loyalty to his choice Principles) preferred to Trinity-colledge Cambridge, and
when ejected, admitted in France Secretary in effect to her Majesty the Queen
Mother, in being so formerly to the Right Honorable the Earl of St. Albans;

so much by the great appearance at his Funeral at Westminster-Abbey, as became
the Funeral of the great Ornament of the English Nation, August 1667 as that he

melancholy and despair, forceable to draw forth tears of devotion, able both to
move and moderate affections: The Bards thereby communicating Religion,
Learning, and Civility to this whole-Nation. When it was asked, what made a
good Musician? one answered, A good Voice; another, Skill; but a third more
truly, Incourag^ment.

Bridgeman among the suffering Prelates, it will be no offense to enter him
among the discouraged Artists, he being as ingenious as he was gra^e; and a
great Patron of those parts in others, that he was happy in himself, for those
thirty years that he was Bishop of Chester, every year maintaining more or less
hopeful young men in the University, and preferring good proficients out of it;
by the same token, that some in these times, turned him out of his Livings,
that he had raised into theirs. A good Benefactor to Chester, I think, the
place of his Birth, as well as his Preferment; and to Brasen-nose-colledge
ox^n, the place of his Education; but a better, under God, to England, in his
Son, the honorable Lord Chief Justice Bridgeman, a great sufferer in his
Majesty's Cause, and a great honor to it, his moderation and equity being such
in dispensing his Majesty's Law, that he seems to carry a kind of Chancery in
his Breast in the Common Pleas; endearing, as well as opening, the Law to the
people, as if he carried about him the Kings Conscience, as well as his own; an
instances that the Sons of married Clergymen, are as successful, as the
Children of Men of other Professions, against the Romanists suggestion, who
against Nature, Scripture, and Primitive Practice, forbid the Banes of
Clergymen within their own jurisdiction, and be ^patter them without; though
they might observe, that the Sons of English Priests prove as good men
generally, as the Nephews of Roman Cardinals.

George Wild, a native of Devonshire, Scholar and Fellow of St. Iohns-colledge
in Oxford, and Chaplain to Archbishop Laud at Lambeth; a great wit in the
University, and a great wisdom in the Church; which in its persecutions he
confirmed by his honest Sermons in Country and City, in public and private,
particularly in his well-known (...), or Oratory in Fleet Street, fitted for
the Preaching of the Word, the Administering of the Sacrament, with a constant,
solemn, and fervent use of the public Liturgy, encouraged by his cheerful
spirit and converse; adorned with his great and gentile example of piety and
charity, communicating with great care to others relief, that were Sequestered,
Imprisoned, and almost Famished, what he himself by his great reputation and
acquaintance received for his own maintenance; who hazarded himself by keeping
correspondence beyond Sea most, yet suffered less than any (bold innocence is
its own guard) only surprised sometimes to a few hours Confinement, and some
weeks Silence, when as it is said of Saint John Baptist, by Maldonate,
miraculum nonfecit, magnum fuit; so it is written of him by his successor
Bishop Mossom, Concionem non habuit magna fuit. He preached no Sermon, yet was
he himself, in the pattern of patience and piety, a good Sermon, because Herod
was afraid of this burning and shining light; he came not to execution himself
for his Loyalty, because he feared not Herod; he attended all those, even the
meanest, that went to it for their Conscience.

When 1660. that year of his faith and prayers came, no doubt he had his
choice, whether he would accept that Bishopric he had in Ireland, or an equal
dignity in England; that which would have been the argument of another
refusal, was the very reason of his choice, even the difficulty of the service,
and the sad state of that Church; and so he underwent that rudeness there (to
the danger of his life) from those under him, that he had here from those above
him; notwithstanding which he went on with continual Sermons, to feed the
peoples souls, and not their humors; a wholesome Discipline, that struck at
their pertinacy, not their persons; and even course of Holiness and Devotion,
made up of Fasting and Prayer, whereby he did (...) teach by the pattern of his
Life, St. Basil apud D. Mossom.
as well as the rules of his Doctrine, a generous and magnificent hospitality,
entertaining all his Diocese civilly, that so unworthily (not knowing him, till
they had lost him) entertained him; a diffusive charity (demonstrating that he
sought them not theirs) to poor Widows, young Catechists, hopeful Scholars,
needy Gentlemen, and others, his Pensioners at Derry, Dublin, and Faughen in
Ireland; Glascow in Scotland; London, Oxford, and Cambridge in England; by
which, and other parts of his Pastoral cares, his body and spirits were so
wasted with pains and study in five years, that repairing as a Peer to a
Parliament in Dublin 1665. he brought death in his face thither, and preparing
himself very late on Christmas Eve that year, for a Sermon on Hag. 2. 7. and
Sacrament the following day, at St Brides in the same City, he felt it by a
Paroxism, seizing his heart, whereof he died the Friday after, having received
the holy Eucharist so cheerfully, as one assured of Life, having lived Not
making himself what he fore^ warned others not to do; his preparation for
death, his (...) bed task.
as one assured of Death, (saying, Thy will be done in earth, in terra mea,
(with a Pathetick emphasis in my Body) being a pure Virgin, espoused only to
Christ; and besides that, he laid out 5000 l. per annum since he was Bishop in
charitable uses, and 200 l. per annum in Buildings; he bequeathed his whole
Estate, save some of his best Folio Books, given to St. John's Coll. Oxon. to
furnish their Library; and an 100l. toward the building of their Founders
Tomb. To the poor, to whom he never gave any out of his purse in a Contribution
of Charity, but (such his huge ingenuity, as well as his goodness) he gave
something of himself also in a compassionate pity, yea, and something of his
Office too, in a Benediction and Prayer.

Warmestry, a Scholar of Westminster, Student of Christ-church, and at last
Dean of Worcester; for which Diocese he was Clerk in the two Convocations 1640.
In the first, warily avoiding what might be offensive to the people at that
time, (as the sitting of the Convocation after the Parliament, and the making
of new Canons, when the people could not be brought to observe the old ones.)
And in the second, offering expedients to remove what had been so (according to
the Levitical Law, covering the pit which they had opened) yet he that was so
fearful to offend the multitude (while there was any hope of them) in things
that her judged circumstantial, and prudential, was not afraid to be undone by
them (when they grew desperate) for those things that he understood were
essential. He was the Almoner-general of the noble Loyalists, the
Confessor-general of Loyal Martyrs, and the Penitentiarygeneral for visiting
the sick, very zealous in converting So his book about Sigulor Dandiolo,
converted by him, and the Rev^rend Dr. Gunning, Champion general of that Cause
at that ^^ne.
Infidels, very industrious in reclaiming the loose, very careful in comforting
the sad, satisfying the doubtful, and establishing the wavering; very careful
in preparing his flock for the Sacrament of the Lords See his A^an^^l. called.
The Box of Spikenard.
Supper, and for death; and very cautious against giving any offense. He died
at Worcester 1665. out-doing the Faction at their own Bow, Preaching.

Humphrey Sydenham, born a good Gentleman at Dalverton in Somersetshire, bred
F^llow of Wadham College in Oxford, so eloquent a Preacher (as it seems by
his, The Athenian Babbler, and other admirable Sermons since published) that he
was commonly called, The Silver-tongued Sydenham, but withal so honest a man,
that he was in danger of being turned out in these times, as not fit (its the
phrase of the times) to Preach the Gospel. As if wit, could be better employed
any way, than to please men to heaven; and it were not as lawful to rescue that
Divine thing, as well as Temples, Altars, Sacrifices from Satan's service, who
has usurped it so many ages to serve lusts to gods, who gave it to save souls.
He died about 1651. happy in having the Tongue of Men and Angels, and Charity
too, so that now he speaks Mysteries and Revelations.

Michael Hudson, a Gentleman of great parts, and greater courage, hazarding
himself to discover the strength of most of the Parliament Garrisons;
attempting many of them, and taking some, being best acquainted with the ways
and passes of England, of any person in his Majesty's Army. The reason why he
conducted him so safely, having made many journeys before, between Newcastle
and Oxford, about the terms of his security there, through his enemies quarters
to the Scots at Newcastle; and his Letters so securely to the Queen in France,
till he was betrayed by a Cavaleer Captain into his Enemies hands, who
imprisoned him three quarters of a year in London House, and after an escape
thence, a year in the Tower, whence being permitted to take Physic in London,
he got out (after a shrewd design to have taken the Tower) with a Basket of
Apples on his Head, in a disguise, to the King at Hampton Court, and from
thence to Lincolnshires, where he raised a party for his Majesty, having
engaged the Gentry of Norfolk and Suffolk in the like design, 1648. In the head
of which, after quarter given, he was killed barbarously, June 6. at
Wood-craft-house near Peterborough in Northamptonshire, being thrown down, when
his Head was cloven asunder, into a Mote, and when he caught hold of a Spout,
to save himself as he was falling, a Halbertier cuts off his Fingers; as
others, now he was fallen into the Water, Swimming with one half of his Head
over his Eyes, and begging to dye at Land, knocked him on the Head, cutting off
his Tongue and Teeth, and carrying them about the Country, the Trophies of
their shame, but his immortal honor; who, besides his life, lost 2000 l. in a
personal estate, and 900 l. a year, leaving his Wife and Children to the
charity of noble persons, himself being not vouchsafed a grave, till an Enemy,
of more wit and charity than his fellows, said, Since he is dead, let him be
buried.

THE Life and Death OF Sir RICHARD GURNEY, Sometime Lord Mayor of London.
SIR Richard Gurney Knight and Baronet, born April 17. 1577. at Croydon in
Surrey, was by his Majesty King Charles I. honored with this Title, that he
might be a pattern to the whole Nation: for Integrity and Loyalty, may be so to
all persons of his quality, in every passage of his life.

1. To young Gentlemen (younger Sons to considerable Families) bound
Apprentises in London, in this careful and obliging service, to Mr. Coleby a
Silk-man in Cheap Side, who dying left him his Shop worth 6000 l.

2. To those happy men, that having gained estates in their younger days to
serve themselves, should accomplish themselves against their riper years, to
serve their Country, in his travels (upon his enusing on the foresaid estate)
into France and Italy, where he improved himself; and (by observing the Trades
of the respective Marts as he passed) laid the foundation of his future
Traffic.

3. To single Persons, in his discreet Marriage into a Family [Mr. Sandfords]
at that time commanding at once, most of the money, and by that most of the
Nobility, Gentry, and great Tradesmen of England.

4. To Persons in In most Legacies for ch^r^^able uses he was in hi^ ^^me, the
th^^ p^^son gene^ally concerned.
Trust, in the faithful discharge of a joint power he, the Earls of Dorset and
Essex were invested with, by a charitable person, of an 100000 l. deep, toward
the buying of Impropriations, to be Legally, and bona fide, laid to the Church.

5. To Magistrates, going through all Offices in the places he lived in, a
Benefactor in each place; particularly to his Company, the Cloath-workers,
whereof he was Warden; to the Hospital of St. Bartholomews, whereof he was
Wa^den; and to the City, whereof he was Alderman, Sheriff, and Lord Mayor;
promoting the Loanes the King had occasion for, advancing the Commission of
Array, when the Kingdoms condition required it; entertaining his Majesty (4000
l. deep at his own charge) when he knew how much his Majesty's I^ his
Magnificent rec^pt^^^ upon his return from Scotland, besides that, he assisted
his Majesty in levying ^u^nage and Poundage, and Ship Money supp effect
unlawful Assembl^es and Petitions, qu^sh^ng ^ll (...) was motions at Common
counsel.
reputation would gain in the Country, by the appearance of a good
correspondence between him and the City. Appeasing the tumults, when 63. years
of age, one night, with 30. or 40. Lights, and a few Attendants (whereof his
Son-in-law Sir John Pettus was one) rushing suddenly out of the house upon
thousands, with the City Sword drawn, who immediately retired to their houses,
and gave over their design. In countenancing his Majesty's legal Proclamations,
and neglecting the Conspiracies traitorous Ordinances; ^ffering the King (as
Sir John Pettus assumed me, who went many times a day, in those times, from Sir
Richard to his Majesty, and from his Majesty back again to Sir Richard) to
stand upon the Privileges of the City with his Majesty against the Faction, as
they stood upon the Privileges of Parliament against him; refusing to appear
out of the Liberties of the City before the Parliament, till he was commanded
to do so by the King^ whom he would obey with his ruin;) when besides a long
attendance at his own charge, the City not contributing a farthing toward it
not to this day, in the House of Peers (who sent for him, every day in a whole
month, with his Counsel, on purpose to undo him) he was deprived of Ma^oralty,
Honor, and all capacity of bearing any Office in the Kingdom; kept seven years
Prisoner in the Tower, refusing to pay the 5000 l. imposed upon him for his
Liberty (urging, that by the Law of the Land, he should not suffer twice for
the same fault) Plundered, Sequest^ed, and Troubled, by several seizures of
Estates and Debts, not ended till 57. after it had gone through 13. Committees^
to him and his heirs the Right Honorable the Lord Richardson, and the Right
Worshipful Sir John Pettus his Lady, to the loss of 40000 l. He died Oct. 6.
in the year of our Lord 1647. and of his age 69. being buried at Olaves-Iury,
London, with the Lyturgy, in the very reign of the Directory: His Loyal
Relations so ordering it, that the Coaches should stop all passages into the
Church, and that three Orthodox Ministers should attend at the Grave, one ready
upon the least disturbance to go on, where the other had been interrupted; that
he might have the benefit of that decent Order, when dead, which he maintained,
when alive. Famous Walwin added a Dagger to the City Arms, for stabbing one
Rebel. What deserved renowned Gurney, that if backed by Authority, had stabbed
Rebellion it^self?

Sir Nicholas Crisp a Citizen, and a Citizens Son, having a great Guinia and
other parts before the Wars, as would have been worth to him 50000 l. a year;
and to Holland, France, Spain, ^^aly, Norway, Turkey, and Muscovy in the Wars,
as was worth to the King (though wandering up and down his Kingdom) and forced
away from his great Mart, 100000 l. yearly, Sir Nicholas keeping most Ports
open for his Majesty's occasions, Ships ready for his service, and a
Correspondence between him, and London, Bristow, etc. and all other parts very
useful for his Affairs; neither was he less active in the Field as Colonel
(having trained up himself in the City Militia for the service of the Kingdom)
in leading armed men; then at Court, as Counselor to raise and arm them;
commanding a Regiment of Horse he himself had raised and paid. The Polypus puts
not on more shapes to deceive the Fisher, than Sir Nicholas did to escape those
that laid snares for him; one while you should meet him with thousands in Gold,
another while in his way to Oxford riding in a pair of Panniars like a
Butter-woman going to Market, at other times he was a Porter carrying on his
Majesty's Interest (especially in the design of Mr. Challoner and Thomkins) in
London, he was a Fisherman in one place, and a Merchant in another. The King
would say of him, that he was a man of a clear head, that by continual
Agitation of thoughts went on smoothly in his business, sticking not at any
difficulties: all the succors the King had from his Queen and others beyond
Sea, especially from Holland, came through his hands, and most of the relief he
had at home was managed by his conveyance: neither was he less valiant than
prudent, his heart being as good as his head; For after he had bravely Convoyed
the Train of Artillery from Oxford to Bristol, and was Sept. 1643. quartered at
Rouslidge near Gloucester a Person of Quality in the Country, but of no Command
in the Army, Sir James Envyon, not only incommoded his quarters, in which
particular he was very civil to him; but because he would not draw up his
Regiment to satisfy a friend of his about some Horses that were stolen there,
offering to take all other care to find them (that way for many reasons being
by him proved inconvenient) sent him a challenge, adding, that if he met him
not, he would Pistol him against the wall: Sir Nicholas met, to offer him all
Christian satisfaction in the world, which not being accepted, many passes Sir
James made at him; he in his own defense (much against his will, and to his
grief to his dying day) happened to run him through; yet making his peace with
him while he lived, and offering himself upon a trial by a noble Counsel of
War, by whom after an affixer set, and a Proclamation for any person to come in
and prosecute him, none appearing, he was quitted Oct. the second 1643. His
pious Relations at London something misled, I think by some modern Preachers
(more taken with the seriousness of their preaching and praying, than the
irregularity of their proceedings) befriended him with the Parliament, during
the Usurpation, as he did them with his Majesty after the Restoration, having
been thousands out of purse to his Majesty's Father before the Wars in
Custom-house, he had a considerable interest in the farming of it since;
(having a peculiar faculty of advancing Trade, and consequently Tallage) till
he dyed 1666. his body being buried in Mildred His Kins^os the accomplished M.
Crisp of C. C. C. Oxon. and Moral Philosophy L^ctu^er, preaching at his
Funeral (...) Grand. (...) the R. ^^^hipfal Sir (...) crisp en^^^^ his Estate.
Breadstreet, with his Ancestors; and his heart at a Chapel in Hammersmith,
built at his Charge. He was well known by his large heart in inventing some new
kind of Benefaction there, as he was by his large head in finding out new
Inventions; having done many good works in and about the City while he lived,
and left considerable Legacies there when he dyed. Deserving a Marble Monument
for his new way of making Brick, and an Epitaph as clear as he could speak, for
the obscure way safe to himself and friends, though dark to his foes, he had to
write; expressing himself in these sad times as O. P. whose abilities were not
to be gathered from his words any more than his meaning; save that the more
entangled they were, they were the more judicious: his Interest obliging him to
a Reserve, for he durst neither clearly own his thoughts, nor totally disclaim
them; but opening them with such advantages, that he was neither mistaken by
his friends, nor understood by his enemies.

We must not separate Sir Nicholas Crisp, from the Worshipful Sir John Jacob
his partner, both in the Farming of the Custom-house, and his sufferings about
them, a man ever forward to assist his Majesty, saying, What! shall I keep my
Estate, and see the King want where withal to protect it? if it please God to
bless the King, though I give him all I have, I can be no looser; if not,
though I keep all, I can be no saver; and to relieve the Clergy, valuing more
their Prayers and Gods blessing, than his own Estate: employing under him only
those honest Cavaliers that suffered with him. On whose Grave and

Abraham Dawes, whose misfortues for his Integrity and Loyalty, are recompensed
in the blessing of his Posterity; both his Children and Grandchildren
flourishing in an Honorable and Worshipful Estate in Surrey, endued with
excellent Parts, good and obliging Tempers, a great Reputation, and
considerable Estates, whereby they are as able to serve their present
Sovereign, as their Ancestor was the Father, who when discouraged to advance
his share of the 100000 l. with Sir N. C. Sir I. I. Sir I. W. the King had need
of, with threatenings that he should re-imburse it or as much to the Parliament,
answered no more, But that is the worse that can happen, God be thanked I love
my Allegiance so well, that I cannot only pay it, but pay for it.

And the Worshipful Sir John Wolsten-holm, still (by the blessing With Sir John
Shaw, this great saffer^^ and noble Personage; the most public spiri^ed Sir
Rob. Viner in the Custom-house.
committed to him, though almost eighty years of Age, with incredible activity
and dispatch; eminent for his exemplary Hospitality and Charity, his great care
to keep a good understanding in the City, and his readiness to encourage any
public good work, tenderly asking for Sion College and other ruined places
(as my good friend Mr. Whitle Secretary of the Custom-house, who is never
wanting to speak a good word for a good work, has often told me) to which he
has been formerly a good Benefactor. I may say of him as Mr. Crashaw does of
Mr. Aston.

THe modest front of this small floor,
Believe me Reader, can say more
Than many a braver Marble can;
Here lies a truly honest man.
One whose Conscience was a thing,
That troubled neither Church nor King;
One of those few that in this Town,
Honored all Preachers; heard their own.
Sermons he heard, yet not so many
As left no time to practice any.
He heard them Reverendly, and then
His practice preached them over again.
His Parlor-Sermons rather were
Those to the Eye, than to the Ear.
His prayers took their price and strength,
Not from the loudness, nor the length.
He loved his Father, yet his Zeal,
Tore not off his Mothers Veil.
To the Church he did allow her Dress,
True Beauty, to true Holiness.
Peace, which he loved in Life, did lend
Her hand to bring him to his End.
Sir Martin Noel, Farmer of part of the Customs, born at Stafford
Staffordshire, and dying in Bishops-gate London, was very like Sir Nicholas
Crisp in the activity of a designing spirit, being in all forty several
Inventions for Trade: and the Charity of a public one, having built and
endowed a fair Hospital in the Town of his Nativity, one of the first in that
kind in that Country (and he drew the first Letter with a flourish, being bred
a Scrivener) while he lived, besides what he left when he dyed 1665. and was
buried by his own order at old Jury Church, with only the Office in the
Common Prayer said at his Funeral, and the Book put into his Grave.

Edmund Wright, Lord Mayor 1640. Memorable for his Justice to one Clergyman in
his Office, (Mr. Chestlen of Sr. Matthews Fryday-street) molested by a
combination in the Parish, to pay him no Tithe to weary him out, and bring
Burton (now brought home in a bold affront to public justice) in who appealing
to him according to the Statute 37 Hen. 8. found him so resolvedly honest, that
when Pennigton threatened him to stave him off from doing justice, he replied,
What, shall I be afraid to do justice! and ordered him his Tithes, pursuing his
order so far, as to commit them to the Goal without Bail or main-prize, that
refused to submit to that order, till two of the then House of Commons took the
Prisoners out of Newgate by force, whither they were sent by Law;) and his
Charity to all Clergymen, deprived of their places out of it.

Abraham Reynardson, Lord Mayor 1648. and Imprisoned in the Tower two months,
for not consenting to his Majesty's murder, and the alteration of the
Government (which proved the end of that War which Sir Richard Gurney so
seasonably would have prevented in the beginning of it) and not discharged till
he had paid 2000 l. fine; and (as far as lay in his enemies, who had destroyed
the foundation of honor) lost his honor in a way that increased it. In
reference to whom, be it remembered that his Lady would not suffer the messenger
that brought the Proclamation for abolishing Kingly Government so much as to
drink in her house, John Soams of Orpinham Norfolk 1430l.
bidding him be gone to his Masters for his wages.

Thomas Soams Stephen Soams of Throwlon Suffolk Esquire 800l.
and Alderman Chambers, who repented heartily that ever he had any thing to do
with Fowks in opposing the Kings Customs, for absenting themselves, and
justifying their conscientious refusal of the latter Oaths from former, were
then degraded in the City, and forced to retire out of it. Alderman Culham,
(whom I think they used to call the Queens Knight) and Alderman Gibs Sir Henry
Gibbs and Thomas his Son, paid for composition 517l.
by attending their own Affairs in the Country, escaped the snares laid for
their Consciences in the City.

George Whitmore, See his Funeral Sermon at the end of M. Faringdons Sermons,
that preached it. He was born at Charley in Shrop-shire, his Father was Mr.
William Whitmore who was a great Benefactor of the Hab^rd^shers Company London.
was till his death 1658. as great a support to, and sufferer for his Majesty's
Government in his habitation at Middlesex, as Sir Thomas Whitmore at Auley in
Shrop-shire, his Conscience having cost him (who being very aged, would say,
that he could serve his Majesty only with his Purse) 15000 l. as Sir Thomas his
Allegiance, besides Plunders, Decimations, and infinite troubles, did 5000 l.
many Orthodox Ministers, and distressed Gentlemen were his Pensioners during
his life, more his Legates at his death; when he bestowed as much money in
Charitable uses on the City as he brought to it. Having been a great instrument
to promote the repair of Paul's begun in his Mayrolty 1631. a great Benefactor
toward the repair of other Churches. Men, these for show, as the
Mulberry-tree, the most backward of any to put forth leaves, and the most
forward in bringing forth fruit of good works for sincerity.

Sir John Gair, Sir George Binion,^ Gentleman, that has done and suffered
much, must not be forgotten, whose ho^ sal H^gh-gate was pulled dow^ ^o the
ground.
Lord Mayor of London 1646. when he lost his bring home the King and though of
a tender disposition, yet of a resolute, severely just spirit, being wont to
say, that a foolish pity is cruelty, deserving the testimony given him at his
death, that his place did not so much honor him as he his place. Zealous was he
in his attendance in the Houses of prayer in that way of Worshipping the God of
his Fathers, which the Faction called Popery, and the Papists Heresy, all his
life; and very bountiful toward the repair of them when he dyed: singular was
his Reverence in hearing Gods word, and affectionate his respect to the
dispensers of it, and that not in Complement, but relief of those whom he
thought Orthodox, and found necessitous, to whom (besides many particular and
liberal Supplies by his own hand) he bequeathed an 100 l. by his Executors. A
faithful friend, and a just dealer, he must needs be in his public commerce
among men, being so sincere in his private Communion and secret Devotion with
God, to which he often retired, professing to the Right Worshipful Sir Robert
Abdy his Son-in-law; O how glad he was of his frequent wakings in the night,
since thereby he had opportunity to praise his God, and pray for the settlement
of this miserably distracted Church and Kingdom. He dyed at his house July the
20 th. 1649. and was buried at St. Katharine Creechurch August 14. following,
having left 500 l. for the yearly Clothing of the poor of Plymouth where he
was born, 200 l. to Creechurch Parish, where he lived, besides various other
Gifts to several Hospitals, Releasing of Prisoners, and the like, and 500l.
given Christs-Hospital when he was President of it. Being of opinion that he
must do in his life, what should comfort him at his death, for when his friends
that stood by him on his deathbed minded him of making his peace with God, he
answered, That old Age and Sickness, were no fit times to make peace with
Heaven, blessing God that his peace was not then to make.

Aubigney.
of Array for London, by the one much restraining the lewdness of the Suburbs
(for the filthiness of London, as of Jerusalem is in its skirts) by the other
endeavoring to suppress the tumults. Pity it was he should suffer many
thousands loss for his Loyalty, (besides tedious Imprisonments) who gave so
many hundreds away in Charity, in weekly Contributions to the Parishes of St.
Sepulchers, St. James Clerken-well, etc. while he lived there; and in yearly
allowance to those Parishes in the Suburbs, and to the Hospitals, and Prisons
in London. A devout man, that made Conscience of preparing himself for the
highest Comfort, as well as Mystery of our Religion, the holy Eucharist; and
therefore left 6 l. a year for a monthly Sermon on the Friday before the first
Sunday in the month at Clerken-well, ^ find in the Catalogue of Compounders,

the late troubles, as the Heir of his Estate and Virtues, is of sober men

Charity.

Paul Pindar, first a Factor, then a Merchant, next a Consul, and at last an
Ambassador in Turkey, whence returning, he repaired the Entry, Front, and
Porches of St. Paul's Cathedral to the Upper Church, Quire, and Chancel,
enriching them with Marble, Structures, and Figures of the Apostles, and with
Carvings and Gildings far exceeding their former beauty, to the value of 2000
l. an action so Christian, that King James would say, It was the work of a good
man; for which, and his great skill in Trade he made him one of his great
Farmers of the Custom-house, and he in gratitude laid out 17000. pound more
upon the South Isle of that Church in the beginning of King Charles his Reign,
and lent his Majesty 3000 l. besides 9000 l. he gave him to keep up the Church
of England in the latter end of his Reign.

A Projector (such necessary evils then countenanced) and he a Clergyman too,
informed King James how to get himself full Coffers, by raising first Fruits
and Tenths (under-rated forsooth in the Kings books) to a full value: The King
demands the Lord Treasurer Branfields judgment thereof, he said, Sir you are
esteemed a great lover of Learning, you know Clergy-mens Education is
Chargeable, their ^referment slow and small; let it not be said that you gain
by grinding them; other ways less obnoxious to just censure, will be found out
to furnish your occasions. The King commended the Treasurer (as having only
tried him) adding moreover, I should have accounted thee a very Knave, if
encouraging me herein. But he sends for Sir Paul Pindar rented the Mine-Royal

course; Sir Paul answered him nobly, That he would lay 30000 l. at his feet the
morrow, rather than he should be put upon such poor projects, as unsuitable to
his honor, as to his inclination. Go thy way (says the King) thou art a good
man. So that he might have said when persecuted and imprisoned as our Savior,

Dr. Felton, Bishop of Ely, encouraged in his natural inclination to Limning and
Heraldry, lest he might (by a force upon nature) be diverted to worse, became
the best Illuminer, and Herald of his age; wherefore, and because he was a
right honest man, the Earl of Arundel employed him to Italy for some Pictures;
whence returning by Marseilles, he missing the money he looked for, and walking
up and down melancholy in the walk of that City, was thus accosted by a civil
Monsieur, who (upon the relation of his condition) said, Take I pray my
counsel, I have taken notice of your walking more than twenty miles a day, in
one furlong upwards and downwards; and what is spent in needless going and
returning, if laid out in progressive motion, would bring you into your own
Country; I will suit you (if so pleased) with a light habit, and furnish you
with competent money for a Footman. A counsel and kindness that was taken
accordingly. He died 1649. leaving several Manuscripts to several friends to
publish, but (as Aristotle says against Plato's community of Wives, and the
educating of Children at a charge) what is every man's work, is no man's work.

Parishioner, who died 1665. and deserves to be remembered) generally gave
relief to their necessities.

Anthony Lord Gray, (...)
the eighth Earl of Kent, was a conformable England, at Burback in
Leicester^shire, 1939. when he was called, as Earl of Kent, to be a Peer of the
Parliament of England at Westminster: The Emperor Sigismund Knighting a Doctor
of Law, saw him slight the Company of Doctors, and associate with Knights, when
smiling at him, he said, I can make many Knights at my pleasure, when indeed I
cannot make one Doctor. This Earl excused his attendance on the Parliament by
his Indisposition, not liking their proceedings; and continued in the
Church Service, approving its Doctrine and Discipline; for which he was looked
on with an evil eye, and by God with a gracious one; for making, like a Diamond
set in gold, his greatness a support to goodness, his Honors not changing his
Manners; and the mortified Man being no more affected with the addition of
Titles, than a Corpse with a gay Coffin.

Of which temper was Mr. Simon Lynch, born at Groves in Staple-Parish December
156^.
Kent, bred in Queens College in Cambridge, and made by Bishop Ailmer his
Kinsman, Minister of North Weal, a small Living, then worth 40 l. a year, in

House, and brought up 40. Children) and dying 1656.

Mr. Joseph Diggons, bred in Clare-hall Cambridge, in the Reverend Paskes time,

distressed Royalists.

to his cost a Loyal Subject, beholding the Usurpation of his Nephew, God-son,
and Names Sake, with scorn and contempt. He died 1654.

Francis Nethersole, born at Nethersole in Kent, bred at Trinity College,
Cambridge, Orator of the University, Ambassador to the Princes of the Union,
Secretary to the Queen of Bohemia, eminent in his actions and sufferings for
the Royal Family, and disposing what great misfortunes left him, to erect a
School at Polesworth in Warwickshire, for the Education of such as might serve
their Sovereign as faithfully as he did his.

Chettam, born at Cromsal in Lancashire, a diligent reader of Orthodox men's
works, and hearer of their Sermons, the effect whereof was his exemplary
loyalty and charity, giving 7000 l. for the Education of forty poor children at
Manchester from six to fourteen years of age, with Diet, Lodging, Apparel, and
Instruction; 1000 l. to buy a Library, 100 l. toward the building of a case
for it, and 200 l. to buy honest and sober books, for the Churches and Chapels
round about Manchester, leaving Dr. Johnson, lately Sub-Almoner, and an
Orthodox man, one of his Feoffes; and very Loyal Citizens, his Executors.

no less prosperous than painful, in compounding all differences among his
neighbors) December. 8.

Michael Vivan, a loyal, and therefore persecuted Minister in Northumberland,
at the hundred and tenth year of his age, when much broken with changes and
alterations, between those that would not leave their old Mumpsimus, and those
that were for their new Sumpsimus, had of a sudden his Hair come again as
white and flaxen as a child's, a new Set of Teeth, his Eyesight and strength
recovered, beyond what it was fifty years before, us an eyewitness has
attested September. 28. 1657. who saw him then read Divine Service without his
Spectacles, and heard him preach an excellent Sermon without Notes. And being
asked by the said Gentleman, how he preached so well with so few books as he
had, and lived so cheerfully with so few acquaintance; answered, Of Friends and
Books, good, and few are best.

Grigson, a Citizen of Bristol, who notwithstanding that he paid 300 l. for his
Allegiance, bestowed as much more on charitable uses, saying, He liked only

Poor, or that they had made so many Rich.

a Kings-Scholar (under Mr. Bright, whom he always mentioned as gratefully, as
Mr. Calvin did his Master Corderius) at Worcester, Fellow of Sidney-colledge in
Cambridge. An excellent Grecian, and a general Scholar, the greatest Tutor of
his time, breeding young Gentlemen with a gentle strict hand (neither cockering
them with indulgence, nor discouraging them with severity) in the mean between
Superstition and Faction, zealously did he promote the Kings Cause to satisfy
his conscience; yet warily, so as to secure himself to be a good Benefactor to
his College (giving it 120 l. and the Library 10 l.) and a good help to the
distressed Cavaliers, till he died, January 28. 1653.

reference unto Aristotle; That the Genius and Spirit of them was transplanted
into him, so naturally did he express them in his life, and so bountifully
relieve the assertors of them out of his estate; giving many a pound privately
to maintain Temples of the Holy Ghost, distressed throughout the kingdom; and
some hundreds to enlarge and repair the Church of God at Leeds, notwithstanding
the Sequestration of his Estate, and the many troubles of his person; for which

Mr. George Sandys, youngest Son of Archbishop Sandys, a most Militia, liked
worst of any, his own; and having translated many good Authors, was translated
himself to heaven, 1643. having a Soul as Vigorous, Spriteful, and Masculine,
as his Poems; (dextrous at Inventing, as well as Translating; and in being an
Author himself, as setting out others) till drooping to see in England more
barbarous things than he had seen in Turkey; It was, for grief, forced to make
another, and its last Voyage to the most Holy Land.

THE Life and Death OF The most Illustrious and Heroic JAMES GRAHAM, Marquess
of Montross.
A Man born to make his Family the most Noble, as it was the most Ancient in
Scotland, where his Grandfather was Lord Chancellor in King James his Reign,
and his Father Ambassador to several Princes, and Lord President of the
Sessions in King Charles his Reign. He being bred a Soldier, and Captain of
the Guard in France, was by Hamilton invited over into England, to address
himself to his Majesty, while his Majesty was on design to disoblige him,
possessed with prejudice against him. Upon this affront (he thought) from the
King he goes to the Covenanters, whose interest he promoted much, by the
respect he had in that Country, and the abilities he was Master of himself;
till hearing a muttering amongst them upon the Borders of deposing his Majesty,
he waiting a just opportunity, sent Letters of his submission to him, which
were stolen out of the Kings pocket, and sent to the Scots, and resolutions
for him; in pursuit whereof, after his return upon the Pacification, he formed
a League among the Loyal Nobility and Gentry, to prevent the storm arising from
the Covenant entered into by the people, and after a tedious Imprisonment at
Edinburgh (all transactions between him and his Majesty being discovered by
some of the Bedchamber) 1643. came Post The Lord Ogle^y was one (...) much,
who with several of his Family suffered a tedious imprisonment after^^wards.
with the Lord Ogleby to the Queen, then newly landed at Bridlington, to open
to her the danger Scotland was in, if his Majesty armed not his loyal Subjects
in time, before the Rebels raised themselves; wherein he was overborn by
Hamiltons Counsel, as his was afterward by the Rebels: and afterward (having
dived more into the Covenanters design (by being thought for the affronts put
upon him at Court, and his retirement thereupon, inclined toward them) to the
King at Gloucester, And that he had hindered them last Summer, but could not do
it any longer.
to discover to him the Scots resolution to assist the English (discovered by
Henderson to him with a design to satisfy him) which the King (abused by
Hamilton) believed not, till Hamilton himself writes that they were upon the
Borders. When my Lord advising his Majesty to send some Soldiers out of
Ireland into the West of Scotland, to set him with some Yorkshire Horse into
the heart of that Kingdom, to deal with the King of Denmark for some German
Horse, to furnish him with Arms from Foreign parts, and to put a Touchst^ne
Protestation to all the Scots about his Majesty, entered Scotland with some 1400
poor Horse and Foot, relieving several Garrisons, and taking in some in his
way, though all assistance failed him but that of his own great spirit;
commending a design from which all men dissuaded him, to its own Justice and
Gods blessing upon it; knowing he must perish, resolved to die honorably: and
seeing his men fickle, returned them to the King, keeping only two with him
(able and honest (...)
Sir William Rollock, and Mr. Chibbalds) wi^h whom he traversed Scotland, to
understand the state of it; and at last formed a few Irish sent over, and the
Athol men who loved him well, into a Body, both to encourage his Friends, and
amaze his Enemies, who were astonished to see him whom they thought to be
penned up with a few ragged men on the Borders of England, marching so
formidably in the heart of Scotland, as to ^ight 600^ Foot, and 700 Horse, (who
were so confident of beating him, that one Frederick Carmichael, a cried up
Scots Minister, said in his Sermon, Sept. 1. when they fought, that if ever God
spoke word of truth out of his mouth, he promised them in his name, assured
victory that day) by Perth, without one Horse, and but Powder for two Charges,
which he ordered to be made in the Enemies teeth, with a shout (all the Ranks
one over the head of the other discharged at once) and to be followed by the
Irish, whom he placed in the main Body of his men, to secure them from the
Scottish Horse; (against whom, lest they should fall on him in the Front, Rear,
and Flank, he drew his men in the most open Order) after a gracious (...)
invitation to them to lay down their Arms and join with him in settling the
Peace of their Country, he routed them, to the loss of 4000 taken and slain,
and 7 miles pursuit, and the taking of Perth without the least harm to the
obstinate Citizens: and after that with 1500 Foot and 44 Horse, overthrew the
Commissioners of the Covenanters, with their Army of 4000 Foot, and 600 Horse,
Sept. 12. 1644. falling in amongst them, having ^lanked his Foot with his few,
but brave Horse, with great execution to Aberdeen; whence recovering the North,
he sent to bring in his Friends, and force his Enemies to his assistance,
holding a great Army of Argyles of 11000 Foot and 2000 Horse in play, with such
(...)
success that they supplied him with Ammunition, and lost in two Skirmishes
2000 men (notwithstanding that Argyle by his subtlety had corrupted most of his
prime men from him) and at last by a surprising march over untrodden (...)
places, frighted all Argyles Foot into a dispersion, the Traitor himself
hardly escaping to Perth^ (leaving his own Country to my Lords mercy, who
blessed God that ever he got safe out of it) as he did 5000 more which Argyle^
had got together in the Low-Lands to rescue his Country, coming by strange
passages (known only to Cow-herds and Huntsmen) upon them unawares, and
overcoming (...)
them first by his power, and afterward by his kindness, whereby he subdued
all those parts, either to their Allegiance, or (their little God Argyles power
being now disparaged by two defeats) to Peace; dispersing several parties,
taking in several Particu^larly Dundee, the nest of the Reb^llien.
Garrisons; challenging Bailey and the Covenanters whole Army, (maugre the
treacherous revolts of his men, and eminent friends every day) and making a
noble Retreat (notwithstanding that all passes were stopped) by wheeling
dexterously up and down without any rest three days and nights, with the most
undaunted resolution in the world, till being recruited, he trepanned their
whole Army at (...)
Alderne, May 4. 1645, by some Umbrays under which he hid his men, and the
cunning misplacing of the Kings Standard, made a defeat, where he killed and
took (though Vrry, an excellent Soldier, was Commander in chief) three times
more men than he had himself; seasonably succouring his men, concealing
disasters from them, and keeping them from too far and rash pursuit: as he did
the like number under Bailey at ^here was (...) the L^^d Gorden.
Alsord, July 2. 1645. after he had tired them with continual Alarms, and
possessed himself of advantageous grounds and passes, (making as he did always,
the best show of his few men.) And afterward the greatest Army he ever saw of
the Covenanters together, at Kilsith, September. 15. 1645. killing and taking
above 5000 Foot and 400 Horse; Coll. John Ogleby an old Swedish Commander, and
Alexander the son of Sir John Ogleby of Innar-Wharake. The consequence whereof,
was the scattering of the Rebellion, the chief flying to England and Ireland,
and the submission of the Kingdom, which he with great courtesy and civility
took, after the overtures made to him of provisions for War, into his
protection; settling all the Cities and Towns, even Edinburgh it self, in peace
and safety, without the least injury offered; releasing such Prisoners as the
expert old Soldiers, the Earl of Crawford, and James Lord Ogleby, etc. and
inviting the Nobility ( viz. Trequair, Roxborough, Hume) to join with him in
the settlement of the Kingdom; but the Kings friends in Scotland betraying him,
and the succor out of England under my Lord Digby, failing him; and which was
worse, the King being forced to throw himself upon the Scots; commanding him,
without any security to his faithful friends, to depart the Kingdom, and in
France wait his Majesty's further pleasure, (that opportunity, as many more of
the like nature for re-establishing his Majesty, was lost) as he did,
discreetly avoiding the snares laid for him in his transportation; being fair
in France for the chief command of Strangers there; assisting the Prince at the
Hague in the debates about the expedition into England under Hamilton, 1648.
Thence traveling to Germany was offered by the Emperor the Command of 10000
men immediately under his Majesty against the Swedes: after that, procuring of
the Dukes of Brandenburg and Holstein, forty Vessels, with men, and Ammunition,
and 1500 complete Horse-arms from the Queen of Sweden; besides other
assistances from several States and Princes, which were imbezzeled before they
came to his hands. He threw himself away at last upon some persidious men,
pretending to his Majesty's service in the North of Scotland, where he was
taken in disguise; and so barbarously murdered by the Rebels of Scotland, that
the Rebels of England coming thither next year, were ashamed of it. Since very
honorable buried in the Grave of his Fathers; and renownedly famous both
abroad and at home, in the Chronicles of his Age: the glory of Scotland, and
the grief of Europe; the farthest Nations in the World admiring his worth, and
the greatest Kings bewailing. Which happened, He came to Scotland the less time
with an excellent Portraict of h^^iate Majesly ^headed with ^hese words, Judge
and reveng^ my cause O Lord: and an excellent Declaration which was hanged
about his neck.
May 21. 1650.

Brave Soul! whose learned Swords point could strain
Rare lines upon thy murdered Sovereign;
Thy self have engraved thine Epitaph, beyond
The Impressions of a pointed Diamond.
Thy Prowess and thy Loyalty shall burn
In pure bright Flames from thy renowned Vru,
Clear as the beams of Heaven; thy cruel fate,
Scaffold and Gibbet shall thy fame dilate;
That when in after Ages Death shall bid

abroad, and his many years good education and practice at home; Lord of the
Sessions extraordinary in King James his time, and constant President, and
Secretary of State in King Charles his time; between whom and his friends in
Scotland, particularly the Marquess of Montross, he kept in the most difficult
times a constant correspondence, for which he was beheaded at St. Andrews,
exhorting the people to his last, to keep to their duty toward God and the
King, and to beware of a lying Spirit sent by the Lord in Judgment among their
Ministry.

it was published, insomuch that the Bishops of Ross and Brechen, Sir John Hay,

6. For refusing to contribute toward the Scottish Wars; for withdrawing

THE Life and Death OF Sir WILLIAM PENNIMAN
SIR William Penniman, Besides him, James Penniman Esquire of Orness in Yorkshire,
paid for his Loyalty 2000l Composition; and Sir James Penniman jun. 530. an
eminent Commander at Oxford, and elsewhere in the Kings Army.
a Gentleman of good fortunes in Yorkshire (where part of the Alum Mine rented
by Sir Paul Pindar, belonged to him) before the Wars; and one of the first that
engaged with the King in the Wars: whose Epitaph at Christ Church is his just
Chronicle.

fuerat merito charissimus.

Obiit Aug. 22. A. D. 1643. tumulo potitus in eadem domo in qua ingenii cultum
capessaverat. Jacob Lord Ashley, born of a well know Family in Norfolk, bred
under Sir Francis and Sir Horace Vere, a Captain in the Low Countries, and
preferred for his good Conduct-Colonel, whence after thirty years service,
returning to his Native Country, he had the Command of New Castle in the
Scottish Wars 1639. 1640. and after of Oxford in the English, out of which (by
reason of the experience his Majesty had of his good wary carriage in keeping
the Northern Army in order when they wanted money, and engaging them to serve
the King, if he had thought fit to have made use of their assistance when he
wanted strength 1641. to keep the City in order, and the Parliament free) he
was drawn into the Field, and particularly to assist in forming the siege of
Gloucester, (wherein (the Low Country Wars being in effect nothing but sieges)
he had a great judgment, and where he was shot in the arm) as afterwaads to
draw the line of Communication between his Majesty's Forces round about the
Earl of Essex at Lestithiel, his own Post being at Hawl, where he commanded the
Haven of Foy. Having likewise the disposal of the most difficult part of the
second Newberry Fight, after which he settled the Affairs of Worcestershire and
Gloucestershire so well, by continual surprises of the Enemy, that he commanded
Contribution to the Gates of Gloucester; after that, much against his Being of
opinion that his Majesty should march either into the North or into the
associated Countries, whi^^er Fai^sax following after, he knew would give him
several advantages, which he had a shrewd way to take.
will was he commanded to form the fatal battle of Nazeby; and which was worse,
to quit the advantageous piece of ground and model he had first designed, to
the loss of that battle; after which, by diligent Correspondence with Ireland
and Wales, he got a considerable Army, which for want of the Horse promised him
from Oxford, a straight wherein he could not avoid fighting, he lost at Stow in
the Old March 21. 1645/6. where when he was taken, he said, That the Game was
up, and after a tedious Imprisonment dyed, I think, in that Foreign Country,
where he had so Honorably lived 165. His Son Sir Bernard Ashley, an eminent and
stout Commander in his Majesty's Army, after admirable service done in fix
Fights, and eight Sieges, dyed of wounds received in a brave sally out of
Bristol, Sept. 4. 1645.

Arthur Aston, a Lancashire Gentleman, where the Papists are most zealous by
Antiparistasis, because of the extreme zeal of the Protestants there, as good
of his Hands as a Soldier, as Sir Walter Aston, the known Ambassador in Spain
and Germany was of his Head; many Soldiers did he by his great services in
Foreign He was ^red up in the Wars of Germany from his youth.
Wars bring to his Majesty from abroad; more by his excellent Discipline did he
make at home, where he commanded the Dragoons in Edgehill, doing exquisite
execution, and giving my Lord Stuart and other young Gentlemen direction how to
do so. Thence being made Governor of Reading, he beat Essex thrice from the
Town, till having a dangerous wound, he was forced to devolve his Command upon
Col. Fielding, returning himself to Oxford, where he was Governor till it
appeared that the severity of his Discipline would do more service in ordering
a loose Army in the Field, than in awing a regular Garrison in a Town; whence
his Fortune being answerable, neither to his skill, nor to his courage, he went
over with the flower of the English Veterans to Ireland; he was made Governor
of Drogheda, Besides Sir Arthur, there were in the Kings Army the Lord Aston,
who aazzarded himself much about the rel^^ of Che^ster. Sir The. A^^on, and
C^ll^^el Ralph Ast^n, (...) rants of that C^^ntry L^nc^shire, the piercing air
whereof make^ the Inhabitants b^dies as able as their m^n^s, willing for any
laborious employment. To whom I may join Edward Ash^on of Aldenham Salop Esquire

charges, 2000 l. Composition.
about which Town he laid an excellent plot to tire and break the English Army,
but that being overpowered, he lost his life, first being hewed in pieces, and
not till then; the Town being deserted by Coll. Walls Regiment after the
Colonels death, which betrayed both the Garrison and themselves: with him fell
1 Sir Edmund Varney, 2 Coll. Warren, the right Gospel Centurion, that feared
God as much as he undervalued man; 3 Coll. Fleming, 4 Coll. Brin, 5 Major
Tempest, and several other brave Gentlemen, Cromwell thinking to cut off all
Ireland in cutting off that Town, which was the Epitome of it. Sir Arthur, like
Montross, had one excellent faculty, that in extremity he had some operative
Phrases, wherewith he could bespeak his Souldiesr to do wonders. Pallas so much
honored by him, which some Pen equal to his Sword, may more fully relate, and
her Military relation doing him right in her learned Capacity.

Edward Herbert, Atturney-General to his Majesty, much troubled about the
Impeachment he drew up against the five Members, more about the opinion and
advice he gave concerning the Parliament, having asserted the peoples Liberty
with resolution, 1626. 27. 28. and his Majesty's Rights with integrity 1639.
1640. 1641. his Majesty preferred him for his abilities in the first, but the
people would never forgive his faithfulness in the second, having assisted at
most Treaties and Councils at Oxford in the War, he retired beyond Sea after;
dying with honor there, though he could not live with Indemnity at home; having
this Character That he thought he served his Prince best, when he gave things
the right color, not varnishing them over with a false Gloss: which did more
harm when discovered, than good when pretended.

France was well managed, for being referred to Luynes the Favorite of France
for Audience in behalf of the Reformed; Luynes (setting two Protestant
Gentlemen behind a traverse near the place where they were to conferr, to hear
what little expectations they ought to entertain of the King of Englands
Mediation) asked roughly, what our King had to do to meddle with the state of
France; Sir Edward Herbert, its not you to whom my Master owes an account of
his actions; and for me, it is enough that I obey him. In the mean time I must
maintain that my Masi^ (...) more reason to do what he does, than you to ask
why he does it. Neve^theless (reserving his passion till the issue of the
discourse) said he, if you desire me in a gentle fashion, I shall acquaint you
farther: whereupon Luynes bowing a little, said, very well: the Ambassador
answered, That it was not on this occasion only that the King of Great Britain
had desired the peace and prosperity of France: and that upon the settlement of
that Kingdom, he hoped the Palatinate might be the better assisted. Luynes
returned, We will have none of your advices: the Ambassador replied, He took
that for an answer; being sorry the King his Masters affections were not
suitably resented: adding, that since it was so, he knew well what to do. And
being answered that the French feared him not; returns smilingly, If you had
said you had not loved us, I should have believed you; and made no other
answer, In the mean time all that I will tell you more, is, That we know very
well what we have to do. Luynes thereupon rising from his chair discomposed,
said, By God, If you were not the Monsieur Ambassador, I know very well how I
would use you. Sir Edward rising also from his chair, said, That as he was his
Majesty of Great Britains Ambassador, so he was a Gentleman, and that his Sword
(whereon he laid his hands) should do him reason, if he had taken any offense;
adding, when the Marshal of Geran after a more civil audience of the King, told
him that he was not safe there, since he had so highly affronted Luynes) That
he held himself to be secure enough, where ever he had his Sword by him. The
Gentlemen behind the Curtains afterward, when he was called home to
accommodate Le mal intendu between the two Crowns, attesting, that though the
Constable gave the first affront, yet Sir Edward kept himself within the bounds
of his instructions and honor, very discreetly and worthily. His Son Richard
Lord Herbert, dead since, deeply engaged with Sir George Booth and many others,
in most of the designs for his Majesty's Restoration: all of them the wariest,
and the most resolute of any that followed his Majesty, from the Scots Wars
1639. to the Settlement 1660.

John Pennington, born nigh Alesbury in Buckinghamsh. bred a Seaman by his
great diligence and patience, attaining to a Captains Command; and by his noble
and (...)
generous temper, to the honor of Admiral of the Guard belonging to the Narrow
Seas; where gaining vastly by Convoys, he lived like a Prince in the
magnificence of his Table, and Interest in the Seamen, who shared in his
gains, and he in their hearts; making them all true to him, as he was to the
King and Church, being very faithful to the interest of the first, till he,
deluded by the Faction, disabled him from serving him; and very conscientious
in observing the Orders of the second in all his Ships, as long as he had any,
being none of those Seamen, whose piety being a fit of the wind, are calm in a
storm, and storm in a calm. Yet very serviceable was he in transporting
Commanders, Arms, Ammunition, and other necessaries for his Majesty's service,
keeping Passages open in most Ports of England, besides that he secured Scilly,
Guernsey, and Iers^y; bravely did he 1626 refuse upon my Lord of Buckinghams
Order to deliver his Majesty's Ships to the French without a considerable
security for their value and use; and as bravely refused all Overtures from the
Parliament, he died at Bristol Sept. 1646. having been never cruel (as some) to
Slaves, knowing that the Sea might drown the men, but not the murder. To him I
may add

Sir John Lawson, a poor man's Son at Hull, bred at Sea, by his Industry much
honor in boarding fix Admiral ships in the War with the Dutch 1651. 1652. 1653.
more in contributing to his Majesty's Restoration, by putting a stop with
eight ships upon the mouth of the Thames, till the stop put upon the Parliament
was removed 1659. most of all in the admirable attempt upon Algiers 1661. 1662.
which he forced to make the most honorable Peace they ever made with
Christians, and afterward which was more, most punctually to observe it: and
in his gallant Conduct and Resolution in the first Sea Fight between the
English and the Dutch 1665. where by a shot in the leg he lost his life, having
spared the lives of the worst of men, who he knew had God for their Father,
though they had not the Church for their Mother.

Sir Christopher Mynnes, an honest Shoemakers Son in London, this side: a plain
man, and a good Spokes-man, Qualities for which the King and Prince Rupert
loved him: made of an indefatigable Industry and a vast skill and abilities,
for which they much trusted him; yet very familiar among his Soldiers whom he
saw well used for Diet, Pay, and their share in Prizes; getting more in buying
again the Soldiers share, than others did in cheating them of them: the more
absolute power he, as all Sea-Commanders had, the more careful he was how he
used them; he was shot in the mouth, yet holding it in his hands, continued in
his Command all over in blood as long as the Enemy continued the fight, against
whom he was so forward, that if his advice had been taken in the Bergen
Expedition, the Dutch had come to London to beg that Peace which they would so
hardly yield to at Breda.

Rich. Stainer, a man deserving well of his Majesty, about Portugal and
Tangier, as good a Seaman as most in England, as the Seamen in England are as
Kekerman of Danzick, a great Port Town, de re nautica, all owneth the English
the best, the Dutch the next Seamen of the 4 first Circumnavegators a^out the
world 2 were English 1. Mag^llane a Spaniard 2. Drake 3. Cavendish, 4. Noort an
Hollander, Conducted by the English, Capt. Mollis his Pilot.
good as any in Europe, either for Fighting or Trading, for tame (Merchants)
ships, or wild ships, (Men of War having contributed as much as any for
improving the Sea for what it was made (neither only for Fish to play in, nor
only for the Sun to drink of) but for Commerce in Traffic, Learning, and
Religion, all mankind being one Family, Acts 17. that the world may know its
self before it be dissolved. A pious man at Land in safety, as devout at Sea in
danger; not like those Seamen (whose hearts are like the Rocks they sail by)
so often in death, that they think not of it, seeing Gods wonders in the deep,
he were the greatest wonder of all that were not made more serious and pious by
them.

James Ley, Earl of Marleborough, who not content to be penned in the narrow
Island where he was born, launched out to the wide world, where he might live.
The Lord Treasurer Ley his Ancestor gained an Estate by his Court-Interest
beyond Sea; and he gained skill by improving that Estate, wherewith he served
his late Majesty very seasonably with two or three Ships, supplying him with
Arms, Ammunition, and whatever else he wanted from beyond Sea; opening the
Western Ports, and maintaining the passage between England and Ireland, and his
present Majesty very effectually; in advancing his Majesty's Interest in
Plantations abroad, and hazzarding his own life for him at home, loosing it in
the first Sea Fight with the Dutch June 1665. aboard the old James, whence a
little before he died, reflecting on the former course of his life, he writ to
this effect to

Hugh Pollard. (who deserves a mention, not only because he was his friend (as
Eusebius is known by the name of his friend Pa^philus, whence he is called
Eusebius Pamphilus) but because being a Gentleman of a good Family, and
interest in Devonshire (descended from Sir Lewis Pollard of Nimet in that
County, and one of the Justices of the King's Bench in King Henry the eights
time, who had four Sons Knighted before his face) Governor of Dartmouth, a Port
of great Importance, well Garrisoned, for his late Majesty, and Comptroller of
the Hushold for his present Majesty: very active, and venturing for his Majesty
in the worst times; and very hospitable and noble with his Majesty in the best.
Observing that rule (in keeping up the English honor of a great Table)
occasionally entertaining, rather than solemnly inviting his ghests, lest he
should over do his own Fortune, for fear of under-doing the Inviteds
expectation, to whom his Feast might be his ordinary fare. Which puts me in
mind of a King of France, who used to lose himself in a Park Lodge; where his
sauce, hunger, made the plainest fare a Feast; and the Park-keepers taking
heart to invite him, came, with all his Court, to whom all his meat was but a
morsel: Well (said the Park-keeper) I will invite no more Kings.

The Letter which James Earl of Marlborough writ to Sir Hugh Pollard, who dyed
1667. was to this effect 1665.

I Am in health enough of body, and (through the mercy of God in Jesus Christ)
well disposed in mind. This I premise, that what I write proceeds not from any
phancying terror of mind, but from a sober resolution of what concerns my
self, and earnest desire to do you more good after my death, than mine example
(God of his mercy pardon the badness of it) in my lifetime may do you harm. I
will not speak ought of the vanity of this world; your own Age and Experience
will save that labor: but there is a certain thing that goes up and down the
world, called Religion, dressed and pretended phantastically, and to purposes
bad enough, which yet by such evil dealing loses not its being: the great good
God has not left it without a witness, more or less, sooner or later, in every
man's bosom, to direct us in the pursuit of it, and for the avoiding those
inexitricable disquisitions and entanglements our own frail reasons do perplex
us withal, God in his infinite mercy has given us his holy words, in which,
as there are many things hard to be understood, so there is enough plain and
easy to quiet our minds, and direct us concerning our future being. I confess
to God and you, I have been a great neglecter, and (I fear) despiser of it:
(God of his infinite mercy pardon me the dreadful fault.) But when I retired my
self from the noise and deceitful vanity of the world, I found no true comfort
in any other Resolution, than what I had from thence: I commend from the bottom
of my heart the same your (I hope) happy issue. Dear Sir Hugh, let us be more
generous than to believe we die as the beast that perish; but with a Christian,
manly, brave resolution, look to what is Eternal. I will not trouble you
farther, the only great and holy God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, direct you
to an happy end of your life, and send us a joyful Resurrection. So prays

Your true friend, Marleborough.
Old James near the Coast of Holland. April 24. 1665. I beseech you commend my
love to all mine acquaintance; particularly, I pray you that my Cousin Glascock
may have a sight of this Letter, and as many of my friends besides as you will,
or any else that desire it. I pray grant this my Request.




Henry Earl of Huntington, one of the first that appeared for his
Leichestershire, as his Son the honorable Lord Loughborough continued there
with the last; the constant service of the second during the first War, in
commanding Ashbey of De la zouch, called the Mai^^n Garrison never touched the
E. of Leicester Sir Richard Hastings a Col in the Kings Army, deserves to be
inserted into this Catalogue.
the Garrisons of his Country very vigilantly; and in the second in disposing
of the Provisions in Colchester so carefully and unweariedly (attending it
every hour in the day for a long time) together with his Imprisonment, Escape,
and Exile, excusing the Age, Infirmities, and Retirements of the first.

Sir Thomas Burton, Sir George Villiers, Sir Henry Skipwith of Cows, Richard
Halford, Sir Io. Hale, Sir Erasmus De la fountain, Sir Will. Jones, Sir R.
Roberts, Sir John Shepington, George Ashley Esquire Tho. Hortop Esquire need no other
History than the first Commission of Array in their own Country
Leichestershire, wherein they were inserted. The Catalogue of Compounders
wherein they are punished between them 20000 l. the Paper of Loan, wherein they
contributed toward his Majesty's service 25642 l. Among whom is Sir Wolstan
Dixby of Normaron Derby 1835 l. composition
the several Imprisonments they suffered, and Sequestrations they endured.

The Right Honorable Henry Earl of Bath, a Person it is questionable, (once
publicly professing it one of the greatest Honors that ever happened to his
Family, that one thereof, Thomas Bouchier by name, was once dignified with the
Archbishopric of Canterbury) always asserting the Kings Interest, attending
him in his Counsel in York, and his General in his Affairs in the West, till
being taken Prisoner 1642. when he was rendered incapable of serving his King
and Kingdom, he grew weary of the world, paying for his Loyalty 900 l. rich in
a contentment that cheerfully enjoyed its own Estate, and troubled its self not
with the thoughts of others, limiting all desires but those of doing good,
whereby he might either relieve the needy, or encourage the Ingenious. A
gallant man, not in his quarrels with others, but in his Victories over
himself, greater in that he was above affronts, than that he retaliated them; a
happy soul, that conversed with its self, understood the value of time, made
use of that Authority great men are happy in, to discountenance Vice, and the
Reputation which is the talent of Noblemen, to encourage Virtue.

Francis and Mildmay Fane Earls of Westmerland, His composition cost Mildmay
Earl of Westmerland 1000 l.
the first that assisted that Majesty, which honored them 1624. and the first
that suffered for it. For the Earl of Westmerland I find was not in the
Parliament at Oxford, because in Prison at London, having lost his own freedom
in defense of the Kingdoms: a great Wit, and a Patron of it, as appears by his
Noble Letters to Cleaveland, and Cleavelands Heroic reply to him.

Henry Carry, Sir Hen. Carry of Cockingham Devon paid besides noble Contributions
to the King, and losses by the Parliament 1985 l composition, he commanded
Kingssworth when Sir The. F. assaulted it.
Earl of Munmouth, bred up (under his Father Sir Robert Carry Earl of Munmouth
1625. Tutor to the Prince, for being the first that brought King James tidings
of the Kingdom) with King Charles I. at home, and sent by him to travel with
this Instruction, Be always doing something abroad; whence he returned so well
skilled in the modern Languages, that being a general Scholar, he was able to
pass away the sad times in Noble studies, the fruit whereof are excellent
Translations of Spanish, French, and Italian Authors, such as Malvezzi,
Bentivoglio, etc. He dyed 1661. and with him the Earldom of the Lord Carry, his
Eldest Son dying in the Bed of Honor at Marston-Moor July 2. 1644. The first of
these Honorable drank no Wine till he was thirty years of Age, saying, it
preyed upon the natural heat, and that vinum est Lac sonum bis puerorum: the
other enjoyed health best in unhealthy places, whence he observed that the best
Airs for a man, are those that are contrary to his temper, the moist to the dry
and consanguine, and the dry to the moist and phlegmatic, and the best Diets
to those that correct the Air; and the best method a care of not going from one
extreme into another, using often that saying, Till May be out, Leave not off a
Clout.


Henry Earl of I think the first Earl of M. and the Earl of Dover were Brothers.
Dover, created 1627. that was Colonel of a Regiment of Scholars in Oxford as
he was I think Captain of the Guard of the Pensioners (after the Earl of
Norwich) at London, a Noble Person, not to be moved from his Allegiance by
those Arguments used to his Son the Lord Viscount Rochford as some-say, but as
the Kings Declaration of the 12 Aug. 1642. Intimates to himself by Mr. Pym,
viz. That if he looked for any Preferment, he must comply with them in their
ways; and not hope to have it in serving the King: Being made up of that blunt
and plain integrity toward his Prince, and firmness to his Friends, for which
his Ancestor the Lord Hundson was so famous, that Queen Elizabeth says, she
would trust her Person with the craft of Leicester, the prudence of Cecill, the
reach of Bacon, the diligence and public spirit of Walsingham, and the honesty
of Hudson; he dyed (after one Greatrates that pretended to heal Diseases by
washing and rubbing the affected places) had been tampering with his Head for
his deafness) at Windsor March 1665.

The Earl of Chesterfield (created 1628.) who never sat in the Col. Philip
Stanhop was a considerable pe^s^n in the Army, Governor of Shelford house,
taken by storm where he was killed, the first instopping every breach that was
made.
The Lady Stanhop, since Countess of Chesterfield, Governess to the Princess
Orange, doing that service with my Lord Kirkoven, Sir William Boswell, etc. in
getting Money, Arms, Ammunition, and old Soldiers in Holland, which my Lord
would have done in England. And what the Ancestor could not do toward the
re-establishing of King Charles I. the Successor did toward the restoring of
King Charles the II. (both in great hazard, and both great expense, their
Loyalty having cost that Honorable Family 15000 l.) est aliquid prodire tenus;
Essays in such Cases are remarkable, green leaves in the midst of Winter, are
as much as Flowers in the Spring; especially being seasonable, when the whole
Kingdom asked a Parliaments leave to have a King, as Widows ask their Fathers
leave to Marry.

Mountjoy Blunt, Francis Newport of ^yton upon Severn Sal. compounded for ^284
l. Sir Richard Newport deservedly created Baron Neport of High-Arcall, besides
many thousand pounds he sent the King, paid composition with 170 l. per annum
settled 3287 l. Mr. Lewis Blunt a Volunteer, was killed near Manchester, and
Mr. Christopher Blunt at Edgulton, house.
Earl of Newport, created 4. Car. I. having made as Europe, as he had done by
study of Notes in all kind of Learning, was called to the great Counsel of
Lords at York, and attended in all the Counsel at Oxford, where considering
that time would undeceive the Kingdom, and give the King that Conquest over
hearts, that he failed of over Armies, his Counsel was always dilatory and
cautious, against all hazzards in battles when bare time to consider, would
recover the Kingdom, and break that Faction which the present hurry united. He
would not easily believe a man that rashly swore, there being little truth to
be found in him so vainly throws away the great Seal of Truth; he would endure
none but him that could not give as good account of their time, as he could of
his; others diswaded men from uncleanness as a sin, but he as a mischief in
dissolving the strength and spirits, dulling the Memory and Understanding,
decay of Sight, tainture of the Breath, diseases of the Nerves and Joints, as
Palsies, and all kinds of Gouts, weakness of the Back, bloody Urine,
Consumption of Lungs, Liver, and Brain, a putrefaction of the Blood, etc. as
the Philosopher would say, I would strike thee, but that I am angry; so would
he say when a discourse grew hot, We would prosecute this business but that we
are set on it. He was in much danger of his life at the assault at Dartmouth,
Ian. 17. 1645. with Sir Hugh Pollard the Governor, who was wounded there, and
Coll. Seymor, being there taken Prisoner, but he died at Oxford, 1665. being of
the Bedchamber to his Majesty at home, as he had been of his intimate Counsel
abroad. His Composition was 40 l. a year Land, and 4179 l.

John Lord Pawlet of Hinton St. George, entrusted by his Majesty with his first
Commissioners of Array, 1642. (when other Noble men were Crest or
Coronet-fallen) and excepted by the Enemy, as the most dangerous offender,
being a pious man for Religion, an hospitable and well reputed man for doing
justice and good in his Country; a watchful and active man in the field, and a
shrewd man in Council: as became the son of his Mother, sole sister to the
Martial Brothers, the Norrices, and the wife of his Father Sir Anthony Pawlet,
Governor of Iersey; an accomplished Gentleman of quick and clear parts; a
bountiful Housekeeper, by the same token King Charles I. consigned Monsieur
Sobez to him for Entertainment. Guardez la Foy, Keep the Faith was his Motto
and Practice. Sir Amias Pawlet in Q. Elizabeth's time would not suffer his
servant to be bribed to poison the Queen of Scots; nor our Lord his men, to
carry on a noble cause in an unworthy way. William Pawlet of Paulstones,
Southampt. paid 544 l. for his allegiance, Francis Pawlet and Amos Pawlet,
Summers. 800 l.


Sir Thomas Savil of Pontfract Baron, Earl of Sussex, heir of his Father Sir
John Savils parts and activity, Comptroller of his Majesty's household, falling
off from the Parliament (upon that saying of a Member to him, That he must not
be only against the Persons, but against the Functions of Bishops, and that men
(they are Mr. Pyms words) how corrupt soever, must be forgiven their past
offenses, upon their present serviceableness to the Commonwealth) he appeared
with the King at York, was of his Council at Oxford, waited on the Queen in
France, and made his own peace easily (being supposed one, whose Counsels
tended to the peace of the Kingdom) at London: his offense carrying an excuse,
he in the Wars being for an accommodation. Observing abroad Mitres opposing of
Crowns, and Chaplains vying with their Patrons, he would say that if Clergy men
left all emulation with Lay men in outward pomp, and applied themselves only to
piety and painfulness in their Calling, they had found as many to honor, as
now they had to envy them. Frequent passions he avoided, 1 Because then not
likely to be regarded by others. 2 Because (by causing Fevers, Palsies,
Apoplexies, Apepsie) they are sure to endanger our healths; (its to be more
then to be (...) without affections, and to be a wise man to be (...) a good
mannager of them) which, with the vigor of all his senses and faculties he
preserved by temperance. Sir William Savil was an eminent and a sober Commander
on the Kings side. Will. Savil of Wakefield, Yorksh. Esquire paid 946 l. as he said
for the 13 Chapter of the Romans.


Henry Leigh of High-Leigh, Chester, Esquire; 710 l. Composition. George Leigh of
Wotton, Gloc. 264 l. Coll. Tho. Leigh, and Sir Ferdinando Leigh were never
sur^rised for want of Foresight, nor worsted for want of Resolution, Gervase
Lee of Norwel Notingh. Esquire paid 560 l. for charges. Tho. Leigh of Adlington,
Chester, 3000 l. Edw. Leigh of Bugeley, ibid. 700 l. Thomas Lord Leigh of
Stone-Leigh, faithful to his Majesty in dangerous times, paid for his
conscientious adherence to his Sovereign 4895l. Peter Leigh jun. of
Neithertalby Chesh. Esquire 778l. Will. Leigh, Pitminster Summers. 120l. Sir Richard
Lee of Langley Sal. Ber. 8782l. Sir Thomas Leigh of Humpstal Ridward, Staff.
1376 l. Gentlemen, these easily distinguished by their actions, though agreeing
in name. Great men (when Sirnames are necessary to distinguish obscure persons)
are Sirnames to themselves.
Francis Leigh of Newnham Warwickshire, Baron Dunsmore, Earl Chichester 19 Car.
1. Captain of his Majesty's Guards, and a stout honest man in his Council;
having a great command of things (as the first being) he had a shrewd way of
expressing and naming them. His surname was before the Conquest, if there was
any surname then (sirnames being used since) which puts me in mind of him that
said his Arms were 3 Gun hores 1000 years ago, when there were no Guns in
Europe above 300 years. The honor died with him, who left two daughters, the
Right Honorable Countess of Southampton, and the Viscountess Grandison. One
being asked which St. Augustine he liked best; answered, that which was the
best corrected. My Lord being in discourse about our Modern Reformlings
opinion, said, That way was best that had been least reformed: when Ace is on
the top, Sise is at bottom. When men (whose flesh was refined, blood clarified,
spirits elevated by Victory) got Goods to their new Gentry, Lands to their
Goods, he would often mention Rich. 3. saying of the Woodviles, viz. That many
are noble that are not worth a noble. He had a good rule for health, that a
full meal should be at such a time as might be, Laboris and cogitationum
terminus, and the heat and spirit not destracted from assisting in the
concoction. He continued with the King from York (where the King begun to
provide for himself) to Oxford, not yielding up himself till Oxford was
surrendered.

The Lord Gray of Ruthen, who as seriously asserted his Majesty's Seldom
asserted his own honor and title when disputed. Angel Gray of Kingston Marwood
Coin: Dorset, Esquire 900 l. for obeying the King for Concscience sake; and Edward
Gray of Campan, Northumb. 389. A man that feared the War on this score, because
it was like a Fair, that would draw in Chapmen from all parts; who seemingly
slight, but secretly love and envy our plenty; and would be willing to come
from Wine to Beer and Ale, and from Fruits to Meat. His great Rule, that
Temperance enjoys the sweetness of things which Excess aims at, if
considered, would prevent more diseases, than his Relation the Countess of
Kents Powder has cured.

Sir John Stowel of Stowel in Somersetshire, a Knightly Family for Liberties
and Religion while any hopes of peace; all pains and care imaginable did he
take to reduce them (according to the Commission of Arra, where in he was an
eminent Member) when they were bent upon War, 6000 men, and 30000 l. did Sir
Edward Stowel, and Coll. G. Stowel raise to set up his Majesty; and 8000 l. a
year during the troubles did they bring to support him: till Sir ^ohn having
with Sir Francis Courtney, Sir John Hales, and Coll. Hugh Windham a m^^k Lion,
was sl^n in Docetshire.
Sir Hugh Windham, whose Loyalty cost them 45000 l. and upwards, bravely kept
Bridgewater, was brought Prisoner (as I take it) from Worcester to Westminster:
where being convened, for his great Estate, rather than his great fault, he
refused to kneel and own their Authority; demanded the benefit of the Articles
whereon he rendered himself prisoner, and demanded their charge against him;
being answered with 14 years imprisonment, without any legal trial had
(notwithstanding that his Cause was heard in every Convention that was during
the Usurpation) and he himself set five times before a n^igh Court of Justice:
nor any judgment given, till his Majesty returning, May 29 1660. was met by
him at Charing Cross with a stand of Loyal Gentlemen and old Officers of the
Kings Army, the stateliest sight seen that glorious day. He died Feb. 21
1661/2. faelicitas in ipsa faelicitate mori, Sen. being supported under his
great age, and greater suffering, by a naturally great spirit; made greater by
solid and unquestionable principles, by a cheerful temper, by noble studies
that both comforted and diverted sublimating natural bodies, for he was a great
Chemist, as he did his affections, by a well grounded patience; for he would
say he learned patience himself, by looking on the inconvenience of impatience
and anger in others. And to keep his body in a temper suitable to his soul, for
many years he eat no Breakfasts, that his stomach might be cleansed, and its
superfluous humors consumed before he came to Dinner; saying, that those who
went with a crude stomach from one meal to another, without an extraordinary
use of exsiccatives, as Ginger, Oranges and Lemons, Citrons, Horseradish
Roots, etc. would hardly escape the Scurvey, if they did the Dropsy.

Edward Stradling, Major General Sir Henry Stradling, Coll. John Stradling, and
Coll. Thomas Stradling, of the ancient Family of the Stradlings the second
Baronet of England, of St. Donats in Glamorgan, one of the noblest seats in all
Wales. Very forward in raising that Country for his Majesty, and in eminent
trust; commanding it under him, much to the satisfaction of the people, more of
the Gentry: Good Prome-Condi of Antiquity, faithful in keeping monuments
thereof, and courteous in communicating them; whereof, though some had as it
said of John Stow, Mendacio, now and then jogging them on the elbow: yet many
of them lacked Learning rat^er than Truth, seldom omitting what is, sometimes
observing what is not considerable. A Family to whom a Septenary number is
happy, a Nonary fatal.

John Lord Culpepper of Thorsway, whose Family is now honorable in the Isle of
Wight; bred to the Law, was resolved to maintain it; relating to the Exchequer
in times of Peace (when the Parliament grew sullen, and would not see what they
did) he made his business to fill it against a War, bringing his Majesty in
some thousands from his friends; and all that he had himself. November. 9. 1640.
he made a smart Speech in Parliament against the grievances of the Government
in the behalf of Kent, for whom he sat. December. 6. the same year, he offered
the peaceable and safe ways of repressing them; and when he saw the Remedy like
to prove worse than the Disease, he endeavored to compose differences in the
House as long as he could, and afterward out of it, bringing the first message
of Peace, with the R. H. the E. of Southampton, and the most accomplished Sir
Will. Wedall (a handsome man, and as knowing, as much Learning, long Travels,
and great Observations could make him; men of parts sided with the King that
could encourage them) to the Parliament, 1642. as he did six more during the
Wars, assisting in all his Majesty's Councils, and promoting all the Treaties,
wherein he was always a very sober Commissioner. And when he saw no more good
to be done by those Treaties, than the Father says he saw by Councils,
advising his Majesty to enlarge his Interest by dividing it into his own, the
enjoyment of the Kingdom, and his sons; the hope, the one-to draw together the
North and South out of a sense of their present duty; and the other the West,
out of a regard to their posterities happiness: he was appointed to direct his
Highness the Prince his Counsel 1645/6. as he did first in raising a good Army
toward the recruiting of the War, and afterward in proposing his Highness as
a fit Mediator between the King and Parliament for Peace. From Cornwall he
attended his Highness to Holland to negotiate supplies; from thence to the
revolted Fleet, to keep it in order, and dispose of it to advantage; thence to
France and Holland to settle the new Design 1648. for re-establishing the King,
mannaging an exact correspondence then, both with the Scots and English; thence
to Breda to forward the Agreement with the Scots, where he with an admirable
dexterity, solved or mitigated each morning, the difficulties they made at
overnight; therefore called by those people The Healer; thence to Denmark and
Muscovy, where he prevailed so far for his afflicted Master, that he made the
first Kingdom declare against the Rebels; and the other, besides some supplies
he sent his Master, lay all the Estates and persons of English men in those
parts, at his Masters feet, whom he used so civilly, as to convince, that his
Master aimed more at their good than his own Right; and that he desired to
govern his people only to protect them. He lived to see his own maxim made
good, That time cures sedition, which within few years grows weary of its
self; (the people being more impatient (as he would say) of their own
Libertinism, than of the strictest and most heavy Government: besides that, the
arts and impulses of seditious Demagogues, may a while estrange and divorce
their minds; yet the genius of English men, will irresistably at last force
them to their first love) and his Majesty entering his Metropolis (where he
would say, A Prince should keep himself in all commotions as the seat of money
and men) May 29. 1660. He dying June 12. following, Master of the Rolls; and
his Son Governor, I think, of the Isle of Wight.

Sir Tho. Culpepper of Hallingborn in Kent paid 824l. Composition. William
Culpepper and Thomas his son, of Bedbury in Kent, 434l. Sir Alexander
Culpepper, 40l.

Maurice, bred in the Wars of Germany, which were undertaken for his Father
Frederick, Prince Elector Palatine, and chosen King of Bohemia; and with some
German Officers coming, Sept. 17. 1664. over to serve his Uncle K. Charles I.
whose only sister Elizabeth^ son he was, in the Wars of England. Where he
behaved himself at once valiantly, and soberly, acting nothing in any place
without a Council of War of the most knowing Gentlemen in that place; nor
exacting any contribution without the consent of the Inhabitants: very much did
he assist (by a strange reach in contrivance he was Master of) in pounding
Essex in Lestithiel; and more toward the taking of Exeter: wary in his advice,
and bold in his action; surprised twice by the carelessness of his Officers,
yet so that both times he told them of it, having a strange mixture of
Jealousy mingled with Courage. Indeed he was a Monogdoon, that is, one
admirable; Prince of eight complete Qualities, Sobriety, Meekness, Civility and
Obligingness, Particularly in (...) de^eat of Waller at Teux bury.
Conduct, Resolution, Seriousness and Religion, Justice and Integrity,
Foresight and Thoughtfulness, Patience and Constancy. Noble in bringing his
people on, and careful in bringing them off; being called by his Enemies, the
goodcome off, serving his Majesty at Sea as he had done at Land; and commanding
the Ships fallen from the Parliament, (when there were no more to be commanded
for the King) to watch and supply the Coasts of Ireland, and infest those of
England. He was in his way to the West Indies, divided from his Illustrious
Brother Prince Rupert (one of the most expert Seamen, as the most general
Artist in Europe) and from all the living, by an Hurricano 1649. ^ad! that our
Calamities swallowed not only the Royal Branches growing in England, but those
in Germany too; who escaping the Austrian malice, perish by the British; but
true grief for a Valiant man, requires not Womanish tears, and great grief
scorns it, no tears being able to wash off the guilt of Royal blood, the shame
of that Age shed in both parts of the world, that beyond the Line, and that on
this side of it. Peace had made him as excellent as his Brother the Prince
Elector, who for general, but especially mechanic Learning and business, is
the happiest man in the world.

Henry Duke of Gloucester, his Majesty's younger Brother, born 1640. died 1660.
A Prince of as great hopes, as studious; great Parts, and as great expectation
as solid Virtue; and promising great actions, could make him, that having known
nothing but Imprisonment for the first years of his life at 8t. James's
Pensehurt, and the Isle of Wight, and Banishment in the later, grew by his
affliction so knowing, that at eight years of Age he could tell his Majesty
(when he sending for him the day before he died, he bid him not take the Crown
before his Brothers Charles and James) he would be first torn by wild Horses
before he would do it; so capable, that Ascham who was deputed his Tutor by the
Earl of Northumberland, protesting that he could discourse nothing to him but
what he could after once hearing, with more advantage discourse to him again;
so serious, that when Abbot Montague designed his Education in the Catholic
way, he could say at ten years of Age, H^ would obey his Mother, but he must
his Sovereign: So resolute, that in the battle before Dunkirk 1657. Don John
protested he fought like an Englishman; and so accomplished, that at his return
there was not an Artist whom he did not obligingly and satisfactorily converse
with in his own way. Fata ostendunt non dant Henricos.

Mr. Endymion Porter, mentioned near these two Princes, because James for his
Wit. 2. To King To whom ^e was Genesis ^^man of his Bedchamber.
Charles I. for his general Learning: which with his brave style, sweet temper,
happy travels, great experience, modern languages, and good address,
recommended him to the Duke of Buckingham, who after the journey into Spain
(begun at first by the Prince, the Duke, my Lord Cottington, and Mr. Endymion
Porter) introduced him to his Majesty, who loved him for his own Ingenuity, and
for his being a Patron to all that were Ingenious: our Endymion, had the
happiness to be loved by our Sun and Moon, the King and Queen, but not because
he slept. He pleased his Majesty not more in time of Peace, than he served him
in time of War by his Intelligence and Declarations at home, and his
Negotiations abroad, both in France and Holland, the reason sure why he was
always excepted out of their Indemnities, his friends paying for him 1500 l.
composition; and he dying with his Majesty abroad, as his Son did for his
Father at home, being killed 1644. Loyal blood like Harvies, went round the
Port^rs, from the highest to the meanest, 26 of the Name having eminently
suffered for his Majesty.

Sir Nicholas Slanning. The Cornish men in the Reign of King Arthur led the
Van, where is the Conduct of an Army: and in King Canutus his time brought up
the Rear, which is the strength of an Army. Sir Nicholas, a Cornish Gentleman
of an Ancient Family (that deserves the same Character that is bestowed by Mr.
Carew upon another, Employing themselves to a kind and uninterrupted
entertainment of such as visited upon their invitations or their own occasion,
their frankness, confirming their welcome by whatsoever means, Provision the
best fuel of Hospitality, can in the best manner supply.) Of a Learned and a
Martial Education, able both to attend the Crusible, and the Gun; a very
knowing Philosopher and a good Soldier, led on his Countrymen in his resolute
Speeches at Westminster, being a Gentleman of a stern spirit, and brought up
the Rear in his Command at Pendennis, and other back Harbors of Cornwall (over
against France for supplies, and in the Levant, Spanish, both Indian, and Irish
Road (where most Merchants touch, and whither many are driven) being a man of
an impregnable Integrity, and unwearyed watchfulness, and a severe Discipline,
lost by the Parliament, when in Sermones tanquam vetita miscuissent, specimen
Arc^ae amicitiae facere: and (having with Sir Bevile Greenvile at Landsdown
done wonders in advancing from hedge to hedge in the Head of his men, in the
mouth of Canons and Muskets, so that his men thought him Immortal, July 5.
1643.) lost to his Majesty in a brave assault upon Bristol July 26. following,
when they saw him mortal. (In the Catalogue of Compounders, I find this Note,
Sir Nicholas Slanning Knight of the Bath at the Coronation of King Charles II.
who would not have yielded Pendennis, but at the Command of King Charles I.
of Pendennis-Castle Cornwall 1197 l. 13 s. II d.) and Col. Henry Lunsford,
Col. Buck, and Col. Trevanian, fell there the same time, with whom it is fit to
mention Sir Charles Trevanian, of Caryhey Cornwall, Sir John Trelawny and his
Son, Col. Tho. Tregonnel, Col. Jonathan Trelawney, Col. Lewis Tremain, I think
of Nettlecomb Somerset, who paid 1560 l. composition, Col. George Trevillion,
Col. Ames Pollard, Io. Pegonwell of Anderson Dorset Esquire 1735 l. Col. James
Chudleigh slain at Dartmouth in Devon. Col. Bowls slain at Alvon, Edmund
Tremain Esquire Colloecomb Devon 380 l. Men remarkable for their Conduct in keeping
their Counsels, in disguising their actions, and foreseeing the Designs and
Courses of the Enemy, being very well acquainted with the passes of the
Country, and strangely dexterous in gaining Intelligence, scouring the Enemy
before Bristol, as well as the Gray-Sope of that place does Clothes; men whose
Persons generally are like their Houses, narrow and little Entrances into
spacious and stately Upper-Rooms. Sir Richard Prideaux of Tregard compounded
for 564 l. at Goldsmiths-hall, and others whom I would more largely insist on,
but that I am (...), an Herald of another nature, and having not taken Letters
of Mart to seize on others Callings, for their Invading mine; do Loyally leave
these Ancient Gentlemen to the justice of the King of Arms.

Richard Fielding, Lord Fielding, suffering something in Reputation about
Reading, which being Deputy Governor, he yielded as was thought too easily: but
recovering it at Newberry, Nazeby, and all other Engagements where he stirred
not an inch, keeping his ground too obstinately, a generous shame, adding to
his Valor, and choosing rather to lose his life by his Enemies, than that it
should be said he deserved to lose it from his Friends. A kin to that Noble
Family of the Villiers, that had no fault but too good Natures, carrying a Soul
as fair as his Body, and a carriage Honorable as his Extract; being not carried
by the heat of the blood he had, to any thing that might be a stain to that he
came from.

He that beat Cromwell once in the West, Sir James Smith Devon paid for being a
Coll. in the Kings Army 188 l. Sir Will. Smith, Sir Walter Smith of great
Bedwin Wilts with 40l. per annum settled, paid 685l. Composition, Thomas of
Nibley Ches. 40l. Edward Smith of Haughton Northam. 142l. Will. Smith of
Stamford Kent 108l. Will. Smith of Presly Some. 140l. R. Smith Heath Denb 90l.

Smith of Comb. Somerset 86l. Joseph Smith Selby Linc. Clerk 600l. Edw. Smith
Wakefield York 60l. Captain Dudley Smith killed at Roundway-down.
Sir John Smith the last Knight Banneret of England, who relieved him, being
too far engaged at Edgehill, as he had before rescued the Standard, who being
Nobly born, (Brother to the Lord Carrington) strived to hide his Native honor (
suae fortunae Faber) with acquired dignity, desiring to be known rather to have
died of his Wounds for his Sovereign at Alesford in Hampshire 1644. than that
he was born of Noble Parentage in Yorkshire 1646. It may be said of this
numerous Family after the defeat of the King, as it was of the English after
the Invasion of the Conqueror. Some fought as the Kentish, who capitulated for
their Liberty; some fled, as those in the North of Scotland; some hid
themselves, as many in the middle of England, and Isle of Fly; some, as those
of Norfolk traversed their Titles by Law; bold Norfolk men that would go to Law
with the Conqueror, most betook themselves to patience, which taught many a
Noble hand to work, foot to travel, tongue to entreat; even thanking them for
their courtesy, who were pleased to restore them a shiver of that whole Loaf
which they violently took from them.

Which was the Case of the Honorable Family of the Caries, Theodore Carry was
the wiliest, Col. Edward Carry, the most experience, Sir Henry Carry the
steadiest, and Sir Horatio Carry the wariest Commander in the Kings Army. The
first best read in History, the second in Mathematics and Tacticks, the third
Experimented Philosophy, the fourth in the Chronicles of our Land. Indeed, the
best study for a Gentleman is History, and for an English Gentleman is the
British History. Ernestus Carry Shelford Camb. paid 229 l. at Goldsmiths-hall,
John Carry of Mil^on-Clevedon Some. 200 l. John Carry of Marybone Park Middlesex
Esquire 1200 l. Charles Carry Gotsbrook North. Esquire 183 l.

The Right Honorable John and Henry Mordant Earls of The ^ Windsor 1100l.
Peterborough, Usher and a Papist at his house, where the Papist confessed
himself silenced by the just hand of God upon him for presuming without leave
from his Superiors to Dispute with so Learned a Person as Dr. Usher, the other
wounded at Newberry and other places, where he was a Volunteer (...)
for his late Majesty, as he was often Imprisoned for his Loyal attempts 1647.
1655. 1657. 1658. 1659. in behalf of our present Sovereign the great Agent and
Instrument, for whose Restoration was Io. Lord Viscount Mordant Creat^d 166l.
of Aviland, who was tried for his life at Westminster, and brought the first
Letters from his Majesty to the City of London, their Loyalty cost that Family
35000 l. whereof 5106 l. 15 s. composition.

Sir Edward Walgrave, Sir William Huddleston of Millain Castle Northum. was Sir
Edward W. only Parallel, who raised a Regiment at his own Charge, and had
seven Sons that rid in it, for which besides 30000 l. other losses, he paid
2248 l. Composition, and Sir Henry Lingen of Sutton, Her. who raised two
Regiments, and did eminent service in awing Gloucester, and securing Heresord
and Worcestershire with his Bragade of Horse, that they said never slept, and
^azzarded himself often for his Majesty's Restoration, for which he paid
6342l. as Jo. Lord Scudamore Viscou^t Sleyo in Ireland, some years Ledger
Ambassador in France, who all these times kept his secret Loyalty to his
Sovereign, Hospitality in his Family, and Charity to the distressed Clergy; for
which with his son 2690l. Not forgetting Sir B. Seudamore a gallant expert
Commander, Governor of Hereford: and Dr. Scudamore, who was slain't ^ere: nor
the R. H. Will. Lord Sturton, whose Loyalty cost him 1100l.
an Ancient Northern or Norfolk Gentleman, never more than a Knight, yet little
less than a Prince in his own Country; above 70 when he first buckled on his
Armor for the English Wars a Brigadine in his Majesty's Army, one of the first
and last in action, and a Commander in the Isle of Ree: Commanding the Post at
Saltash, at the Impounding of Essex, where his men scattering, were thrice
rallied by himself, though twice unhorsed, and the whole Parliament Army
stopped till his Majesty approached: he lost two sons and 50000 l. in the Wars.
A Gentleman who deserved his neighbors Character of Strong Bow, having brachia
projestissima, and Tullies commendation ( nihil egit levi brachio) especially
falling heavy upon all sacrilegious invaders of Churches; who being angry with
the King, revenged themselves on God; destructive Natures delighting to do
mischief to others, though they did no good to themselves.

2. Sir ^ervase Scroop was not so near Sir Edward in his dwelling as in his
character; who being an aged man, engaged with his Majesty at ^dgehill, where
he received 26 wounds, and was left on the ground dead, till his son Sir Adrian
having some hint of the place where he fell, lighted on the body (with no
higher design than to bring it off honorably, and bury it decently) still
warm; whose warmth within few minutes was improved into motion, that motion
within few hours into sense; that sense within a day into speech; that speech
within certain weeks into a perfect recovery; living above 10 years after (with
a pale look, and a Scarff-tied arm) a Monument of a Sons affection to a Father,
as of both to the Father of their Country; for whose sake his purse bled (there
is a vein for silver as well as blood) as well as his body, the War standing
him and his Soh in 64000 l. whereof 120 l. per annum in Land, and 3582 l. in
money for Composition: for which the Family (there was Coll. Io. Scroop^) is
highly esteemed by his Majesty, who is happy in that quod in principi rarum ac
prope insolitum est, ut se putet obligatum, aut si putet, amet Plin. Ep. ad
Trajan.

3. William Salisbury of Bochymbid Denb. Governor of Denbigh Castle, was such
another plain and stout Cavalier in his True blew Stockings ((...)) who yielded
not his Castle till all was lost; nor then his loyalty, keeping up the
Festivals, Ministry and prayers of the Church by his example, and charity:
printing Orthodox Books in Welsh, and buying them in English at his own charge:
relieving the poor Cavaliers, and encouraging the rich, zealously, but wisely
and warily: his loyalty cost him and his son Charles Salisbury 781l. by way of
composition, and 100 l. per annum in a way of charity. An old Gentleman of a
great spirit that would would deal faithfully with any man; and spoke so
plainly to his Majesty for two hours in private that the good King said, nev^r
did Prince hear so much truth at once.

He was sure to have his Carolon Christmas day, as St. Bernard his bymn. See
Mr. R. Vaughans Dedic. of Bishop Usher and Bishop Prideaux his works to him,
translated at his charge. R. Vaughan whose house Caergay was burned for his
loyalty, to the ground, a great Critic in the Welsh Language, and Antiquities
(as was Mr. Rob. Vaughan of Hengour) to whom his Country is much engaged for
translating the Practice of Piety, and other good Books into Welsh.

4. Sir Thomas Salisbury of Lleweney by Denbigh, a Gentleman every way;
especially in Loyalty and Arms recovering the honor of that ancient and noble
Family by his early and effectual adhering to K. Charles I. which was tainted
by his Predecessors practices against Q. Elizabeth: he hazzarding as much for
the established Religion against the Novelties of his time, as his Ancestor did
for what he thought the old Religion, against what he supposed the new in his.
Under him the Welsh at Brentford, made good the Greek Proverb with right
British valor, (...), He that flies will fight again,: those who being
little better than naked, cannot be blamed for using swift heels at Edgehill;
must (having resolution to arm their minds as soon as they had armor to cover
their bodies) be commended for using as stout arms (as any) in this fight,
which cost the Family, though Sir Thomas died not long after 2000 l.

5. Sir Evan Lloyd of Yale, a sober Gentleman, and one of the first that waited
on his Majesty at Wrexam, for which he suffered deeply several times, till his
Majesty's Restoration; by whom he was made Governor of Chester, a City of
which it is said, that it was more honor to keep a Gate in it, than to command
a whole City elsewhere; seeing East Gate therein was committed formerly to the
Earl of Oxford, Bride Gate to the Earl of Shrewsbury, Water Gate to the Earl of
Derby, and North Gate to the Major. He died as soon as he was invested in his
Government, 1663/4.

Godfrey Lloyd, Charles Lloyd, and Tho. Lloyd, were Colonels in the Kings
Army; and Coll. Rob. Ellis a vigilant, sober, active, and valiant Commander,
240 l. Sir Francis Lloyd, Caerm. 1033 l. Walt. Lloyd, Lleweny Carding. Esquire 1033
l.

6. Col. Anthony Thelwall, a branch of the Worshipful Family of the Thelwalls
of Plasyward near Ruthin in Denbighshire, known for his brave Actions at
Cropredy (where his Majesty trusted him with a thousand of the choicest men he
had, to maintain, as he did bravely, the two advantageous Villages, Burley and
Nelthorp) and at the second Newberry fight, where he did wonders with the
reserve of Sir G. Lisles Tertia; and had done more, had he not been slain for
not accepting of Quarter. Not long after Daniel Thelwall of Gray's Inn Esquire paid
540 l. composition, Io. Thelwall of Pace-Coch Denb. Esquire 117 l.

The Right Honorable Thomas Wriothsley, Earl of Southampton, England, and
Privy-Counsellor to both Kings Charles I. and II. bred in the strictest School
and Coll. Eaton by Windsor, and Magdalen College in Oxford, to a great insight
into general and various Learning: and in the Low Countries and France, to a
great happiness in Experiences and Observations in the Affairs of War, Trade,
and Government; the result, of which, and his retired studies, by reason of the
troubles of the Age, and the infirmities of his body, much troubled with the
Stone, (with a sharp fit whereof he died 1667.) was as King Charles the First,
who conversed with him much in his Closet, called it; and King Charles the
Second, who came often with the Counsel to his House and Bed side, found it
Safe and clear Counsel; a sober and moderate Spirit (the reason, together with
the general opinion of his great integrity and unblemished reputation, he was
so much reverenced and courted by the Parliament (as they called it) and so
often employed in seven Public Messages, and three solemn Treaties between the
King and Parliament) a serious temper and deep thoughts, understanding Religion
well (he was reckoned the best Lay-Divine And the excellent judgment he would
give of all the rational discourses i^ Religion extant.
by his Polemical and Practical Discourses, after the Kings death, in England)
and practicing it better. Prayers, Sermons, and Sacraments being performed in
no Family more solemnly than in his house; private preparations before the
monthly Communion, used no where more seriously than that, of all that
belonged to his noble retinue in his Closet: his stipends to the poor Clergy
and Gentry in the late times were constant and great, near upon (besides what
he sent beyond Sea) 1000 l. a year: his charity to the Poor of each place where
he had either his residence or estate Particularly in the la^e sickness.
Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly, above 500 l. a year among those few
Ministers reduced into distress by the late fire, he bestowed (besides
particular largesses, and a resolution to take them, if unprovided, to any
Preferments that should fall in his Gift) an 100 Pieces in Gold, giving always
his Livings to the choicest men (recommended to him by the Fathers of the
Church, whose judgments he much relied upon in those Cases) in the Kingdom he
reckoned it certainly a more blessed thing to give than receive, when (besides
his great Hospitality during his life, and his manifold and large Benefactions
at his death) he gave away so much for public good: and, as I am told,
received not one farthing all the while either as Lord Treasurer, or Privy
Counselor, for his own private advantage. He was one of the Honorable Lords
who offered his life to save his Majesty; pleading, that he had been the
Instrument of his Government, and hazzarded it to bury him.

His Composition was 3466l. in Money, and 250 l. a year in Land taken from him,
and his losses in the War 54000 l. Sir Walter VVrotsley not VVriothsley of
VVrotsley Stafford 1332 l. 10 ^. with 15 l. per annum Land taken from him.

Frederick Cornwallis, Treasurer of the Household, Comptroller and Privy
Counselor to his Majesty, (whose old Servant he had been, and his Fathers and
Uncles before him) at his Restoration, and made Baron Cornwallis of Eye in
Suffolk at his Majesty's Coronation. The Temple of Honor being of right open to
him in time of Peace, who had so often hazzarded himself in the Temple of
Virtue in the time of War; particularly, at Copredy-bridge, where the Lord
Willmot twice Prisoner, was rescued once by Sir Frederick Cornwallis, and the
next time by Sir R. Howard: Sir F. being, as the last Pope said of this, a Man
of so cheerful a spirit, that no sorrow came near his heart: and of so resolved
a mind, that no fear came into his thoughts; so perfect a Master of Courtly and
becoming Raillery, that he could do more with one word in Jest, than others
could do with whole Harangues in Earnest; a well-spoken man, competently seen
in modern Languages, of a comely and goodly Personage, died suddenly of an
Apoplectical fit, Ian. 7. 1661. Pope Innocent being in discourse about the best
kind of death, declared himself for sudden death; sudden, not as unexpected,
that we are to pray against, but sudden, as unfelt, that he wished for. To him
I may add, Sir Will. Throgmorton, Knight Marshall to his Majesty, who died
166^. A Gentleman of an Ancient Family (to whom a great spirit was as
Hereditary, as a great Estate) who did much service to his Majesty in England,
and was able to do more to him and his Friends in Holland, where he was
formerly a Soldier, and then an Inhabitant; worth is ever at home, and
carry^th its welcome with it wherever it goes, who had lost his life sooner
with a Bullet got into his body, had not he done as they say Mr. Farnaby the
Grammarian did, who coming over from the Dutch Camp, poor and wounded at
Billingsgate, met with a poor Butterwoman, of whom he bought as much as he was
able to pay for, melted it down, and scoured his body with it when he kept
School first in a Cellar in Aldersgate Street. In the Wars there were for
personal Valor very eminent, Sir Baynam and Sir Clement Throgmorton, who
whilst others boast of their French blood, may with their English Family vie
Gentry with any of the Norman Extraction. 1 For Antiquity, four Monasyllables,

Mynne, Governor of Hereford, (there were in the Army besides Col. Robert, and
Col. Nicholas Mynne, one or both Knights Harbingers) and signing the Articles
at the Rendition of Bristol, an experienced Commander first in Ireland, and
afterward (coming Sir William St. Leager came over with him, with his Regiment
afterward, Commanding at second Newberry battle the Cornishmen, and the Duke
of Yorks Regiment. Sir Anthony St. Leiger of Ulcomb Kent (where it has) been a
Kinghtly Family 300 years, Sir Tho. St. Leiger being Brother-in-law to Edward
the 4th. was killed commanding Prince Ruperts Lifeguard at Newberry second
battle Oct. 27. 1644. His son I suppose Sir A. St. Leiger paying 400 l.
composition. This Ancient Families decays has been the occasion (the issue
general of decayed Estates are projects) of many noble Inventions in England,
preferring to be Masters of a Molebill, than dependant on the highest Prince in
Christendom.
over with a Brigade 1653. over whom he was General in England, distressing
Glocest^r from Berkly and thereabout with continual Skirmishes, Massy saying,
He had played till these came over. A restless man in pursuit of some project
every day to hearten and employ his own Soldiers, and weary the Enemy; as he
was going to join the Forces of Hereford and Worcestershire at Castlelane, with
a design on Gloucester and others, not keeping touch with him, he was cut off
with the best Regiment (made so by continual exercise) within three miles of
Gloucester, in disadvantagious Enclosures (the consequence whereof was the
defeating of the Kings Power in Southwales) being much missed by his Friends,
and honored by his Foes, who gave him a stately Burial 1644. in Testimony of
his Worth and Valor, being the fairest, and shrew dest Enemy in Christendom,
whose Monument shall be supported by

First, Col. H. Washington, who blocked up Gloucester on Tewxbury side (a
Gentleman, though disobliged by being put upon designs without Money to pursue
them, never suffered his Heat and Fever to turn to a Frenzy, unworthily
attempting what he could not handsomely atchieve, though vexed that his swelling
and prosperous sails should be silled rather with airy promises, than real
supplies) and Eversham, scoured the hedges near Stopwash, a Border-Town of
Cheshire, to make way for Prince Rupert to enter into that Important Garrison;
kept Worcester (till his Majesty under his hand June 10. 1646. commanded him to
yield it) against all Assaults and Summons, and did Wonders by Patience and
Resolution at Colchester, as he did at the first taking of Bristol; the first
breach whereof entered was called by his name, made terrible thereafter by his
brave Regiment of Dragoons, whose fierce and active Gallantry bestowed a
Proverb on every resolute Exploit, Away with it quoth Washington.

Secondly, The Honorable Col. Oneal, the only Protestant of his Family; its a
question whether gaining more honor by his hard service about Gloucester, and in
both the Newberries with King Charles the I. or by his assiduous Negotiations
and Messages posting from place to place (in Holland, where he was warned to
the Countess of Chester^ield in France, where he was welcome to the best
Cavaliers, and Germany) for King Charles the II. especially in the various
Occasions, Opportunities, and Revolutions 1659. at Fontarabia, Scotland,
Flanders, England, etc. that made way for his Majesty's Restoration, who let
him to Farm the Post Office: He died 1664. Its more to be called an Oneal, than
an Emperor in Ireland.

3. By Colonel Will. Pretty, who when Backehouse sent him word he woulk
Breakfast with him, returned that then he would Dine at Gloucester; a Gentleman
that loved his last thoughts (as Mothers the youngest Child) best, declaring
siercely Sept. 2. 1645. That Bristol was Tenable by force, and needed not the
courteste or charm of words (meaning Treaties with Fairfax) to maintain it;
only the Soldiery were to be refreshed, and the Bays of Victory are not to
be plucked up, till by fair opportunities they are grown ready.

4. Colonel Pert, who received his Deaths wound 1645. in Cornwall, not to be
gained by Power or Policy from the ground he stood in; the Riddle of the Army
never appearing what he was, nor being what he appeared, giving his Enemies
always too little hope to trust, and too little to distrust him. Such must be
as dark as midnight, who must perform actions as bright as Noonday.

5. Col. Tailor, there was one Mr. Tailor Resident for his Majesty with the
Emperor, in honorable esteem, who made the Glocestershire Forces pay, as he
said, Cost and Damage for the death of Col. Mynne, at last killed himself
1645, at Bristol (when unus homo pereundo restituit rem) where he died in the
bed of honor, about which we can only draw the Curtain.

Richard Tailor of ^rnely Sussex, paid 500 l. composition, Jo. Talbot of
Thornton York 800 l. Sir Jo. Talbot Lanc. 600 l. Tho. Tailor Ocle Pichard Her.
265 l. Rich. Tailor Clapham Bedf. Esquire 450 l.

6. Col. Rich. Poor, that little man and great Soldier slain in Wales.

7. As was Col. Will. Win of Berthu at Wem, the Bulwark of Northwales (which
as Soldiers cry was all and one his, because of his large alliance, obliging
spirit, exemplary sobriety, great conduct and fidelity) to which the Enemy
never entered while he lived, no more than the English could while Owen
Glendower Commanded such a strong Line of Communication he had formed in all
the Marches, and so watchful and active was he in maintaining that Line.

The Worshipful Wynnes of Gwyddir were great sufferers for his Majesty.

8. Col. Dalby, that excellent Engineer killed at Wingfield Manor Derbyshire.

9. Col. Io. Marrow, slain near Sandiway in Cheshire.

10. Sir Matthew Carew, whose Misfortunes were his advantage (It is an ill wind
that blows no body good) his Company being delightful, when his service,
though prudent and valiant, was unsuccessful, and he fit to stand before
Princes, and not before mean men; a man of spirit for his non Faelix, carrying
a badge of Valor (no blemish but Beauty, Mars has his spots as well as Venus)
in his face.

Sir Francis Carew Beddington Surrey paid 1000l. Composition.

11. Col. Bagot who had traveled most places in the world (one in most great
Actions from 1624. to 1645.) to accomplish himself for the service of his own
Country, where he was Governor of Litchfield Staffordshire, keeping (with Col.
Lan^ Sir Richard Bagot, Dr. Bird, and my Lord Loughborough) that Country in
good order, by suppressing the Moor-Lander, (though as envy always must be
expected, if it will not be surprised by worth (most men supposing their Bays
to wither if others flourish) some found fault with his Actions, because they
did them not themselves; which he endured being used to hardship, having not
eaten his bread, nor fasted neither in one place: He was slain at Nazeby.

Harvy Bagot of Parkhall Warwick Esquire paid 600l. Composition.

12. Col. Henry Tillier, one of those eminent Commanders brought over by Prince
Rupert from the Palatinate; zealous for Religion, and therefore might be
called, as well as Robert Fitzwalter, Marshall of Gods Army and holy Church:
worth will not long want a Master, his judgment was much relied on in the
Relief of Newark, in the ordering of Marston-moor fight (where with Major
General Porter he was taken Prisoner) in the siege of Bristol, at the Delivery
whereof he, Vavasor, and Mynne drew up the Articles, as he did those of Oxford,
taking as many of the Garrison as would be Listed into pay under him for the
French service, as the Spanish Ambassador did for the Spanish.

13. Col. Robert, and Col. Sir Edward Broughton, the last of whom did his
Majesty Knight service in Cheshire and Newark 1645. 1646. at Worcester 1651.
being one of the few Loyal Subjects that appeared there: in Cheshire 1659. with
the Lord Booth, for which he was long Imprisoned in the Gatehouse, whereof he
was afterward Keeper, woing the Widow whose Prisoner he was: and in the
Sea^fight 1665. between us and the Dutch, with his Highness the Duke of York,
where he valiantly lost his life, scorning to fall, though in effect killed,
and in his stubborn way blundring out Commands when he could not speak them.

14. Col. Sir Arthur Blainey and Col. John Blainey, bred in Ireland, and after
he had lost his arm in Anglesea ( a) with success, showed it depended not on
Valor 1648. killed there. The first, the plainer man and greater Soldier, the
second, the faster man and deeper Politician, whom his own Country cry up for
such a man, that it will be a question hereafter whether ever there was such a
man.

When invited thither by the Right Honorable Lord Buckley, an eminent Gentleman
for his Majesty in Northwales, basely murdered by one Chedle of the other side.

15. Sir Fulke Hunkes, an old Soldier from Ireland, whose Valor was attended
with such meekness, that upon all occasions the biass of his inclination did
still hang (...); and he took as much pains to bring over his old acquaintance
on the other side, by persuasions and Letters as to conquer them by force. And
indeed so weighty his overtures, that qui deliberarun: des^iverunt, they that
came to themselves and considered, came over to him and revolted.

16. Sir R. Leveson of Frentham Staff. (who with 360 l. per annum settled, paid
6000 l. composition; a great instance of Commines his rule, that they who have
the art to please the people, have power to raise them. He prevented all
jealousies of his Majesty's proceedings, much more complaints; doing what the
people about desired, before they desired it; being very tender in bestowing
Commands and Trusts, since no man is served with a greater prejudice, than he
that employs suspected Instruments. Coll. Tho. Leveson, a Gentleman fearless of
death always, and yet always prepared for it; that never begged or bought
Command, winning all he wore; Governor of Dudley, which he held till May 13.
1646.

17. There were in the Kings Army 3 Colonels more of the name, viz. Sir
Charles Dallison, Sir Robert Dallison, and Sir William Dallison, who spent
130000l. therein: men of great command in their Country, bringing the strength
thereof to the reasonable assistance of his Majesty.
Sir Tho. Dallison, a Lancashire Gentleman, of great service in Prince Ruperts
Brigade, whose Loyalty cost him his life at Nazeby, and 12000 l. in his Estate,
being one of those noble persons, whose too much courage (as Buchanan says in
all defeats of the Scots) was the reason they were conquered; and their
pursuing their Enemies too far, the cause of their being beaten by them.

18. Sir Richard Crane, bred in the Palatinate, serving the Prince Elector,
with whose son Prince Rupert he came over, 1642. to serve his own Sovereign: a
Gentleman very careful against all ill opinions of his courage, or prudence,
knowing that if the Enemy overawed, or overreached him, they for ever after
had his measure. Slain at a sally out of Bristol, 1645. Be it here remembered
that the Worshipful John Crane Esquire of Lorton, Bucks. paid 1080 l. composition.

19. Coll. Anthony Air, Coll. Rowland Air, and Sir Gervase Air, Robert Air
of West Cabfield, Wilts. Esquire hazzarded their lives, and spent above 40000 l. in
his Majesty's Service: commended not only by their side, (which may be partial,
but by their Enemies who cannot be suspected so) for commanding their looks,
words, and actions, yea their very dress, garb, and accent, as well as the
pretenders by a rule: and watching shrewdly in all Skirmishes the advantage of
Ground, Wind, and Sun; each singly considerable, but little less than an Army
when all put together.

20. Coll. Cockram, an Agent well versed in the humors and intriguies of the
Danish, Polish, Swedish, and other Northern Courts, whence he procured
considerable supplies both for England and Scotland, reducing the former
Leagues of those Crowns to more exact particulars with reference to the present
state of his Majesty's affairs.

21. Coll. Edward Hammond, Coll. Francis and John Heath, all astive in
Colchester. Edw. Heath of Cotsmore Rutland Esquire paid 700 l. composition. Jo.
Hammond of Elling. Norf. 1000 l. R. Heath of Eyerton, Chesh. 300 l.


22. Coll. Sandys slain Where fell Coll. Scot.
at Alford Hampshire, besides there were in the service of the name, Coll. H.
Sandys, of St. Michaels Bedw. Worcest. 1400 l. Sir Martin Sandys, Coll. Robert
Sandys, Coll. Sam. Sandys of Vmbers^^ Worcest. Esquire 1445 l. and Sir Tho. Sandys,
the first of whom would usually rise out of his bed, dress him, open the doors,
walk round about the field, fight, now striking, now defending himself, and
return to bed not wakened: the second for parentage, person, grace, gesture
valor, and many other excellent parts, among which, skill in Music) he was
the most acceptable person in all places he came of his time; except his
Enemies Quarters, where his person was very terrible, his actions more. There
is a Bird which has looks like a man, which killing a man comes to the Water
to drink, pineth away by degrees and never after enjoys it self. An unhappy
duel was a covering to one of these Gentlemen's eves all his days, ever after
his Conscience loathing what he had surfeited on, refused all challenges with
more honor than others accepted them. The fourth of these Gentlemen altered
the Scene of the War from Defending to Offending, and from Speeches to
Syllogisms of Fire and Sword, gaining much goods, and doing more good in
showing that the King was not deserted.

23. Sir Francis and Sir William Carnaby, both Gentlemen of good quality, of
Thornum in Northumb. 10000 l. the worse for the War: The one Treasurer of the
Northern Army, and the other a Colonel; both after the defeat at Marston-moor
accompanying my Lord of New Castle beyond Sea; whence the first returned with
new hopes to serve his Majesty, and was slain at At which place and time sell
the Right Worshipful Sir ^. Hurton
Sherburn in Yorkshire, 1645. having time enough to rise on his knees, and
cry, Lord have mercy upon me, bless and prosper his Majesty. A short Prayer at
death serves him whose life was nothing but one continued Prayer; and the
other died at Paris, not much concerned that he was set by, and not set by;
hung up like the Axe when it has hewed all the hard timber on the Wall,
unregarded; and none of those that desired to embroyl the Nation in a new War;
and like a knavish Surgeon out of design to blister the sound flesh into a
sore, to gain by the curing of it.

24. Coll. Sir ^. Appl^yard, Dilling. Cumb. the first that entered Leicester,
and was therefore Governor of it. Good always at at bold Onsets; but better at
prudent Retreats. And to conclude all,

25. The Lord Bard, a Ministers son of our Church, that valiantly fought for
it; coming from the University of Cambridge to the Army, advancing by the
particular notice his Highness Prince Rupert took of his large Spirit penned
within a narrow Fortune, from a Commoner, by his great Services, to a Baron;
leading on the Left hand ^ertia with Sir G. Lisle at Naseby, and bringing off
the whole Brigade, otherwise likely to be cut off at Alesford, he with the two
London Prentices, Sir T. and W. Bridges, are not the only English instances of
men of private Occupations, arriving at great skill in Martial performances:
Sir Io. H^wkwood, a General in Florence, was a Tailor, turning his needle to a
Sword, and his thimble to a Shield; he appeared not in our Wars as spirits, who
are seen once, and then finally vanish, being often put upon Honorable, but
Difficult service, to keep places with few men, against a fierce and numerous
Enemy; to whom once he set open the gate of Cambden house, his charge, as if
deserted, but entertained them so, that they spilt not so much Claret Wine in
the house, as they left blood before it. He would often commend Sir Clement
Pastons method of bounty, Building a fair House for Hospitality, where his
serving-men spent their Younger days in waiting upon him; and an Hospital hard
by, where they might bestow their Elder years in Recollecting themselves; and
say that he descended from that man in Norfolk (he must be a Norfolk man) that
went to Law with W. and overthrew the Conqueror. All these brave Gentlemen,
both for Camp and Court, for Entertainment and Service, in a March for Valor,
and in a Mask for Ingenuity. Gentlemen who were most of them buried in honor,
and his Majesty's Cause for a while buried with them, whose Ashes should not be
thus huddled together, deserving a more distinct Commemoration; especially
those that have been as devout as valiant, and as prudent as devout, their Wit
being as sharp as their Swords, and piercing as far into business, as those did
into bodies.

Sir Francis Gerard, Sir Cecil Trafford, and Coll. Francis Trafford Lancash.
Gent. men worthy, Recusants, arming themselves in defense of those Laws by
which they suffered; valuing their allegiance above their opinion, and
supporting a Government that was imposed upon them, rather than betraying it to
them that would impose upon the Nation. With whom I might reckon Sir Peter
Brown and his son, of Kidlington, Oxfordsh. who was slain in the service, being
mortally wounded at Naseby, and dying at Northampton. Sir Troilus Turbervile,
Captain-Lieutenant of his Majesty's Lifeguard, slain in the late Kings march
from Newark to Oxford: whose bounty to his Soldiers puts me in mind of my Lord
Audleys to his Esquires, who bestowed the Pension of 500 Marks upon them, which
the Black Prince bestowed upon him for his service at the battle of Poictiers;
and when questioned for it by the Prince, said, These have done me long and
faithful service, without whose assistance I being a single man, could have
done little; besides the fair Estate left me by my Ancestors, enableth me
freely to serve your Highness. Sir Jo. Fortescue Cookill Worc. Esquire paid 234l.
for his Loyalty, Jo. Fortescue of Bridlest Esquire Devon. 202l. Sir Faithful
Fortescue came over to his Majesty at Edgehill with his Troop.
Nicholas Fortescue, a Knight of Malta, slain in Lancashire, whose worth is the
more to be regarded by others, the less he took notice of it himself; a Person
of so dextrous an address, that when he came into notice, he came into favor;
when he entered the Court, he had the Chamber, yea the Closet of a Prince; a
Gentleman that did much in his person, and as he would say, Let Reputation do
tho rest; he and Sir Edmund Fortescue were always observed so wary as to have
all their Enemies before them, and leave none behind them. Sir Henry Fortescue,
being the most Valiant Commander in H. 5th. time, Sir Ad. Fortescue, the
strictest Governor (he was Porter of Callis in H. 7th. time.) Sir Hen.
Fortescue, and Sir Io. Fortescue, the most learned Lawyers in Henry 6th. time,
Sir Io. Fortescue the wisest Counselor in Queen Eliz. time (whose studies he
was Overseer of) and these Gentlemen very eminent Soldiers in King Charles I.
Reign, always prevailing in their parts with parties, as much beneath their
Enemies in number, as above them in resolution and temperance; by whom if there
were any violence offered, the appearance of these Commanders checked, they
carrying civility in their presence against all rudeness, as the Abbot of
Battle did a Pardon in his (having power to save any Malefactor he saw going to
be executed) in all executions. Col. Cuthbert Coniers of Leighton in Durham,
slain at Mulpasse in Cheshire Aug. 1644. and Col. Cuthbert Major Laurence
Clifton and Captain John Clifton slain at Shelford House, Sir Gervase Clifton
of Clifton Not. 7625.
Clifton slain near Manchester, who could not endure that Rebellion that took
Sanctuary in Religion, which wanted a refuge its self, the horns of the Altar
pushing it from him; sober men that could not endure to see the English coming
to fight now under King Charles, as they did 600 years ago under King Herold,
drunk, and not able either to stand to an Enemy (so overcome with drink) nor
fly from him; both with Col. Richard Manning slain at Alseford in Hampshire,
Col. There was Coll. Matthew. and Ralph Eure in the Kings Army, Sir Sampson Eure
Garley Park Heart. paid 110l. composition.
Will. Eure, Brother to the late Lord Eure slain at Marston-Moor, and his son
L. C. Tho. Eure slain at Newberry. Col. L. C. Philip Howard, Nephew to the
second, and Cousin Germain to the first, slain near Chester.
Tho. Howard, son of Sir Francis Howard, who gained the battle at Adderton-moor
(as Eyewitnesses testify, with the loss of his life, June 30. 1643. (one of
them that taught the world to plant Laurels on the brow of the Conquered.) Col.
Thomas Howard, son to the Lord William Howard, slain at Pi^rebridge in the
County of York; the Honorable Sir Francis and Sir Robert Howard, of whose Names
there were seven Peers with his Majesty. Col. Col. Thomas Morgan of Weston, was
slain at the first Newberry battle.
Thomas, Col. Anthony, and Col. James Morgan, Sir Edward Morgan of Pencoed Mon.
whose Loyalty stood him in 1007 l. Sir John Cansfield (who interposed himself
between his Majesty, King Charles and the Prince, and the Fury of the Enemy,
bringing off both with two dangerous wounds in his own body (as King Charles I.
attested under his own hand). The Right Honorable William and Francis, And his
Brother the Honorable Edward Talbot Esquire slain, together with Mr. Chapter Townley at
Marston-moor Volunteers, and Mr. Charles Sherburne. Col. James Talbor was a
Person deserving well of his Majesty, Sherrington Talbot of Salwarpe Wor^. his
Estate suffered 2011l. deep.
Earls of Shrewsbery, the one attending his former Majesty in all his Wars with
great Charge and Prudence, and hardly used by the Parliament who broke th
Articles with him; and the other following his Majesty that now is, in all his
streights from Worcester Fight, where he ventured to wait upon him with a
gallant Company of Gentlemen to his Restoration, which he attempted often with
the hazard of his life, and saw at last to the great comfort of it, according
to their Renowed Ancestors the Talbots Motto on their words, more manlike than
Elegant, and like a Nobleman rather than a Pedant. Sum Talboti pro defendendo
Rege contra Inimicos; neither of them when sent to raise Forces for his Majesty
(whose party deserved not the name of an Army, until the Earl of Shrewsbury
came in, no more than Henry 7 th. did, till Sir Gilbert Talbot came to him)
answering him, as their Ancestors did Henry 8th. when he sent to him to
fortify Callice, who said he could neither fortify, nor sistifie without
money. The Right Honorable John lately, and George Nevill, now Lord
Abergavenny, the first Baron of Abergavenny (created so by King Harold 2. a
Family so potent then, that whereas others boast that they came over with the
Conqueror; it may speak a bigger word, viz. That the Conqueror came in with and
by it.) Noblemen, whose plain and honest Natures is as good a sign of their
Antiquity, as the plainness and simplicity of their Coats and Arms, Sequestered
and troubled much beyond the Note in the Catalogue of Compounders comes to.
John Lord of Abergavenny 531 l. I say, To these Iadde Sir Henry Constable, Lord
Viscount of Dunbar, who died in the service at Scarborough.
these and many more Catholics that were faithful to King Charles I. in his
distresses from 1642. to 1648. And Who has three Crowns added to his Arms with
this Motto, Subditus fidelis Regis and Regni salus.
Col. Carlese, Sir James Hamilton and others, who were to King Charles II.
1651. in his extremity and Escape, make it probable that Marianaes
Institutions, Suarez his Apology, and his Potestas Regia Bell. de Pont. Romans l.
Creswell. Philopatus de offic. Principum, may be Books whose dangerous notion
as those of Buchanan and others, among us may be published and discoursed,
among those who abhor them; and though they honor the Authors, venture their
lives to oppose their Tenets.

Sir Richard Lawdy, slain at Cover in Glocestershire, and those two Ingram
Hopton, and Sir George Bowls, who fell at Winsby near Horn Castle October
1643. There was Colonel Jo. and Colonel Thomas Butler, Men much valued and
much lamented, as Persons of great Interest in the Associated Counties, and
Colonel Croker.
William Butler, and Sir William Clark, two Kentishmen of great Quality slain
at Cropredy-bridge June 29. 1644. those two Northern men that swallowed the War
in earnest, Sir Thomas Metham, and Sir William Lambton, who died at
Marston-moor, the two hardy Courtiers, Sir Thomaas Dallison, and Sir Richard
Cave: Sir John Beaumont of Grace Dieu in the County of Leicester, who died in
the service; that good Soldier Col. Croker near Oxon. who paid 909 l. need no
more than a mention here.

Charles Cavendish, son to Sir C. Cavendish, Grandfather to Sir W. C. and
Privy-Counsellor and Treasurer of the Chamber to H. 8. Edw. 6. Queen Mary,
younger Brother to the most potent Who lost by the War 733579 l. and his son,
the most hopeful Charles Lord Viscount Mansfield, who had an eminent Command
under him, died in these times: He was General of the Ordnance.
William Duke of Newcastle, inclined from his youth to Learning (particularly
the Mathematics) as his Brother was to Chivalry; those studies agreeing better
with his vigorous soul, than other exercises did with his weak body; when the
liberty of a Camp in the North endangered the very being of Christianity there,
the Soldiers retaining little of their Religion, but their Allegiance, as if
their service to the King, did excuse their care of their duty to God; Sir
Charles his excellent discourses set off with a most sweet nature, and a most
strict example, prevailed as successfully over the Army, as they did a great
while over their Enemies, keeping, though not improving their charge; though
indeed it was much improved, in that it was not impaired all the while he had
the charge of it; partly by the Valor of his Person, and partly by the
advantage of his Country, making so stout a resistance, that they whose
successes made them fly in other parts of the Kingdom, could a great while but
creep in the North: a Country that showed it self as Valiant in what it did, as
patient in what it suffered; their Hands and Arms being as good as Backs and
Shoulders. He was the person entrusted by the Northern parts to welcome her
Majesty 1643. with a brave Body of Horse to guard her: and the Person entrusted
by her with 20 Troops of Horse, 2000 Foot, and 500 Arms more to protect them.
Great his care of Ammunition, as Master of the Ordnance, and greater of Money,
as Treasurer of the Northern parts, till the defeat at Marston-moor (when a
brave Troop of Gentlemen desired him and his Brother to Lead them up to perish
Honorably, rather than outlive the consequence of that day) after which he
went over with his Brother to Holland and France, whence returning 1651. upon
my Lord Chancellor and others persuasions, to compound for his Estate (which he
protested he had rather loose than have it by composition from the Enemy.)
After the settlement of that, and some little Remainder of the Dukes, he died,

Sister, the Heroic Princess, the Duchess of Newcastles; With this
Inscription, The most generous and charitable man having; never Courting, yet

admired and then loved him.

I find Sir Charles Cavendish of Wellingon Line. 2048l. deep in the
Goldsmiths-Hall Book, and Francis Cavendish of Debridge Derby 480l. The Lord
Henry Cavendish was a Person of great Command.
Charles Cavendish Esquire (Brother to the Right Honorable William Earl of
Devonshire, whose eminent services and sufferings deserve this Motto, Premendo
sustulit, ferendo vicit; a person of no vulgar parts himself; and a Patron of
those who are above the ordinary Learning,) Qui art militari it a inclaruit,
ut vividae ejus virtuti nihil fuerit impervium, (it being as impossible for him
not to be, as not to be active) being a Commissioner in the Northern Array,
secured Lincoln and Gainsborough; whence being Governor of that place, he
issued out to the relief of the surprised Earl of Kingston, he was
overpowered; and his horse carrying him off over the Trent, but sticking in
the Mud, he died, magnanimously, refusing quarter; and throwing the blood that
ran from his wounds in their faces that shed it, with a spirit as great as his
blood: his goodness was as eminent as his valor, and he as much beloved by his
Friends, as feared by his Enemies.

Sir Walter Pie of Mind in Herefordshire, equally a friend to the Mitre
Herefordshire, Worcestershire, and Glocestershire, against the Scotified
English, expending 20000 l. as he had gone into the North against the
Frenchified Scots, expending 5000 l. of a grateful Guest becoming a bountiful
Host to his Majesty. For which services he was twice a Prisoner in the Wars at
Hereford and Bristol, and four times after suffered in Goldsmiths-hall, (which
like the Doomesday Book of the Conqueror omitted, nec Lucum, nec Lacum, nec
Locum, though Favorites were rated, nec adspatium, nec ad pretium, as it was
said of the Abbey of Crowland, in that Book) 2649. as Sir Edmund Pie of
Lachamstead, Bucks. was 3225.

Sir Walter Pie was prisoner with Sir William Crofts Sir William Crofts was
slain at Stokesey, Shrop. June 9. 1645. James Crofts, Her. Will. Crofts, Devon.
Christoph. Crofts, and Edward Crofts, York. paid 700l. for their Loyalty.

abilities, had left the Court, 1626. for some words against the D. of B.) in
its prosperity; and being of great Integrity, came to help it, 1640. in its
adversity; insomuch that King Charles I. when he saw him put on his armor at
Edgehill, admired it first, and afterward was very glad of it, being, he
said, the only man in England he feared; being looked upon as able enough to be
Secretary of State always, and as the fittest man at that time, being a man
inured to great observations; and constant business from his childhood) and
Coll. Conisby Tho. Conisby, Morton Baggot, Worcest. paid 91 l,

of Hertfordshire, who being told that some Enemies had prevailed to make him
Sheriff, answered, I will keep never a Man the more, nor never a Dog the less,
for all that: and who for publishing his Majesty's Proclamation, and executing
his Commission of Array, was a Prisoner in the Fleet, I think, as long as his
soul was prisoner in his body; his person being first seized, and then his
Estate,) were the persons with whose death Fines threatened the Earl of Forth,
in case he should proceed against any of their way, knowing them worth their
whole Party. Herod might have salved his oath, because St. John ^aptist was
worth more than half the Kingdom. France, France, France, pronounced by the
Herald of France, answered to all the Titles of Castile, Arragon, etc.
pronounced by him of Spain.

Patrick Ruthen General King, a good Scotch Soldier, bred (and I think) after
the defeat at Marston-Moor, died in the Swedish service: and Sir Jo. Brown, a
good Commander, slain 1650. infight with Lambert.
Earl of Forth and Brentford, a Scotch man, and therefore an excellent
Soldier, bred in the Low Countries many years, and serving his Majesty of
Sweden in Germany as many: A wary man, as appeared in his ordering (for he
modelled that fight) the Battle at Edge-hil; and a stout man, as was seen at
Brentford and Gloucester, leading his forces so gallantly in the first of these
places, that with his own Regiment he cut off three of the best belonging to
the Parliament; and drawing his line so near and close about the other, that he
was shot in the head, in both the Newberry battles, Brandean Heath fight, and
near Banbury; in all which places, considering the hazard of his person, shot
in the arms, mouth, leg, and shoulder; admirable was the stediness of his
spirit and his present courage and resolution to spy out all advantages and
disadvantages, and give direction in each part of a great Army. A hail man made
for the hardship of Soldiers, being able to digest any thing, but injuries;
the weight of his mean birth depressed not the wings of his great mind, which
by Valor meditated advancement; being resolved (as the Scotch man said of his
Countrymen when sent abroad young) to do or Die.

formed in the air in legible characters: and a Princes always, though by the
fortune of War he had it sometimes imprisoned in a poor man's purse; minding not
the present benefit; but the happy issue of the War, this being the only way to
secure that. This old Priam having buckled on his armor in vain, left his
Country to advise the Prince in Holland, France, and at Sea, when there was no
fighting for his Father at Land. Having seen the Scots (after his very
intercessions) accept of his Master for their Prince, he designed, as old as he
was, broken with years and hardship, to march in the head of an Army to settle
him in England; but though, bearing up his spirit with a Review of his great
actions and renowned life (as a man having passed a large Vale, takes great
pleasure to look back upon it from the Hill he rests on) he did about 1650.
being sure, that as the Air, however depressed by a certain Elastical power,
will yet recover its place; so the Consciences of the English and Scots,
however kept under, would yet in time get up their sentiments of Duty and
Allegiance. Many Captains great actions had been greater, if reported less: but
this noble person will be believed the more, because expressed so little. It is
pity the Scots brave spirits should be debauched to Rebellion, who do so
bravely for their allegiance.

Coll. Leak, slain at Newark, and Mr. Leak found dead with Lands-down fight;
both sons to the Right Honorable Francis Leak, and brothers to the Right
Honorable Nicholas, now created 16 4.
Baron Deincourt, and Earl of Scarcedale; both active in his Majesty's service,
being in the number of the Peers, reckoned in the Declaration of the Parliament
at Oxford to the Parliament at Edinburgh, absent thence on his Majesty's
occasions, in settling his Contributions, and money, his Garrisons and Ports,
together with his Army and the discipline of it: both eminently suffering, as
it should seem by this Note; Francis Lord Deincourt P. Lancelot Leak, and Tho.

Sir Michael Ernely, an old Soldier, bred in the Low Countries, Ireland, he
came with Colonel Monk (the Renowned Duke of Albemarl) upon the Kings
Majesty's Orders, against as bad in England; and writ thus to those Parliament
Commissioners, that upon his Landing desired to treat with him.

Although we are sensible how unworthily the Parliament has deserted us, yet
we are not returned without his Majesty's special Commission: If you have the
like from the King, for the Arms you carry, we shall willingly treat with you;
otherwise we shall behave our selves like Soldiers and faithful Subjects.

his Sovereign, paying 800 l. composition; and giving what he could save from
his Enemies, in largesses to his friends, especially the learned Clergy; whose
prayers and good converse he reckoned much upon, as they did upon his
charities; which completed his kindness with bounty, as that adorned his
bounty with courtesy; courtesy not affected, but naturally made up of
humility, that secured him from envy; and a civility that kept him in esteem:
he being happy in an expression that was high, and not formal; and a Language
that was Courtly, and yet real.

Walter, Sir William, Sir Char. Vavasor, a Family equally divided between the
North and Wales, in their seats always, and in their Commands in the War; Sir
William being employed by his Majesty with a strong Party to awe and caress the
Welsh side of Glocestershire and Herefordshire, did his business very
effectually, by the good discipline of his men, and the obliging way of his own
carriage; to which he added the skill of two or three good Pens, to draw
Letters and Declarations; for which purpose it was at first that O. C.
entertained Ireton. He was as good at approaching a Garrison as at closing with
the Country, making the best Leaguer Sir I. Ashley ever saw, with his Welsh
Forces, on the North Gate of Gloucester, by a dextrous line of Communication
drawn between him and the Worcester Guard. And as good at checking a great
Garrison, by little actions, and vigilant and active Guards on the several
Passes; as he did as Commander in chief of the Glocestershire Forces, as at
besieging it; besides that, having been an experienced Soldier, he knew how to
work upon Soldiers and Officers, to trepan and betray Garrisons; but being
drawn off to Marston-moor, and disgusted with the miscarriage of that great
battle, he went over with my Lord of Newcastle, General King a Scotch man, the
Earl of Carnworth, Col. Basil, Sir Arthur Basset, Knighted by the Duke of

The Right Honorable, the Whose escape at Winc. was admirably contrived, not
only to his safety, but the converting of many to his Majesty's side, and
sowing of Dissension among the Enemies.
Lord Grandison, who received Bristol, after he had laid a design, prevented by
a ridiculous mistake to entrap Fines 1643. with his gallant Brigade of Horse
that never charged till they touched the Enemies Horses-head; after he had
charged through and through (notwithstanding four wounded, two Horses killed
under him; twelve men at once upon him upon Prince Rupert being in great danger
to the dismaying of the Army having no room for grief or fear, anger had so
fully possessed his soul) looking as if he would cut off the Enemy with his
Eyes, before he did it with his Arms) at the raising of the siege at Newark the
same year; and after he had brought (in his dexterous way of marching Horse)
several supplies through the thickest of his Enemies to Oxford, where his
Counsels and Advices were as pertinent, as his Actions were noble, King Charles
I. saying at his death, that he lost of him a good Counselor, and an honest
resolved man, free from spleen, as if he had always lived by the Medicinal
Waters of St. Vincents Rock, near which he was wounded, left the Garrison of
Oxford and Bristol should have Lank after their Bank: he was very forward in
motions as well as sallies out, for the furnishing of their Granaries, for
which the better sort had cause to commend him, and the meaner sort to bless
him, who never have more than they needed; and sometimes needed more than they
have.

The Right Honorable H. Earl of Danby, who received his Burmingham, son of Sir
John Danvers, and Elizabeth Nevil, the Lord Latimers Daughter and Coheir, born
at Dantsey in Wiltshire 157. where he was buried 1643. first entered in the
Low Country Wars under Maurice Prince of Orange, who made him a Captain of
Foot at Eighteen, then eminent in the Wars of France under H. 4. who Knighted
him for a great Action he did before his face at twenty one. After that, he was
I Captain of a great Ship in the Voyages of Cales and Portugal, under the Earl
of Nottingham Lord Admiral, who professed he was the best Sea-Captain in
England at twenty five. 2 He was Lieutenant General of the Horse, and Sergeant
Major of the whole Army in Ireland, under the Earl of Essex and the Lord
Mountjoy, before thirty made Baron of Dantsey, Lord President of Munster, and

honor of this Earl, in Emulation of what Scotland did in honor of the Earl of
Morton: the Scottish Earl (like Xeuxes his Picture) being adorned with all Arts
and Costliness while the English Peer (like the plain sheet of Apelles) got the
advantage of him by the Rich, Plainness, and Gravity of his Habit,) was the
greatest solemnity ever known in the Memory of Man: the composition for his
large Estate, is the greatest in the whole Catalogue, being one and twenty
thousand, five hundred and ninety seven pound, six shillings, not abating the
odd two pence. This minds me of Sir Thomas Danby of Fornley York, who paid
780l.

as the Country was toward him, whom they desired to live and die under for his
four excellent Qualities. 1 Skill. 2 Vigilance. 3 Sobriety. 4 Integrity and
Moderation. When he went over with the Duke of Newcastle to Hamborough,
Holland, and France, after the defeat of Marsto^moor, he told a friend of his

An History that Caeteris paribus will suit with,

1. Sir I find this Note in the Black Book of Goldsmiths-Hall; Sir Will.
Campian Comwel Kent 1397l.
W. Campian, as famous for his services at Borstall House, whereof he was
Governor, as Col. Blague was at Wallingford, both restless men. The latter
accomplishments puts me in mind of the Maid presented to King James for a
Rarity, because she could speak and write pure Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; the
King returned, But can she spin, meaning, was she as useful (as this Knight
was) Learned; as none more stern if occasion required, so none more gentle, in
so much that he deserved the Honor and Title, Sigismund the Emperor being here
in England with King H. the 5 ths. leave, bestowed on the greatest Soldier of
his time, viz. (true Courage and Courtesy are Individual Companions) the
Father of Courtesy. He said he went to the Wars to fight with his
Loyal-Countrymen; but to Colchester to perish with them, as he did in a brave
salley July 1648.

2. Sir Thomas Armestrong, who having done as much as a man could do in England
and Ireland, offered to do more than a man in the Isle of Man, that is,
maintain it against all the Parliaments Forces by Sea and Land.

3. Sir John Bois, Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, being likely to be cast
away in his passage to France, desired that he should be tied to the Mast with
his Arms about him, that he might, if any either Noble or Charitable found his
body, be Honorably buried. Sir John Bois need desire no more than one plain
stone of Dennington Castle (where he did the King faithful service, refusing to
surrender it either to Essex, or Manchester, or Horton, or the Scots Army, who
plied him for six weeks night and day; bidding them spare blood as they
pleased, for he would venture his, denying a Treaty with his own Brother) to
make him an honorable Monument: (Ancient his Family in Kent, and well-deserving
of the Church (especially since Dr. John Bois his time, the best Postiller of
England) and therefore since the Restoration of the Church, he was near the
most eminent Person in it, being Steward to the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury)
and his saving the Kings Army and Artillery in their coming off from the second
Newberry fight, with a pace faster than a Retreat, and slower than a flight.
His Epitaph.

There was another Sir John Bois a Col. a Gentleman of great Expedition in
dispatching Affairs in the Kings Army.

4. Sir William Courtney, who is transmitted to Posterity, as partner in great
Actions with Sir Francis Dorrington now in France, as I take it, with her
Majesty, and Col. Web an old German Soldier dear to Prince Rup^rt, and the
best Horse man, a Horse-Commander of his time in England: Totos Infusa per artus
Major in Exiguo regnabat Corpore virtus.
Eminent for flanking the Enemy about Banbury, so dexterously as well as
valiantly, that with a 1000 Horse he dispersed 5000 of the Enemy, though shot
in the hand, and both the thighs. Sir Tho. Holt of Aston com. Warwick paid
4401l. 2 s. 4 d.

Sir Tho. Hole of Fleet-Damorell Devon. 280l. per annum setletd, and 400l. in
Money, Rob. Holt of Castleton Lane. Esquire 150l.


Col. M^rmaduke Holthy, the watchful Governor of Monmouth, who by his vigilance
lost it; for upon a contrived Intelligence of the Parliament Forces, retiring
in some disorder toward Gloucester, he Commands Kirle with a 100 Horse to
pursue them as it was agreed, who closed with them, and returning, got the Town
opened to them, whence he hardly escaped over the dry graft. But regaining it
(being the Key of South Wales, by Sir William Blaxtons resolute Thomas Web of
Rich. Surrey Esquire paid 345 l. Composition.
Onset with his Horse Brigade) next week with as great a Conduct as Kirle lost
it with Treachery. Col. Richard, a Kentish Gentleman of good personal valor
(under the good old Earl of Cleaveland) both at Newberry in the Newberry
fights, where he exceeded his Command; at Sherburn, where he exceeded
expectation, (upon the surrender of which place he was taken prisoner) and at
Colchester where he exceeded belief. Sir Thomas Hooper, a Wiltshire Gentleman,
at first a Shoemaker in England, at last a Soldier in the Low Countries;
where he attained so much skill, as upon his Invitation over by Coll. Goring to
have the Command of a Regiment of Dragoons: with which Regiment he performed so
much service that he was Knighted; and which honor he wore so well, that to
say no more, he deserved it; often with execution laying that sword over his
Enemies shoulders, which his Majesty laid over his. I find Sir Tho. Manwaring,
Tho. Manwaring, Peter Manwaring, and Elisha Manwaring, all Cheshire Gentlemen,
2000 l. deep in Goldsmiths hall.
Sir Will. Manwaring, and Sir Henry Fletcher, slain both at Westchester; Coll.
Francis and Col. Io. Stuart, in quibus erat insignis piet as in deum, mira
charit as in proximos, singulares observantia in major^s, mitis affabilitas in
inferiores, dulcis humanitas in omnes, multiplex doctrina, redundans facundia,
incredibilis Religionis Orthodoxae zelus: men in whom Valor was not all their
Arts, born to adorn as well as defend their Country.

Sir John Girlington, and Mr. William Girlington, slain near Melton-Mowbray,
Leicest. and his Widow, as I take it, of Southam Cave York. fined 1400 l. a
person that had much learning in his Books, more in his Breast; where Nations
were ranked as orderly as the men in his Regiment, and as quietly as the
species of his various prospects (for he was well seen in Optics) in his eye.
One too too good for War, and deserved to be as far from danger, as free from
fear.

Sir Richard Cholmley slain at Lime in Dorsetshire, Sir Anthony Maunsel slain
at Newberry. Sir Tho. Gardener and his brother slain about Oxford. The first
with Sir Hugh Cholmley of Whitby, York. who suffered 5000 l. deep; Henry
Cholmley and Richard his son, who paid 347 l. Tho. Cholmley, of Vale Royal,
Cheshire, who compounded for 450 l. and the Lord Cholmley who paid 7742 l. who
might be called as his Ancestor was for 50 years together, The Father of his
Country; who no sooner moved in their respective Countries in his Majesty's
behalf, but it was incredible with what cheerfulness, their motion meeting with
loyal and well affected inclinations, was entertained with; all meetings
applauding their propositions about this Loyal, as the Council of Clermont in
France did Pope Vrbane II. Speech about the Holy War, with a God wills it,
looking upon all the pretensions of God and Spirit on the other side, but like
the Christians in the foresaid War, carrying a Goose with them in their Voyage
to Jerusalem, pretending it to be the Holy Ghost: their thoughts beginning
where others ended, and having a privy project beyond the public design. The
second with Mr. Henry Maunsel, of Llandewy, Glamorgan, Esquire and five more
Gentlemen of that worshipful name, was ready to mortgage their own Estates to
secure the Kings (selling Land for Gold to purchase propriety with Steel and
Iron) and were 30000 l. the worse for the War. The third extracted of that
Nation, I mean the French, which wants a proper word to express stand, were
over-active when engaged, though (like a heavy Bell that is long a raising, but
being got up made a loud sound) considering enough before they engaged.
Gentlemen, that deserve a fame in as many Languages as they understood; and an
honor from as many Persons and Nations, as they imitated in their Manners,
Wisdom, Learning, and Piety, who lived up to the excellency of each part of the
World they traveled, as if they had been born in it. Gentlemen, that were
Masters of an Universal Speech to express their Universal Learning; and to
furnish men born not to one Nation but to all, having a vast knowledge, but
that they had vaster minds.

Coll. Rice, and Coll. William Thomas were active men in those parts.
Sir Nicholas Kemish of Kevenmably in Caermarthen, slain at Chepstow in
Monmouthshire, whose Ancestors blood was as noble in his vein as in their own;
who had the Sail of Valor poised with the Ballast of Judgment. With a fanned
Army, as he called it, he cunningly surprised Chepstow by a slight, with the
hazard of his life, keeping it against all force, (refusing any Treaty) with
the loss of it; the resolute and noble being killed in cold blood, O. C.
saying, that if he had had a fortnights time longer, he had overthrown all the
price of their blood and treasure.

Col. Hugh, and Coll. William Wynn, and Sir Lodowick Wire a Dutch man slain at
Banbury, where their bad Breakfast discouraged not their Friends from their
dinner in the Wars: a good Conscience goes on through difficulties (which the
bad one needs no Enemy but it self, having always a storm in the Heart, what
ever weather it is in the Face) being not like those who see not their own
good, for too intent looking on it. But of these Gentlemen before. The Marquess
De Vienvill, a French Lord, slain at the first Newberry fight: as Baron Done
(kinsman to the Prince of Orange) fallen at Nottingham) the Nobility of all
Nations assisting in so just and so general a cause.)

10. Sir Francis and Sir Richard Dacres, the one dying at Marston-Moor, and the
other at York, together with Sir Thomas Dacres, whose Ancient and Martial
Spirits were not quenched in that age of Peace that gave little countenance and
less encouragement to men of Service and Action; and those parts, though the
Frontiers, (which in Kingdoms are to be looked after as carefully as doors in
Houses) were so ill furnished, that they had nothing left them in the beginning
of the Wars, but the Primitive Arms of Prayers and Tears; and had been easily
conquered, had not the experienced Soldiers (breathed Deer, are not caught so
soon) made their Country as strong by Art, as it was by Nature, till Art and
Valor was rather stifled, than overcome by multitude. When these Gentlemen in
vain encouraging their Countrymen much with their words, more with their
actions, fell rather, than as their Companions they would guard their brave
heads with their nimble heels.

The Right Honorable Henry Lord Piercy, son of the Right Honorable Henry, and
brother of the Mirror of English Nobility, (for a well-governed Greatness, his
house being a College for Discipline, and a Court for Grandieur) the most
noble and potent Algernoon Piercy Earl of Northumberland, Baron Piercy, Lacy,
Poynings, Fitz-pain, and Brian, Knight of the Garter, and of the Bath, whose
Ancestor H. Baron Piercy of Alnewick, was at the Coronation of Richard 2. 1377.
created Earl of Northumberland; a person of a stern spirit, and a great
capacity; the first inclining him to Arms, which he handled with honor abroad;
the other to Studies, which he followed with success at home: being at once a
very stout, and a very wise man, useful in the Field, and in Council; having a
great command of the Northern Army, 1639, 1640. and a good stroke in the
English Parliament, being able with his care of, (especially in point of pay)
and interest in the first, to awe the second as he did 1641. to give the Army
good words, and make his Majesty great promises as long as that Army had a
being in England, and he a Command in it. When he could no longer serve his
Majesty in Parliament (where he must expose his person to the rudeness, and his
opinion to the suggestions of the multitude) he countenanced his affairs in the
North (where the name could at any time raise an Army, and interest to support
it) where he grew as formidable, as he had been rendered in the South
contemptible. My Lord with great hazard attended his Majesty in all dangers,
being thrice dangerously wounded; and with great resolutions in all Council; at
York, for preparing for War; at Subscribing all Declarations there.
Oxford for accommodations of Peace, being made June 28. 1643. a Peer of the
Realm, Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's Household, and the only person
entrusted with the conduct of her Majesty from the North to her dear Consort at
Oxford, and of four deputed to assist her in Councils in France. As the Beaver
bites off his stones, for which he is hunted to save himself; so he quitted his
Estate to save his Person, being excepted from Indemnity, though he hazzarded
his Majesty's displeasure to procure them (in order to a peace) theirs. He died
suffering with Majesty beyond Sea, having this character, That he would not
take an affront from the greatest person, nor give any to the meanest. With

slain at Rowton-Heath near Chester. Sir Tho. Strickland of Thornton Biggs,
York. who paid 943 l. Sir Robert Stapleton, an Ingenious person, that
translated Iuvenals Satyr, Plinies Panegyric, and other excellent Authors, not
only into his own Language, but into his own person: being a just wit, and not
only a strong Oxford Metaphor; a forced and affected simile; a short sentence,
an unclean ribaldry, a juggling Anagram, Acrostick, or Rhyme (jests says one,
for Dutch men and English boys) not a fluent tale, or a flashy jest, but a
brisk thought, and an equal apprehension of each thing he saw or heard. Col.
Samuel Tuke, as well known by his adventures of 18 years in the German Wars, of
5 years in the English Engagement, of 12 weeks in the Where he mediated for the
terms they had there.

first that broke into the Traitor Mannings Closet, and caught in the very act
of correspondence with the Rebels) of some years tuition of young Noblemen

him.) The Lord Ethyn, Sir Tho. Danby, Sir Charles, Sir Robert, and Sir Tho.
Dallison, Sir William Dalton, the 6 last of whom lost 36000 l. by the War: Sir
Rich. Goodhill, wounded in Wales, and died at Worcester. Sir George Baker who
kept Newcastle against the Scots, (as they writ themselves to the Parliament)
with a Noble opposition, yielding them not an inch of ground but what they
gained with infinite loss, and speaking as bigg (to use the Scotch men's words)
at last as at first; and letting them blood to cure them of their Pleurisy of
Pride on the wrong side; keeping the Besiegers so long, until their Victuals
grew short, and they admired rather than assaulted him; yea when they offered
the place, the Enemy refused it, suspecting some deceit in the tender: as bad
men measure other men's minds by the crooked rule of their own, between death,
and death the Foe without, and hardships within, being no way dismayed with
some men's stealing away (the loss of Cowards being gain to an Army) they
generally resolved rather to lose their lives by wholesale on the point of the
sword, than to retail them out by Famine, which is the worst of Tyrants, and
murdereth men in State while they die in not dying, and armed with despair
(valor swells being crushed between two extremes) dispute each inch of the
Town (which was ransacked by the angry men, whose passion, like heavy bodies
down steep hills, once in motion move themselves, and know no ground but the
bottom,) and keeping the Castle till the Scots, after long fasting, not
measuring their stomachs by the Standard of Physic; and dieting themselves
till nature by degrees could digest their meat; by surfeiting, dug many of
their Graves with their teeth.

Tho. Lord Fanshaw, of Ware Park, Hertf. Clerk of the Crown to his Majesty, who
besides that, he lent 2000 l. toward the Scots expedition; and suffered 30000
l. by the English War, paid for his Loyalty 1310 l. as Sir Simon Fanshaw did
600 l. and Tho. Fanshaw of fenkins com. Essex Esquire with 80 l. per annum, settled
500 l. but especially the Honorable Sir Richard Fanshaw, my Lords Brother, bred
in Cambridge, whereof he died Burgess; and at Court, where he died a Minister.
A Gentleman of great and choice Learning, and of a great Wit, appearing in
Lusiad and o^ there Poems as well Originals as Translations the Argument^ of his
ability as well as modesty, since no Genius less than his that writ should
attempt Translation, though few, but those that cannot write translate, J.D. in
Fr. II Pastor Fido.
Translations, to set off that knowledge, yet using both as they conduced to
the higher Ends of great business and honorable Employments; the one as the
weight, the other as the Edge of his actions, in whom the Statesman saw the
burial of the Poet and Orator, as Charles the 5 th. assisted at his Funeral.
His travels were so many Victories over the times, and the Vices of those
places he lived in; no insight into the Arts and Intrigues of ill, being able
to biass his soul from its noblest design of virtue, whereof he learned from
bad Customs, the excellent practice, and of truth, which he taught all the
Languages he was Master of (as an exquisite Latinist as Englishman; a facete
Italian, an exact Spaniard, a fluent French man, and a skilful Portugez:) to
speak a strange Current; this that passing through several soils, yet received
no taints from the several passages; nor ever traveled from his own nature.

Having had the honor to serve his Majesty in his younger years with such
fidelity, and dutiful affection to his Person, which found his gracious
acceptance, together with some encouragement from his own mouth to hope a new,
and a more fixed relation to him in the future; and having in times unhappy
indeed to the State, but glorious to many good men (to whose abilities and
integrity calms had been no trials) run all the hazzards of his suffering
Master, and his afflicted Cause in the quality of his Secretary in Holland,
France, Scotland, and what was more at Worcester, where he was wounded and
taken Prisoner (such services without worldly hope to allure) could have only
pure Conscience for their principle; and it was the bare Right of his Master,
joined with a love to the owner, and a belief of Providence made him digest all
the misfortunes of an unhappy allegiance; having I say, thus deserved of his
Majesty in his afflictions, he knowing his abilities, were as great as his
merits, advanced him at his Restoration, to be one of the Masters of Request;
The great Ambassador of honor to Woo his Queen for Marriage in the Court of
Portugal 1661. 1662. 1663. where he behaved himself with a great Address, and
of business to work his Allies to a firmer Peace, by Treaty of Commerce in the
Court of Spain 1664. 1665. where he managed things with great Integrity, being
so far above private advantages, that he nobly threw away that Wealth which
others grasp at, to preserve Kingdoms; tying himself with the same truth to the
business of his Prince, that he had done to his Fortune at Madrid: He died July
1666. leaving behind him the Character,

1. Of as able a man as one grown studiously gray in Travel. Universities, and
Courts, which infused into him whatsoever of excellent such eminent Schools by
long observation, could teach so apt a Scholar.

2. Of a plain-heartedness, dwelling in a breast and temper large and open,
made indeed to hide his Masters secrets, but not dissemble his own inclinations.

3. Of a great industry and patience, whereof the whole course of his life is
an Argument; particularly his two Journeys from Madrid to Lisbon, and back
again (to accommodate some jealousies) over so long a Tract of ground in so
short a time.

4. Of great exactness in all his Addresses, Observations, and Correspondencies.

5. Of a sweet nature, a familiar and obliging humility, and a knowing and
serious Religion.

William Boswell, I know not whether a more exact Scholar, Fellow of Jesus
College Camb. and Proctor of the University 1624. or an accomplished
Statesman, Secretary to Sir Dudley Carleton Leiger Ambassador in Holland, and
afterward Leiger Ambassador there himself. The World is beholding to him for
giving famous Mr. I. Mede Money at Sturbridge Fair to buy some Books which he
saw him look melancholy upon, and of which upon discourse with him, he said,
if he could not have bought them, he was resolved to withdraw to a Country
retirement then offered, where he had been buried alive, and the rich Notions
and Observations in the Critical Learning and Chronology of the Scripture
(wherein he was the happiest man living) buried with him. He managed a
Negotiation between Scholars, as appears by his Letters to Mr. Mede and others
to improve Learning, as well as bebetween States to improve Trade: he
understood Trade well, and Books better; by this being able to better men's
nature, and the other only their Interest, having as strict an eye upon
Frankford Mart, as Amsterdams; Religion had as much of his care, as either
Learning or Traffic, as appears in the Discoveries he made by Andreas ab
Habernfield of the plots against it, and the pains he took in the business of
the Marriage of the Prince of Orange, and the Princess Mary, with other
Treaties, for the promotion of it. To his Negotiation we owe all the Arms,
Ammunition, and Officers we had from Holland, and all the Civilities we found
there, where I am told he died 1646/7. in the 54 th. year of his age.

Which Character becomes well Dr. Isaac Bargrave, Dean Bois his Brother-in-law,
and himself Dean of Canterbury, a Gentleman of an unwearied study, great
travels, intimate acquaintance with Padre Paulo of Venice, who told him that

Parliament 1623. upon that Text, I will wash (...) and compass thine Altar)

Patron of both; his House being ransacked, his Family frighted and abused, the
will of Dr. Boys, and some Gold they found in his Wives (now 80^ years of age)
Chamber, threatened to be embezzeled; his Wife led up and down the House in her
Morning Gown at midnight^ his son carried Prisoner to Dover Castle, and as
Witches draw the Picture of the man, they would enchant, so they drew a
scandalous Character of this Gentleman, which indeed was so unlike his modesty
and civility, that he need not fear the charms; and at last the Dean himself
seized at Gravesend, and sent Prisoner to the Fleet with sorrow, for which
usages (from one the Commander in this business, whom he had saved from the
Ga^lows at Maidstone some years before) he died heart broken, and it is well if
his Enemies did so with repentance. To him I may add,

2. Dr. Cox, a grave Divine sent by Sir (...), with Overtures of Peace after
his Victory at Sir^^^on, to the defeated at Exeter, almost killed there by a

plundered nothing; till as they boasted upon their return, they had made the
Gentleman a Beggar, and left him not worth a Groat.

28. Dr. Featly, of whom before had his Barns burned, Chancel defaced, and his
Rails torn at Act^on Nov. 1642. some of his Congregation killed, and all
frighted out of the Church at Lambeth Feb. 19. 1642. threatening to cut the
Doctor for keeping to his Porridge (for so they called the Common Prayer) as

Jordan Bovile, that often deceived the Enemy, as the Gibeonites did the
Israelites with passes of false-dated Antiquity, who could have thought that
Clouted shoes could have covered so much sub^ilty, who often in his own single
person took Lievery and Seisin of a breach which his followers were to possess
as frugal as noble, as thrift is the fuel of magnificence.

Sir Giles and Sir James Strangways Dorsetshire, Gentlemen of an ancient
Family, great Estates, and a good Repute, deserving very much of their Country
in the Parliaments at Westminster and Oxford; of their King in the Field, and
of the public good (to which their frequent motions in the House, and quick
actions in the Field always tended) in both; furnished with that Oratory that
used to settle Kingdoms (who made speaking an Art, which was a talk) built in
their youth men (for which a Schoolmasters name was a name of great Veneration
in that Family, Father its self being but second to it.

For Deeds of age are in their Causes then, A. C.

And we are taught but Boys, we are so made men.
Gentlemen of a general Learning, but particularly seen in the Affairs of their
own Country, for which they deserved honors, but despised them; stout men that
flattered none, but boast themselves more true, just, and faithful than any
thing but their own memories: Memories that forgot nothing but their Injuries
which they were so forward to cancel in an act of Oblivion, though they were
generally excepted out of their Enemies. The eldest of the two, one of the
Feoffees in trust appointed by Mr. Nich. Wadham, 1612. (who as Absalom, being
childless, erected that uniform and regular College in Oxford, called by his
name to perpetuate his memory) to oversee the finishing of his noble
Foundation, which he did faithfully, being himself a good benefactor to it, as
he was to all ingenious designs and persons, especially in these late times
wherein he was as liberal as the Arts he was master of: died 54 years after,
full of years and honor, about Christmas 1666. their Loyalty having cost that
Family at least 35000 l. To whom I may add I find this Note in the black List
of Compounders. H. Walcot of Poynton, County Salop Esquire with 80l. per annum
settled 500 l.
Sir Will. Walcot, taken with him at Sherburn Castle, Aug. 15. 1645. when the
Earl of Bristols brother in Law, Sir Lewis Dives, (a Gentleman so famous for
his services in Bedfordshire, and the Associated Counties, in the English War,
and (after a cleanly escape through an House of Office at Whiteball) in the
Irish, and for his great sufferings all along with his Majesty beyond Sea, to
the loss of 164000 l.) after a brave resistance, delivered it up to the Enemy,
not before his Majesty had delivered up almost the whole Kingdom.

2 Sir John and Sir Thomas Hele, Gentlemen of great Estates and Repute, whose
withdrawing from the Parliament with Walter Hele of Whimston Devon. brought his
Majesty's Cause great credit for the justness of it, rich contributions for the
supply of it, and abundance of men (who trusted much to the prudence and
conduct of the foresaid Gentlemen) to maintain it.

3. Sir Jo. Harper of awk Derb. 578 l.
Sir Io. Harper of Swakeston Com. Derb. who besides 110 l. settled from him,
paid 4000 l. composition, for being one of the first that resisted the
Rebellion in those parts; and one of the last that stood out against it; for
which they would have buried his Grave (as the Israelites did Moses) as well as
himself, the people were so fond of him.

4. Anthony Hungerford of Black Barton, Oxon. Esquire and Col. Io. Hungerford, who
paid for their Loyalty 3989l.

5. Sir Willoughby Hickman of Gainsborough, and Sir Charles Hussy of
Holten-Holy, Linc. who paid 2474l. between them.

Col. Robert Hatton was an active and a discreet man in the Kings Army.
Sir Edward and Sir John Hales, contributing freely to the first War, and

fields for some days, while they did declare so. The Authors of the two famous

against the Catholic, and the Scots: All which services cost them 64000 l.

2. Sir George Bunkley (of whom before) famous for his relief of Basing.

3. Sir Henry Carew, another hopeful son of the Earl of Monmouth, who had the
Command of Kingsworth, and which was more, of himself; being an excellent
Scholar, and a sober man (not to be expressed but in his own Poetry, and his
own picturing.)

4. Sir Thomas Tilsley, Bred in the German Wars.
a Brigadeer, Governor, I think, of Lichfield under King Charles I. 1645. and
Major General of the English, under King Charles II. 1651. by whom appointed to
assist the Earl of Derby in raising the Lancashire and Cheshire Forces, he
approved himself a faithful and an able man, till he was slain at Wigan, Aug.
25. 1651. with Sir F. Gamul, many years his fellow Soldier, and now his fellow
Sufferer; men of good hands and hearts, of exact lives as well as great parts,
each way proportionable; in nothing redundant or defective, abhorring as they
called them, ill-favored and unclean sins. The Grave has every where a good
stomach; but where these were buried a Boulimia, or greedy worm, devouring
their Honorable bodies, as Aceldama did tread Corpses in 48 hours: their
bodies being taken away as greedily as the Treasure in Josephus was out of
David's Grave, though by the way, it was strange there should be treasure in
David's Tomb, who said, Ps. 49. 17. Man shall carry nothing away with him.

Col. Thomas and Col. H. Warren, the most valiant men that lived, because the
most prepared to die; Twins of Valor and Piety, loving in their lives, and in
their deaths not divided: The Sun warms not near himself, but at distance where
he meets opposition; the warm spirits of these Gentlemen discovered not it self
in the peace they had at home; but in the dangers they met abroad. The praying
Soldiers! that wrestled with God before they strive with the Enemy; and
besieged Heaven to take it by violence, before they assaulted a Town; Members
of the thundering Legion! Men in whom afflictions looked lovely; they enjoying
themselves in the great difficulties they struggled with, as the Bird flutters
about its Cage a while, and finding no passage out, sits and sings.

Worcest. 703 l. Col. Jo. Washburn, Wickenford Worcest. 797 l. one that paid the
Rebels more than once in other metal, Sir Marmaduke Wivel (whose Ancestor is
the last mentioned in Lastle Abbey roll, 1660. continuing in so good state,
that one of them in Hen. VI. time deposed that he could spend 20 l. a year old
rent, all charges defrayed) of Constable Barron, York. 1343. Sir Tho. Whitmore
of Appley, Salop. 5000 l.

Sir Patricius Curwen, Knight and Baronet, of Worlington in the County of
Cumber. a pious and a peaceful man, forced, as his Majesty was to the War,
where he had the Command of a Colonel of Foot in that County; as he had the
trust of being Knight of the Shire in all Parliaments, when he first appeared,
from 1623. to 1664, when he died: a Gentleman in whom Art and Nature conspired
to make him Master of a great Wit, and a vigorous discourse, out-doing most in
action, and himself in suffering; being as able to persuade himself to
patience, as he was to move his neighbors to allegiance; dressing his
misfortunes so gracefully, that they were envied, and he like to be sequestered
of them too; and as he was in prosperity, that due reward of his merit, an
example of the least part of mankind, that is the happy; so in his adversity
was he a pattern to the greatest that is the unhappy; his clear and heroic
mind finding an exercise, and thereby a glory in the darkest state, as Stars
and Diamonds do a luster (oppressed, not helped by day) in the darkest night;
Fortune at last yielding to his virtue, and flattering him as his Slave, whom
it could not overcome as his Foe; he had once the Posse Comitatus, 12. Car. I.
as a Sheriff, and always as a Patriot, for which honorable title he paid to
the Parliament 2000 l. and spent with the King 23000 l.

1 Sir Francis Carew of Beddington, Surrey, that as nature had epitomized most
perfections belonging to a man in him; so would he extract all sense into short
sentences, called Sencca's little-much, who paid for one smart word 1000 l.

Sir Jo. Covert of Sla^ham, Sussex, 3000 l. Hen. Clerk of Covenr. 300 l. Adam
Cley-pool of West-Pooling, Linc. 600 l. George Cotton, Cumbermoor, Chesh. 666

H. Clerk, Essex, and Gervase Cutler, York. 1100 l.

2 Col. Tho. Carry of Norwich, Esquire whose years were measured, not by his
Almanac, but his suffering, called the Round Heads Circle, having given away
3000 l. to the King, had but 200 l. left for the Parliament.

3. Sir Alexander Culpepper that could have charmed any thing to a better
usage, but a Jew and a Puritan (both which People carry their spirit in a round
Circle) paid them first 500 l. Composition, and afterward (Witches, if they
have any of your money, will have all) 500 l. more.

4. John Courtney of Molland, Devon. Esquire for saying, that men now a days draw
up platforms of Religion, as men do Cycles, Epicycles, and other Phenomenon in
the Heavens, according to their fancies to salve their hypotheses, paid 750 l.
in Gold, and was gladly rid of it, in a time when Churches, Crosses, and all
other things suffered for being Gilt.

5. Col. Sidney Godolphin, descended of the most ancient Family both of Love
and Wit; murdered by those men that professed to destroy Wit and Learning; and
at that time when men were not allowed to wear Hair, much less Bays. A
Gentleman that will live as long as Virgil, whom he has L. 4. Aen.
translated; and as long as the best Times best Wit, As Done, etc.
whom he has commended as elegantly as he was commended by them. Besides whom
there were Col. Sir William, and Col. William Godolphin of Trevervenith and
Spragger, Cornwall, who spent their blood and Estates for his Majesty, being
sorry that they had 1500 l. left to be taken by his Enemies. Treasures of Arms
and Arts; men equally fit for College and Camp; in whom the Scholars ^ earning
did guide and direct, and the Soldiers Valor fight and act; the first without
fear, the second without rashness: their several accomplishments meeting like
so many conspiring perfumes to one delicate temper.

6. Col. William Walton C^l. Cassey Bental, slain at Stow in the Would, Glo^.
Col. St. George, killed at the entry of Leicester; which Town is his T^mb, and
the stones as red with his blood as those of Jerusalem are with St. Stephens.
Col. Fenwick, Sir John Fenwicks son, an excellent Horseman, slain at
Marston-Moor, Col. Dalby Engineer General, killed at Winkfield Manor, Derb.
one that could do any thing ex tempore, but durst not pray so; having Wit, and
nothing else at will: and knew no reason why he should not be rich, but because
he was born a Poet. He was slain in that Battle which he would not have
outlived, I mean Nazeby, wherein three Kingdoms lay bleeding by him, as well
as Col. Cuthbert Ratcliff, and Col. Ralph Pudsey, who would gladly have lived
to do more service for his Majesty, but refused not to serve him in dying;
scorning as well the censures as the commendations of that ignorant age.

7. Col. Posthumus Kerton, a Somersetshire Gentleman, of a spreading name,
slain at Marston-Moor in the midst of the White Coats my Lord of New-castles
Lambs, (called so, because clothed by him in white Cloth, which he had not
time to color (until they being cut off, every man gave it a noble tincture
with their own blood) which he commanded; a cro^d of dead men, makes a noble
Crown about a Commander, than one of Laurel; being so pleased (Saints above
know sure what we do delow in our fight with life) to see the same brave heat
in his followers, that was in him; that Death smiled on his lip^, and he looked
as if he were above, wa^bling the hymns he used below, pitying our dull and
earthly joys, where grief and misery dwells with pleasure; a man of great
daring and good success, a knowing and honest man seasonably taken away from
the place of Ignorance and Hypocrisy to Heaven, the only place then free from
both, to live there among the blessed, whose souls are clothed with white, and
follow the Lamb.

Sir Jo. King of Woodsam, York. B^r. 500l. R. Kibe, Sussex Chich 992l. Will.
Knowls of Grayes, Oxon. Esquire a brave Gentleman of parts, and a (...) worthy his
Ancestors, who died, 1664. 1100l. Jo. Kirk, Westminster. Esquire 985l. G. Kinsley, Cant.

572l. Sir William Kinsmel of Sidmonton South. 740l. Robert Kemp, Cheston Her.
480l. Sir Gorrel Kemp of Slindon Suff. 2931l.

8. The Lords Kilmurry, the Elder and the Younger, the first having spent 20000
l. in the service of the King, to whom he owed his honor, gave 5306 l. in Land
and Money to keep it, the only Estate then left good men: the second having
hazzarded his life with his Estate, spending then 15000 l. with Sir George
Booth, etc. to restore his Majesty 1659. for which he was imprisoned, like
Isaac, offered and not sacrificed; lost it afterward of the Small Pox, I
think, that infections and unclean disease seizing on that breath, where life,
spirit, and pleasure always dwell; snatching as rude hands do Roses before half
seen or understood, now ripe in the blossom. To whom I may add, Sir Kennes of
Kevenmably Glam. 3500 l. and Edward Kennes of Kennes Manor 1000 l. H. Earl of
Kingston 7499 l. Io. Kellon of Totnes Devon. Esquire 663 l. who reckoned it cheaper
to pay than to swear, and valued their souls above their Estates: a Character
of whose Loyalty is engraven on every part of their Estates, as the Arms of the
Shugboroughs are on every stone of their Land; the impression of the Usurpers
violence being like the Print of Judas hands and feet where he fell, Indelible.
Men that abhorred a barren Religion as much as Christ did the fruitless Fig
tree; when he wrought once, as he often spoke a Parable (that whole Tree being
but the Bark, and barren Professors the Timber) and could not endure those men's
Creeds, who made their own Articles with God and Kings; and were so troubled
with a Vertigo, that they thought Sun and Stars were subject to the Falling
Sickness: and invented new bonds for supposed weak Kings, as the Virgin Mary is
said to drop her Girdle to swath the Faith of weak Thomas. The first of which
foresaid noble persons built a Spitle, where God had provided a Bethesda, with
his charity seconding Gods mercy; God giving the cure, and he building the
Harbor for impotent persons.

Richard Lord Viscout Molineux, and Col. Roger Molineux of Lincolnshire, and
Sir Ferdinando Fisher of Northumberland, persons of generous, active, sweet,
and obliging natures; able, stout, and condescending; living with that zeal,
devotion, piety, that others die with; weeping out at night the debts their
souls contracted in the day; setting peaceably and innocently, as the unspotted
Sun does in water. Gentlemen that had more Virtues united in them, than we can
pick up scattered here and there, in Books and other men; doing more than
others teach: in whom Religion guided their other qualities, as the higher
sphere does the rest: The last drowned unhappily in his passage to the Isle of
Man, to assist that Place: of whom see Peter de Cardonnel, a French Gentleman,
Parentatio Generosis manibus Ferdin. Fisher, juxta monam Insulam, Anno M D C X
L VI. nausragio absorpti. The Lord Moulineux paid 1140 l. in Land and Money. To
whom I may add,

Exequiae viri Generosissimus, Jo. Chichesterii, Gubernatoris de Derry, Militum

Anthony, James, and Thomas Morgan, the last of whom, I think was the brave
person that was killed in the Cheshire business, 1659. scorning that so brave a
design should be lost without blood shed: there were Col. Sir Francis, and Col.
Will. Middleron, slain at Hopton Heath Staff. Col. Edward and Mr. George
Middlemore of Kings Norton 564 l. Sir Edward Musgrave, Layon Camb. 960 l. Sir
Philip Musgrave, who took Appleby 1644. for his Majests, and so eminent in that
years brave attempt. Col. William Musgrave 640 l. Jo. Martin, Yorecomb Devon.

as one did of Heraclytes his Books (...) What I know of them is excellent, so
I believe is what I know not.

10. Col. George Heron of Chipcase Northumberland, slain at Marston-Moor, where
fell Sir William Wentworth Father and Son, Col. Hern, son of Sir Edward Hern
slain with Col. Beton a Northamptonshire Gentleman, at Gainsborough Linc. Col.
Bernard, with diverse other Gentlemen put to the Sword at Cannon-Froom Heref.
July 1645, Col. Francis Hungate of Saxton Yorkshire, slain at Chester, Col.
William Barn, slain at Malpass Cheshire, Coll. Francis Billingsley, slain at
Bridge-north Shropshire, Col Thomas and Roger Whithey^ one of whom was slain at
Conway Castle Caern. Col. Tho. Wheatly, Col. Pinchback and Col. Fitz Morris
slain at Newberry, Col. Richard Green slain at I^^ston Castle Cheshire.

Men that could look upon the saddest things with the most cheerful tempers,
and a Mirth that was the spirits and flowerings of various wit, neither
blaspheming God, nor abusing man; taking its just turn with more retired and
deep discourse, fetched not from Books, but the rich notions of their own
minds, Natures better Table Book. Men whose Wits were the greatest things of
their Times, except their Judgment, which governed the ebbs and flows of their
Fancies, as the Moon does those of Waters. How did their Notions throng and
crowd about their tongue and discourse, their Wit flowing faster than others.
Ink-men of gallant, but not extravagant spirits; overcoming the follies of
their own side, as well as the cheats of the other; their vigorous souls like
Stars sparkling but not burning, and warm with generous not sordid heats; minds
large and high as the Heaven, the seat of their souls; humble as the Grave, the
seat of their bodies. The sacred names of Friendship and of Love, torn from the
World with as much reluctance as their Souls from their Bodies: about whose
Graves, methinks, I could stand still, as Ghosts do about the seat of their hid
treasure.

Catalogue of Worthies, that instilled into their respective Neighbors the good
principles of Allegiance, and were able to go to the charge of then; most of
them most active (as natural motions are most swift) toward the end of the
War: when (the air being corrected by cold and nipping misfortune) there was no
danger of taking the Kings side, as some did in warmer times only by
Infections; professing themselves better able to manage great miscarriages,
than a great success: most of them provided for the War suitable supplies,
while others performed in it great actions. Admiral Colligni was wont to say,
He that would paint the Beast War, must first begin to shape the Belly: meaning
that the chiefest care in War should be the supply of the Army. Many of whose
Ladies deserve to be mentioned among these men, for having done in the War more
then Women. One especially, who trained a Pigeon to carry Letters, which were
sent as they were written, with the wing of a Fowl; all of them at last
conquering that party by yielding, which they could not by fighting; lurking in
corners (as Truth does often fearing her Judges, though never suspecting her
Cause) till the Conquerors having so much choice, had in effect none at all,
being able among so many Governments to pitch upon none, fell of the Colic, I
mean the Divisions in the r own bowels partly, as well as Cowardice, the
disease of their hearts; and these Gentlemen who followed the Crown with the
Cross at first, and afterward endured the Cross without the Crown, at last
enjoyed the Crown without the Cross. They who never refuse what God carveth
them, do never cut ill for themselves, being contented to see much misery, upon
condition their eyes should not be put out; and they in compliance with their
fortunes should not be compelled to do any thing unworthy of their Birth,
patiently bearing their Masters loss of his Crown of Gold, in consideration
that their Savior wore one of Thorns, being comforted with this general
Opinion, that his Majesty's worse Vice, was his Virtue.

Michael Wharton of Benly York 9999l. in land and money.

12. Sir Thomas and Sir William Bridges, both Colonels, able to serve his
Majesty in the War, and one or both Prentices, but of very good Families, ready
to serve their Country in time of Peace by their good service under Sir Tho.
Bridges Campton Some. 869 l. with 20 l. per annum settled.
Command, deserving one. Sir Thomas as discreetly deserting both (in time while
he might have good conditions) when untenable, as he stoutly maintained
Leicester while tenable. Sir Henry Billingham, well known for his eminent
services, not only in Kent, but in Christendom, and Thomas Billingham Esquire who
seeing the differences among us grown so great, that they could not be united
by either Law or Reason; endeavored to cut them asunder with their Swords much
against their wills, not that they were worse Soldiers than others, but that
they were better Christians; their demurre being not in their Courage but
Conscience. Sir Thomas Bower of Lethoru Sussex, a Gentleman whose soul was
enriched with many virtues, whereof the most Orient was his Humility, which
took all men's affections without resistance, but those men who had guts and no
bowels, to whom he paid 2033 l. and he said he had a cheap pennyworth of the
Peace of his Conscience. Sir Thomas Bosvile, Eynsford Kent 205 l. of whom, and
of Sir G. Lisle bred them up and his Brother Major Lisle, who was killed at
Marstonmoor, Sir Tho. Bridges Somer, 1000l. in money, and 20 l. per annnum
land, Redman Buller Fulbeck Esquire 770l. Sir Tho. Bludder Flanford Surrey 1537l.
There was Col. Jos. and Col. Bamfield belonging to Arundel Castle.
Col. Bamfield, who conveyed away his Highness the Duke of York from St. James,
that rule holds not true, that Ambition is the spur of a Soldier.

13. Sir William Bulton of Shaws Wiltshire, a Gentleman to whom his Ancestors
honor were a spur to Virtue, his Parents not satisfying themselves that they
had begot him honor, unless they bred him so too; and implanted in him those
Virtues to support the Family that raised it by Dr. Prideaux his tuition, whose
Pupil he was at Exeter Col. Oxon. and Sir Arthur Hoptons Company, whom he
attended in his Embassy through France, into Spain, by Geneva, untainted with
the levity of the French, the pride of the Spaniard, the superstition of Italy,
or the novelties of Geneva; but nobly accomplished for the service of his
Country, had it been capable of it. Having a large Estate and no Children, his
Hospitality was exemplary, his charity to his poor Neighbors great, to poor
Ministers and Cavaliers greater, to poor Scholars at School and the University
greatest of all: his Devotion according to the way of the Church of England,
strict both at his Parish Church and in his Family; and his duty and conscience
justly valued above his Estate, whereof besides his contributing to his
Majesty, he paid 2380 l. composition to the enemy dying April 1660. and buried
at North-Wraxall the 12 th of the same month, with this noble Character of a
most beloved Patriot, a most indulgent Husband, a loving Brother, a fast
Friend, a good Landlord, a bountiful Master, and a very just man.

14. Sir Thomas Ailesbury, one of the Masters of Request to King Charles I.
whose Ancestors were High-Sheriffs of Bedford and Buckinghamshire often in Edw.
2. and Edw. 3. time; the Countess of Clarendons Father, and the Duchess of
Yorks Grandfather, suffering much in his Estate at home, and dying I think
banished abroad.

15. Sir William Valentine Lane, and Col. Io. Osburn Prince Ruperts old
Soldiers, at whose advance such a calm of Cowardice seized on the Enemies
hearts, as that their skirmishes were rather Executions than frights; but our
sins put a stop to their success.

16. Sir Io. Monson of South-Carleton Lincoln. a good Lawyer as any in London,
and as wise a man as any in Oxford, assisting in all Counsels, and one in all
Treaties, for which he paid 2642 l. being permitted a quiet retirement, for the
same reason King John being urged to untomb the bones of an Enemy, permitted
him a quiet grave, Oh no (said he) were all my Enemies as honorably buried. To
whom I must annex Sir Steven Hawkings, never separated from him either in his
services or sufferings; a Commander of his Majesty's Army, and an eminent man
in his Counsel, as were Sir Thomas Haggerston, Sir Gilbert Houghton, Sir
William Heart, Sir Richard Hastings, and Col. Io. Hilton, Persons cut out by
nature for Superiority and Command (being like Saul taller by the head and
shoulders than their Brethren) and deserving it every where but among our
phanaticks, who raised mean men to Authority, as the Goths had a Law always to
choose a short thick man for their King: most of them bred Scholars, and when
exchanging their Caps for Helmets, not putting off their Learning with their
Habit. For though bookishness may be unactive, yet Scholarship does accomplish
a Soldier, and make him wield his Sword the steadier, as appeared in Sir Io.
Heydon, who was a great Scholar (especially in the Mathematics, whereby he
overthrew the Astrologers upon their own principles) and a good Soldier, as
were Col. Gosnall and Mr. John Dutton, both active in making the defense, and
drawing up the Articles of Oxford, the last of whom was an instance of that
great truth, that Riches may be wanted with Pride, and enjoyed with Humility,
he being one of the Richest, one of the meekest men in England, not so rich in
the great Estate he had, as in the good works he did. Notwithstanding that I

Sir Io. Curson of Oxfordshire, who were both taken at Watlington in the same
County, as they sat upon his Majesty's Commission of Array, for which, besides
long Imprisonment, they paid 12000 l. and Sir Io. Curson losing of a son in the
service, as did Sir Alexander Denton Knight of the shire for Bucks. and losing
his own life with heartbreaking grief in Prison, as his son Col. George Denton
did his with thirty wounds in the field.

17. Doctor William Harvey, the Eldest Son of Master Thomas Harvey, (who had as
good a faculty in improving his Sons money, (with which they all trusted him)
in Land, as they had to get it,) born at Folkston in Kent, bred ten years in
Cajus College in Cambridge, five years at Padua, whence he became so
accomplished with such a mixture of Foreign and Domestic Learning, as to be
Physician in Ordinary to King James and King Charles I. to establish in the
world against opposition in his Solus quod sclam qui Doctrinam novam superata

life time, that new but noble Opnion of the Circulation of the blood received
as generally at last; as it was (strangers are apt to be suspected) distrusted
at first all those Riolanus, etc. shaking hands with him that hand tilted Pens
against him, yet notwithstanding his great Worth and Obligations upon mankind,
he suffered 2000 l. deep for attending his Master King Charles I. in these Wars
at Oxford; he was turned out of the Wardenship of Merton College Oxon. and
which was of worse consequence than all the rest, having made a good progress
to lay down a Practice of Physic conformable to the Thesis of the Circulation
of the blood, he was plundered of his Papers by those men, who not contented to
murder the people of their own time, destroyed thereby those that were unborn:
He died June 3. 1657. and the 80 th. year of his age, a Bachelor, leaving
behind him three Monuments. I His four Books, De Circulatione Sanguinis, de

18. Dr. William Johnson Fellow of Queens, and Dr. Nicholas Bernard Fellow of
Cambridge, Parallels in most of their virtues and most of their sufferings. The
first at once, the most witty and pious man living; the other Master of the
greatest Mirth and seriousness in the World: Both happy in sanctified Fancies
and Parts, both bred with eminent men, the one with B. B. the other with Bishop
Usher, whose Instrument he was in making many and useful Observations and
Collections, and whose Trustee he was in reference to his Reputation and
Remains; the first of which he often vindicated, and the latter he often
published, both suffering equally, the one turned out of his Fellowship and all
his Preferments in England; and the other out of his Deanery and all his Estate
in Ireland, both men of miraculous deliverances, the one at Sea, when forced to
serve the Levant or the Indian Merchants, where he was twice shipwracked,
living for four days without any sustenance, and at last relieved only by that
money which was stolen from him and the Company, by one that was to die with
them; a strange itch to stealing, when one takes that which neither they that
lost, nor he that took it could keep for ought they knew two hours to an end.
The other saved at the taking of Drogedah, when all others were put to the
sword, because the Soldiers breaking into his Chamber, found him at Prayers:
both persons of great fidelity, entrusted with the Legacies and Charities of
more private Benefactors than any two men in England, and both called to manage
public Largesses, the one being Sub-almoner to King Charles II. and the other
Almoner to an Office though imposed upon him, possibly with design he managed
certainly with integrity. The first died Archdeacon of Huntington, 1666. and is
buried at Westminster, having great apprehensions of the sad state of things
amongst us, by the same token-that the last time I saw him, he was very
inquisitive what particular History there was (besides Mr. Fox, and the
troubles of Frank ford) of the Confessors Exile and Sufferings in Queen Mary's
dayes' and the other died Rector of Whitchurch in Shropshire, where he is
buried, fearing and suspecting the settlement of Ireland, because he chose
rather to take a Parsonage here, than to return to his Dignities thither. They
were both Inns of Court-preachers, the one Master of the Temple, where he was
as in all places he came to indefatigable in the extraordinary pains he took in
Expounding, Praying, and Preaching; the other Preacher of Gray's Inn.

19. Dr. Jeremy Tailor, born in Cambridge Town, and bred in Cajus College in
that University, his Parts being above his Birth and Fortunes (for his Father
was a Barber) supplied his Chamberfellow Mr. Risdens turn in the Paul's Lecture
three or four times with such applause above his years, that Archbishop Laud
that great Judge and Patron of able men, observing the tartness of his
discourses, the quickness of his Parts, the modesty and sweetness of his
temper, and the becomingness of his personage and carriage, preferred him
Fellow of All Souls Oxford, where he might have Time, Books, and company to
complete himself in those several parts of Learning, whereinto he had made so
fair an entrance: An admirable Specimen of his progress wherein he gave in his
full Sermon against the Papists, November 5. 1638. preached to the University
at St. Mary's Oxford, and Dedicated to the Archbishop of Canterbury; and being
a complete Artist, especially an accurate Logician (whereby he reduced all his
Learning to such a method, that he was the readiest in it of any man in his
time) notwithstanding the loss of his Church-preferments, and which was more to
him, his time, by his necessary attendance on his Majesty's Army, to which he
was Chaplain, he writ most accurate Defenses of our In one Volume, called, His
Pol^mical writings.
Episcopacy, Liturgy, Ministry, and Church, which were never answered, and some
of the other side confessed could not be answered; so exquisitely quick and
exact were his Reasonings, so fluent his Language, and so prodigiously ready
and various his Learning, as being a very strict and pious man, he writ several
taking books of Devotion, as Holy Living and Dying, his Life of Christ, his
(...), or Course of Sermons throughout the year; the Doctrine and practice of
Repentance, his Golden Grove, or a Manual of daily Prayers, the Worthy
Communicant, A Collection of Offices or Forms of Prayer, fitted to the needs of
all Christians, the Nature, Offices, and Measures of Friendship, and his Cases
of Conscience, by which doing the Church in the time of her sufferings great
services, the latter adorning and assisting the forme^, and his endeavor to
make men holy and serious, preparing to his pains, to make or keep them good
Subjects and Churchmen. His great Wit and vast Learning being to be excused
for some unwary Sentiments about Original sin, and Liberty of Conscience, the
first in his Book of Repentance, and the second in his Liberty of Prophesying,
which he writ to weaken Presbytery by pleading for Liberty to all other Sects,
as well as to undermine it, as it had undermined Episcopacy; he having
published them with submission, and explained them with moderation and
Ingenuity, erring possibly as a man, but not persisting in his error as an
obstinate man. The reason why he was suffered under the Right Honorable the
Earl of Carbery to officiate and keep School (as he did very dexterously) so
long in South Wales, to preach and keep a Congregation so long in London, and
to have a settlement in Ireland in those times, where he had done so much good,
that his Majesty preferred him Bishop of Down and Connor there 1660. In which
place, what advices and comforts did he treasure up for all sorts of people,
and direct his Clergy to! what Liberal Collections did he make! what Directions
to teach inferior Ministers, to say and do well (by reading good and approved
Books, especially Casuists; and being skiled in the Rubricks, Canons, Articles,
and Homilies of the Church) did he give! what care of constant Prayers and
Communions! what strict Injunctions on his Clergy, to visit their Parishioners,
and to deal faithfully with them, especially in their sicknesses about their
final state! what exact Rules about the observation of the Lords day, the
Church Fasts and Festivals, Catechisms, (...) which all ignorant persons of all
ages he enjoined to be (...)
Confirmation, Confession of sin, Declaration of the state of their Souls, and
conversation with their Ministers about Spiritual things! what helps and Rules
about the practice, methods, and benefits of Meditations! what caution against
popular compliances, and making the peoples humors the measure of Doctrines,
which should be the measure of their humors; indiscreet clashings between
Prayers, Sermons, and other Ordinances, unbecoming the discourses of God, or
light expression in the things of God, emulation about Audiences, of which he
would say, that he that envied his followed Brother is but a Dwarf, that
endeavors to pull down a higher man; but is a Dwarf still; advising those
who could not have the fame of a good Preacher, to take care that they had the
Rewards of good men, it being very hard to miss both: what severity against
disputing Articles of Faith, or reviving old Heresies and their Arguments, or
novel and not allowed Interpretations of Scripture! what diligence he wished
popular errors, and evil principles should be suppressed, and the four last
things should be inculcated! what discretion he required in the use of
Prmititive, known, and accustomed words in Religious Discourses; in teaching
all men the duties of their Calling, in avoiding the heights of Gods Mysteries,
and inculcating the lowliness of Christ's life, in reproving the faults of men
that Laws cannot, or do not take cognizance of, especially slandering and
backbiting, those poisons of Charity, the life of Religion; yet so common, that
it is passed into a Proverb, (After a good Dinner let uo sit down, and backbite
our Neighbors) in pressing graces that do most good, and make least noise; in
discreet reproofs of sin in particular, without reflections upon the person,
especially if absent: meddling not with the peoples duty before the Magistrate,
nor with the Magistrates duty before the people; the first looking like
indiscreet flattery, and the other tending to dangerous mutiny, in bringing
down general, indefinite things, as getting Christ, uniting to Christ; to
minute and particular discourses, in guiding the peoples Zeals by good Rules,
respecting not their persons, complying not with their curiosity, entertaining
them not out of their own Parishes, nor appealing to their judgment, nor
suffering them to talk about questions, foment divisions, pretend conscience,
keep up names of Sects, but instructing them to fill up their time with serious
employments, and conferring with them in the spirit of meekness: He died Aug.
1667.

These are the Martyrs of the Royal Cause, the best Cause and the best Men, as
accomplished examples, not only of Allegiance, but of all virtues as far as
nature can go, improved by grace; and reason raised by faith as much above its
self, as it is of its self above sense; who though dead, are not the major part
To go to the dead, is said to go to the greater Number.
(as the dead are reckoned) of his Majesty's good subjects, there being as many
living that suffered as exemplary with him, as now they act under him; his
Court, his Council, his Courts of Justice, his Church, his Inns of Courts, his
Universities and Colleges, his Schools, his Armies and Navies, his Forts and
Cities being filled (as the Emperors charges were of old, as Origin and
Tertullian, I. Martyr, and other Apologists and Champions for Christian
Religion urge) with Confessors. Indeed there is no person in the Kingdom but
what either ventured his Life or Estate for him, or owes his life to him, and
I hope none but wo^ld sacrifice all they have to support his Sovereignty, who
have been secured in all they have by his Pardon and Mercy.

And I do the rather believe it, because there was not a Worthy Person (a few
Regicides too infamous for a mention or History excepted) that engaged against
these Honorable Persons before mentioned, but at last complied with them; yea,
(which is an unanswerable Argument of a good Cause) yielded to their Reasons
when they had conquered their Persons, being overcome by the Right and Justice
of that Cause the other supports of which had overthrown, being the Converts of
afflicted Loyalty, and choosing rather to suffer in that good Cause, and with
those Heroic Persons that they had conquered, than to triumph in the Conquest.

As I Sir John Hotham and his son, who begun the War, shutting the King out of
Hull; before the War was ended, were themselves by their Masters shut out, not
only of that Town and all other Commands, Being knocked off his Horse before
that Gate, before which he denied the King Entrance into Hull, and plundered of
that Estate, to the value of 25000 l. which he had plundered from his Neighbors.
but out of Pardon too; and having spilt more blood than any two men, as one of
them confessed, to serve the Faction in the North 1642. 1643. had their own
spilt (in a barbarous manner, the Father being cruelly Reprieved to see the
Sons Execution) by it at Tower Hill 1644. being denied that Justice (as one
oppressed by him at Hull, told Sir John he should) which they had denied
others, and obstructed. Sir John finding that true, which his Father, to check
his troublesome inclination, told him, (viz.) That he should have War enough,
when the Crown of England should lie at Stake. Father and Son, Root and Branch
falling together, by that Arbitrary Power, which they had first of any man
avowed for: corresponding with the Lord Digby, who came to Hull as a Soldier
of Fortune (in a Pinnace, by design suffered to be taken) to work upon Sir
John, and draw off that Garrison. A great instance of Providence, that that
Party should hazard the dividing of their Heads from their Bodies for the King
in his distress, who divided the hearts of the people from him in his
prosperity. Nay,

2. Sir Matthew Boynton, who betrayed and took Sir Io. Hotham his own Brother
in Law (the nearness of which relation being the umbrage to the design) at Hull
1643. was slain for the King at Wiggan, Lan^. 1651. after he as willingly made
one of exiled Majesty's retinue in Holland 1647, 1648, 1649, 1650. as he was a
member of the exile Congregations 1637, 1638, 1639, 1640.

3. Sir Alexander Carew who had been on the other side so unhappy, that in the
business of the Earl of Stafford, when Sir Bevil Greenvil sitting in the same
place with him in the House, as serving for the same County Cornwall, bespoke
him to this purpose; Pray Sir, let it not be said that any Member of our County
should have a hand in this ominous business, and therefore pray give your vote
against this Bill. Sir Alexander replied to this effect. If I were sure to be
the next man that should suffer upon the same Scaffold with the same Axe, I
would give my consent to the passing of it. For endeavoring to deliver
Plymouth, whereof he was Governor, with himself to his Majesty was (as some
report upon the instigation of his Brother, Io. Carew, who suffered miserably
afterward, October. 1660.) beheaded at Tower Hill, December. 1644.

4. Sir H. Cholmley, as I take it, of Whitby York^ that kept Scarborough, for
the Parl ^took it with Brown Bushels assistance 1643^ for the King, upon whose
Royal Consort he attended with 3000 convert Horse and Foot, which cost him
10000 l. besides a long and tedious exile.

5. The Right Honorable H. Earl of Holland, a younger Brother of the Earl of
Warwicks, raised to that great Honor, Estate, and Trust (being Justice in Air
of his Majesty's Forests on this side Trent, Groom of the Stool, Constable of
Windsor Castle, Steward of the Queens Majesty's Lands and Revenues) by King
James and King Charles I. for the comeliness of his person, the sweetness and
obligingness of his behavior: upon which last score he was employed Ambassador
in the Marriage Treaty of France, 1624. He said at his death that he had
relieved, favored, and done Offices for that Party as much as any man in the
Kingd.
favored the Faction so far, that my Lord Conway writ to the Archbishop of
Canterbury from the North, 1640. that Warwick was the Temporal head of the
Puritans, and Holland the By which he meant the invisible.
Spiritual; that he was their Patron and Particularly in the Case of the five
Members.
Intelligencer at Court, their friend at the Treaty with the Scots at York, and
London; and their second in their Petition at York, where the Petition of the
Lords was no more than a Transcript of that of the Londoners. And that he chose
rather to part with his places at Court, than when the King sent to him to
leave that party in Parliament, whom yet afterward he saw reason so far to
desert, that upon his request, they refused him leave to attend the Earl of
Essex into the Field: and that denied, he took leave to go with the R. H. the
E. of Bedford to the King at Oxford, 1643. to act for him in London, 1644,
1645, 1646. and to rise in Arms for him about Kingston; where being defeated,
and taken at St. Neots, after a tedious imprisonment, notwithstanding his
sickness and infirmities, tried for his life, and beheaded in the Pallace-yard
Westmin. recommending with his last words to the deluded People, the Kings
Government, and the established Religion.

The Right Honorable Francis Lord Willoughby of Parham, who with Sir Io.
Hotham, the Earl of Stamford, Sir Hugh and Sir H. Cholmley, Sir Christopher
Wray, Sir Edward Ayscough, etc. all Converts afterward in being as active in
settling the Militia of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire in obedience to the
Parliament, as other persons of quality were in prosecuting the Commission of
Array in obedience to his Majesty, was warned by a Letter under his Majesty's
hand, dated at York, June 4. 1642. to desist from Assembling the people in
those parts upon any pretense whatsoever, upon his allegiance; and answered
with much modesty and humility, that though he could not presently desist,
without falsifying the trust reposed in him by the Parliaments particular
Directions, according to an Ordinance voted by the Lord Keeper Littleton, and
the Lord Chief Justice Banks, whose judgments swayed his younger one, as he
said, to this action, so unsuitable to his Majesty's liking, yet nothing should
pass by his Commands, but what should tend to his Majesty's honor and safety.
Agreeably to which ingenious Declaration, when he saw into the bottom of the
factious designs, he was so active for his Majesty's honor and safety in the
House of Lords, and the City of London, 1645, 1646, 1647. that with the Earls
of Philip Earl of Pembroke escaping narrowly, being then sent with Propositions
to Hampton Court.
Suffolk, Lincoln, and Middlesex; the Lords Berkley, Hunsden, and Maynard; all,
a while deluded by the Iuncto: and because they presumed to be undeceived, at
last punished by them; being impeached of high Treason, for levying War against
the King, by endeavoring to make the City and Kingdom for him: chose rather to
hazard himself, 1648, 1649, for a conquered and a captive Sovereign (assisting
and attending his Son in Holland, and the Fleet, as long as there was any
likelihood of serving him) than to have a share any longer in a conquering and
prosperous Rebellion, though it cost him several imprisonments and
molestations, besides 5000 l. composition. Prosecuting his Loyalty by providing
Arms for his Majesty's Friends 1655, 1657, 1658, 1659. at his own charge, till
the Restoration; when having a large Estate, and great experience in, As he
had been before 1649, 1650, 1651, 1652, 1653. till forced away by Sir George
Ayscough another Convert to vanquished Loyalty.
he was made Governor of the Caribee Islands, 1660. where going (during the
late War) upon a design of recovering St Christophers, newly seized by the
French, he was cast away with most of his Fleet, by an Hurricane, 1666. being
succeeded in his Government and Honor by his brother, the Right Honorable G.
Lord Willoughby of Parham, 1666.

A blessed Cause this (to use the words of that ornament of his ancient and
worshipful Family in Suffolk and Norfolk, Mr. Hammond L'Estrange, who enobled
his sufferings as well as the cause he suffered for, by his Writings,
especially his Alliance of Liturgies, a Book full of that Various Reading, not
common in men of his quality; and his History of King Charles I. a piece
compiled with that ingenuity, prudence, and moderation, as was not vulgar in
the Writers of his Time) that won its conquering Enemies, all but one, that
sacrificed his Reason and Conscience to his ambition, who yet in the midst of
his greatness had not one minutes rest from those Fears his Conscience and
common foresight, that Right and Truth, which are greater, notwithstanding all
his Arts and Methods of settling himself, should prevail.

And there being nothing left now for the Kings Cause to conquer, but those
principles of Religion, and those Ministers that supported the Faction; those
stood not out against its Evidence and Arguments: for,

1. Mr. Alexander Henderson, a Moderator of (that is in effect Archbishop in)
all the Assemblies in Scotland, one in all the Treaties of England, one of the
ablest Presbyterians in both Kingdoms, being overcome with his Majesty's
Arguments at Newcastle, where he was Ordered to converse with, and convert his
Majesty (when as all his Confinements, his Pen gained those For the Papers
being published, all gave the better to his Majesty.
Victories which were denied his Sword) went home heart-broken with Conscience
of the injuries he had done to the King, he found every way so excellent. To
whom I may join,

2. John Rutherford, a Layman, who was so far won by his Majesty, then their
Prisoner, as to hazard his life seven times for his rescue; for which after a
great reputation he gained in the King of France his service, and great
integrity and ability in serving his own Master, he was 1660. made Governor of
Dunkirk, and 1662. Governor of Tangier (and Earl of Tiveot) both which
Garrisons he fortified impregnably, being a man of a great reach in Trade,
Encamping, and Fortification, and of an unwearied Industry and Diligence:
laying the design of the Mole in the last of those places, which when finished,
will be a Piece of the greatest concernment in Christendom. He was cut off
1664/5. in a Sally out (as he was a very forward and daring man) upon the
perfidious Moors, whom he had reduced to the most honorable peace that ever
was enjoyed at Tangier, to recover a Wood that was a great shelter to the
Enemy; and would have been of vast advantage unto us.

They that begin Wars know not how to end them, without horrid scandals to
Religion, and an unparalled violence offered to all the Laws and Rights in
the World. On which consideration many returned to sober principles of
Allegiance; and indeed, all rational men acquiesce in the present
establishment, according to their respective consciences, actively or
passively; in gratitude to his Majesty and the Government for their former
Indemnity: that since his Majesty as a Father, looked on all his Subjects as
sons; yet caressed his Prodigals, those Subjects that came to themselves, and
acknowledged their error, with extraordinary kindness and tenderness,
out-doing all his promises and engagements. Let the World see that his promises
made and performed, were not the effects of necessity, but the fruits of a
gracious and Princely mind, like his Grandfather H. IV. of France, not only
pardoned the former Errors of those that were seduced against him and his
Father, but preferred and trusted them too. They may make good his late Majesty
(of blessed memory) his Royal word and engagement for them, Medit. 27. (...),
that will be more loyal and faithful to his Majesty, than those Subjects, who
being sensible of their own errors, and his injuries, will feel in their souls
vehement motives to repentance, and earnest desires to make some reparations
for their former defects.

Mr. Cauton, and Mr. Nalton was banished, and Mr. Christopher Love born in
Wales, and bred under Dr. Rogers in New-Inn^ Hall, Oxon. Minister first of St.
Ann Aldersgate, and afterward of St. Lawrence Jury, was beheaded for owning
the Kings Interest, by those with whom he opposed it, so far as to say at
Uxbridge, There was no peace to be made with the King, the difference between
him and the Parliament being as wide as that between Heaven and Hell. He
suffered 1650. when the Presbyterians were in open War for the King, against
the Sectaries that were for the Parliament.
