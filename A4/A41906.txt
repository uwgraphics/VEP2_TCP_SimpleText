A great Miracle AT SEA: OR, A perfect Relation of a mighty Whale, which was
pursued in the Sea, and encountered by multitudes of other Fishes, As it was
certified by diverse Mariners of Weymouth Sailing from France in a Shipp called
the Bonanaventure, did shoot the Whale, Which making to Land (as all Whales do
when they are mortally wounded) was found dead upon the Shore within three
miles of Weymouth.

Where the Country people (after many days labor upon this mighty fish)
having opened it is belly, found a Romish Priest, with a black Box of Pardons
from the Pope for many Papists in England and Ireland, whose Names are here
printed.

Also the names of the Seamen who were present, and will make attestation of
this wonderful truth.

A great wonder at Sea.
THat Antichrist or the Pope is the Beast of Rome, has been abundantly
declared by all reformed Writers; but that this Beast is odious not only to
men and Creatures upon earth, but even to Fishes in the Sea this age only can
give an illuctration of it, and that in such a miraculous manner as never age
can produce the like. We will describe unto you the full manner of it, and you
shall have it really and plainly related as we have received the truth from
many who were the present Spectators of this wonderful sight, and we shall
desire only from you but the gentleness to receive it, and the credence to
believe it.

On the 10 of October 1645 being the Lords Day, the good Shipp called The
Bonaventure of Weymouth, being bound for England, was bringing home her
Merchandise from France, which was Wines, Linen Cloth, and abundance of
Walnuts: the day was very fair, and no wind stirring, so that the Ship for
above three hours space lay hulling upon the Seas, being not able to move
either one way or other, for want of wind, although she was full Sailed and
prepared to take the advantage of every Gale. Being put to some inconvenience
by reason of this great Calm, the Seamen for the present had nothing else to
do but to look about them, many of them, as the manner is at Sea, wishing rather
for a Tempest, then being Wind-bound to stare about them, and do nothing, when
behold not far from them they saw a mighty rolling, and working upon the
water; and being amazed at the strangeness of the sight, they called unto one
another, and were all come above Board, expecting what should occasion so
strange a motion in the water, they found it to draw nearer to them, which made
them the more eager to apprehend the cause, at length they perceived it to be a
Whale, and that of no small proportion, but (as it were the Leviathan of the
Sea) to transcend all other Whales in length and compass. The VVhale made
toward the Shipp, which put the Mariners into a great fear, being not able to
get from it, but they perceived the Monster of the sea to come to them rather
for refuge, then offense, for they saw it was followed by a infinite company of
other Fish, as if all the fishes of the Sea were in the pursuance of it: There
were to be seen Fishes of all sorts, only the Remora was absent, which the
Seamen afterward conceived was got under their Ship. There was the
Sword-Fish, the Thornbacke aimed with his Prickles, the fair Balena, the
filthy Phocae, and such a fry of Sea Monsters (the old ones following after) as
the like was never seen nor can be represented, but only by those men who were
the Spectators of it. In a most violent manner they did beat against the
VVhale, making a most hideous and fearful noise, and falling upon her, she
made what haste she could to get from them: some of these fishes were in one
shape, and some in another, but all most wonderful to behold, who in great
fury did use whatsoever weapons of offense that nature had afforded them to
assault this VVhale: nay, many of them were so eager in their fight, that they
were seen to leap above the water, and as if they had gained an advantage of
strength, they did throw themselves with greater rage against it, who being but
one against so many thousands, was not able to wirstand their fury, but making
a most terrible cry, did what she could to come near the Ship. On this the
amazed and distracted Seamen, fearing the VVhale should overturn their ship,
and so drown them all, discharged diverse of their muskets against it, which it
seems took effect, for presently they saw so great store of Blood that the
sea was much colored, and the Whale which before seemed to draw more near the
Ship for a safety, did now steer another course through the bloody and foaming
waters. The infinite shoales of fish, which in incredible numbers did follow
the Whale, were no way dismayed at the noise of the Muskets, nor at the fire
which was given, but perceiving the wounded Whale to make away from the Ship,
in greedy throng they pressed after it.

This made the Seamen to wonder more, for many of them whose Names are here
subscribed, having been often at Sea, never beheld the like thing before, nor
never saw such diversity of pertentous Fishes, following troops on troops, one
after another, as if they were in emulation who first should exercise their
greatest fury and revenge upon it; Besides, they do profess, that it did
increase their wonder, to see this contestation which is against the usual way
of nature, it being common and ordinary for the Whale to pursue other Fishes,
and to devour them, and not to see a multitude of other Fishes (as if they were
confederate all in one obligation) to pursue the Whale, and to do the uttermost
of their endeavor to destroy it. In this manner they followed the Whale, and
used what violence they could against it, as far as their eyes could reach, the
sea beating up and down, and the waters laboring as they passed through them,
yet still in choleric tumults pursued the chase, leaving a great trale upon
the waters, which for a long way was to he seen as they passed.

By this the evening coming on, the wind did begin to rise, which blowing from
the South-East was very welcome to the Seamen, who making their best advantage
of it, they came on the next morning (being Monday October. 20. 1645.) unto
Weymouth, where they were no sooner landed but they understood that a Whale of
a mighty bigness was cast up three miles from that place, who coming in with
the Tide, and being sorely wounded with Musket shots, did make what haste she
could to Land, and finding the Tide to forsake her, she made a mighry roar,
that the noise thereof (as the country people do report) was heard two miles
from it: on the next morning she was found dead, like a mighty ruin lying all
along upon the shore, the country people coming from all places in multitudes
to behold it.

On Friday following these Seamen (having dispatched their business at
Weymouth, went nine of them together in one company to see the Whale, and the
rather because they did truly conjecture it to be the same Whale which on
Sunday before they saw pursued by such monstrous multitudes of fishes;
corceiving also, that by reason of the many wounds which she received by the
shots from the Muskets, that she made haste to the next shore to dye on, for
the Whale, although when she is living will be covered with the Sea, yet when
she feels death coming on, she does renounce that watery Element, and will
admit no coverture but the wide Vault of Heaven. These mariners being come they
found the Countrey-people very active in cutting up the Whale, some busy on
one part of the body, some on another, the better sort standing by and wondering
at the mighty compass and proportion of it, and encouraging the
Countrey-people to proceed in their unaccustomed work. The honest people
partaked in the labor, the better sort in the profit, and all in the
grievousnesse of the smell, which to speak the truth was so excessive, that if
it be true Philosophy, that a violent subject or sensible does destroy the
Sensory or the sense, it may be a question whether these Noses can ever have
the capacity of senting any thing that is sweet again. Had you been there you
might have seen Greenland near Weymouth, such a noise and a quarter they make
when they do hew the Whales in pieces in that Northern Climate, where there is
but one night and one day in a whole year.

Their strength being lost with labor, and their spirits with the odious
importunity of the increasing favor which proceeded from the corruption of
that mighty Carcass, they relieve themselves (according to the accustomed
practice) with the strength of Hot-Waters: and now being armed against all
ingredients of ill savours, they distribute the fish in prepared Cauldrons,
which by the benefit of the fire must be improved into Oil,

While the laborers are boiling the Fish, the Merchants are compounding for
the Spelme or seed thereof; and this commonly is called Parmacity, some part
thereof they design to Falmouth, some part to Exeter, some part to Weymouth, and
very like some part to Bristoll and London:

The belly of this Whale being opened, and the vast Ribs being taken asunder
there was discovered in the Bowels of it a man, who it seems had not long lain
buried, his head was shaven, he was surely some Priest, and the hair on his
Crown since his death was not much grown.

They found also with this man a black Box made of Lether, wherein were diverse
Pardons for several Papists now in England and in Ireland, as for John Flower
and Humphrey Vaux] in England (it is thought that this Vaux is of kin to Guido
Vaux, who endeavored to have blown up the Parliament House in the year 1605.)
Also many Pardons for Papists in Ireland, who have labored to the uttermost of
their endeavors to blow it up again, as to one Preston, the same who is now
expected to come over into England with Forces; also an exhortation to him to
proceed in the Wars he had undertaken, with assurance of the benediction of his
Holiness. A Pardon for one Muskerry, a Pardon for one Oneal, for Mac Magennis,
and one for diverse others, which was read by a Scholar, who was then present,
as those Seamen have affirmed, but being themselves but unexperienced men in
Letters, they are sorry they cannot deliver the particulars so fully as they
desire.

It may evidently appear, that the reason why these multitudes of Fishes before
related did so prosecute this Whale, was by reason of the person in its Belly,
who it seems was cast into the sea by some shipwreck, and then swallowed by
this great Whale.

The Pardons were for these men, viz.

Englishmen John Flower Humphrey Vaux

Irishmen John Muskerry William Preston Patrick Oneal James Macgennis

The Names of the Seamen who affirm this, and were eye witnesses, are William
Lelo Master of the ship, Tho: Chibnall Boteswain, Francis Sero, Tho: Tailor.

FINIS.
