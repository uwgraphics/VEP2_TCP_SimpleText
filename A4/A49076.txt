Me this Day, That diverse Persons (Pretending Themselves to be Citizens of

Present Convention of the LORDS and COMMONS at Westminster, Upon Pretense of
Petitioning: It being Regular and Usual for the Citizens of This City, that are
under the Apprehension of any Grievance, to make Their Application to my Self,
and the Court of Aldermen: Therefore with the Advice of my Brethren, the
Aldermen of This CITY; These are to Require You, That You Command your Beadle
immediately to give Notice to Every Inhabitant within Your Ward, That They
forbear any such Tumultuous Disturbance, or Assembly; As They will Answer the
Contrary at Their utmost Peril.
