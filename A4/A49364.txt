The LOYAL SHERIFS of LONDON and Middlesex. Upon their Election.
To the Tune of, Now at last the Riddle is Expounded.
^

1.
NOw at last the Matter is Dicided,
Which so long the Nation has divided;
Misguided
By Interest and blind Zeal,
Which so well in Forty four they Acted;
Now with greater hear,
They again act over like Men Distracted,
To give to Monarchy a new defeat.
2.
Famous North, of Noble Birth and Breeding,
And in Loyal Principles Exceeding;
Is pleading
To stand his Countries Friend,
To do Justice to the King and Nation,
Some so much oppose,
To renew the work of REFORMATIOM,
And carry on again the Good Old Cause.
3.
Next Renowned Box as high Commended,
And of Loyal Parentage Descended;
Intended
To do the City Right,
With true Courage and firm Resolution,
He the Hall Adorns;
But the Heads were all in great Confusion:
Such Din there was and rattling with their Horns.
4.
Prick up Ears, and push for one another,
Let not Box (an old Malignant) Brother;
Nor 'to'ther
Our Properties Command,
He Is a Malignant, North is nothing better,
They walk Hand in Hand,
He you know is the Lord Mayor's Creature:
And therefore it is not fit that they should stand.
5.
Where are now our Liberties and Freedom?
Where shall we find Friends when we should need 'em?
To bleed 'em
And pull the Tory's down,
To push for our Intr'est, who can blame us?
Sheriffs rule the Town,
When we loose our Darling IGNORAMUS:
We loose the Combat, and the day's their own.
6.
Then let every Man stand by his Brother,
Poll over ten times, Poll for one another;
What a Pother
You see the Tory's make,
Now or never, now to save your Charter,
O, your Hearts will ache,
If it goes for them expect no Quarter:
If Law and Justice rule, our heels must shake:
7.
Rout, a Rout, join 'Prentice, Pore and Peasant,
Let the White Hall ^arty call it Treason,
It Is Reason
We should our Necks Defend,
Routs and Ryots, Tumults and Sedition,
Poll 'em over again,
These do best agree with our Condition;
If Monarchy prevail, we are all lost men.
8.
The Lord Mayor is Loyal in his Station,
Alas what will become of the Reformation;
Of The Nation
If the Shrieves be Loyal too?
Wrangle, Brangle, hust and keep a Clatter;
If we loose the Field,
Poll 'em over again, it makes no matter:
For though we loose the Day, we scorn to Yield.
9.
Ten for Box, and Twenty for Papillion,
North a Thousand, and Dubois a Million:
What Villain
Our Interest dare oppose?
With those Noble Patriots thus they sided,
To uphold the Cause;
But the good Lord Mayor the case Decided:
And once again two Loyal Worthies Chose.
10.
Noble North, and Famous Box promoted,
By due Course and Legal Choice allotted;
They Voted
To be the City Shrieves,
And may they both to Londons Commendation,
Her ancient Rights restore,
To do that Justice to the King and Nation,
Which former Factions have denied before.
LONDON, Printed for M. Thompson, 1682.
