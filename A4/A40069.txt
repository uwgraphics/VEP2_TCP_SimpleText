An Humble REPRESENTATJON FROM His Excellency, Sir Thomas Fairfax, and the
Council of the Army.
SInce, by the blessing of God, the Speakers and Members of both Houses (that
had been driven away) were without blood restored, and have been ever since
secured to sit and attend their duty in Parliament, with what patience God has
given us to wait for the resolutions of those things we have insi^ted on or
offered, tending to the future security of the Parliament, the j^st
satisfaction of the Soldiery, and the ^ase and settlement of the Kingdom, we
need not use many words to set forth; the expense of above 4. months time, in
quiet expectation thereof, with so little satisfaction does sufficiently speak.

As to what fruit we have found, in any thing done to any of those ends, we are
sorry we can s^y so little thereof, or that we have occasion to say so much to
the de^a^e^, neglects, and obstructions* thereof, as ^ow we are constrain^d to
do,

But what ever those d^layes or negl^cts have been, o^ wherever the fault ha^h
been, w^ are sure the bla^e th^reof has been laid upon us, almost ^n all
han^s, and this is the* fruit we have found from the hands of men, of all our
patient waiting hitherto.

It is not unk^own what reproaches and scan^all, in this ki^d have been cast
upon us, and what use and advantage has been ma^e of those delays, thereby to
work upon the impatience of the Soldiers, and Countr^^, to ince^^e (...)
^ountrey against the A^my, an^ both the Country and Army against us, as if it
had been our fau^t ^^a^on, that no more was do^e. And to what an height of
scand^ll and discontent against us, the pretense hereof was driven, (...) have
been thereupon, to withd^aw the (...) (as having betrayed or failed and
neglect^d both theirs and the Kingdoms interest) to divide and distemper the
A^my, and to enga^e both the Soldiery and many other well affected people
(under the same notion and pretense) in way^s of dist^actio^ and confusion, and
(as we accompt^d the^) o^ most i^minent dangers, both to the Parliament, City,
and Kingdom, we need not now spend time to express^; We b^li^ve a^l tha^ wished
w^ll ^o the public were so deeply sensible thereof, as they cannot so suddenly
forget it, and others (w^o had any thing to lose or haz^d) though perhaps so
far as they had hop^s, the Army might that way have destroyed it self, they
might have some secret rejoicing at it, and may now be sorry the business^ is so
well over without that offer, yea, so ^arre a^ they considered the bottomless
depth and endless danger of it, they could not but b^ aff^cted with it, so as
we need not mention i^ save to mind men of what danger and mischief God has
therein d^livered them from, and whence the greatest a^vantage to the rise and
growth of it, was (even from delays and flow proceedings in those things which
the long expectations of the Soldiery and Kingdom have been set upon, and to
obs^rve how apt both the Soldiery and people through tedious delays in such
cases, are to hearken to any party, and try any new way propos^d (under the
notion of more speedy and eff^ctuall, though perhaps so far from real remedy
as that ^^ indeed endangers the utter less of their end, with ruin and
destruction ^o both.

To pr^vent the p^ogresse of this growing danger to all; we have lately exposed
our selves to the utmost h^zard, and being act^d therein from some ^^arre^^
^n^^^ Confer^nces, that the fault of those delays lay not upon us [as wa^ s^an
alous^ suggested] and a co^^;i^nce in God (...) would appear, to vindicate that
m^asure of (...) and integri^y, he had given us i^ the thing, though with ma^y
fail^^^s and miscarriag^s on our part, we were led forth by him, wi^ho^^ any
Artifice, whereby to vindicate or ex^use our selves, nakedly to cast our
selves, and the business upon him, and to his praise w^ must speak i^, he
has appeared in an answerab^e (...); wher^of the Parliament and Kingdom ^ath
had an account, and wherein they may se^, and we wish they may with us ^ake
notice and be mindful of, the mercy and goodness of God in our deliverance
more added to all the rest, and therein the Army, which in casting of all b^nds
of order and government, was like to have been let loose to be a plague and
bane both to the Kingdom and it self, once more reduced unto that temper and
discipline which may render it, through and under God, a further security and
stay to the Kingdom, and in due time bring it to a quiet disbanding, when just
satisfaction, with set^lement and safety, shall a^mit.

But [as has in part been done already] we must again mind the Parliament upon
what terms this has been wrought, the General [as we all wit^ and under
him] stands engaged to the Army, for the lawful prosecution of the Soldiers
Concernments and some General fundamental things for the Kingdoms and (in
confidence of the Parliament good accep^ance of the service thereby done, and
of there real intention and promised effectual resolution, to give
satisfaction in those things) has in a manner undertaken for the Parliament
therein.

We wish we may see a cause to acknowledge a just sense of his Excelencie; good
affection, and service in that business, or at least of their own engagement,
or the Kingdoms concernment therein, and that we had not cause to apprehend
either a strange neglect thereof growing upon many, or rather (in some) the sad
symptoms of an evil eye, at the service it self, as if they did regret the
happy composure of those distractions begun in the Army and the reuniting of
it, or did grudge the good hand of God toward it, and the Kingdom therein,
that in mercy would not suffer it to run on in these distractions to its own
ruin and the Kingdoms. For though it be most evident that had God given up the
Army to cast off the reins of Government and order, and to go on in those
distracting and confounding ways, (which it was endeavored to be drawn into)
both it and other forces of the Kingdom, were like ere this time to have been
engaged in blood, one against another, or else united only in some desperate
course of rending and tearing out the bowels and vitals of the Kingdom, and
plucking up or endangering all foundations of order, peace and government
therein (yea and of all right and property too) yet the envy and malignity of
some men's spirits against this Army, and against the interests of good men
therein, seems to be such, as if they had rather have seen it so, then that
this Army should again be an united piece; and we clearly apprehend the same
principles (that swaid heretofore) none again prevailing, as if there were no
good so desirable or evil so formidable; which the breaking of this Army (with
as much ignominy, and confusion as may be) would not, in their account,
countervail; and if such an envious and evil spirit be indeed lodged and
working in the hearts of any, we desire God in mercy to convince them of it,
least he confound them for it. For our parts having the witness of God in our
consciences that though we are not without weak and frail workings of our
fleshly hearts in all our ways (yet for the main) we have in all our
Engagements, from the beginning of the war, had the work of God and the
Kingdom in our eye, and not our own, and that since the Army (by the oppressive
provoking and spiteful proceedings of men acted by the aforesaid envious
principles against it) was raised into such resolutions, and driven into such a
posture as put it past the power of the Officer to bring it to a quiet
disba^ding, without further satisfaction and security; It has been our main
end in continuing with it and almost our whole work, to keep it within compass
and moderation, to withhold it from extremities of all sorts, and from that
mischief to the Kingdom or itself, which our withdrawi^g and taking off our
hands from the Government of it, would have let it loose unto, to make use of
it and of the providence that brought it to that pass (if possible) to some
good issue for the just liberty, safety and set^lement of the Kingdom, and
bring the Army to some bottom of seasonable satisfaction wherein it might
acqu^esce, and at last come to a quiet disbanding; and (in ^ransact^on of all
this) with all tenderness and patience to preserve [if possible] the authority
and peace of the Kingdom, and prevent new Broyls, which several parti^s and
int^rests have been ^o apt unto.

Having, we say, the wi^nesse of these things within us, when, on the other
side, we consider that unworthy requitalls for all this we meet with from the
hands of men, how we are loaded with reproaches for it, and ^^ndered the only
disturbers of the K^ngdom, and the Authors of its burdens, as if for private
en^s or designs we kept up the Army) and how generally most men [even of the
Parliament party, for whose preservation and for prevention of whose ruin
amongst others, we have exposed our selves to all ^azards therein) do either
from dis^ff^ction or ^^sign to divide and break the Army, withold ^r obst^^ct
all supplies and satisfaction which might keep it inord^^, uni^n or repu^e; We
confess, when we (...) these (...) we are ready to apprehend tha^ God does
herein (...) most justly to upbraid cu^ ca^e an^ (...), to ^^eserve a people
given up (as we begin to fear) to their ^wn destruction, and which (...) to
choose it rather, the^ ^ot to have their own facti^us i^terests or envy
fulfilled, rather then to own their preservation, in the least degree, by th^se
whom God has app^ared willing to use for their preservation and deliveran^^.

And rather then we would further incur the ^dium and scandal of being the
only public disturb^rs and oppressors (so unworthily cast upon us merely for
our good will, and endeavors to prevent greater mi^chiefs) we are apt to c^use
rather to withdraw f^o^ our present station (though wi^h hazard of our
personal safeties, and the ^^^e not only of any imagined benefit of fu^ure
empl^yment, but even our arreares, for what service we have done) and so
leaving all to what ever confusion God in ^is righteous judgment may see good
to bring upon the Na^ion, to cast our selves wholly upon him, to pr^s^rve and
provide for us in the midst th^^eof, or if God in mercy (...) better things
to the Kingdom, or has found (...) in us (which we con^^sse he may) r^^d ring
us unwor^hy to be any further instruments thereof, we should desir^, with
meekness and rejoicing, to see any other whom he finds, or the Kingdom judges
more wor^hy to take up our present charges: But fi^ding not as yet any s^c^
c^^^r ^ischarge as would (^o our apprehensions) fully acquit us before God or
Man, to leave the Army or kingdom in their present condition, we shall, in
discharge of our duty to the u^most, add this one assay more to bring both into
a be^ter, if God in mercy see it good: We shall therefore once more beg the
Parliament timely to consider and provide effectually for these things expressed
in the late Remonstrance published at the several Randezvous of the Army, upon
his Excellencies continued conjunction, wherein the disconten^s in the Army
were quieted, the distractions composed, and the due order and Discipline of
it, recovered and submitted to.

And amongst these things, since the greatest and most immediate and pressing
evil to the Soldiery is want of pay, and to the Country, the disorders,
exactions, and abuses of the Soldiery with the burden and annoyances free
quarter (thereby enforced) and which (if once provided for) gives time of
consideration for other things, we shall first apply to that either to obtain,
a present remedy, or at least, to acquit and discharge our selves in that point.

Of the many evils thereof both to the Soldiery and Country we have long
been sadly sensible, and many ways and often expressed our sense thereof, but
we have bin most troubled at it, since that necessity which heretofore enforced
it, ( viz. the straitnes of the Quarters the Parliament had to raise money in)
was taken away, and all parts of the Kingdom have been cleared from any
enemy, and free for the equal levying of money to supply the necessities of
the whole; and it seems a matter of wonder to us, or an argument of great
improvidence (at best) that since that time the Soldiery (though much lessened
in number) should be no better paid or provided for then before; From the sense
of these things we have made frequent addresses to the Parliament, for a
sufficient establishment and provision of pay for the Army and other Forces of
the Kingdom, until they might (with safety to the Kingdom, and just
satisfaction or security to themselves (in point of Arrears* Indemnity etc.) be
disbanded or otherwise employed out of the Kingdom, We have long waited with
patience as aforesaid, for some fruit of our addresses, at least, in this
point: But what through the difficulty or delay of getting things past in
Parliament to this purpose, or of putting in^ execution those Ordinances that
have been passed, and the neglect or flownesse of Country Committees,
Assessors, or Collectors to do their duty therein, what through the Malignancy
of some who (in design to break or distract the Army as aforesaid) for want
of pay, and to disaffect the Country thereto by necessitated free quarter) do
industriously retard all supplies of money, and what through the General
backwardness of all (especially in the City of London,) to part with it, we
have yet found little fruit of all our addresses, and endeavors in this kind,
there being not as yet an establishment of Contribution, for pay of the
Soldiery, any whit near proportionable to the numbers that are yet kept up,
or any effectual execution of the powers already given for raising of the
Taxes already charged upon the Kingdom, so as we remain yet, as far as
ever, from that supply of pay to the army, at other forces; whereby either the
burden and grievances of free quarter can be taken off, or the necessity of
the Soldiery competently supplied o^ their discontents in any measure removed
or disorder prevented, or good discipline preserved, and (which is most sad) in
the Garrisons of the Kingdom (and those of most importance) where the
Soldiery have not, nor can well have that benefit of Quarter for their
subsistence (as the Army and field Forces have yet) they have very long been
without any supply of pay at all, so as diverse poor Soldiers in some of them
have actually starved, and died for want, in attendance upon their duties,
others forced by extremity of want to quit their service, and the rest ready
to ^terve or quit the Garrisons to any that will possess them; And as it is
most apparent, that the present proportion of Tax (if duly levied) could not
competently supply them, and others too (in an equal distribution thereof,
considering the number that are yet in being) so the Committees in many
Countries (where such Garrisons are, that have engaged with the Army) do
refuse to levy those small proportions of money, that have been assigned for
the present relief to such Garrisons, but are content to see the aforesaid
miseries of the Souldierie, and danger to the Garrisons, rather then do their
parts, to give the least remedy to either, diverse of them telling the
Soldiers plainly (as we are informed) that if they had declared against the
Army, they should not have wanted, but having engaged with it, they must expect
neither quarter nor pay, but what they get from the Army.

If we or this poor Army have deserved such hatred and despite, (especially
from pretending friends to the Parliament, and the Kingdoms interest) we would
^aine be plainly told and convinced wherein, otherwise we cannot but account
it most unchristian and inhumane dealing, and such as can have no better root,
then most envious faction, void of all regard to public Interest; and we
would have all such know, that if we had borne the same mind, or could have
allowed our selves by power to pur^ue the ruin of adverse parties by indirect
or unchristian ways, or otherwise to set up a party of our own and suppress
all others, or if we had not ^ill (according to our first principles) loved
much more the ways of Common right and freedom, and the proceeding in all
such things by Parliament in order thereunto, or if we had not in the way of
ordering our affairs since the Armies engagement, consulted mo^e the
preserving of Peace in the Kingdom, and to prevent the rise of any new war,
then our own advantage or security, we could (to speak as men with the power
and advantages God has put into our hands) long ere this time (as yet also we
might) have put the Army and all other Forces engaged with it into such a
Posture, as to have assured themselves of pay while continued* and probably to
have made our opposers in the Kingdom and City too, willing to have followed
us with offers of satisfaction, as to Arreares, and other dues that concern
the Sould^ery; or we could have told how to prosecute those advantages we
have had to the suppression, if not destruction of adverse parties and
interests* so as they should not (probably) have had those foundations or
possibilities to grow up again, to our further trouble or danger (as now they
seem to have;) And all this with reason and justice enough too, but that we
have studied the preservation, and good of all, without ruin or destruction to
any, as far as we could, and have (through God) been acted therein, in some
measure, with that mildness, moderation, patience, and love that becomes the
name of Christ; And we are yet confident, we shall at last loose nothing by
it; But (to return to our purpose, as to the inconveniences and dangers of a
new Provision for the Souldery in point of Pay, the Parliament has had
sufficient Cautions and warnings, especially in the late distra^tions; and
though, while the danger thereof continued visible, it was largely professed
(if that danger could be removed, and the Army reduced into order and
discipline) we should have what provision we would with reason in that point,
and the same (with much more) upon the first hopes of overcomming that danger,
was as largely promised; Yet now the danger is over* we see little better care
of performance then before. but after many days since elapsed, and some spent
in professed consideration of it, the whole care of that business seems to be
wrapped up in one Bare vote, viz. [that all supernumerary forces shall be
disbanded.]

As to which matter of disbanding supernumeraries (so it be with reasonable
satisfaction in point of Arreares,) we are so far from opposing, or
obstructing it, that (for the speedy easing of the Kingdoms burdens by it)
we shall readily give all furtherance and assistance to it, and shall (by and
by) offer that encouragement thereto, as will demonstrate the same, and on such
terms we should our selves most gladly be of those supernumeraries that
should come first to disbanding.

But, as to the thought of present disbanding all supernumeraries (according to
the Vote) first we cannot but wish it be considered, whether with any respect
at all to the service, and relief of Ireland, the Parliament can well disband
them all, unto which service (as there might have been a great advancement of
assistance long since, but for the prevalence of Faction and design to break
that force that might have afforded it, as we have formerly remonstrated) so
we have more lately contributed our parts, in the offer and designation of a
very considerable force thereunto, and there has* wanted nothing but
resolution and money, with expedition to send them over, which was not within
our power.

But if (with respect to that service and the safety of this Kingdom) the
Parliament can yet lessen their forces so much, as to bring them near the
compass of sixty thousand pounds a months pa^, yet, we wish it be withal,
considered how many those supernumeraries are, that must so come to be
presently disbanded (which, to bring the residue within that compass, would
be little less then twenty thousand of one sort or other) and (if so) how
great a sum it would require, to give any reasonable satisfaction to so many
in point of Arreares in hand; And (by the hardness of getting so much money as
to piece up the months pay to the Army) we have much reason to doubt how long
the Parliament will be in raising such a sum together, or where they will*
suddenly find money, to give competent satisfaction to the proportion but of a
Regiment or two upon a present disbanding, and unless they be provided with
present money, to give reasonable satisfaction to so many at once, as would to
that end come to be disbanded, the Parliament must either turn them off
presently with extreme dissatisfaction and disobligation (which would render
them apt to rise again with any party against the Parliament who would give
them hope of better dealing, or but of revenge) or else must continue them
until better provided.

And though there were money ready for a competent part of arrears in hand, yet
it will be necessary however that they be continued some time for the stating
of their accounts and giving debentures for the remainder, for (besides the
injustice and dissatisfaction of turning the Soldiers off without that) we
presume the Parliament has had too much experience already of the bottomless
ill consequences of not ascertaining their accounts and arrears before
disbanding, and not keeping the same registered together, by the endless
clamours and outcries of particular persons for arrears, and the vast sums
expended thereupon without end of satisfaction (the persons or their sta^e of
arrears through neglect of taking such accounts before disbanding) having never
been certainly known, nor any end either of their number or claims) and the
dispatch of such accounts, for those that remain, before disbanding, will
certainly take up some time (we doubt) some months; now, if thus any part of
the supernumeraries (above what the sixty thousand pounds a month will pay)
shall either for the time of stating their accounts or longer (for want of
present money to disband withal) be continued, both they and all other
Soldiers in the Kingdom must so long remain without constant pay, and
consequently go upon free quarter the while, unless the tax for their pay be
(for the mean time) proportionably increased; for the sixty thousand pounds a
month, not affording any assignement for such supernumeraries pay, those must
of necessity go unpayd the while and consequently upon free quarter, and their
going any where upon free quarter will hinder the coming in of the contribution
of those parts which should be to pay some others, and so they likewise must go
upon free quarter the while: which will in like manner hinder the pay and
necessitate the like free quartering of others, so as all will that while be
equally hindered of constant pa^, and forced to take free quarter still; but
(besides these aforementioned certain and visible occasions of delays to the
present effect of the vo^e for disbanding all supernumeraries (we doubt it will
find many other difficulties and obstructions to the speedy and effectual
dispatch thereof, and prove not so easy or so well executed as voted; so that,
though we wish that business of disbanding supernumeraries, put into a way of
as speedy execution as may be, yet upon all these considerations we cannot
imagine that vote to be absolute and sovereign, nor so speedy or timely a Cure
of the Soldiers wants, and discontents, or the Countries grievance in their
free quarter, as the nature of the malady and temper of the Patient requires;
We shall therefore offer our final advice for some other: First setting down
the particulars, and then showing the efficacy and benefit thereof; The
particulars (which we have in part heretofore propounded to the Parliament) are
these;

1 That the Parliament do forthwith enlarge their monthly contribution for
five or six Months, to the full proportion of the pay of all the Forces now in
being within this Kingdom (or at least of so many of them as they are not
provided with present money to disband) and to a considerable proportion (viz.
about ten thousand pounds a Month) over; which (by a near estimate) we
conceive would well be by the addition of forty thousand pounds per mensem to
the present sixty thousand pounds, and with less we believe it cannot (...));
And the same Committees to be appointed and to have the same power for the
levying of this as for the former sixty thousand pounds, and the same penalties
for neglects or defaults therein, as for the Arreares of former taxes to the
Army, and for more speedy passing of this unless some visible inequallity in
the rates of Countries could be readily rectified without delay to the passing
of it, we wish it might, (being but for that short space) pass according to
the same rates as the sixty thousand pounds; and for the Kingdoms better
sattisfaction herein it may be Resolved and Declared.

I. That upon this enlargement and the effectual Leavying of it in the
respective Counties, no free quarter at all shall (from within a month at most
after passing the Ordinance) be taken in any County or place where it shall be
duly Leavyed and paid. II. That it is intended this enlargement of tax shall
not be continued beyond the space of the months limited, and that in the mean
time, as the Parliament can find money, and safety to disband and lessen their
forces, so (if that lessening be considerable) they nill by degrees lessen the
said tax proportionably.
2 We desire that for the more sure and effectual Leavying of the whole tax,
the General and Committee of the army, or one of them may have power (in case
of any County Committees neglect or failing therein) to add new men to any the
respective Committees who (thereupon) to have the same power as the Committees
named in the Ordinance have.

3. That for more sure and ready payment of the Soldiery out of this, the
forces which cannot, or are not provided for to be forthwith disbanded, may be
immediately assigned to several Counties or Associations of Counties, out of
whose taxes they shall be paid, and that the General may have power
accordingly to make such distribution and assignments giving notice and account
thereof to the Committee of the Army, and they thereupon to take order for the
payment of the forces so assigned, immediately out of the Counties or
Associations to which they are Assigned, and that the payment be made according
to due Musters and according to the last establishment (as to the rate of each
officers pay) and the surplusage of any Counties Taxes above the due pay of
their Forces so assigned to be paid out of them, to be (at the care and
oversight of the same Committee for the Army) called for and paid into the
Common Treasury, for such General uses as shall be found necessary relating to
the forces and service within this Kingdom, by warrant from the General or
Committee for the Army according to the usual course of limitations
heretofore; and the remainder or surplusage of the said Taxes of the whole
Kingdom (above the uses aforesaid) to be for the supply and relief of the
forces already in Ireland, or other public uses as the Parliament shall
think fit; And the same Committee likewise, with the Treasurers, to take care
for the methodizing, and ballancing of the whole accounts, and to have power
for the employing of Officers needful for the dispatch and accommodation of
this service, and to make allowance of salaries to them, (within some
reasonable limitation) particularly that there be allowances for so many Deputy
Commissaries of Musters as upon the practick of this distribution, the General
and Committee shall find needful; And the Treasures General out of their
salary (in regard of this accession to it) to maintain so many Deputy
Treasurers as the General and Committee of the Army shall find needful to be
employed, and reside in such several parts of the Kingdom as the General
shall find convenient for that service.

4. That the security for arreares being settled as has been already and is
again hereafter propounded, the Parliament would speedily send down
Commissioners to the Army, and appoint the like for other forces of the
Kingdom, to state accounts and give debenturs, whereby the Soldier may before
disbanding, have his arreares ascertained to him, as a clear debt to be paid
him out of that security; And that one Office or Registry may be appointed into
which all accounts so taken may be returned, and all the arreares Registered to
be paid in order, as is hereafter expressed, and for this office we offer that
two Registers, with four Clerks may be allowed to have reasonable Salaries out
of the Revenue issuing out of the said security, and this we desire may be
hastened for the speedier preparation to the work of disbanding; that such as
are to be disbanded may be ready for it, by that time the Parliament can
provide money wherewith to disband any of them, and that so by disbanding the
supernumeraries as fast as may be, way may be made for the speedier lessening
and taking off the Taxes by degrees.

Now, for the advantage and benefit of the things here propounded, they will
appear as follows, viz. Whereas upon the former supposition (that the
putting off the Soldiery that are to be continued into a way of constant pay,
do depend only upon the disbanding of all supernumeraries, whom the present Tax
will not extend to pay) Its most evident (as before demonstrated) that none can
be put into present pay, but all must go on upon free quarter, so long as
until every one of the said supernumeraries be disbanded (which what ever may
be imagined) though no other difficulties or obstructions should happen then
what are now visible, as before mentioned, would not be effected, nor (we
doubt) provided for in three or four months time, we wish it prove so soon:
but we much fear interruptions, or delays, will happen to make it much
longer, and all that while (free quarter continuing as before) the burden
thereof (besides the anoyances) though it fall more lightly upon some parts and
heavier upon others, yet in the whole it damnifies the Kingdom as much as the
said increased contributions come to. The Soldiers also must have (besides his
quarters) some pay in hand the mean while (otherwise he can neither subsist nor
be kept in order) yet still he accounts (at least) half of his pay for the
remaining time, in arrear to him, so as that further debt does also grow upon
the Kingdoms score; Now contrary-wise (the things we have propounded being
granted) that bare contribution answers all; for we dare under take, within a
fortnight after granting of them, all the forces of the Kingdom shall be
assigned where, and how to receive their pay consta^tly, til disbanded; and so
no more freequarter shall he^ceforth be taken, no part of the Kingdom any more
unequally oppressed thereby, nor any further debt of arrears hence forth
incurred upon the Kingdom, and the work of disbanding supernumeraries not at
all hindered, but much facilitated thereby, and as the Parliament finds money
and safety to disband any of them, they may by the same degrees either lessen
the tax proportionably, or will have so much more surplusage thence from,
toward relief of Ireland, or toward disbanding of others, or any other
public uses.

And now for furtherance and encouragement in the matter of d^sbanding (those
things before mentioned being granted) we shall (for the Army and other Forces
engaged with it) offer and agree to these rules following,

1. That such of the said forces as shall come to be disbanded as
supernumeraries, shall (out of the moneys to be raised upon the security for
Arreares) have the full moity of their arreares first made good to them, as
moneys come in hereupon, before those which fall out to be continued shall
receive any part of theirs, and after that (when those that continue, shall
have received the like proportion of theirs then) these that shall be disbanded
to receive the other moity or full remainder of their Arreares, before these
that continue any more.

2. That those of them which shall disband, shall (as moneys come in upon the
said security) receive their proportions of Arreares in the same order and
course as they disband, (of which order and course a remembrance to be entered
and kept in the aforesaid Regestry of these accounts) the persons of the
Regiment, Troop, or Company first disbanding, and so the rest in course, to
receive first what was due to them at disbanding (to make up their first moity)
by two equal portions, and likewise to receive their second moity at twice, by
equal portions, in the same course as they disband.

Now for our desire in the first proposition afore-going, (to have the increase
of Contribution extended to the proportion of ten thousand pounds a month (by
estimate) over and above what we think the just pay for the Soldiery now in
being in the Kingdom, and not ready for present disbanding will come to: the
reason is, partly, that there may be (certain) some present supply out of it
for the Force in Ireland, and partly because, if the contribution should be set
scant of, or but just answerable to the pay of the Soldiery, the many
Contingences and acc^ssary Charges (not to be foreseen, and the probable
failings of full levying the Contribution in some parts, would necessitate the
going of some upon free Quarter, (which would disturb the order, and constant
pay of the whole) and it would also r^q^ire much time to proportion the Forces,
to be assigned upon the several Counties exactly to the contributions of them,
which would make it long e're free Quarters could be taken off, since none
could be assigned where to be paid, until the pay of each part of the
Soldiery were exactly computed, and all of them as exactly distributed
according to each Counties tax;) Whereas the taxes being laid to a sufficient
proportion above the just pay, we can immediately make distributions and
Assignments lie estimate, so as to be sure the taxes of each County exceed the
pay of the soldiers assigned to it, and though so, one County have more, and
another fewer soldiers assigned to them then (upon an exact distribution
according to the number and pay of the Soldiery) their just proportion would
come to, yet none having so many, but that their taxes will do more then pay
them, no part will bear above its due proportion of charge, and those parts
which have least numbers of Soldiers assigned upon them, yet will bear their
due proportion of charge, either in pay to the Soldiers, or in the surplusage
of their tax above it; which, being collected into the Common Treasury, will
be for relief to Ireland, or other public uses, so as the surplusage (either
in particular Counties above their particular Assignments, or of the whole
Kingdoms taxes, above the pay of the whole Soldiery in i^) will be no loss;
but (as to some present and certain relief for Ireland out of it, upon
supposition of the hundred thousand pounds a month) we shall (besides the
surplusage of every Counties tax above the pay of the Soldiers to be assigned
to it) forecast in the Distributions and Assignments, to leavye the taxes of
some Counties, (and that as many as may be) to come entirely into the common
Treasury for the relief of Ireland, without assaying any of the Forces in
England to be paid out of them.

And for that power desired for making such Distributions and Assignments, the
advantages and benefits of that way of Reparticion (as to the more sure and
ready payment of Soldiers) are sufficiently known and tried: and it is most
evident, that without it, (if no Soldiers be paid before the moneys be first
Collected in the several Counties, and then sent into the Common Treasury for
all the Kingdom, and then sent to the Head Quarters, or thence distributed to
the several Forces within the Kingdom, it is in vain to think that the
Soldiers can be supplied with money aforehand, or timely enough to make him
pay Quarters, and it is as good (almost) not at all, as not in time.

We have thus propounded a way whereby all the Soldiery of the Kingdom may
be instantly put in a condition of constant pay (while continued) and thereby
be kept in order and discipline, all free quarter (with the abuses, exactions,
annoyances, and unequal pressures that accompany it) immediately taken off, no
further debt of Arreares incurred upon the Kingdom, and that which is already
incurred, put in a way to be recovered and overcome in time, and whereby the
supernumerary forces may shortly be disbanded by degrees (as the Parliament can
find money to do it) and will be satisfiable to disband, with less money in
hand, without danger of dis-obligation therein, and whereby also the
additionall charge (now propounded) with other burdens of the Kingdom may by
the same degrees be lessened and eased with safety and satisfaction, until all
can be taken off.

And as it is evident, that if such a course as this had been taken sooner, and
the Parliament (as they found the several parts of the Kingdom cleared from
the enemy, and eased of the oppressions they suffered under them) had by
degrees extended an equal contribution over all parts in a proportion
sufficient to have paid all their forces (while they continued them) the
Kingdom had been eased of free quarter, and no further debt of arreares to the
Soldiery incurred upon it, for (at least) a year and half ago, those that
have been disbanded had not been put off with so much disobligation (as some
have been) nor had their claims and endless demands since brought such
troubles upon, or drawn such vast arrears from the Parliament and Kingdom,
and those that now remain to be disbanded had been much easier satisfyable and
more readily disbanded; So if such a course (as is here propounded) be not
speedily taken, but the putting off the Soldiery into a way of pay be left to
depend only, upon the disbanding of all supernumeraries (and that so unprovided
for) or so uncertainly and slowly provided for, and proceeded in (as without
this course) it is like to be) it is most evident (besides unforeseen dangers
of discontent both in the Soldiery and Country of difficulties to disband, or
interruptions and dissatisfactions in it) that the non-disbanding of some will
so long occasion the non-payment of all, and continue free quarter, with the
inconveniences thereof upon all, and the non-payment of all may hinder the
disbandin^ of any, and so both debts and discontents grow upon the Soldiery and
Kingdom, (perhaps) till it pass the power either of the General and
Officers, to compose the one, or the Parliament and Kingdom to satisfy the
other.

Having therefore thus sufficiently d^scharged our selves in this point, so as
we shall (we hope) stand acquitted before God and men from whatever evils ensue
upon any further neglect thereof; We must now declare, That we find the just
expectations of the Army herein (especially since the Generals late
Eengagement or undertakings at the Randezvouz) are so great and earnest, the
clamours and outcryes to us from other forces, and Garrisons of the Kingdom
engaged with the Army (for their extreme necessity, and our apprehended
neglect of equal provision for them) are so sad and pressing, the discontents
of the Country (from the oppressions of free quarter) are so full and yet
growing, and almost desperate, and the distempers distractions, and dangers
threatened by all these are so vast and emminent, as we can no longer stand
and under the burden or blame of them. But if the things here before
propounded be not granted and passed effectually (or a certain course settled
according to the effect of them) by the end of this present week; We can no
longer give account of the Army or other forces in a regular way; but unless
we find satisfaction in our judgments, to take some extraordinary ways of
power; We must let the Soldiery and K^ngdome know, that we cannot satisfy
their just expectation, and thereupon desire that the charge of the Soldiery
may be transmitted to others; If the Parliament shall approve, and pass what
we have here propounded, we must (for the better prosecution and effecting
thereof) add, that the superlative backwardness and obstinacy, or disaff^ction
rather of those within the City, who have thus long withheld their arrears of
Taxes, (so long since due to the Army) may not escape either with v^ctory
therein, or without examplary suffering (at least) by strict and speedy levying
as well the penalties, as the arreares themselves, and (for that purpose) that
the Parliament would reassume the consideration of the Generals late Letters
about that business, to the Committee of the Army, and reveiw that to the Lord
Majo^ and common Council, wherein the ill consequences both of the wilful
neglect of the thing, and of the Armies withdrawing to a further distance
before it be done, or of its continuing longer here abouts, in the delatory
(and perhapps) frui^l^sse expectation thereof from the Cities own actings
therein may sufficiently appear.

To which we add, that till it be done effectually (and sharply to some) the
distribution of the forces to several Committees to be paid (according to what
is before propounded) can neither be effectual nor safe; And we must therefore
desire that unless it be thought fit, that the whole Kingdom should groan
still under the oppressions of free quarter, and these adjacent Counties be
undone chiefly while those of the City (that occasional) sit free from any
taste of it, there may be no longer stop to the drawing in of the Army, or a
considerable part of it to quarter upon them in the City (who had not paid
before the said letters, until they shall have paid both the Arrears and full
penalties; And though our tenderness of that Cities safety and welfare, and our
clearness from the least thought of evil toward it, or any base design to
make the least advantage to our selves, or the army by it has sufficiently
appeared, as in all our former demeanments, so in our carriage of the business
upon our late advance toward it (notwithstanding the just occasions, and great
provocatitions thence so newly given) as also in our innocent march through it,
and quiet and patient waiting about it for those long-due Arreares, without
quartering any Soldiers in it; Yet now, in Justice, we cannot but desire that,
(besides the levying of the Arreares at last (for which we have been put to
stay so long) there may now likewise some reparation be thought on from the
City to the parts adjacent for above one hundred thousand pounds damage
sustained through the Armies attendance here on the Cities defaults and
delays; which reparation, we (if necessitated thereto, or called upon by the
Country) must in their behalf demand from the City to the full; and now also
(the rather in order to that) we must earnestly desire that the proceedings
against those Citizens and others lately impeacht may be hastened, and out of
their fines or confiscations, some part of reparation may be made to the
Countries adjacent for the aforesaid damages which the crimes of those persons
and others in the City did first bring upon them; And indeed, without something
done against those persons, for example to others, before the Armies with
drawing, we do not see (when it shall withdraw) with what safety or freedom
the Parliament can sit longer at Westminster, especially when we find the
Common Council (through the Parliaments and Armies lenity) to take the
boldness already (in the face of both) to intercede for the release and
acquitall (or rather justification) of those impeached persons, (who indeed are
but fellow-delionuents (we doubt) to most of that Council) as if that so
actual, immediate, and horrid a force upon both and the whole Houses of
Parliament, and the levying of War in abettment and prosecution thereof, and
of that concurrent Treasonable engagement, were already forgotten by them to
have been any crime; the consideration whereof, and of the renewed confidence
of Master Gewen and some other Members of Parliament, (known to have been
partakers, if not principals in the same things) who yet presume, and are
suffered to appear again in the House (as if in those things there had not
been so much fault, as to render them less worthy of continuing in that
highest trust) makes us begin to fear, that, while so much of the same leaven
(through lenity and moderation) is left behind, it may shortly spread, til
even the worst of the eleven Members (notwithstanding their doubled crimes) be
again called for in, unless the House (by some exclusive resolutions and
proceedings) do timely prevent the same; We hope therefore the Parl. will
weigh these things, and speedily (ere it be too late) consult (at least) their
own safety and the Kindoms, if not ours and the Armies, their poor servants,
and something concerned with them (especially) in that affair.

Next, we again more importunately desire, that those other so near
concernments of the Soldiery (expressed in the Generals late Remonstrance at
the Rendezvous) may be speedily considered, and fully and effectually provided
for; In order to which we shall here more particularly propound as follows.

First, as to the security for Arrears, whereas (in the late Votes or
Proposition intended for that purpose) the two thirds of the Lands or
Compositions of certain Delinquents assigned toward the said Security, is
only of the Delinquents within the three first Qualifications of the 16th
Proposition; We desire that may be altered so, as to be two Thirds of the Lands
or Compositions of all the Delinquents that have not yet compounded. And next
we must desire, that Deans and Chapters Lands may be added (with Proviso for
reasonable satisfaction or maintenance to such persons, as, having a present
lawful Interest in any the Revenues thereunto belonging, have not forfeited
the same by Delinquencie). These Additions are desired, because the Security as
yet Voted is justly estimated not to be sufficient, and since all that is
propounded is but for Security, if the Security prove to exceed the Arrears
really due, the surplusage will be free for any other public use, so as the
State will not be damnified by these Additions to the Security. Lastly, (as to
this business) we desire, that the matters of Security (being resolved on as
desired) may be past into Ordinance, and thereby put into a speedy and
effectually way of raising Moneys thereupon.

Secondly, for matter of Indemnity, that if no Indemnity more absolute can be
provided, (to free the Soldiery from all question for things done in the War)
but that they must (in case of question at Law) fly to some Committee or
Commissioners for relief; It may be provided for the ease of all, that (either
under the Grand Committee for Indemnity, or otherwise by the immediate
appointment of Parliament) there may be Commissioners in each County empowered
to give relief in such Cases, as the Grand Committee now are* And those
Commissioners to be such as ordinarily reside in the respective Counties, and
mixed of such as have been Military Officers to the Parliament, together with
such Inhabitants as have appeared active and faithful for the Parliament in
the late War; for which purpose we shall (if admitted) offer names; and that
there may be a severe Penalty laid upon Judges, or other Officers of Justice,
in case they shall proceed against any contrary to the Ordinance for Indemnity.

Thirdly, that sufficient Provision be made in a certain, and no dishonorable
way, for the relief and support of maimed Soldiers, and the Widows and Orphans
of men that dyed in the Service, to continue during the lives of the maimed,
and widows, and during the minority of their O^phans; And that the same
Commissioners (to be appointed in each County for Indemnity as aforesaid) or
others in like manner mixed, may be empowered for this purpose also; And in case
of the death of any such Commissioner, or their departure out of their
respective Counties, those that survive, or remain, may choose new ones to fill
up the number.

4. Thus for the Just freedom of Apprentices, who have served the Parliament,
there may be a sufficient penalty laid upon Masters refusing or delaying to
give the same, when their times are out, accounting the time they have served
in the war as part. And that the Apprentise may have his Action at law for that
penalty.

5. For freedom from impresting, that (as no freeman of England, may be
imprested for any foreign service, or other then for the immediate defense of
it, so) no soldier that has voluntarily served the Parliament in the late
War, for the liberties of the Kingdom, may be liable to be pressed, for any
Military service at all: and that it may be promised, that a Certificate of his
said service as a Voluntier, under the hand and seal of his Colonel, or other
Field Officer, under whom he has served, may be a sufficient Protection and
discharge to him, from any such impresting.

Having thus discharged our selves, in those matters which are our most proper,
and immediate business (the concernments of the Soldiery) and for which we
redouble our desires, that the two first (concerning the putting them into
constant pay while continued, and Provision for their Arreares) may be first
considered, and immediately settled before any other business, and then that
the rest of them may also be provided for, as soon as may be. Now though the two
first of these, want not their equal concernments to the Kingdom, (in the
present taking of the oppression of free quarter, preventing the increase of
Arrears, and providing or preparing for the more easy and satisfactory
disbanding of supernumeraries, and thereby the better easing of the Kingdoms
burdens by degrees) Yet we cannot in any of our addresses of this kind, so far
forget those things we have formerly declared concerning (more purely) the
public interest of the Kingdom and our selves, as members of it, but we must
herewith renew our humble and earnest desires, that no time may be lost by the
Parliament for the just consideration and dispatch of these things, both for
the redress of Common greivances, releife of the oppressed* and for the
liberty, security, quiet and some safe settlements of the Kingdom; and more
especially, that these things of this nature, expressed in the late Remonstrance
at the Rendezvous, may in such settlement be fully and effectually provided
for, (and that) with as much expedition as may be. And it is our hearts desire
and hope, that herein the proceedings and resolutions of the Parliament may be
such, and so timous, as that we may not need any more to remind the Parliament
in any of those things which (as far as with truth or any safety to that most
obliging interest of the public, and to those that have engaged for it, we
may forbear) we are most unwilling and take no pleasure to meddle in.

Windsor. 5. December. 1647. By the appointment of his Excellency, Sir Thomas
Fairfax, and the Council of the Army. John Rushworth Secretary.
