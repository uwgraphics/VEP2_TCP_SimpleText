Good and True, Fresh and New Christmas Carols

Now let true hearts together twine,
Where Modesty with mirth does join,
And let each Christian werry make
For Jesus Christ our Saviors sake,
And for the blessed Saints which died,
Who are in Heaven deify'd

Good and true, Fresh and New CHRISTMAS CAROLS.
A Caroll for Christmas day: To the tune of Troy Town.
THe glorious Son of Heaven is up,
cicering the clouds or ignorance,
And for to save our Souls from Hell,
which by old Adam was our chance;
True God, a Savior, Prophet, King,
From heaven being sent, good news did bring.
The holy Angel Gabriell came
to blessed Mary meek and mild,
Saying all hail, thou full of grace,
this day thou have conceived a child,
A Savior to all Mankind sure,
She said, I am a Virgin pure.
This virtuous Virgin was betrothed
to righteous Joseph at that time,
Who then perceiving other swell.
^ed think that she had done a crime:
To him the Angel Gabriell said,
Fear not thy wife, she is a pure Maid.
At that same time the Em^erour
great tares on his Subjects laid.
Man Woman, Child, where they were borne,
must travel, where it must be paid;
Joseph and Mary then forth went,
And many a weary step they spent.
At length to Bethelem they came,
being a Village that was poor,
Where as no bed was to be had,
the Innes as then could hold no more;
Within an Ore-stall she did lie,
And yet she took it patiently.
It pleased God that very morn,
time came, she should delivered be,
Where it did j^y her gentle heart,
her blessed Savior to see;
Now was she Mother, Wife, and Maid,
Who had the Laws of God obeyed,
No Midwives help she there could have,
no Swathing bands of Linen pure,
Nor dandling Nurses her to help,
yet she most patient did endure,
No golden Robe nor such like things,
Although he was the King of Kings.
His Cradle there a Manger was,
whereas the Ass and Ox did feed,
But there bright Angels did appear,
with harmony, as God decreed;
A glorious Star did then appear
To certain Shepherds that were near.
They wondering at this unknown Star,
at length from heaven a voice they heard,
Who bid them follow that same light,
and wished them not to be affeard;
Saying, in Bethelem this morn,
A Savior and a King is borne.
King Herod hearing of the same,
was vexed at heart most cruelly,
Who swore, all Children two years old,
or under, every one should dye;
And he his bloody Soldiers sent,
Lo murder each poor Innocent.
But God his malice to prevent,
an Angel did to Joseph send,
And bid him take his Wife and Babe,
and unto Ae^^ypt Land to w^nd;
Where seven long years they did remain,
Till Herod's ^^te by death was lane.
Thus have you heard our Saviors birth,
who for our wicked sins did dye,
For to redeem our souls from death,
to live with him eternally:
A joyful Christmas to all send,
And thus my Caroll I do end.
An other for Christmas day. To the tune of All you that are Good fellows.
ALl you that are good fellows,
come hearken to my Song,
I know you do not hate good cheer,
nor Liquor that is strong,
I hope there is none here,
but soon will rake my part,
Seeing my Master and my Dame,
says, welcome with their heart.
This is a time of ioyfulnesse,
and merry time of yecre,
When as the rich with plenty stored,
does make the poor good cheer;
Plum-poregde, Roast-beefe, and Minc'd-pies,
stands smoking on the board,
With other brave ^arieties,
our Master does afford.
Our Mistress and her cleanly Maids,
have neatly played the Cooks,
Me thinks these dishes eagerly
at my sharp stomach looks;
As though they were afraid,
to see me draw my Blade,
But I revenged on them will be,
until my stomack's stayed.
Come fill us o^ the strongest,
small drink is out of date,
Me thinks I shall fare like a Prince,
and ^it in gallant state;
This is no Mizers Feast,
although that things be dear,
God grant the Founder of this Feast,
each Christmas keep good cheer.
This day for Christ we celebrate,
who was borne at this time,
For which all Christians should rejoice,
and I do sing in Rhyme:
When you have given God thanks,
unto your dainties fall,
Heavens bless my Mass^^ and my Daine
Lord bless me, and you all.
A Caroll for Saint Stevens day. To the tune of, Wigmores Galliard.
I Think none here but they have heard
the malice of the Jews,
And ^ow the Saints of Jesus Christ
they did abuse and use;
This day for sweet Saint Stev^n sake
we now do celebrate,
Who did profess the faith of Christ,
for which they did him hate.
The Word of God so them he taught,
for which they did him kill,
Who like a Lamb he then did dye,
and never thought them ill;
One of Christ's followers was he,
and first that martir^d was
After our blessed Savior
did suffer on the Cross.
For they with great affliction
most vtidly did him use,
They said he sow^d sedition,
and therefore him accuse;
Unto a Stake they did him tie,
both arms and legs with cords,
Because he told them of their sins,
they gave him cruel words.
Like bloody cruel minded men,
at him they threw huge stones,
They brus^d his flesh, bear out his brains,
and breaks all his bones:
But ere he di'd, to heaven above
he lifted up his ties,
And prayed to God he would forgive
his cruel Enemies
An other merry Carrell, for the same day. To the tune of, Bonny sweet Rohin.
COme mad Boy^s, be glad Boys, for Christmas is here
And we shall be feasted with jolly good cheer
Then let us be merry, it is Saint S^e^^^s day,
Lets eat and drink free ly, here is nothing do pay.
My Master bids welcame, and so does my Dame,
And it is yonder smoking dish doch me instante,
Anon I Will be with you, though, you me, outface,
For now I do tell you I have time and place:
I Will troule the boule to you, them let it go^ round,
My heels are so light they can stand on no groad^d.
My congue it does chater. and goes pitter patter,
Heet's good cheer and strong beer, for I will not flatter.
And now for remembrance of blessed S. Stephen,
Let Us joy at morn^^^, at noone and at evening,
Then leave of your ^ineing and fall to mince pies
I pray take my counsel, be ruld by the wise.
A Caroll for Saint John's day. To the tune of, Flying fame:
John signifies the grace of God,
then unto God lets pray,
That he will still direct our paths
and guide us in his way,
John Baptized Christ in Jordan flood,
true baptism for to take,
And for to wash away our sins,
the old law to forsake.
Herod the King he married
his Brother Phillips wife,
Saint John rebuking him therefore,
it cost his dearest life,
He told them 'twas a deadly sin,
and that it was full evil,
Then Herod said he was possessed
by an infernal Devil,
And straight in Prison him he casts,
last bound in iron chain^s,
Where he in hunger, cold and ^oe,
a many days remains;
M^ane whi^^ the birth day of the King
it was solemnised,
But unto John it fatal was,
for then he lost his head.
Great banqueting and feasting then
prepared was that day,
And several sorts of music sweet
melodiously did play;
A dainty Damsel nearly danced.
which pleas^d the King so well,
Which ravished his senses so,
in love with her he sell.
Fair dame quoth he ask any thing,
of me thou shall it have;
An't p^^^se your Matesty (she said)
John Baptists head I crave;
Which he did grant, and then straight way
his head to her was brought,
In a large platter her to please,
such mischief then she wrought.
A merry Caroll for the same day. To the tune of, the Kings going to Bulleine.
COme bravely on my Masters,
For here we shall be tasters,
of curious dishes that are brave and fine,
Where they that d^e such cheer afford,
I Will lay my knife upon the board,
my master and my dame they dor not pine.
Who i^st will not be merry?
And sing down down aderry,
for now it is a time of joy and mirth,
It Is said, it is merry in the Hall
When as beards they do wa^ all,
Gods plen is here, it does not ^ew a death.
Let him take all liv^s longest,
Come fill us of (...),
and I will drink a health to honest John.
Come pray thee But^^r fill the bow^e,
And let it round the Table trole
when that is up I Will tell you more anon.
A Caroll for Innocents day. To the tune of, As at none Duleins rested.
GHis was the day when cruel Herod
heard that Jesus Christ was borne,
(A King, a Savior and a P^^^het)
in his Land did chinke it scorn;
Command did give
He should no^ live,
And more his malice to unfold,
Straight charge did give,
No Male should live
The which were under two years old.
His bloody Senidiers went to murde^
each poor filly Innocent,
But God in Heaven which all things sees,
did his malice ^ooue prevent;
An Angel there
Then did appear
To Joseph, and did him command,
With his dear Mate
And Baby straight,
With speed to fly to Egypt Land.
Now what great ferrour it was to Mothers
children sucking at their breast
Broody villains with their Poniards,
from their Mothers nipple wrest,
In pieces there
They did them tear,
And with their Swords they did them hew,
As it is expressed,
Among the rest,
King Herod's young son had his due.
A merry Caroll for the same day. To the tune of, the Spanish Pavin.
CAst care away, it is Holyday,
This is no time to work, but play,
With this good cheerd I Will make a fray,
and mean to fill my belly;
And quickly for to end the strife,
I with my spoone and with my knife,
Do mean to keep a heavy life,
I tell ye.
By er leave good Master and good Dame,
For this ^^^ent I h^ther came,
I see here is nothing out of frame,
and many than^es I give you,
I here am come as a bold Guest,
And know I me welcome to your Feast,
Whereas your love it is expressed
most freely.
And now my Friends and Neighbors all,
Your cheer and beer it is not small,
And bold'y to your victuals fall,
by leave, I give you warning;
I now will drink a full carouse
Unto the Owners of this house,
And for our foes care not a Louse;
nor farthing.
A Caroll for New-yeares day. To the tune of, Green Sleeves.
THe old year now away is fied,
The new year it is entered,
Then let us now our sins down tread,
and ioyfu^ly all appear,
Let^s merry be this Holyday,
And let us now both sport and play,
Hang sorrow, let us cast care away,
God send you a happy new year.
For Christ's Circumcision this day we keep,
Who for our sins did often weep,
His hands and feet were wounded deep,
and his blessed side with a Spear,
His head they crowned then with Thorn,
And at him they did laugh and scor^e,
Who for to save our Souls was borne,
God send us a merry new year.
And now with New-yeares Gifts each Friend,
Unto each other they do send,
God grant we may all our lives amend,
and that the truth may appear;
Now like the Snake cast off your skin
Of evil thoughts and wicked sin,
And to amend this new year begin.
God send us a merry new year.
And now let all the company
In secondly manner all agree,
For we are here welcome all may see
unto this folly good cheer;
I thank my Master and my Dame,
The which are founders of the same,
To eat to drink now is no shame,
God send us a merry new year.
Come Lads and Lasses every one,
Jack, Tom, Dick, Besse, Mary and Ione,
Lets cut the meat up unto the bone,
for welcome you need not fear,
And here for good liquor we shall not lack,
It will whet my brains and strengthen my back
This ioylly good cheer it must go to wrack,
God send us a merry new year.
Come give's more liquor when I do call,
I Will drink to each one in this Hall,
I hope that so loud I must not baule,
but unto me lend an ear;
Good fortune to n^y master send,
And to my dame which is our friend,
Lord bless us all, and so I end,
and God send us a happy new year.
A Caroll for Twelfe day. To the tune of, the Ladies fall.
Mark well my heavy doleful tale,
for Twelfe day now is come,
And now I must no longer ^ng,
and say no words but mum,
For I perforce must take my leave,
of all my dainty cheer,
Plum Porredge, Roast Beef, and Mine'd Pies,
my strong Ale and my Beer.
Kind hearted Christmas now adieu,
for I with thee must part,
And for to take my leave with thee,
does grieve me at the heart:
Thou were an ancient Housekeeper,
and mi^th with meat did keep,
But thou art going out of town,
which makes me for to weep.
God knows whether I again
thy merry face shall see,
Which to Good-fellowes and the Poor
that was so frank and free,
Thou lovedst pastime with thy heart
and eke good company;
Pray hold me up for fear I swound,
for I am like to dye.
Come Butler fill a Brin^ner full,
to cheer my fainting heart,
That to old Chrstmas I may drink,
before he does depart;
And let each one that is in this room,
with me likewise condole,
And for to cheer their spirits sad,
let each one drink a boule.
And when the same it has gone round,
then fall unto your cheer,
For you do know that Christmas time,
it comes but once a year;
But this good draught which I have drank,
has comforted my heart,
For I was very fearful that
my stomach would depart.
Thanks to my Master and my Dame,
that does such cheer afford,
God bless them, that each Christmas they
may furnish thus their board;
My stomach being come to me,
I mean to have a bout,
Intending to eat most heartily,
good friends I do not floute.
A merry Caroll for the same day. To the tune of, The Spanish Gypsies.
COme follow follow me,
Those that Good fellows be,
Into the Butterie,
Our manhood for to try,
The Master keeps a bounteous house
And gives leave freely to carouse.
Then wherefore should we fear,
Seeing here is store of cheer,
It shows but cowardice,
At this time to be nice,
Then boldly draw your blades and fight
For we shall have a merry night.
When we have done this fray,
Then we will go to play
At Cards, or else at D^ee,
And be rich in a trice;
Then let the kneves go^ round a pace,
I hope each time to have an Ac^.
Come Maids let us want no B^^re
After our Christmas cheer.
And I will only crave
Good Husbands you may have,
And that you may good houses keep,
Where we may drink carouses deep.
A^^ when that is speat the day.
Where Christmas Camb^ls play,
A^ Hotcochles beside,
And then go to All ^^de,
With many other pretty ^oyes,
Men, women, ^outhes, maids, girls, and b^yes.
Come less dance round the Hall,
And let us for liquor call,
Put Apples in the fire
Sweet Maids I you desire,
And let a Boule be spiced well,
Of nappy stuff that does excel.
Twelve days we now have spent
In mirth and merriment,
And daintily did fare,
For which we took no care,
But now I sadly call to mind
What days of sorrow are behind,
We must leave off to play,
To mo^^ow's working day,
According to each calling,
Each man must now be falling,
And ply his business all the year,
Next Christmas for to eat good cheer.
No^ of my Master kind
Good welcome I did find.
And of my loving Mistrife
This merry time of Christmas,
For which to them great thanks I give,
God grant they long together live.
A modest Caroll for any of the Twelve days, or to be sung at any time of the
year.

A Dozen of good Points I Will give,
The which will last you while you live.

Chearing each melancholy mind,
The which to sorrow is inclined.
