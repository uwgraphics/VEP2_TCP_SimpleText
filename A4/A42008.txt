A Lamentation Taken up for LONDON, THAT Late Flourishing CITY, a bitter, yea a
bitter Lamentation over all her Inhabitants yet living within and about her
Borders, and over all her Rulers and Mighty Men, who are Fled from her as from
a Murderer, with good Counsel and Advice, from the Spirit of the Lord to all,
that they may turn unto him before the Vials of his Wrath be poured out for
their utter Destruction.

A Lamentation taken up for London.
OH London, London, what Lamentation may I take up for Thee, who was of late a
flourishing City; whose Situation is by a pleasant River, thorough which great
Riches in abundance has been brought to thee, by which thy Inhabitants have
been made rich; thy Pomp and thy greatness, thy Excellency, and variety of
Treasures, has allured many to flock unto thee, from one end of the Nation to
the other; and many have counted themselves happy, that could get a convenient
Habitation in or about thy Borders: A City that was so joyous and counted a
place of delight, and a Palace for Princes, a meeting place for those called
the Nobility of the Land; unto thee has the Ambassadors from far Countries
resorted: Oh how is this City become solitary that was full of people, she is
now left as a widow of youth that was counted the pleasant place of the Nation,
and as a Princess in the Province, for how has thy great Men left thee, and
are fled as from a Monstrous woman; how are thy Inhabitants a dread to the
Country, because of the Plague that is broken out in thee; Oh my heart has
been in sorrow for thee, and a burden has layn upon me as concerning thee,
ever since the Lord began to manifest his displeasure against thee, even ever
since the Ship called the London was blown up, where more then 200. persons
were torn in pieces, whose Graves were in the Sea; this then was the cry of my
heart; saying, think ye they were greater sinners above all men? and this was
the answer from the Lord, Except they repent they shall likewise perish with a
mighty slaughter, though not in the same way. This was signified unto me by the
Spirit of the Lord when I was in his dreadful fear, overshadowed with his
Heavenly power, and I waited to see it effected, or a return to the Lord by
cealing from unrighteousness, which most of all I desired, that he might have
diverted his intended Judgments; But Oh how have thou dishonored his name, and
walked after thy own hearts lusts, as those that have forgotten the Lord days
without number, and have not humbled thy self before him, but have regarded
iniquity, and walked in cruelty, against the Lord and his poor people, and have
walked proudly, so that many of thy Inhabitants scarcely knew what to eat, or
to drink, or what to put on, and yet a professing people, having on you the
name of Christians, but are seen of all those whose eyes are open to be in the
nature of Heathens, Turks, or Infidels, who are not found in the nature of
Christ, who came not to destroy men's lives but to save them; but on the
contrary thy Rulers and Magistrates with their attendance, have been found
persecuting and imprisoning, knocking down, and wounding even some unto death a
peaceable people that fear the Lord, that he has raised up in these last days
to be as signs and wonders, whose residence and dwelling is amongst you; who
have but testified against unrighteousness, and assembled themselves together
as the ancient Christians in the days of old, who feared the Lord, and thought
upon his Name; and when all this Cruelty would not do nor bring them down, whom
God has raised up; then was invented in thee another way, thou did see thy
pomp and greatness would do thee no good while these people called Quakers were
among you, their Laws being diverse from thy Laws, their Worship to thy Worship;
then thou have concluded with the rest of the Rulers of the Land, even as Haman
who said, it is not for the Kings profit to let them live among us; then this
cruel Edict was invented in thy Borders to make such a Law as thou might be
sure to find these people transgressors of, that thou might say as those
unworthy Jews, who said, We have a Law, and by our Law Christ ought to die.
Oh this your Law will not excuse you before the Lord who sees your insides,
and will judge you according as your works are, not by the sight of the eye nor
by the hearing of the ear, but he will enter into righteous judgment with you,
for he is determined to plead with all flesh to bring down the haughty, and to
lay the lofty low; and for all thy transgressions and cruelties God is now
risen to plead with thee; for thou have been the womb in the which cruelty
without mercy has been conceived, thy Rulers with their Allies have been
examples to all cruel minded men thorough the Nation, therefore must thou drink
a bitter cup, and into thy hand has the Lord first put it; for when thou began
to banish (by that late devised Law) those people out of the Land that feared
the Lord, and durst not make shipwreck of their faith, and of a good conscience;
then did the Lord begin with thee, and poured out his Plagues upon very few, as
thou beganest first to banish two or three of the people of the Lord; Oh that
thou had considered and made a stop then of that woeful sin of Persecution,
but still thou would go on; and did send away seven more of the servants
of the Lord; and would not take notice of the increase of the Plague, but
still thou have hardened thy heart against Gods innocent people, and sent away
eight more, though still the Plague increased in thy borders; and as thou have
multiplied thy cruelty, so the Lord has caused his Plague to increase; and now
at last thou have by force carried near threescore of the servants of the Lord
both men and women on board, a Ship in order to their exilement, even into an
inconsiderable Vessel where is not convenience as becomes Christians; the Deck
being so low that they are fain to go double between the Decks, where they must
be forced to be and lodge, as if they were intended to be destroyed. And as thou
have sent near threescore more of the servants of the Lord away, so has his
Plague increased to near three thousand by the weekly bill; though it is judged
to be more; and by many of the Inhabitants of this City here is a cry, saying,
this is that which will increase the Plague; yet still were the hearts of thy
Rulers hardened against this innocent people: Well, they may all know the Lords
anger is not yet over, but his hand is stretched out still; for, as thou have
increased in cruelty, so has the Lord executed his righteous Judgments (and
will yet more and more) yet would thou go on like Pharaoh in the days of
old, though the first born was slain, yet he would pursue Israel into the Sea,
which became a Grave for him: Oh that thou would have taken notice of the
dealings of the Lord, and have ceased from all oppression and cruelty; that
those whom you have nothing against but as concerning the Law of their God,
might have lived peaceable amongst you, being such that loves peace, and can
learn war no more; yet they are assured the Lord will plead their cause, who is
their reward in the day of trial, and has and is with them in the hour of
temptation; Oh but thy Pride and wantonness and fullness of bread, thy
drunkenness, whoredoms, couzenings and cheatings, has so eaten thee up that
thou have not considered the most High rules in the Kingdoms of Men; for in
seeing thou could not see, and in hearing thou have not considered, but thy
heart has waxed fat thorough the abundance of thy Dilicacy; the voice of
Music, and the sound of the Organs thou have delighted in; but now instead
thereof, the voice of sorrow, weeping, and bitter Lamentation shall be heard in
thee, and none shall comfort thee, because thou have not regarded the
afflictions of the afflicted, but has added grief unto their sorrow: Oh, oh
the Lord has seen, the Almighty has taken notice, and is now risen to plead
with thee, and as thou have added affliction to the afflicted by drawing and
rending the people of the Lord from Prison where they have long lay'n to send
them by force into exile; so the Lord has increased thy Plagues, who would
have none of his counsel, neither regarded his reproofs in your hearts, but
have hardened your selves against Gods good spirit that has reproved you, (for
your good) but you have rushed into iniquity as a Horse into the battle, and
have not had so much understanding as Balaams Ass, who saw the Angel of the
Lord in the way, and those that have you have smote them more then three times,
who have warned you that you should not rise up against the Lord and his
people, but you have done despite unto the spirit of Grace, whereby you might
have been led into the way everlasting. Neither have you regarded the servants
of the most high God, which have been sent unto you from several places, who
have warned you and exhorted you, and beseeched you in the bowels of Gods love
that you would give over oppressing the innocent and persecuting the upright,
knowing that vengeance belongs to the Lord and he will repay it; and that those
might not suffer Persecution, Imprisonment, or Exilement, whom you have nothing
against, but as concerning the Law of their God; yet them nor their Testimony
has not been regarded, but they have been villified and derided of many, and
have been counted as those who have been telling of idle Tales.

Oh, but many may say, why do thou upbraid us in the day of Calamity, or tell
us of our Iniquities in this day of our sore Distress, to which I answer, I do
not upbraid you, but rather lay those things before you which you have been
guilty of, that you may consider the Mercy and Justice of the Lord, and look
back and ponder the long-suffering of the Almighty, and of the means of grace
that he has afforded thee, and of the Light that he has lighted thee withal,
and that thy Inhabitants might have been as his pleasant Children, and that now
whilst thou have a Day to live thou may return unto him with unfeigned
repentance, for they that repents and turns unto him, they shall find mercy:
Oh, but thy Priests and false Prophets have dealt deceitfully with thee, who
have said, Peace, peace, none evil shall come upon us; they have not discovered
the Iniquity to turn away thy Captivity, thy Prophets are become fools, and
thy spiritual Men mad, for thy breach is great like the Sea; and none of thy
Prophets can stay it, nor thy spiritual Men make it up, though they Prophecy
smooth things unto thee, and make Books to confess thy sins by, for the stoping
of this breach, and that you should return to the Lord; yet we see Those that
do depart from Iniquity, are made a prey on; and while they call for mercy,
they are oppressing the up-right; their Feet run swiftly to do evil, their
thoughts are thoughts of wickedness against Gods People, for which cause
Desolation and Destruction is in their path, the way of peace they know not,
there is no equity in their goings, they have made them crooked paths,
whosoever walks therein shall not find peace: Therefore Oh ye Inhabitants
of London, whether fled away, or yet remaining in her alive, return to the Lord
with all your hearts, and know his fear placed in you, and take up with me a
bitter Lamentation; And as for you that are fled from the City, and have left
your outward Dwellings, think not that ye are safe or secure, for the Lord can
find you out at his pleasure, for the destroying Angel goes forth according
to the determination of the Lord, and neither Hill nor Mountain can cover or
hide you from his anger and fierce wrath, nor from the stroke of his Hand there
is none can fly, though thou fly upon the swift, a swifter shall overtake thee,
thy Riches cannot save thee, nor thy Strength deliver thee, neither can the
Clifts of the Rocks hide thee from the Lord, who turns a fruitful Land into
a barren Wilderness, because of the wickedness that is committed therein; and
you that are yet Inhabitants in this City, and cannot well go out of it, fear
ye the living God, and wait to feel his Power in your Hearts to break down the
man of Sin, that Christ the Power of God may be known to rule in you, and to be
a Leader unto you who is the Teacher, which shall never be removed into a
Corner, as others are, who are made after a Carnal Commandment; but he after
the power of an endless life, who is the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,
whose right it is to Rule for ever and ever. And Nations shall walk in his
Light, and Kings shall bring their Glory unto him. Therefore every one return
unto the Lord by ceasing to do Iniquity, and lay aside all Cruelty and
Oppression, release the too long oppressed Ones, and let the Prisoners go free,
who suffer upon the Account of tender Conscience toward God, or else in vain
is all thy formed and framed humiliations and fastings confessing iniquity and
hanging down the Head like a Bull-rush for a day; this is not the Fast that the
Lord has chosen while you take not off the heavy burdens, neither let the
oppressed go free, for if this was done, then would the hearts of the upright
be enlarged to the Lord on your behalf, and their Mouths opened to Cry to the
Almighty, to stay his Judgments and to retain his Fury, which begins to burn as
an Oven, which your wickedness has procured; Oh let my Counsel be accepted,
and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thy iniquities by showing mercy to
the poor, if it may be, that the Lord may have mercy on thee and lengthen thy
tranquillity, but if thou like Pharaoh hardens thy heart, and repent not by
turning speedily to the Lord, thou shall be left as a Widow, and thy
Babilonish Merchants that have made themselves rich in thee, shall run afar off
thee, Crying, Alas, alas, that great City where many were made rich, now is
her torment come on a sudden, and they themselves shall not escape, though they
have cried peace, peace, when Death was coming in at the Door to cut off thy
young Men from without, and thy Children from the streets; Therefore, all you
that is living in fleshly Tabernacles, that belongs to this great City, whether
in it or fled away, this to you I send, expecting that many of you that are
gone, may never see this City again, that now you may, be seeking a City and
dwelling place whose foundation is the Lord, and this you may know if you
return to the Spirit of the Lord, which tries all things, and wait to know it
to be your Leader, then will it witness to your Spirits that you are the
Children of God; so that then, if you eat the bread of adversity, and drink the
water of affliction, and in the world ye have great trouble yet shall you live
in the peace of God, and die in his favor that your end may be blessed; But,
if you follow them that teach for Doctrines the commandments of men, and obey
not the pure spirit of the Lord, then will God give over striving with you; and
then everlasting sorrow and woe will be your portion, and he shall say as to
Ephraim, let him alone, let him alone; so thy time is almost out and the long
suffering of the Lord is near an end to this Generation; Therefore none be
stout hearted, but fear and tremble all careless ones, before the living God,
for the slain of the Lord shall be many, and with a strong hand is he going
forth and none can hinder his purpose; but as all return and humble themselves
as the people of Niniveb from the greatest unto the least, for then did the
Lord stay his hand and did
