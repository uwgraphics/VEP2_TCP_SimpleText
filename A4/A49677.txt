THE late Duke of Monmouth's Lamentation.
The Tune of, On the Bank of a River, Or; Now now the Fights done.


THe World is ungrateful
the People deceitful,
Ambition and Pride our first Parents did choke
it leads to high places
as Slip'ry as Glasses,
Their gilded pretenses all vanish like smoke.
Their fatal delusion
Brought me to confusion
I fall by those Powers I did justly provoke.
Those Men of Sedition
that nursed my Ambition
And soothed up my Fancy with hopes of a Crown
their fares are depending*
and must have an Ending,
It Is they ruined me and my former renown
Seducers of Reason
Made me commit Treason
For which on the Block I lay my head down.
My Grief I discover
For those I brought over,
And those in this Land I seduced to the Sin
true Churchmen denied me
the Gentry defyd me,
With none but the Factious I favor did win
this sorrowful sentence
brings me to Repentance
Unfortunate Monmouth this Act to begin.
The Second Part,
To the same Tune.
THus my Allegiance was all disobedience
the King of the West in those Parts they me call,
Each Village and City
was spoiled without Pity,
The Kings better Subjects I brought into Thrall:
But now such vile doing
has caused my ruin
My Pride and Ambition must now have a Fall.
The popular Babble
and noise of the Rabble,
It pleased meat first and did Nourish the Vice
'Twas Pride and Vainglory
did furnish the Story
And gave to my after proceedings the Rise
while that I did aspire
to fly higher and higher,
Like the generous Bird I was snared in a trice.
All did me admire
naught I could require,
But the Royal Bounty did freely allow
was of Royal standing
had all at commanding
And men of the highest Rank to me did bow
but Iv'e taken ill measures
and lost all those Treasures
Poor Monmouth's thy Case is altered now.
Ambition cannot borrow
One day, e're to morrow
Poor Monmouth must lie in the silent dark Grave:
let his sad conclusion
be Traitors Confusion
And dash them to Pieces as Rocks do the Waves,
take warning you Traitors
and all you Crown Haitors
Your cunning designs your Heads shall not save.
