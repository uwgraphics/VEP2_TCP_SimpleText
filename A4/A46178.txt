DIEV ET MON DROIT

BY THE Lord Lieutenant AND COUNCIL.
ESSEX.

WHEREAS the Farmers of his Majesty's Revenue (being the persons and Officers
duly Authorized by themselves, Substitutes, Agents, or Servants, for the
Receiving, Collecting and Answering the Duty ariseing by Hearths, Fireing
Places and stoves, etc.) have Complained to Us, that they are deprived of a
considerable part of the said duties by Certificates unduely granted by the
Justices of the Peace, unto several persons, who by the Acts for settling the
said Duty on his Majesty, are uncapeavle thereof; And whereas in the first Act
for settling the said Revenue, there is a Proviso Contai^^d, That in case any
Two Justices of the Peace, shall in writing under their hands, yearly Certify
their belief, that the House wherein any person does inhabit with such County
wherein they are Justices of Peace, is not of Greater value than Eight
shillings per Annum: upon the full Improved Rent, and that neither the person
so inhabiting, nor any other useing the same Message, has, uses or occupies
any Lands or Tenements of their own, or others, of the yearly value of Eight
shillings Per Annum: nor has any Lands, Tenements, Goods, or Chattell, of the
value of four pounds in their own Possession, or in the Possession of any
other in trust for them, then in such Case upon such Certificate made to the
Justices of the Peace of such County, at any of their Quarter Sessions to be
held for the same County, and allowed by them, for which Certificate and
allowance no Fees shall be paid, the person on whose behalf such Certificate,
made, shall not be returned by the Constables or other persons to be Assistant
to them as aforesaid, and the said house is thereby for that year discharged of
and from all Duties, by this Act Imposed, any thing therein Contained to the
Contrary notwithstanding: Which said last Provisoe by the Additionall Art for
the better ordering and Collecting the Revenue ariseing by Hearth-money is
declared shall be Construed, to Extend only to such Widows as shall Produce
such Certificates as are therein mentioned, and as to all other persons
whatsoever, the said Clause is thereby absolutely Repealed. And We being
Informed that Certificates have been lately Granted by several Justices of the
Peace for freeing persons from payment of the said Duty which have not been
Either allowed at the Quarter sessions, or Warranted by the said Acts. Yet
under Color thereof many persons have pretended to be freed from payment of
the said Duty, who by Law are Liable thereunto, and if such Certificates, so
unwarrantably Granted have not been allowed by the said Farmers Officers, they
have been Indicted, and prosecuted thereupon, and thereby put to Great Costs,
and Charges, and hindered from Levying what is Justly due to his Majesty by the
said Acts. And forasmuch as it is Enatted by the said Additionall Act, that it
shall and may be Lawful for the Lord Lieutenant; Lord, Deputy, or other
Chief Governor, and Council etc. to appoint such persons as they shall think
fit, to do, Execute and perform all, and Every the matters, and things which
by the said former Act, or this present Act, are to be done, Executed or
performed by any Justice of the peace or Clerks of the Peace of this Kingdom
