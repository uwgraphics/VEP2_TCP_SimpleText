have thought it convenient and necessary to prorogue the said Parliament until
the One and twentieth day of July next, We do therefore will and require all
persons to whom it does or shall appertain, to take due notice thereof, to the
end that in the mean time they may repair to their Houses, or otherwise apply
themselves about their private Affairs at their pleasures, and then to give
their attendance here again at the day and time aforesaid in the usual place
appointed for that intended Service, whereof they may not fail.
