A FULL ACCOUNT OF A Terrible and Bloody FIGHT, BETWEEN The Dutch and English
Forces in Flanders, against the French; with a particular Relation of a Great
and Singular Victory obtained over the French.
LETTERS from Brussels of the 23 d. of May, Old Style, gives this particular
Account; That the French having drawn together a Body of about 15000 Men,
between Mabuege and Bouchian, were Attaqued by a Body of the Confederate
Troops, consisting of 12000 Men, under the Command of Count Waldick; That the
Victory was very uncertain, both behaving themselves very Courageously, till a
fresh Body of 4000 Brandinburgh Horse Advancing, fell upon the Rear of the
French, putting them into great Confusion by breaking their Ranks -- -- The
Damage of the French Party were very considerable, having lost near 5000 Men,
who were Killed upon the Spot, besides several that were made Prisoners of War.
-- -- The Confederates lost not half the Number of Men, but keeping the Field,
made themselves Masters of a great Booty -- --.

They further add, that by Letters from Rotterdam, they received the Advice of
the Arrival of the Earl of Malebourgh, Lieutenant General of His Majesty's
Forces of Great Britain, who had Ordered Nine Battalions of English to be in
Readiness, and 'twas believed, they would take the Field in three or four days.
-- -- And some are of Opinion, they with their Troops will this Season, make an
Incursion into the French Territories. They further say, that the Flat-boats
lying there, would be ready in some few days to set Sail, with what Sweedish
Troops are to Complete the Horse now in England; so that in few days they may
be expected here, in order to give their help toward the Reducing of the Irish
Rebels, who are now the chief Support of the French King's declining Cause.
