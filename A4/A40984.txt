Father Peter's Policy Discoverevd: Or, the Prince of Wales Pro'd a Popish
Perkin.
IN Rome there is a most fearful Rout,
And what do you think it is about,
Because the Birth of the Babe's come out:
Sing lulla by Babee, by, by, by.
The Jesuits swear the Midwife told tales,
And ruined His Highness the Prince of Wales;
She Is a Jade for her pains, Cutsplutter-anails:
Sing lulla, etc.
The Popish Crew did all protest,
That twenty great Men would swear at least,
They see His Welsh Highness creep out of his Nest:
Sing lulla, etc.
The Goggle-ey'd Monster in the Tower,
He peeped at his Birth for above an hour,
And 'twas a true Prince of Wales he Swore:
Sing lulla, etc.
Another great Lord, both Grave and Wise,
Stood peeping between Her Majesty's Thighs;
He looked through a Glass for to save his Eyes;
Sing lulla, etc.
Both were so well satisfied,
They knew the sweet Babe from a thousand they cried;
'Twas Born with the Print of a Tile on his side:
Sing lulla, etc.
Some say it is a Prince of Wales by Right,
And those that deny it it is out of Spite;
But God send the Mother came honestly by it:
Sing lulla, etc.
Some Priest, they say, crept nigh her Honor,
And sprinkled some good Holy Water upon her,
Which made her conceive of what has undone her:
Sing lulla, etc.
The Papists thought themselves greatly blessed,
Before the young Babe was brought to the Test;
But now they call Peter's a Fool of a Priest:
Ting lulla, etc.
The Priests in order to fly to the Pope,
Are got on Board on the Foreign Hope,
For all that stay here will be sure of a Rope:
Sing lulla by Babee, by, by, by.
