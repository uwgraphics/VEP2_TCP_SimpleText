To the READER.
Reader,
IN times past, in the night of ignorance, when men groped in the dark as
blind men, since the Apostles days; and out of thick darkness have spoke
darkly of the things of God and of his Kingdom, and written many things about
the things of God, and of his Kingdom, which has fed the dark mynds of many
who are unconverted unto God: And seeing how many people are confused in their
minds, and err in judgment, and have lost the key of knowledge which should
give an entrance into the mystery of Gods kingdom, and open their hearts;
Therefore in compassion unto them who are thirsting after the Lord to find
him, these few things I was moved to write for the sakes of those who have no
place to rest in or upon, to the intent that all may wait in that, through
which God reveals his mind, and manifests his true knowledge in man: and these
things that I have written, as they were revealed to me, and in me by his pure
Spirit. If thou wait in the manifestation of the Spirit; these things thou will
see to be truth, though hid and veiled from the world that lies in wickedness,
as thou comes out of its nature. I have not written for to please men of
corrupt minds, who glory in words and outward appearances, and glory in
natural parts, and in sounds, and are erred from the life; but to the
simple-hearted, and for the strengthening of the weak, and for the
understanding of the simple; and that which thou see in the following
discourse, which thou can not close with, let it alone, and judge nothing
before the time, in thy wisdom which is earthly, or in thy reason, but in
that; and to that of God in thee, I desire to be approved, and to nothing ^lse,
and shall be made manifest in the day of the Lord which is dawning in the world
and many have seen it to appear in power and glory; wait thou in thy own
particular, that thou may f^ele thy own condition, and see thy own state* and
that which lets thee see thy own condition, will let thee see the Lord, and
what I have declared of him to be true.

I am thy friend in truth, and wishes good to all men, F. H.

THe Lord God of the whole earth, who lives for ever, even the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac and Jacob, whose Throne is established in righteousness for
ever; who rides upon the heavens, and shines forth in his eternal excellency,
from the firmament of his power; he is manifesting himself in his power, as in
the days of old, and revealing his righteousness as in the years past, and
pouring forth his spirit upon his sons and daughters, according to his promise,
and they that believe, comes to be made partakers of the blessing of the
everlasting Hills, even the Lord, who appeared at Sinai, unto Moses his servant
in the bush, who rose up from mount Seir, and shined forth in his brightness
from mount Paran, and came with ten thousands of his Saints, even he, from
whose right hand went a fiery Law; so that the people could not behold his
glory: the same is he who has now appeared in this the day of his power, and
is appearing, whose glory shall dazel the eyes of the world; whose brightness
shall make dim all the worlds glory, and stain its wisdom, and shut it up in
utter darkness, that it shall not a^pear to have any existance or being, and
the shadow of death shall fly away, and all the haughty and lofty Princes of
this world shall be horribly afraid; the beasts shall go into their dens when
the day appears, and the Lambs of the everlasting fold shall come forth and be
fed in the fat valleys, where the springs of life compasses about all the
banks, and rejoice in their shepherd, and shall say, The Lord is my shepherd,
which many at this time does admire and say, What has the Lord wrought? who
have seen his wonders in the days of old, and have seen his noble acts, which
the fathers have told of, who are fallen asleep, and are at rest in the Lord:
and now many is God bringing to see their witness to be true, and to have the
same fulfilled in themselves; honor and praise unto him for ever, who is the
stay and strength of all his people for ever. And the day of the Lord is
broken, and the light has appeared that manifests all things which are
reproveable; and the day star is arisen in the hearts of many, and they are
come to see that fulfilled in their hearts, which Peter exhorted them to wait
for, and to take heed unto the sure word of prophecy, until the day appeared,
and did dawn in their hearts; which day when it appears, and to whom it
appears, discovers all things and makes all things manifest, as it is
declared by the Spirit of truth, in the Scripture of truth, and every man's work
shall be tried of what sort it is, and of what nature it is; and this day has
appeared to many, praises to the Lord, who have waited for it, and now they see
every thing in its ground and rise; and every tree and fruit is seen according
to its kind, whether good or bad, and every man's works is obvious to every one,
who are in the day, and upon whom the morning of righteousness has appeared,
and the Sun of righteousness has shined upon, whereby that is seen in every
one (by the light which is truly called day, by the Lord who causes it to
spring from on high) which is reproveable and condemnable, and also whatever is
justifiable and unreproveable, is seen by the day of the Lord appearing in the
heart.

The day of the Lord, what it is, and to whom it has appeared, discovered, and
how it is seen.
GOd is a spirit, his day is spiritual, and is seen with a spiritual eye, its
pure light, pure brightness, the pure shining forth of the Lord in his glorious
excellency, the pure shining forth of eternity, life putting forth it self in
its brightness, holiness sheding it self abroad in its glory, purity, spreading
it self in its immeasurable excellency, and can only be seen as it is in it
self, by the children of the light that are born of it: there is a natural day,
there is a spiritual day, the natural day receives its brightness from the Son,
the spiritual day receives it brightness from the Son of righteousness, by whom
its brought forth; without whom nothing was made, or is made, or brought forth
but by him who is the fountain of life; and as the natural day receives its
clearness from the natural Sun, and is discerned by the natural eye of a
natural man, and all things natural are seen and discovered by and in the
natural day, and are perspicuous and obvious to him that has his natural
sight; even so, from the Sun of righteousness, the Lord of glory, light and
purity; the day of God receives its brightness, and is issued out from him by
the rays of his brightness, and is discerned and seen only by the spiritual eye
of the spiritual man, who is the Image of the father brought forth in life, and
in his own nature and quality; (that is to say) from God the Father of life, by
Christ Jesus the life of men, the light of the world; and this is the birth
which is born from above, which is of the nature of the Father and the Sun, and
of the day, and he only comes to behold this day, and discerns all things of
the fathers kingdom by it, and likewise discerns all the hidden things of
dishonesty, and the works of darkness which is brought forth by the Prince of
darkness, who is shut up in eternal and utter darkness, which is his dwelling
place for ever, which is his residence, and shall be the residence of all the
workers of iniquity that bear his Image for ever.

Obj. But some may be ready to say, It is not yet appeared, and all things are
not yet made manifest, and that day is not yet come, neither has appeard in
this age to any.

Answ. What if a man that is naturally blind say, that there is no light in the
day, nor in the Sun, because he sees none; is therefore there no light in the
day, nor in the Sun? And what if all things be alike unto him, day and night,
so that he can distinguish nothing, does this therefore make void their seeing,
who do see with the natural eye, both the Sun and the day, and hinder them from
distinguishment or discerning? And what if they who are spiritually blind, and
are children of the night, say they see nothing, nor beholds nothing of the day
of the Lord, or of the discovery of the things of God, or of his glo^ious
appearance, which many witness; does this therefore make their sight void, or
discovery of the things void to them who have seen into the things that be of
God^ kingdom? the unbelief of some, does not make the faith of them that do
believe void, God forbid.

What the day of the Lord is, and what it will be to the wicked, declared.
AS I have said, though the day of the Lord be pure light and brightness in it
self, and mixeth not with the night, which is of a contrary nature, because the
Lord in the beginning separated them, and set a decree which will last unto all
perpetuity, and that which limited the bounds and circumferen^e the^eof now is
the same: I say, though the day of the Lord be pure, and keeps its purity, and
property, and nature, and is still one and the same in it sel^; (for nothing
can alter its purity) yet it is a day of blackness and gloominess, and a
notable terrible day unto the wicked, who hates its appearance, and hates the
light; children of falsehood and of deceit, whose deeds be evil, it makes them
and their deeds manifest; there it is unto them, as it is written in a certain
place, The eye lids of the morning are unto them as the shadow of death; the
appearance of the Lord affrights them, and they would run from it as a thief
that diggeth through a wall, and breaks open a house in the night when deep
sl^ep is upon men, but when the day appears, that discovers his actions, he is
afraid, because he will then, (if he stay there) be seen; and all that live
wantonly upon earth, whose hearts are set to seek after wickedness as for hid
treasure; the day of the Lord will steal upon such as a thief, and will come as
upon a thief, and they being children of the night, and bringing forth the
fruits of darkness, contrary to the light, they will have their portion in
utter darkness, and eternal vengeance will compass them as a wall, and fury as
a fi^e that devoureth all the fuel, so shall the ungodly perish, and have
their portion with hypocrites.

Think on this all you raylers, and revilers of the light, and of the
appearance of God, and repent; for as ^^e wild ass that snuffs up the wind,
and they that seeks will not weary themselves with her, yet a time comes when
she may be found and taken: Even so all the ungodly, though they may run as a
wild Ass, and traverse their way as a Dromedary; yet the month comes, and
the day comes they will be overtaken in the midst of security, and they shall
not escape: And though the children of this world, and teachers of this world,
and professors of this world, who profess the Scriptures, have prayed for the
day of the Lord; yet when it comes, it will be as hot burning fire, as
devouring fire, and they will fall as stubble, and as burnt mountains before
it, and will not be able to abide; for as I said, whatsoever is reproveable, is
manifest by the day, the light, which is eternal, in which God appears; and it
shall appear even to the wicked, to the ungodly, they shall be made manifest;
that which is manifest, is not hid, but seen, and brought to light, and
beholden: So all you hirelings, who preach for hire, and you people that love
to have it so, you shall not be hid; all gainsayers of the truth, you shall be
found out, all shall be convinced of their ungodly deeds, and hard speeches,
and that which makes your deeds manifest will be the day, and that will
convince you; for even the wicked shall see his appearance, although to
condemnation, shame, and contempt, They shall see him whom they have pierced:
And know further, even in the wicked God has a witness, which is pure, which
checketh often, though they heed it not, because the God of the world has
blinded their eyes; yet when Christ the life shall appear, he will make that
see in the wicked which they have put out, and the God of the world has
blinded; yet he by his power will open even the eyes of the wicked, and they
shall see him and his coming in dread; and his pure appearance, which shall
make them horribly afraid, and his day and appearance will be to their sorrow:
Although they would not see, yet they shall be made to see, and to hear that
which they would not hear, when God sounds his Trumpet, to give warning to
all; that the dead both small and great may arise, some unto everlasting life,
and some unto shame and everlasting contempt. All that has hated his
appearance shall see, though they would not; Put not this far away, all
deceitful workers, drunkards, liars, swearers, whores, and whoremongers,
adulterers, idolaters, who worship your own imaginations; and all raylers,
mockers, and proud wanton disdainful people that live in wantonness and
pleasure, time-servers, flatterers, men-pleasers, cursed speakers, vain
talkers, foolish jesters, fiecre despisers of those that are good, who are come
out of the pollution that you wallow in; his appearance will be to their joy,
but to your shame and eternal misery, except you speedily repent.

What the day of the Lord is to the righteous, and how be appears to them, and
whether any are to look for it while in the body; resolved.
THe appearance of God who is eternal life, in his day, in his immeasurable
light, a great joy and rejoicing to the righteous; for there they come to
behold him who is unto his people an everlasting light, and in his light they
come to see light; and in his day he reveals the secret mysteries of his
kingdom in them, who see his day appear in their hearts, which makes all
things manifest, even the secrets of the Lord, and his hidden treasure, and his
durable riches which never cankers nor rusts, but is fresh, and keeps its pure
image and impression, and is still the same; by which all the righteous who
have waited for Gods appearance, comes to see him and his riches, as it is
written, This is he we have waited for, let us rejoice and be exceeding glad;
why? what is he come that you have waited for? yea, come, and his reward is
with him; and they that see him come find contentment in him, and in his
reward; and what is the reward? joy, gladness, peace of conscience, assurance
of Gods love sealed in their hearts by the pure Spirit of the Lord, the streams
of life flowing forth continually from the great deep, which refreshes and
keeps cool in the greatest extremity and heat temptation; and this is enjoyed
by them that have waited, and do wait for it even in the body; they bare
witness of him and of his coming, the Disciples; what was their witness? The
Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding: Of what? of God, of his
day, of his appearance, of his power, of his wisdom, of his kingdom, of hope,
of faith, of assurance, of peace, of joy, of comfort and consolation: what in
this life? yea, a cloud of witnesses I might bring in former ages, and a cloud
of witnesses I might bring in this age, blessed be the Lord; But my witness is
nearer me, that gives me assurance, and is surer to me then all their
witnesses, although they be all true: Abraham the Father of the faithful, and
of the righteous, who believed God, and was accepted; he saw Christ's day, and
was glad. Say literal professors, that is by faith; yea what else? by faith he
and all that ever saw Christ and his day, or the Father, they saw him by faith;
By faith they saw him who was invisible. Isa. 12.2. Behold God is my salvation,
he also is become my salvation; what, do thou enjoy it already? yea, he is
become: And Simon who waited for the consolation of Israel, Luke 2.30. Now let
thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation. And this he
said, who knew Gods comfort and consolation; as our suffering for Christ does
abound, even our consolation in Christ does much more abound; and they were
made partakers of his Divine nature, and sat together in heavenly places in
Christ Jesus. For heaven is his Throne, and they that are in him, and enjoys
him, who is the power of God, and the wisdom of God, knows peace, and rest,
and salvation both from guilt and act of sin; And the Apostle wrote to the
Hebrews; After he had purged away our sins (speaking of the atonement) the
everlasting high Priest, he sat down on the right hand on the Majesty on
high. He saw beyond sin even him who had purged away sin; and this comes to be
made manifest unto them, and in them that believe by the Spirit of Jesus who is
Christ the Lord, the arm that brings salvation; and is the author of eternal
salvation unto all them that believe, who begins it in his day, and perfecteth
it in his day; for he works in the day, as he himself said, Hitherto my father
works, and I work; but the night comes when none can work. So that he
destroys the work of the Devil, which is his work in man; which they that are
come to his day feels and sees the handiwork of God in themselves, and his
own works praise him, for they only can; and they that are not come to the
day knows not Gods work in themselves, and they who have not yet heeded that in
themselves, which manifests all things reproveable; neither that which does
reprove they are not come to know; the appearance of the glimmering of light,
or of the day yet in themselves, which the Saints witness in them, even all
they that are sanctified.

Where the day of the Lord does appear, and how it comes, and how it is to be
looked for, declared.
THey that gaze abroad, whose eyes are abroad, cannot see his appearance, nor
his day which appears. He that knows not wherein it consists, knows not how
to look for it, no more then the Jews who were Scripture-professors, and
learned men knew, wherein the kingdom of God did consist; Even no more do the
litteral professors, whose faith is founded on the Letter, and upon that which
is visible, knows what I say. First, all must know wherein it does consist. It
is eternal brightness shed abroad through all things, which pierces
through, and searches the secretest place, even that which is invisible, and
makes manifest all things; and the nature of every thing by the day of the
Lord comes to be seen, and it appears in the heart; they were to wait for the
day to dawn, and to break forth in their hearts, and to wait for its appearance
there; and that is it which is to be waited for and upon; that which makes
evil manifest, and brings it to light, and declares against that which is
contrary to its nature, and so the day comes to dawn. Christ the covenant of
light, Gods gift, who is sent and anointed of God to preach, and to proclaim
the acceptable year of the Lord, and also the day of vengeance. He proclaims in
the heart; for he comes not to bring peace, but a sword, and his sword is the
sword of the Spirit, it is that which divides and discerns the intent of the
heart; and his day discovers the desperate wickedness of the heart. And where
he finds no faith in the heart, he kindles a fire in the earthly heart, and
executes his vengeance: And his day unto such is a day of great perplexity,
their spirits comes to be wounded, the heart comes to be made faint, and sorrow
comes to fill their hearts, and trouble to be felt; and in this state are all
in, who are unconverted, he finds no faith, no hope in the heart, therefore he
comes and takes away peace. Many has talked of the day of the Lord; but when
it comes to draw near them, they will not abide it. Whatsoever makes manifest
is light. Now the day makes all things in every one manifest; and when deceit
is seen, and wickedness brought to light, then they that have done evil
cannot abide, but would run to any thing, rather then abide the day, or to see
the Lord of life appear in his day to execute vengeance upon his enemies, and
to destroy his adversaries; and to kindle an unquenchable fire to consume all
his enemies: And who has not seen this yet in themselves, never has seen the
day of salvation, nor of gladness; and this made the Prophet cry out, Who may
abide the day of his coming? And many have been eyewitnesses of the dreadful
day of the Lord which has appeared, wherein all peace has been hid from their
eyes; and all that ever came to see the day of joy and gladness, first did
know the terror and terrible day of the Lord in themselves: Therefore said the
Apostle, We knowing the terror of the Lord, do persuade men. Now it comes
not with observation; lo here, or there: So the Pharisees looked the Kingdom
should come, when Christ told them it was within them. So say I, if ever any do
behold the bright shining forth of eternal life, thou must wait in that which
is pure of God, through which he will manifest his day, and his power in his
day in thee; as thou keep in thy mind to that which manifests unto thee
evil, and shows thee good, thou will see how it appears. Even as the light
shines from the East unto the West, so is the coming of the day of the Lord.
And the eye which is spiritual sees it, and the power and the glory of the Lord
comes to to be seen in the day which is pure and spiritual in the heart; and
the eye which is pure, does behold when it comes, where it comes, and how it
comes, and it is hid from Vulterous eyes, and from their eyes which are full of
adultery, and cannot cease from sin. Now the day of the Lord comes not where
the carnal mind may imagine, nor when: Man will neither according to the
carnal desire of the carnal heart, neither according to the evil eye that
looks out, can it be seen, but it is seen in Gods own light, and by the measure
of Gods holy spirit. And as the day of the Lord is a mystery, the spirit of
the Lord is the only discoverer of it; None knows the things of God, but by
the Spirit of God; and the day of the Lord and his bright shining forth in the
heart of man, is one of the glorious things of God, which only the spirit of
God does give the knowledge of to man, and in man, and not the letter, nor the
Scripture; for the Jews had the letter, and they had neither heard Gods voice
at anytime, neither ever did see his shape, neither did they see the day of the
Lord, nor the power, neither in a word, did see or perceive God or any of the
mysteries of Gods Kingdom at all, but dreamed, imagined, thought and conceived
of things in their minds, their foolish hearts being darkened, for the further
a man draws from the light, his heart comes to be more dark, and their
understanding closed up, and shut up, that they cannot behold the Lord, neither
his glory, which is revealed only by Gods holy spirit, which spirit is near
man, though he see it not.

What the spirit of the Lord is, and how it comes to be received, which
discovers the things of God.
THe Spirit of the Lord is pure, holy, equal, purity it self, holiness it self,
equity it self, and is one with the Father and the Son, The Father, the Word
and the Spirit is one, its life, its pure power, pure strength, purity it self,
which mixeth not, neither joineth to any thing but that which is of its own
nature; its an immeasurable pure substance, its life issued forth, an active
living power, and is everlasting, alters not, changes not, keeps its holiness,
its purity for ever, it is unsearchable, unfathomable, undeclarable; words are
all too short, too narrow, to declare its excellency and glory, but only as it
makes it self out to them that believe, and opens it self, and sheds it self
abroad in them that wait upon it; it is revealed in its own purity, manifest in
its own power, and received in its own light, felt in its own virtue, the
living father of life himself is manifest by it, and appears in his power,
majesty and excellency through it, to man and to the sons of men, to the
righteous and unrighteous, to godly and ungodly, to the upright, and to the
deceitful, to the children of darkness, and to the children of light, that
which searches the heart of man, and sees through all things, and makes
manifest all things, even the hidden things of God, and the secret works of
darkness, and reproves for all evil, all iniquity; that is the pure act of the
spirit, which convinces every man, and as the creature comes to join to it, it
arises and shines forth more clearly, and makes it self known in its power and
operation, its power comes to be felt, it checks and reproves, judges and
condemns all actions which is done and past, and brings them to the creatures
remembrance; and as it is waited upon and hearkened unto, it sheds it self
abroad in its own pure brightness, and brings all things to light, even all
the deeds of darkness, and makes manifest the intents of the mind, and
manifests all things reproveable: Now as there is a waiting upon the pure
appearance of it, and the mind be still and quiet, and calm, the creature comes
to feel and sensibly know his own condition, he sees his mind is alive to other
things and other lovers, and not to God, and so he sees himself dead to the
things of Gods kingdom, and in the loss, and in the fall, and in the
transgression; now this which shows the vain motions and vain thoughts, and
checketh them, is an operation of the spirit, and purity comes to be felt
working in the heart, and as it is loved and obeyed, it leads and converteth
the heart to the Lord, and draws toward its self, out of unholiness, and
from under the dark power, and brings that under, and so it arises in its
strength as it is believed in and waited upon, and judges and condemns for all
evil, for it is the discoverer of the mind of the Lord to the sons of men; or
the Father by it makes known his mind to and in the creature, and does discover
the things that be eternal in their true property and nature (which only they
that have the spirit, and have received it, and are brought out of the
sensuality comes to discern him, who is invisible, and the things that belongs
to everlasting happiness, which is not seen by a natural eye, neither received
by the spirit of the world, who never received the things of God, neither the
testimony of them who were in the life. Now all that comes to receive it (that
is to say) the spirit of truth must wait in that which is pure, unto which it
joins; it joins not to the corrupt man, neither to the sensual heart, neither
to the vile affections, neither unto them whose eyes is full of adultery, which
cannot cease from sin, neither to the seed of falsehood, neither to the
corruptible birth, neither unto that which is born of the flesh, nor unto the
will of the creature; yet notwithstanding, though it join not to these, yet is
it near man, even the natural man, its manifestation or the shining forth of
its brightness, makes all these things manifest beforementioned to be evil;
and thus far the spirit of God has appeared to the world and all mankind, as
to convince the world of sin, yet still it remains in its own purity, and while
the heart of any man is taken up with that, and joined unto that which the
light reproves, (that is to say) the worker of iniquity; that man has not
received the spirit, neither is made possessor of it, nor injoyes it, but it
stands off man, and from man at a distance, showing the worker of iniquity and
the works of darkness, and manifesting to the creature in its light, and
letting him see unto whom he is joined; for so far as a man denies himself in
acting or joining to that which the manifestation of Gods spirit (shining forth
in its own purity) in him reproves, so he comes nearer, and comes to join in
some measure to the spirit of holiness, or the holy spirit, and to receive it,
and to feel the power of God in some small measure, though but weakly working
in him, to the purging out those things which the spirit lets him see is evil,
which has been reproved in him, and so in some measure feels in himself what
to wait upon, and where to wait, and in what, even in that which gives every
one a feeling of their own condition within, and opens their understandings.

How the spirit of truth works and operateth in them who are convinced, and
yet has not obeyed it, showed.
THough God who is a spirit has appeared by his manifestation unto all, yet
all have not received it, he that hates the light has not received it, The
eyelids of the morning are unto him as the shadow of death; that which
manifests and brings to light all evil, the evil doer likes it not, heeds
it not, receives it not, but still is without God in the world, that lies in
wickedness, and without the spirit, in death, and dead in trespasses and sins,
a sepulcher, in which the just lies slain; in this state God is not remembered,
there is no remembrance in the grave, nor no thanks in the pit, yet light
shines in darkness, and a man unconverted, yet convinced, is that darkness, and
that which convinces him is the light; so light shines in darkness, in man, in
the greatest darkness; and this may convince all vain disputers, who say every
one is not enlightened, neither that the spirit of God has appeared to all;
good men have it, bad men its near them; they that bring forth the fruits of
darkness, and bring forth the deeds of darkness, they are lighted, yea, they
that are in darkness, and are darkness, the light shines in them, the spirit of
God shines there in darkness, manifests their darkness, here man is darkness,
the Ephesians were darkness, in the unconverted estate, yet had light shining in
them, Ephesians. 5.8. the spirits manifestation they had, but were not led by it;
once they were without God in the world, but after it was turned unto, it
showed them their darkness, and it leading their minds, they came to be made
light in the Lord, who is that spirit, whose manifestation has appeared to
all, so all are without excuse, for he has not left himself without witness;
and they that have not Gods witness to be theirs, (that is to say) to possess
it; they have no faith nor assurance in God at all, but that which should bring
assurance of salvation unto them; it assures their condemnation, and also
reveals sorrow. Now as every one is turned to the measure of Gods holy spirit,
and keeps his mind into it, he comes to feel and to see its reproof, and so as
the mind is kept still into it, it arises in its pu^ity, and shines forth in
the heart in more brightness, still checking man for disobedience, still
judging, and as it is listened unto, it appears in strength, and lays every
man's heart open, and lets him see how full of unrighteousness he is, how full
of imaginations he is, how his heart is full of vain and idle thoughts, and how
lust abounds in the heart; this makes his trouble to increase, and his sorrow
to multiply, and this is always present, none can run from it, but it follows
him, and shall pursue every one to the pit who obey it not, and kindle his
torment; and whatsoever the mind may run into, to take pleasure for a moment,
and the heart be exercised in, yet this measure of Gods spirit is always
present to condemn it, and judge a man for it, so the strokes of the Almighty
is still heavy upon his back, being still in the disobedience of the spirit; it
never bears witness unto any man in that state, but God through it still sounds
the alarm of war and terror in his heart, so that fear compasses him about on
every side, and though for a moment, the cry may not be heard, and through
disobedience it may seem as dead as unto him, yet if ever the mind be but
still, and a man sober and calm, and ever mind what he is doing, it appears
again, and though a man may take up something, and perform something which is
called religious, and pray in words, and read, and talk of the Scriptures, and
may take up some carnal outward Ordinance, and there content himself for a
time, yet still the witness of Gods holy Spirit, for that, shows him his
hypocrisy, and that he seeks a cover to shelter himself under, that he may
live in disobedience, and be at ease in the flesh, but all in vain, for there
is no peace within, but the measure of Gods spirit still shows him he serves
sin, and follows his own will, and in this will brings forth a worship, and
this is will worship; nay, if a man should practice all those things which
others who were in the life performed, and were accepted; yet this will not
satisfy, God has no pleasure in this, no more then if one slew a man, or
blessed an Idol, or kissed Baal, all is abomination to the Lord; and though a
man may sin so far against the light of Christ in his own conscience, that the
light be to him as though there were no such thing, yet all this will not do,
for the Lord will thunder from his holy place, though thou have stopped thy ear
as to him, and closed thy eyes, yet he will make thee hear and see, and will
cause his terror to strike into thy heart, so that dread shall compass thee
about as a wall, and thou shall be afraid for that which thou shall see and
hear; and though the spirit strives long, yet being still disobeyed, the
long-suffering of God comes to an end concerning him that h^th been unfaithful,
and then his wrath is kindled as fire, which shall burn to the lowest Hell,
into which all the rebellious and stiff-necked shall be cast and have their
portion for ever among all the children of darkness; therefore all who have
been convinced long, and still are by Gods holy spirit, of the way of truth,
and yet have not submited to the leading of the Spirit; think on this (for its
the Lords truth which I declare unto you) or else eternal misery will be your
end.

And if thou still persist on after the imaginations of thine own heart, and in
thy rebellious will, thou quenches the spirit and the motions thereof; and
though it be life in it self, yet is as dead unto thee who art in the
gainsaying, resisting that through which Gods eternal power is manifest in them
that believe; and thou will grow insensible and past feeling, and become as
seared flesh, and be senseless as to the things of God, and hardness of heart
will come upon thee, and thou will be as a stone which cannot be melted, and woe
will be unto such where the spirit of the Lord in them cease to strive with
them, having so long rebelled against, and gainsayed the pure drawing of it,
that so the Lord is grieved and wearied with their impenitency, that he gives
them up to their vile affection, and to follow the imaginations of their own
heart ( who receives not the truth in the love of it) but in the enmity still
remains obstinate, doing despite unto the Spirit of grace, his long-suffering
comes to an end, and his fier^^ wrath comes to be kindled against such, and
that which would have led them out of the world, into true pure everlasting
peace, now becomes their tormentor, and they banished from his presence, and
shut up in eternal misery, where the fire is kindled by the breath of the Lord
that burns for ever, the sentence of condemnation being past upon them because
they had pleasure in unrighteousness, and have sold themselves to do wickedly,
and crucifying the appearance of God in themselves; which appearance though it
live in the fountain of life, yet crucified by thee who art out of the life,
yet lives still for ever in it self to be thy condemnation eternally.

How the Spirit of the Father works in them who are turned to it, and have
taken heed unto its manifestation, and are in some measure partakers of its
power.
THere are differences of administration; But the same Lord; and there are
diversity of gifts, but the same spirit; and there are diversities of
operations, but the same God which works all in all. Now the spirit of Truth
which is life in it self, puts forth its own pure act, not only to
convince and detect him that transgresses its appearance, and manifests
evil which has been committed by man; but also being turned unto, and waited
in, it shows man when motions and temptations unto sin arises; and as the
Creature is still, and waits in that which manifests and singly keeps in
his mind to it. It sheds abroad its power, and vanquisheth and subdueth those
lusts which do arise, and condemns the ground from whence they arise, and it
purely draws the mind after it, and secretly works and breaths forth its
pure life in him that waits in patience and in stilness, not heeding the vain
thoughts and imaginations that rises in his heart; but rather heeds the
manifestation of the Spirit, at whose bright appearance all the vain desire^
comes to be extinguished, and there comes to be a hunger begot within, to be
made partakers of its purity and of its nature; for God through the operation
of the eternal Spirit lets forth his power, which turns and changes the
heart, and cuts asunder and divides betwixt a man and those lovers that he has
joined unto, and makes a separation within, and carries a man further from
those things which the measure of the Spirit reproves, and this leads nearer
unto God: And so they that do believe in the measure of Gods Spirit, comes to
feel what repentance from dead works is, and the works and the worker is seen;
and who it is that has wrought is manifest in the light: and as there is a
diligent waiting upon it; there is nothing that passes through the mind, but
it discerns, and gives a discerning unto every particular heart, who singly and
quietly waits upon it. But yet after the Spirit of truth in some measure be
felt, and its living testimony in some thing; yet it may be a long time before
there be a clear distinguishment in the understanding; so that one cannot
clearly discern its moving from all other false motions and high imaginations
which are above: And hence it is, that the hasty and forward minds follows
their vain motions which leads them into deceit, and then the Questioner gets
up, and then they question all that ever the Spirit has made manifest unto
them before; a veil then is drawn over, and the enemy lodges in the vayl and
in the darkness which is entered, and then as soon as any hearkens within, to
that which is the uppermost, and does abound; the enemy that lodges in that
presents motions as to obey this and that, and all is deceit: So therefore all
is to keep back, that they may sensibly feel between the pure motions and
drawing of the Spirit, and the vain thoughts that arise out of the earthly
heart; and when any thing does arise which the light does not bear witness to,
it is not to be followed nor heeded, but a quiet still writing that things may
be cleared to the understanding; and for want of this many have run out, and
have brought forth Satan's work, and acted things forwardly in their will, and so
have clean lost the true sense of that which should guide their minds, and have
followed the spirit of error, and have caused the pure spirit of the Lord to
be evil spoken of; But as there is a keeping back, and a quiet waiting out of
willing, or running and have; it arises purely and stilly in the heart, and
shines forth in brightness in the heart, so that it gives perfect evidence
and full testimony of it self, that there will be no doubting nor questioning
of it is motion; for it will apparently show forth its self in its own
transparent brightness, with full assurance of its own will, and then after it
be clearly seen, and its motion, then keep under all reasoning, and keep out
all questioning, and give not way to temptation; and that which moves of the
Lord of life, will carry thee through in its own operation and power to
accomplish the will of God, and so thou will have peace being obedient, and thy
strength will be renewed; for as any is brought to submit unto the will of God,
when it is known, and comes to obey by virtue of its own power; that which is
contrary unto Gods spirit in thee, comes to loose its strength, and to decay,
and be we^kned; but as any disobeys the pure motion of Gods holy Spirt after it
be known, the enemy is strengthened, and that which is of the flesh nourished,
and the spirit comes to be quenched, that which would give thee power, if thou
submittest to it: But yet know this, the spirit in it self never loses its
purity, neither can be quenched in it self, but will bear its pure witness
against thee, and none shall be able to stop its reproo^; Thus the diversity of
its operation comes to be known as its hearkened unto, obeyed, loved, and
believed in; it puts forth its pure power and gives strength, and seals peace
to the obedient; but disobeyed and resisted, it condemns, judges, reproves and
seals condemnation to the disobedient, and yet there is no variation in it
self, for it is always one and the same.

But as it operateth upon different natures or objects unto which it joins to,
or stands at a distance from, that is to say, the good ground it causes to
bring forth fruit unto God, and the cursed ground, out of which briars and
thorns do arise, it kindles a fire in, that shall not quenched; but as there is
a submission unto its pure operation, it burns up and destroys that which
hinders the growth of the seed, and it purges the heart of them that have
confidence in it from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit, and works up
the creature into its own frame and nature, and fashions, and makes and moulds
all that are in the faith into the image of the Father; and so the Fathers love
comes to be shed abroad in the heart: and as wrath was revealed through the
spirit and condemnation, so now the peace of God comes to be enjoyed, and his
consolation shed abro^d largely, in which there is pure rejoicing for ever.

Unto whom the Spirit of the Father bears witness* and seals assurance of the
Fathers love, and of justification with God, declared.
NOne has the witness of Gods spirit bearing witness to them nor in them who
have not believed in the true light that lights every man that comes into
the world, by whom alone life is begotten by the powerful operation of Christ
in them that believe in him who is eternal light it self, whose word is spirit
and life, by which the new Creature is framed and formed in them that b^lieve,
unto whom he makes manif^st his power; for unto him who is the life of men is
all power committed both in heaven and ear^h; for nothing was made or created
but by him, neither is any turned from sin but by him, and by his mighty power:
without him ^s death, in him is life, and the life is the light of men: So that
none but they that are born of the light, and are begotten by him who is light,
can have the spirit of Christ who is light to bear witness unto them, neither
the assurance of the Fathers love; for only they that are born of the spirit,
and walk after the spirit, are justified by the spirit of the Lord; for the
assurance of his love is not made manifest to his enemies, but unto them that
are born and brought forth in his own image, in his own likeness and nature,
which is pure and incorruptible without stain or d^filement, the holy seed
which is heir of the promise, who knows the living hope which purifies the
heart, and brings the answer of a good conscience unto them that feel and
witness^ the washing of regeneration, and have know^ in themselves the clean
water poured sor^h upon them, which has taken away the stains, and spots, and
bl^mishes, and the defilements; for where these are not washed out, and the
heart cleansed from them, and that believed in, wherein Gods all-suffi^iency is
felt, and his power made manifest, there cannot be assurance of the Fathers
love in the heart, nor in the soul; neither does the spirit of the Father bear
witness unto such, nor assure their justification; but on the contrary, where
sin remains unsubdued, and taken away; the spirit of the Father condemns the
sin, and the creature now is joined to it, and is become one with it; for no
sin is brough^ forth, but there is a consent and an ascenting to the
instigation of the Devil, although when a temptation arises either within or
without, there may be a resisting and a striving against it for a little; but
the heart not being kept close to the spirit, the enemy often enters, and so
captivates the understanding, then there is an agreement and ajoining to the
adversary, and so the spirit pronounces the sentence of condemnation upon him
who is joined to the harlot, and becomes one flesh, and joined unto strange
flesh which is not the flesh of Christ the seed, and that which has joined and
consented to drink of the cup of fornication, must drink of the cup of
indignation and terror, and bear the stroke of Divine Justice, and lie in
patience under it till that be cut down which has joined to deceit, before
there can be the remission of the trangression, or the creature justified in
the sight of God: For sin is not blotted out of the book of Gods remembrance
till it be turned from, and repented of, neither does the creature stand clear
in the sight of God, when God judges in righteous judgment, which the light in
every ones conscience shall answer. Now he that is born of God sins not, for
the seed of God remains in him, which is life: And as the creature joins to
that seed which is heir of the Kingdom, and of the Crown immortal, he comes to
be made partaker of its virtue and operation; which seed is Christ, and by his
power by which he limiteth the seed of the Serpent, and weakens his strength in
the creature, as man comes to believe in his strength unto whom all power is
committed, the covenant with Death is broken, and that agreement that the
creature has made with Death comes to be disannulled by the arm and power of
the Lord, and so the creature comes to be delivered from the bondage of
corruption, and the new man comes to live, or the new creature which is born of
God, which sins not, comes to be framed and fashioned in the image of the
Father: and the Fathers love is manifest unto him and in him, and he has the
assurance in himself. The Babe that is born from above, of the Spirit which is
from above, of which he is born and brought forth of the just by the just, he
is justified by the just God, and the just wi^ness of the Spirit seals this
in him: And he has the record of his justification; For there is three that
bear record in the earth, the water, the blood, and the spirit; and he that is
born of that which is pure in it self, has the witness of all these three in
himself, for they agree in o^e: That which one bears witness too, and for,
the other does the same, and the record, and testimony, and witness of all
these three has he that is born from above. Moreover, there is three that bear
record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the spirit, and these three are
one. So he that is born of the Father, and begotten of the Father in Christ the
seed through the Spirit, he and he alone comes to feel the Fathers love made
manifest in him, and is justified in the sight of the Father, and has the
record of all these witnesses before mentio^ed in himself; so that he has his
assurance and evidence near him and in him, the seal of the Father, the seal of
the S^irit: And so when the adversary comes to tempt and to assault, and would
raise up doubts in the mind, the evidence is near, which puts him out of all
doubt that he is in the love of God, and blessed for ever; and happy are all
they who have waited for these things, and have felt these things, and are
witness of these things; for flesh and blood has not revealed these things.
Now let every man who reads this prove himself, and try himself whether he be
in the faith or no, and whether he have the evidence of the Spirit or no, that
he is born of it, and knows a birth that sins not, because the seed remains
in him; who is kept by the power, that the evil one touches him not, kept in
salvation, and in saving health alive unto him who has brought him forth to
life to drink of the cup of blessing, and of the cup of salvation which
nourishes and refreshes up unto eternal life them that continue in the Faith.

What the free grace of God is, and unto whom it has appeared, and where all
is to wait to receive it, declared, as it has been revealed by the Spirit.
THe grace of God is pure, and is the free gift of God, and it i^ perfect, it
is the appearance of Christ, it is a beam of righteousness shining forth, it is
a measure of Gods strength and power issued out from himself, and a proportion
of his treasure, virtue, and sufficiency which comes to be shed abroad in all
them that believe in it; its that through which God makes known his will, and
teaches his by it, and reveals his saving health through it to them that are
taught by it and through it; them that believe in it, are builded up in the
truth, and becomes a habitation for God; no man does any thing to purchase it,
none need say, where may I get it, or how may I know its teaching? its near
thee, it is in thee, it has appeared to all men, it shows ungodliness in the
heart of man, by its pure brightness; yea, to all men it shows the motions unto
sin, and that which is not like God in motions, words or actions; it draws
the heart of man from them as with a cord, it shows the lusts of the heart and
mind, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, it never joined to sin,
nothing can alter its purity or property, as in it self it is always one and
the same, it is p^rfect, and will be always so, it stands off, and at a
distance from that which is corruptable and imperfect, and yet beholds it,
and although some that have turned to it, be again turned from it, and may turn
it as in themselves into wantonness, yet it keeps its purity, and still
reproves thy wantonness, and will lay i^ before thee, and will show thee how
thou have abused the appearance of Christ, and has marred his countenance and
his face, and reprove thee for it; many have been the talkers of it in this
professing age, but knew not of what they spoke, neither ever informed the mind
of man, where it was to be waited for, neither how it might be known, or how,
or what the operation of it was, but has cried up their own imaginations, we
are justified by his free grace, from all sin past, present and to come, and in
this conceit thousands have been led into the pit of darkness, while out of
thick darkness they have cried up, we are justified by free grace in Christ,
while the free grace of Christ, Gods gift, which should have taught them, they
never heeded at all, but got up into conceitedness, and careles^ness, and
presumption, out of the fear of God; and pretending justification, while they
themselves were the servants of sin, and bondslaves to corruption, and this is
the state of thousands at this day, and they that have been publishers and
preachers of free grace: Now when the thing it self comes to be witnessed and
declared what it is, and as it is, and where it is; now they say it is not
sufficient to teach any the knowledge of God, but from all such foolish
doaters, and blind guids, and ignorant shepherds, is God bringing many sheep
home which they have driven away, and they would kill now them that are fed and
taught by the gift of God, and says its not sufficient, and so make them to
dislike their food, and dislike their shepherd, so would make them deaf and
blind, and then they might lead them into any desert, and feed them among the
swine, who wallow in the mire, in filthiness, and lust, and pleasure, and
ungodliness, and so beguil the sheep, and scatter them from the fold, and lead
them from the true shepherd, and from his appearance, which is his grace, and
from the shepherds voice, which is the word of his grace, which is able to save
the soul. Oh all you blind guides, and you that call your selves Orthodox-men
and Ministers, and all you that have been preaching free grace in words; and
now when God has given them that have waited upon him an understanding to
declare the thing it self, that you have spoken of; now you cry its not a
sufficient teacher. Now let me ask you a question, if that which teaches to
deny ungodliness, and shows it, be the grace of God, and the gift of God, then
how say you, its not a sufficient teacher? if it be not a sufficient teacher,
then why did the Apostle commit them, and commend them to the word of his
grace, which was able to save their souls, and whether is not that which is
able to save the soul, a sufficient teacher? Answer ye wise men, and ye literal
Rabbis, if that which shows sin and temptation be not sufficient, then declare
you, and let us see your skill in the mysteries of God; but to return unto
them, in whose minds there is a desire to be informed; seeing then that Gods
free grace, which is his pure appearance, has so far manifested it self, or
God through it shows sin, and teaches from sin, that which teaches from sin
is holy, and that which leads from worldly lusts is pure, and that which
saves from sin is grace, which is saving in it self, and God has so loved the
world, as that he has sent his Son into the world; and he was and is the light
of the world, and has shed abroad his grace, and has made it appear to all,
and all that waits upon it, and comes to be taught by it, feels its assurance,
so all is left without excuse, therefore wait in that which has appeared in
thee, that which shows the lusts, and thoughts and motions unto sin, this is
Gods gift, Gods grace, this is sufficient, though all men in the world say it
is not sufficient, yet this makes not my faith void, neither thine who has
received it; but thou have the witness of thy faith in thy self, which gives
pure and perfect feeling of the operation of the Spirit of the Lord, and all is
to wait within, to hear him who condemns sin in the flesh within, which by his
grace shows man his transgression and insufficiency in himself, and by the word
of his grace saves all them that believe in it out of sin, and gives dominion
over sin; and this comes to be revealed in the heart of man, and there must it
be waited for in that which is pure, that it may be received, and there the
operation of it comes to be known, and its virtue partaken of by all that do
believe in it, and receive it, and are subjected to it, they see and feel Gods
salvation revealed through it to their souls, and knows where their strength
lies, not in self-acting, but in the free gift of God, the gift of
righteousness, the righteous gift, by which justification comes upon all that
believe^

Whether all have received the grace of God or no, declared; and and whether it
be a sufficient teacher in it self, to wit, that grace that has appeared to
all, if it be received, demonstrated.
THis wise generation, whose wisdom is below the wisdom of God, have
confounded peoples minds with distinctions; as that there is a twofold grace.
First, that which they call common, which they say has appeared to all men.

Secondly, that which they call special, and saving, which has only appeared
to the Saints, and by giving heed to these distinctions, in times past many
years ago I lost my self and my guide, and went from the appearance of it in
my self, to hearken to a thing at a distance from me, and heeded not that at
home which was near, because it was called common and insufficient, and so
suffered great loss; and there I am moved by him, in whose fight I have found
favor and mercy, and grace, to declare the truth as the Lord has made it
manifest to me, and in me; that all who seek after the Lord may be informed,
and know where to wait upon the Lord; for unto that grace which showed me
evil, and temptations unto evil, I was made to go back unto, after many y^ars
profession (which they called common and insufficient) before ever I found the
Lord, or felt his living power again; For the first, they ground upon the
Letter, as they judge, where it is said, He causes the sun to shine, and the
rain to fall upon the just and unjust: And where it is said, in him we live,
and move, and have our being, heal^h and strength, and an understanding in
things natural, and by which men comes to see gross sins and evils; but that
which they call special, is that which the Saints are saved by, and are
established in, in righteousnes^, and receive the remission of sins. Now he
that causes the Sun to shine, and the Rain to fall, and gives health, and
strength, and nourishment to all things living that are visible, in the outward
visible creation, and that discovers gross sins, and open evils to man, the
same is he who is the life of the soul, the same is he that sanctifies, and
purifies, and saves them that believe, and its the same virtue and power that
upholds the natural man in his pure nature, that upholds the spiritual man,
and by which he lives unto God: It Is the same grace, I do not say the same
measure; for the same virtue and power by which all things that are visible and
living, were made alive, and subsist in their station and covenant, and bound
where they are set and placed; the same grace, strength, power, and suffi^iency
upholdeth the heavenly bodies, and moves and acts in a higher sphere or
degree, and preserves all that believe, and are quickened by him who is the
power of God in heavenly places, and the same power and virtue that discovers
the dark places, and hellish places, and the horrible pit; it is the same power,
life, strength and virtue that leads all that believe into the land of the
living, into the holy place, into the peaceable habitation, into the holy
mountain, and into the heavenly Tabernacle made without hands: And in few
words, he that discovers open sins, the same grace and the same purity
discovers hidden and secret sins, though the measure of its purity shine in
one more then another, because them that are in the unbelief, the darkness
over-shadows, and the mountains are high, and the vayl is thick, and the clouds
are many; and the air dark, so that it is resplendency and brightness is not
seen because of the vail which shadows it, that it has not much entrance; but
in them that believe, and have received that grace, and is joined to it in
which they believe, it renteth the vail, and makes the shadow to fly away,
and scatters the clouds, and breaths forth it self in purity, and makes the
air clearer, so that its brightness shines more purely forth to them, and in
them; because the heart is more open to receive its virtues in, yet the same
purity and virtue remains still, and the same grace keeps its purity and
property in it self, and its power and sufficiency is always the same, though
it do not appear so to the creature: So this I say, and is my testimony of the
grace of God which is the gift of God, which has appeared in some measure more
or less unto all men, and convinces and shows gross and op^n evils, even
the same grace by its virtue and power, leads from the least or impurest
thought, and shows the secretest evils that lodges in the heart, unbelief, and
also every temptation unto sin; and this shall be witnessed to be the truth by
the whole earth in the day of the Lords appearing, and is now witnessed by all
the children of Light who believe, with whom I have fellowship in the pure
living sufficient, perfect grace of God, which is Gods free gift, which in some
measure has appeared to all, whereby all are left without excuse: And herein
is the wonderful love of God made manifest to all man kind; and all that
turns to his grace, will see he has long waited to be gracious in his grace,
which is near, that all mankind might be partakers of his bounty, love, mercy,
favor, and free gift, by which justification comes upon all that believe.

Therefore my bowels and heart is more open in this unto all, because many have
erred for lack of knowledge, and have wandered aside, because they have not
found a true guide. Therefore in dear love unto all upon the face of the Earth,
where this may come, I write and let out my bosom into this thing, that they
may also be partakers with me of the free love of God, and the free grace of
God, by which I am saved, and know the wall which is salvation, and the gates
which are praise, which the Saints are compassed about with, and enterd in at;
and for the sake of such who thirst after God, and the knowledge of him, I
write for their information, and not to satisfy critical men, nor them who are
in the Philosophy and vain deceit, who are swollen big in their fleshly
understanding, and puffed up in their earthly minds; for by such I desire not
any testimony, neither acceptance.

But now to come to speak of that which many are doubting about; that is to
say, the grace of God which brings salvation, which has appeared to all men,
whether this be a sufficient Leader and Teacher of it self, if it be received;
but in order to the thing in hand, let all take notice of this, that when I
speak of the sufficiency of grace, and that it is a sufficient Teacher: I do
not speak of it distinct from Christ, or of a thing separated from the power of
God; but one with it, and him from whence it comes; for as he is salvation it
self, so the grace of God is of the same nature, by which he manifests
himself and his salvation to them that believe, and also reveals his witness
in them; for where the appearance and presence of Christ is manifest, there is
his power and strength m^nifest, either to condemnation or salvation; and
though his pure appearance and presence is one in it self, yet them that have
marred his countenance, and pierced him, his presence always has been, and
will be very dreadful and terrible; but unto them that believe, and have
continued with him in his temptation, and have suffered with him, and have
longed for him, his appearance and presence will be amiable, beautiful, and
lovely, sweet, pleasant, delightful, desirable, glorious, and admirable; so
that they who have seen it, have been melted into tears, and dissolved as into
water, because of his love and beauty, who is the chief of ten thousand. Oh!
that all that long after him may wait for him in patience, in that wherein he
will appear, they shall see him, whose sight will be a recompense for all
longing, and thirsting, and desiring, and waiting, the sense of longing and
thirsting will be taken away, when he that makes glad the heart appears, who
lifts up the light of his countenance, and makes whole them whose hearts
have been broken for him whom their souls loved; therefore all wait, and think
not the time long: Keep in your minds to his grace, which is his appearance,
and him you will feel, and see, and be satisfied, and say, This is he we have
waited for, let us rejoice and be exceeding glad; for now he is come, and his
reward is with him, to give every one that wait upon him in purity, full
contentment and satisfaction, where peace comes to be f^lt, and joy unspeakable
which is full of glory.

And though God, out of his everlasting love unto the sons of men, has
followed man, and has called him to return; yet that nature which is above in
man, which has transgressed the life, does always resist the drawing of the
Lord, and is not subject to the law of God, neither to the grace of God which
teaches to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, that has beset and
compassed the creature about as a thick cloud, and always makes war against
the soul; that till there be a listening unto that which shows ungodliness,
which has power in it self. None has power neither dominion over that in
themselves, which leads into the transgression: Therefore, though God who is
salvation it self, has let out himself so far, and has appeared in his
pure and perfect grace unto all men, yet all have not received grace; For,
though the Lord profer his gift intentionally, that the creature might receive
it, and so have benefit, and partake of its living virtue and operation; yet
while that has pre-eminence in man, which is contrary to grace, that will
never receive it, because it is contrary to the life of the corruptible, and
takes its life away, and mortifies and slayes the enmity; therefore all must be
still and quiet, and wait in that which is pure of the Lord, that they may feel
that raised up (which receives grace) above the corruptible thoughts and
desires of the carnal mind; but many who talk of free grace, have put no
difference betwixt the precious and the vile, but has put them upon doing and
working, who are in the enmity, and curse, and in death, and so has brought
forth dead works; notwithstanding all performances, they being dead to the life
God; another acts in them, even he which has the power of Death, which is
the Devil, and so have not known that which was precious in themselves, could
not minister unto that which was precious in others; but have been Ministers of
Death, and have ministered to Death, and so Death nourishes it self in all
them who are not yet come to the separation, to see betwixt the precious and
the vile.

Now though all have not received grace, so as to save them from the committing
of sin, the fault is not in God; Israel would have none of my counsel, they
stopped their ^ares: Neither is the fault in the grace which has appeared unto
all men. Neither is it because of it is imbecility and weakness; but because
it is not hearkened unto, and waited in, and obeyed, believed in and received:
For this eternal truth which shall for ever stand, the least measure of the
grace o^ God has power in it self to save man from committing of that evil or
sin which it shows man: And as it is received, the power comes more and more to
be made manifest, where all that believe comes to be preserved out of evil.

Object. But some have said, and now say, there is common grace, and preventing
grace, and restraining grace, and saving grace, and the former, that has
appeared to all but the latter has appeared to the Saints, and to the elect
only.

Answ. Grace is Gods pure and perfect gift, and is but one thing; I speak not
of q^antity, but of quality; not o^ so much, as that the fullness of grace has
appeared to all; but of a measure of that fullness which is in Christ the head,
although I do not divide the least measure from the fullness in quality or
nature, for it is one and the same; for that which shows a man he should not
lie, nor swear, that is as pure according to it is latitude and proportion, as
that which shows a man all that ever he has done; and that same grace which
leads a man from drunkenness and excess, is as pure, and of the same kind and
nature as that greater proportion which leads a m^n from all sin, I speak
what I have seen from the Father, though the dark world cannot receive it: But
people h^ve been blinded and darkened with sounds and distinctions which men
coin and frame in their natural reason, and by their natural parts, which is
out of the life, although I do not condemn natural parts, which are purely
natural, if they keep ^hei^ bounds and compass; that is to say, to the
management of natural things of the visible creation; but the things of Gods
kingdom are of another quality and nature, and cannot be reached unto by the
natural; but as I said, men through distinctions and names has wrack^d peoples
minds, and confounded their understanding, and have led them into a thick wood,
or a wilderness, so they know not where to get forth, neither what the thing
is, of which one speaks, because not being spoken through the enticing words of
man's wisdom, which darkens the counsel of God. Now that which shows a man
evil after it be committed, is the pure appearance of God: And that which
shows a man the temptations when they arise, that is the same; now this they
call common, and that which preventeth a m^n, and keeps him back, that he lend
not his heart, nor puts forth his hand to commit evil, but restrains a man
from it, is not that saving out of evil, and that which stops the adversary in
his way that he enter not; but preserves the Creature out of defilement, and
saves him from it, is not this saving? is not this the same thing that the
Apostle, who was well acquainted with the grace of God, and of it is operation
wrote of to Titus? That grace of God which brought salvation, which had
appeared, and does now appear to all men, which taught self-denial, them to
deny worldly lusts, and also to live godlily, or like unto God in this present
world, and now does the same; is not this sufficient to believe in, and
sufficient to save? Now I do not say but there is a greater measure let out
unto them that are converted unto God, then is to t^em that are convinced of
their evil by the same grace, yet still ^t is one and the self-same thing; one
gift, yet a greater measure of one and the same pure virtue and power which is
given to them that obeys the life, which is already made manifest by its
appearance unto all.

Object. But some will be ready to say that this is error, and that which is
contrary to the Scripture, and to orthodox Teachers; that the grace which is
saving, is near all men, and has appeared to all men.

To that I answer; Though grace be saving in it self, even the grace that has
appeared to all men, and may be truly called saving grace; yet to them that
believe not in it, neither are taught by it, it convinces and shows evil, and
checks and judges for it; yet there is no variation nor change in the gift of
God, but as it works upon different objects; for faith and unbelief are two
different things, as light and darkness are different, and so the word of his
grace is the savor of life unto life, (that is to say) unto them that believe,
and is the savor of death unto death, unto them who are in the unbelief, who
indeed are dead while they live, yet here is the same grace, and the same word
of grace, yet here is different operations; so the Lord kills and makes
alive, yet the same Lord; the Spirit convinces of sin, and reproves for sin,
and also consolates and comforts; here is diversity of operations, yet the same
Spirit, which never alters.

Obj. But further, some may say, If that it be saving grace, or at the least a
degree, and a measure of saving grace, that has appeared to all men, then how
is it that all are not saved by it?

Answ. Because I would all stumbling blocks were removed away, that the path
might be made plain, that all might come to believe in that which is Gods gift,
in which there is power and sufficiency; therefore I am constrained by the
grace of God to declare of it, and to bear witness to it thus largly, which I
know will be to the edification of all that hunger after righteousness. All are
not saved by it, because they believe not in it, neither are taught by it, yet
its validity, power and virtue, is nevertheless in it self, and though them
that are careless and heedless, say we feel no power nor sufficiency in it to
save us from sin, yet this makes not void their confidence who have received
it, and knows its power, which has given them power, and also sufficiency to
do the will of God; what though unbelievers, who are in the alienation, say
there is no beauty in Christ, neither form nor comeliness; this makes not his
glory void, who is the express Image of the father, full of grace and truth;
the Disciples saw it, and bore record of him, who were in the faith, and the
Pharisees said he had a devil, who were in the unbelief; but in brief, this is
my testimony, that the grace of God, the perfect gift of God, which shows
ungodliness, and leads from ungodliness all that are taught by it, is a
sufficient teacher of it self, I mean, as the power of Christ through it is
made manifest unto all them that hearken to it; Paul a Minister of the word of
reconciliation, who was rapt up into the third heaven, where he saw things
unutterable, came to be tempted and buffetted with the messenger of Satan, and
fear and doubting rose up in him, and he prayed unto God thrice, and this
answer was given unto him, my grace is sufficient for thee; so this is evident
to all understandings, who are opened by the Lord, that which showed him the
temptations, and Satan's messengers, and Satan's buffetings, was sufficient to
preserve him, and so is it for all who singly are kept to it and in it,
sufficient to show ungodliness because of its purity, and to lead from worldly
lusts by its power, and to teach the will of God, and to live like unto God in
this present world; and this testimony I bear of it, and to it, even what as I
have felt, and tasted, and handled of its sufficiency, and virtue, and power of
its operation, for the confirmation of the same truth, which is believed by
many brethren, and also for the information of them who thirst after the Lord,
and for the opposition of all the gainsayers and opposers of it; which
testimony I commend to that of God in every man, which will witness me herein
in the day of God, when all hearts is opened, and all falsehoods and truth is
made manifest, in the mean time shall rest in that which I have declared of, in
which there is pure and perfect peace.

A word to you wise men of this world, who are glorying in the sound of words,
and worshipping outward appearances; to all wise and litterall professors, who
think you are worshipping God aright, who think to search into the deep things
of God by your natural wisdom, learning, and parts, and study.
GOd has broken open the seals of the great deep, where the wonderful
unutterable things of God is revealed, from whence eternal wisdom is flowing
forth to his little ones, whom he has sanctified from the womb, and his power
and glory is he sheding abroad, and making it to flow forth as though it issued
out of a womb, by which power and wisdom you are all weighed, even by one who
is swaddled about with righteousness, and girded up with the girdle of truth,
you are all measured as with a span, and are all weighed as with a scale; all
your parts, tongues, languages, interpretations, significations, wisdom) that
is come to be enjoyed by them who have believed in the true light that lights
everyman, which rounds you all as a heap, and measurs you all as with a line;
your breadth, length, height, and depth; your parts, tongues, languages,
interpretations, is but all natural; words are but empty sounds, though there
be many languages, and each have an interpretation and a signification, they
are all short to d^cl^re the life, the immeasurable being of eternal life, you
with all these are on heaps, disjointed one from another; your Rhetoric,
Philosophy, your framed and devised disputations, your tongues, and the
significations of all tongues cannot know the mind of the Spirit, neither knows
the original of eternal salvation by all these, and so not knowing the
sign^fication of the living eternal spirit in your selves; you invent, study,
devise, forms and frames up things in your carnal mind, by the strength of your
learned, studied, devised parts, and framed speeches, and has filled the whole
world with your dark muddy conceptions, and has led all out from seeking after
the living wisdom of God, which is from above, which was before your tongues
and languages was, and they have sucked in your conceptions and distinctions,
and your devised fables, and your imagined worship, that many have lost the
sense of any thing of God in themselves to guide them, and when you have come
as far as you can in those things, and have devised in your minds, by the
strength of those parts natural, you are farther from the knowledge then
before; and all that hear you and sucketh in your conceptions and imaginations
into their hearts, they are farther off Gods true knowledge then they were the
day in which they came out of their mothers womb; it is a lamentation to see
how people are gone out of the pure simplicity which is in Christ, into
subtilty and deceit stuffed up full, brim-full of that which must be all poured
out as water, before they and you all come to the least measure of Gods true
and saving knowledge. Oh a dreadful day is come upon many, and it lingers not,
but will come swiftly as a thief upon you who have taken away the key of
knowledge, and gives people that which will not open, and tells them of a
litteral carnal thing that must give them entrance; you and all they will be
shut out together, among the uncircumcised as fools, though you count your
selves wise men, your wisdom will perish, and your honor will be laid in the
dust; the time hastens, it is the word of truth to you all.

And you litteral professors, who have got the Scripture into your head, and
into the carnal mind to talk on, and are run into so many heads, you are almost
past numbering, and has exalted so many horns, yet the number is read, the
number of the heads of the beast, and the number of his name; you have taken up
things, and are exalting a visible shadowish practice, and neglects the li^e,
and are making Idols of those things which were but a figure and a
representation, in their purest time; now you like the Pharise^s are limiting
the Lord, that if he will not appear unto you in those things that you have
prescribed unto your selves, and fetched in from the l^tter, and gotten it into
the fleshly part, which is heaped up as a mountain in many of you so high,
above Gods pure witness in you, and so high above the appearance of God in you,
that you have quite lost the sight of that in your selves, which should give
you the knowledge of the living God, and m^ke you sensible of his pure
presence; I say, if he appear not in the way, you would limit him to, in those
things you would confine him in; you cannot receive him, the Lord open your
understandings, that you may see your selves, and how frothy, vain, light, and
wanton you are; one with the world in all things in the very ground, pretending
liberty in Christ, and privilege in him, when you may see you are servants to
corruptions, and to many noysom lusts that makes war. Again, what are all
outward appearances any more but as a Curtain, or as a veil, and as a shadow,
in respect of Christ, Gods righteousness within, but you are filled so full of
your apprehensions of his righteousness at a distance, that you have forgotten
all at home, and your own conditions; for his righteousness will not be a cloak
for your self-righteousness and unrighteousness, and if Christ be nor formed in
you, Gods righteousness, and live in you, and act in you, and work his work in
you, you are in the self-righteousness, and a talk of imputation, will not save
you while you are not in that capacity, and nature, and faith, unto whom his
righteou^ness is imputed. Are you not weary with tumbling up and down among the
earthly Hills, among which you have situated your selves? Do you not see your
land grows barren, and your possessions dry, and your worship dead, heaven
rains not on you, the bottles is stopped, the dew falls not on you; you wither
daily as a stick withousap; what, have you found that which will last unto
perpetuity? oh! nay its rusted already; it is canckered already, it is moth-eaten
already, it is fading, the glory is staining, the renown of all earthly things
is ^ading, and all terrestrial appearances, though never so glorious, they are
all to cease; a consumption is coming, blasting is near, there will be no more
glory in these things, they will fly away as a shadow when the Sun arises;
your riches are wasting, when will ye seek after that which endures for ever. I
pity you who have had breathings after God, and has sat down at ease in that
which is not eternal. Be warned, return home, consider, see what corruption
thou have power over now, which had once power over thee? Do thou rest in
that faith, that thou shall never be cleansed here? that faith is cursed, it is
reprobate, its rather properly unbelief; It Is not the faith of Gods elect, by
which they were sanctified, and overcame the wicked one in themselves by the
power of Christ, who is able to save, and manifests his ability in all them
that believe in the light, which they are enlightened withal, through which he
manifests himself to the Creature, and makes known his power in the Creature,
to redeem the soul out of death, and to redeem the Creature from under the
bondage of corruption, to serve him in the free spirit of God, in which the
sons are made free from sin, from the act and guilt, they become the Temples of
the holy Ghost: How far you are from this many of you consider, who are yet
temples of uncleanness, and a habitation for many noisome lusts; repent and
mind that which empties you of your thoughts and conceitednesse, that you may
know poverty of spirit, that the kingdom may come unto you, and be yours in
possession, else you are everlastingly miserable; and this is the true state of
many of you, own it and repent, that if it be possible you may find a door of
mercy yet opened unto you, and that you may enter in thereat; for it is not
setting up, and conforming to a visible practice without that will justify
you, while that which is in the transgression, and has transgressed the life,
and has disobeyed the light in your consciences (is head in you and above the
pure) that will not recommend you unto God; neither can you have any access,
or acceptance with God in that state, till you come out of the waters upon
which the Whore fits, which is unstable and boisterous, and reels too and fro,
and unsettled; which is all to be dried up, and all the springs cut off that
nourishes; and you must come to the Rock, before you know any thing that will
endure, to build upon, which rock is Christ, who abides for ever; but you are
all gone from that which should give the knowledge of him in your selves, and
does not retain him in your knowledge; neither that which gives the knowledge
of him, the light of his Spirit which shines in your hearts, making manifest in
your hearts the intention of your hearts, when motions unto evil do arise;
This must you all come to, before Gods salvation or redemption you come to know
in your selves, or have the witness of Gods holy Spirit, without which there
is neither seal nor evidence, nor assurance enjoyed or felt of the love of
God. The time of restoring is come, and many are restored again into Gods
covenant, and are delivered out of the jaws of death, and feels him who is the
healer of the Nations, and the restorer of the desolate places to dwell in: but
first you must come to see those places made desolate, wherein the wild nature
lodges, before you come to have a share in the restoration. Come off these
barren mountains where you are feeding, to Christ the life of men, who has
lightened you, and wait in it that you may feel his mind in your selves, and the
signification of the Spirit of truth from your own spirits, or else you will
still err for lack of knowledge, and perish for want of understanding, and so
lay down your heads in sorrow.

The kingdom of God, and of his Christ declared in some measure as it is
revealed, what it is, and where it is to be waited for, and how it comes to be
revealed to them, and in them that believe; that all who are waiting for it,
may know wherein consists, and so receive the end of their hope, and the end of
their expectation, and know the Dominion, which has no end.
THe Lord has prepared his Throne in the Heavens, and his Kingdom rules over
all; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and without end. God is a Spirit,
his Kingdom is spiritual, his habitation is suitable to his own nature; he is
immortal, his Kingdom is so; he is light, his dwelling place is so, a pure
situation in which there is no uncleanness, nor ever shall be: It Is eternal
dignity, it is an immutable being, that remains always in it is purity and
pleasantness: Eternally glorious, it consists in power, in righteousness, in
purity, in joy, in hope, in peace, in life, in virtue eternal: In quietness,
it is a quiet habitation, it is incomprehensible, unsearchable, and
indeclarable; words are too short, they are but as sounds, as vayls: It is
unexpressible, in it is the treasure-house of wisdom, out of which all that
believe in him, (who is the King of eternal and immortal glory) comes to
receive of his wisdom, of his life, of his power, virtue, righteousness, and
comes to enjoy him, who is the fullness that fills all things, whether
visible or invisible, whether terrestrial, or celestial; his power is over
all, his dominion is over all, who is eternally blessedness it self, and
felicity it self; who makes all that believe in him to partake of his
kingdom, of his grace, of his power, of his dignity, of his dominion, and of
his glory celestial; but these things are hid from the world, who are not
redeemed from the earth, neither never looks to be while they are in the body:
Unto such I say, Gods kingdom you shall never see, nor enjoy, while you are in
that faith which is reprobate, but may be truly called unbelief, although you
imagine a glory, and a kingdom in your earthly minds, and dream of a thing to
come, suitable unto that wherein your glory now stands; but that will all
fail, and those imaginations will be confounded, and dissolved into nothing,
because they are centred in that which is out of the truth, Christ, and so are
without ground or bottom, and are out of that which should give you the sight
and knowledge of God in your selves and his kingdom.

Christ when he taught them that followed him, exhorted them, that first of all
they might seek the Kingdom of God, even while they were in the body, Mat. 6.
and 36. The Pharisees were gazing abroad in their earthly knowledge, although
they had the Scripture that declared of Gods kingdom, yet they knew it not;
and this generation is the same who are in the same nature, and in the same
wisdom which is earthly and litteral, and they are imagining as the Jews were,
and are lo here, and lo there, in this observation and the other, and look to
see it there. Nay, Christ said, The kingdom of God is within you to the
Pharisees: And he bade them and others seek it first; what strange Doctrine was
this might the Pharisees say; he says the kingdom of God is within us, and
yet bids us seek it: Need we seek that which is in us may professors say? Yea,
it is like a pearl hid in the Field; it is like a grain of mustard seed among
many great seeds, which is not easily found; it is like a piece of silver lost
in the house among much rubbish, till that be swept away thou will not find
it; thou must dig deep, sweep clean, search narrowly before thou find it;
although he said to the Pharisees, the kingdom of God is within you, he did
not say they were possessors of it, or that it was theirs; but to the Disciples
whom he taught to pray in faith thy kingdom come, and they came to find it;
that which they prayed for, that pearl, that groat, that grain of mustard seed
which it was like; and having found it and believed in it, he said unto them,
Matthew. 5.3. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of God.
And in Luke 6.20. And he lift up his eyes on his Disciples and said, blessed be
ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. They had seen it, and were
possessors of it, it was theirs. And Christ said unto his Disciples, There are
some of your standing that shall not taste of death till ye see the kingdom of
God come in power. And his words were fulfilled; they declared what they had
felt and seen; and some of them say, The kingdom of God is not in w^rd, but in
power. And Paul to the Romans writes, Romans ^4.17. who was also made partakers
of the same power and the same kingdom; he spoke his knowledge of, and said,
It Is not meat nor drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy
Ghost. And the Colossians who had waited for it, and believed in that through
which it was revealed; the Apostle was in the same faith, Colos. 1.12. and
13. Who has made us meet partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light,
who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has transformed us into
the kingdom of his dear Son: And those things were seen in the body, and
witnessed in the body: And the Apostle to the Hebrews says, He that believes
is entered into the rest. And this and all these things was feeled within by
the seed immortal the birth immortal, and they that witness the birth immortal
to live in them: One said, Who has made us joyntheirs with Christ who is the
King of eternal glory, and they were Joynt-heirs with him of the Kingdom that
fades not away, and all that ever comes to see the Kingdom of God in the
spirit, which is spiritual, must wait in the spirit, and in it is manifestation,
that so God and his Kingdom, and the things o^ Gods Kingdom may be felt and
seen and enjoyed in the Spirit which is glorious.

Obj^ct. All this which thou have spoken may some say is the Kingdom of grace;
and that we hold there is a twofold kingdom, the one of grace here, the other
of glory hereafter; which none comes to enjoy glory, nor any part of it in this
life, or in the body.

Answ. People has long been blinded with confused distinctions about names;
and being full of imaginary thoughts and conceptions, have brought forth
foolish and unlearned distinctions; and that which God has joined together,
they would separate: Grace is glorious, and glory is gracious; he that can
receive it let him; the kingdom of God, which was like a grain of mustard seed,
afterward it became a great tree; the tree in its strength, and glory, and
height, is more glorious then when its in the seed, yet the seed and the tree
is in nature, and quality, and kind, one; if the kingdom be in dominion in
purity, and power, and glory, is not here unity? yet a greater measure, yet
still the dominion is one, the power one, the glory one, and the thing one,
wherein grace stands and glory stands, wherein the kingdom stands; grace
is glorious, Ephesians. 1.6, 7. Having predestined us unto the adoption of
children, to the praise and glory of his grace, wherein he has made us
accepted in beloved. In the fathers house there are many mansions, places in
the kingdom of God, there are many heavenly places, and they that walked to the
praise of his grace, came to sit also in heavenly places, Ephesians. 2.6 through
grace, salvation, through grace glory comes to be revealed in the earth, Isa.
6*3. The earth is full of his glory; he that makes heaven and earth glorious,
is glory it self, from whence grace and every degree of glory receives its
being; the least measure of Gods strength and power is glorious, and to be
gloried in, in the Lord, by all that have seen it; things might be declared
which God has revealed, which is not lawful for me now to utter; for as one
star differs from another in glory, yet all glorious, even so is it with the
children of the resurrection, who are quickened and made alive, and raised from
the dead, and fashioned like unto his glorious body, partakers of the glory of
God, of his kingdom, of his power; the power is his in which the kingdom
stands, the kingdom his wher^in glory stands, the kingdom, power and glory
stands all in him who is the glorious God, and the God of eternal glory, who is
revealing his power, his kingdom, and his grace, and his glory, unto all that
patiently wait upon him, in that which yet is as a grain of mustard seed; they
will come to feel his presence, his power and glory revealed in their hearts,
through the spirit, and enjoy God in his kingdom, in his power, and in his
glory, and through faith shall see the weight of glory, which God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ will reveal unto all that patiently wait for his
appearance, and in his appearance.

Obj. But some will cry out, grievous blasphemy and error; what, I think you
look for no other glory but in this life, nor for no other kingdom, but what
you enjoy in this life; thus I know dark spirits reasons.

Answ. The Saints looked not after any other glory but that which stood in
eternal life, and in the immortal life, and in the uncorruptible life, and the
Country they sought after, was that which God was the maker and the builder of,
and they looked and waited to receive of his power in which the kingdom
stands, and did in this life (I do not say the full weight of glory) and to
know and enjoy, and to be made partakers of his eternal dominion and authority,
is that which all his Saints in measure witness, and in due time, came to enjoy
through faith; for by faith they saw him who was invisible, and the things of
his kingdom, which is invisible, spiritual and eternal; but to speak of the
carnal corruptible life in the flesh, who are dead while they live there, that
life, neither the kingdom, nor the power, nor the glory of God is revealed to
them, not till after the death of that life, and till after the death of him
who has the power of death, which is the devil, which rules in the hearts of
the children of disobedience, where all the mystery of Gods kingdom is hid
from, from their eyes, and ever shall while in that state; and so let the
serpent be blind, and they that have an ear to hear, blessed is that ear, for
the kingdom of God is come nigh unto many, and the salvation of God, and the
power of his Christ is seen by many, honor and praise unto him everlastingly,
who is the only potentate that puts down all authority under his feet, that
God may be all in all, but first every one must come to feel in himself the
kingdom, which is as a little grain, in himself, and in it believe, before any
can come to know the kingdom, or wherein it consists, and after it be known in
its measure, yet this is far short of glory in the fullness; so many may come to
be partakers of the power in some measure, yet this is far short of the eternal
weight of glory; He that believes is entered into the r^st, and made partakers
of the heavenly gift, and of the heavenly power, and of the heavenly grace,
which is glorious, and does witness a heavenly place in Christ Jesus, and yet
many enemies to be subdued, and much of the heavenly habitation, which they see
not, which comes to be revealed as there is an abiding in the faith, which
stands in Gods power, in which the kingdom stands, the mysteries of God and of
his kingdom, comes in due time to be revealed; through death they come to be
known, (that is to say) through the death of death; for Israel the true type,
after they passed over Jordan, and had taken Jerico and Ai^, and had made an
entrance into the land, yet there was many enemies to be subdued, and much land
and possessions, which they were not made partakers of long after, even so
after there be of the true rest enjoyed and possessed, and an entrance made
into, yet there is many enemies to be subdued, and much of the heavenly
inheritance to be enjoyed by them that stand in the power which gives domion
over sin, the devil, hell and the grave, and they come to be made partakers of
God, and so the enmity being slain, man comes to enjoy God who is eternal life,
and comes to receive the Crown immortal, which God the eternal power and
strength gives in due time, to them that wait in patience and in faith,
through which the immortal inheritance comes to be revealed to all the children
of light.

And so to conclude in few words, this I say unto all, who are longing after
God, and waiting to feel his power, keep in your minds to the pure measure of
Gods holy spirit, and therein wait to see his kingdom, and his dominion, and to
be made partakers of it, which brings the world to an end; and will let you see
to the end of it too, before it was, and him who is now glorified with the
father in the kingdom of God, with the same glory he had with the Father before
the world began, and who so comes to the end of the world, and to the beginning
again, comes to see him and his glory, and the kingdom of glory which fades not
away, which who so comes to enjoy, are eternally happy.
