ORMONDE.

WHereas we are informed that the Price of Corn, and all sorts of Grain, Meal
and Malt, is grown Excessive High in several Parts of this Kingdom, which both
arise as is conceived from the great quantities of Corn which have been of late
carried Out of this Kingdom, into Foreign Parts. We the Lord Lieutenant and
Council for a timely and seasonable prevention of that scarcity, which by such
Transportation of Corn may be brought upon this Kingdom; do hereby in His
Majesty's Name strictly Charge and Commad all manner of Persons whatsoever,
That they do from henceforth until Michaelmas next, Forbear to Ship, Carry, or
Transport any Wheat, Barley, Rye, Bear, Oats, Pease, Pulse, Meslin, or any
Meal, or Malt out of this Kingdom to any other Place whatsoever beyond the
Seas, as they will answer the contrary at their Perils. And We require all His
Majesty's Officers in the several and Respective Ports of this Kingdom, and the
Farmers of the Great Branches of His Revenue, that they do Seize all such
Grain, Meal, or Malt as they shall find to be Shipped after the Date of this Our
Proclamation, and before Michaelmas next with intent to Export the same,
contrary to the true meaning hereof.
