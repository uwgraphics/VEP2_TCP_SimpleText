To the Right Honorable, the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, and all the
rest of the Loyal Citizens.
My Lord,
I Knowing your Loyalty, and the Loyalty of the Aldermen your Brethren, and
moreover I am not ignorant of the Loyalty of those Worthy Men that assisted you
in the worst of Times; for I was an Eyewitness, and a Labourer with you, and I
know the great Pains and Care you all took; and as for Sir John Moore, I shall
never forget him, but I shall always Admire him, because I saw how he was
harrassed about and teez'd on every side; the Threats, and Scandalous Letters,
and Affronts that he took, but with what Patience, Mildness, and Sweetness did
he overcome all, without running them into Prisons, or Revenging of Injuries,
is not unknown to me; but I question whether the strongest Man in the Nation
could have carried off such a great Confusion with so much Peace, but how
little he is Regarded for it, I think it is not unknown; but if all the World
be Ungrateful, I will not, for I will always acknowledge all your Loyalties,
and will endeavor to Reward it, according to my weak Ability, and for this
Reason I will Live with you, and Die for you, because you have been Loyal to
your King and True to the Heir, tho I know you have been blamed by many, and
been Laughed at, and said. What has your Loyalty gained you, for if you had
joined with us, you would never have lost your Charter; but such discontented
Souls shall know that Loyalty does not go unrewarded, for you shall have a
better Charter, and be more Glorious and Happy than ever you have been, if you
be but Wise, to continue Fervent to the end, and be as True to your God, as you
have been Loyal to your King, for you have Acted like brave Loyal Men, when
Roman Catholics dare not appear above-board, and therefore they shall not have
the honor of your Victory; for if there was any Roman Catholic that Acted,
they were Disguised, and therefore it shall go for nothing; for the King is
ours, and none can claim him so rightly as we can, for we own him for our
Supreme Head and Governor, which no others do; no, not the Roman Catholics,
and why then should they rob us of our Crown Jewel, the Breath of our
Noistrils, land such a Soul, that Rome cannot afford the like. O! he is a
Gracious Prince, that excels all the Princes in the World, and do they think to
bereave us? No, I Will fight a Thousand Battles, and by the help of God, I will
regain him again: For I know you are all so Good, that you value the Kings
present and eternal Happiness more than your own Lives and Fortunes, and when
God is pleased to do this, it will make all forsake the Evil of their Ways, and
cleave to him, so this Kingdom that abounds in Wickedness, may be changed into
a Kingdom of Righteousness, and the King will be eternally Glorious for being
instrumental of such a happy Change; but the Church of Rome must not think that
she can do it, for she is built upon the Sands, and she will never endure to
the end: For to Serve God is perfect Freedom, but to serve Popery is perfect
Thraldom, which the Lord deliver his Anointed and every good Soul from; and for
this Cause, that the Enemies should not prevail over you; nor make a prey of
you, I would have you incline your selves to all manner of Goodness, and not to
hugg up your Money as if it were a God, for that cannot preserve nor save you
in the day of his Anger; but consider the deadness of Trade, and the hardness
of Times, and while we are Relieving the Poor of another Country, do not let
us Starve our own, but do good to all both in Body and Soul, in punishing of
Vice and rewardiug of Virtue: This is that which will make your Souls Live when
your Bodies Die, that you may not only be great in this World, but eternally
Happy, through the Merits of Christ, in the World to come, is the Prayer of

Your Lordships Humble Servant, and Souls well-wisher ELINOR JAMES.
