The c^nfession of Ma^ster John Bastwick Doctor of PHYSIC.
I Have heard many Sermons at the Court, yer never did I hear any, wherein I
saw not the PURITAN brought up, with one scorn or other, and some notorious
lies told of them. So that I wonder not that those poor men are thought so
evil of, though a most innocent and harmless people as any lives upon the
Earth. For when the place of God it self, from whence truth should only
sound, is made a Theater of lying and false accusations, no wonder that the
Kings Majesty, and Nobles of the Kingdom, have a prejudicate opinion of them
they call Puritans, when they expect nothing but truth and veritable narrations
from that place.

In my younger days (that I may in something relate my own condition) I was
bred in as great a hatred of Puritans, as any tender years were capable of, as
it is well known, and thought those men not worthy to live, yet knew not any of
them, (our Country having then scarce two in it) neither was there a Sermon
perhaps in half a year thereabouts, and that read out of a paper book, and
half of it commonly was railing against the Puritans. But when it pleased God
that some of those, that spoke evillest of them (through surfeting, and excess
had brought themselves to languishing sickness, and after to Death it self) I
say, when those men, in their greatest extremities, chose rather to trust them,
yea and to prefer them, before their own brethren and nerest kins-folks, and
bequeath their children and Estate into their hands, and then being also
demanded the reason of such trust, and confidence in them, whom they had
reputed the worst of men before, and most of all traduced, and hated, they then
openly declared themselves, and their opinion of them, saying that they were now
dying men, and that it was now time to speak the truth, and that they in their
hearts believed they were the true servants of the Lord, howsoever despised and
contemned in the world and withal they desired that their souls might go the
way that theirs went.

I say, when I saw such a wonderful change in these men, who were many of
them, of knowledge and understanding in all Religions, and some of them
travelers and Courtiers, and that now on their deathbeds, they should give
such an approbation, and so honorable testimony of those men, of whom they had
in their prosperity spoken so maliciously, I being then of years of
discretion, and better able to discern and judge of things that differ, began
more seriously to consider of that matter, and so much the more studious I was,
because I had in some sort, seen the vanity of all pleasures, having indeed bin
bred in nothing else. The right way then to find blessedness, was my only aim:
which through Gods special favor and benediction upon my earnest endevors,
daily reading of the Word and holy Scriptures, private duties, godly society,
and frequent hearing of the word, which is only able to save our souls, J
found out, to the praise and honor of his name be it spoken. And J then well
perceived, looking into the lives and manners of men, that those that were
commonly branded with the name of Puritans, were the happiest, and that if any
were eternally blessed, they were such of them as squared their lives in
sincerity, according to their profession.

And lest that I might through an overweening conceit of some seeming
blessedness in them, be mistaken; I contented not my self with home-comparing
of men and domestical experience, but I resolved to seek out still a more
excellent way, if there were any; whereupon I went into foreign Nations, and
lived amongst all sorts of men, and in the greatest Princes Courts conversing
among all ranks and orders of them, and that many years, and amongst all
professions, Courtiers, Soldiers, Scholars, Citizens, Merchants, and among
all sects, of factions, and religions, and examining all those in the balance
of judgment, I found none in life and death happy, and truly comfortable, but
those that are branded with the name of Puritans, or at least those that live
and dye in their Faith. And for my own particular, to speak now my Conscience,
I had rather go the way of the meanest Puritans, that live and dye according
to their profession, then of the greatest Prelates that ever lived upon the
earth; and this I speak in the presence of God; for of the ones happiness I am
as sure, as the Word of God is sure, and of the others I can promise nothing he
living in Rebellion to God all the days of his life, and his Repentance not
known unto me.

And notwithstanding, I say, all this, that these are such an holy people: yet
are they made but the offscouring of the world, and of all things, and brought
upon every Stage, and into the Pulpit, as fittest for ludibry by the Players,
Priests, and Prelates, yea and in their Courts it is enough to ruin a man's
cause, if his Adversary can but taint him with the name of a Puritan; but most
especially are they vilely abused by the Priests and Prelates in their pulpits.

Now I say, if it be lawful in them, to make plays of honest men, and to
feign what they please against them: I pray let it be lawful in me, in
meriment to speak the truth of them, which as near as I can I will not
transgress. If some shall say, they have not so great trains nor so much ado
in their marching; I affirm, that at all times, they go more like Princes,
then humble Ministers of Christ, and the Apostles Successors, of whom we never
read, they came ever in Coach or on horseback, but when Paul was mounted by
authority; or that they had ever a servant to attend them, much less such
pomp and State: and yet one of them converted more souls in one day, then all
the Prelates ever did that ever I read off: neither to speak truly have I heard
of any they ever converted, but of many thousands they have confounded. But now
to the matter in hand, because one o^ their abetters said not long since, that
they had not such attendance as I accuse them of. I say, if they have less
company one day, they have more an other, and whether they be their own or
others Servants, when they are in their company, be they the nobles themselves,
they are all their attendants, and the best of them most heartily glad if by
their service they can please them, and we know it usual that the
demonstration of the retinu is always from the greatest, and they are found to
be his followers. And I have heard the Pursivants often brag of the greatness
of their Masters attendance, and in such ample manner as I think the Kings
Majesty has not commonly greater: and therefore that cannot be denied, which
is daily practiced, And for their servants insolency I have frequently both
seen it and felt it. Now whereas you think, it will not be well taken that I
call Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, Antichrists little toes; and in my LETANY
desire deliverance from them, and withal seem to accuse them of incontinency,
all which you think will be censured of unadvisednesse at least, if not thought
scandalous and punishable.

To this I answer, first, that By Bishops I understand the Prelates, and by
Priests their own creatures, a generation unknown in the Church of Christ: and
by Deacons the under Priests in this Kingdom, Officers of which the Scripture
knows nothing likewise. For the Deacons such as the Churches chose, and were
allowed by the Apostles, they were men of gravity, full of faith and the Holy
Ghost, men of wisdom and good government and honesty, and were the treasurers
of the faithful and the Church of God, and distributed the liberality of the
Saints amongst the poor indigent and necessitated brethren. Now I know never a
Deacon in England either guilty of any of those virtues before specified. or
that was ever employed in that Office, or was thought fit to be trusted, with
the treasury of the poor, or took the least care of them, whom ordinarily
they trample upon und most reproachfully abuse with the name of rascality. So
that such Deacons as I pray against are limbs of the Beast, and the inferior
order of shavelings and such as ought to be spewed out of the Church as
profitable for nothing but increase of wickedness.

And for Bishops such as God appointed I honor them, and will maintain their
dignity to the last drop of my blood, so far I am from praying against such.
Neither did I ever speak unreverently against the Kings Bishops and those that
were appointed as an order in the State, till they had in their open Court
renounced his authority, and run themselves by that, and many other notorious
proceedings into a Primunire, and so had made themselves enemies to his
Prerogative royal, and delinquents against his Majesty, and under his
Highnesses displeasure, as by the ^tatutes of the Kingdom they are proclaimed
to be, and by the defenders of their proceedings in their Ecclesiastical
Courts: who in a book set forth by their common consent, do conclude all these
in a Praemunire, that challenge their authority Iure devino, as the Pope and
Clergy of Rome, which at this time they do.

And for your better satisfaction, look in the Apology for proceedings in
Courts Ecclesiastical (a book made by the Prelates own creatures) and in the
first Chapter, you shall see all the Prelates by their own witness in a
Praemunire, and delinquents against his Majesty in a high degree of contumacy.

And truly I think there was never such an affront put upon regal Dignity, as
on that day I was censured, never such dishonor put upon the Scriptures, by
such as would be thought Ministers of the word, and the Bishops and Pastors of
Christ: Neither were the Scriptures ever more blasphemously abused, then they
were at that time, in their open assembly, I shall briefly therefore tell you
that days work, of which there are a thousand witnesses, as also impious words
against the most sacred word of God and divine Oracles of holy writ, by all
which, you will see, I have good reason to call them ANTICHRISTS LITTLE TOES,
and to pray against them; for they are as desperately impious, and equally to
be detested of all such as truly fear the Lord and the King. For if we
compare them together, there will no disparity appear between them, they being
every way as malicious against the word of God and his dear servants, and as
diametrally opposing regality as Antichrist himself, But that all things may
the more clearly be evidenced unto you, let me tell you that days proceedings,

You must take notice, that howsoever, they had fained some trivial Articles
against me, they were all by the general consent of the Court thought so
poor, as they openly averred they would not condemn me for them, and so much
the rather, because those that had sworn to them, were proved to be my
Capital enemies, and also, in their depositions to have sworn point blanck one
against an other, and like evil wiinesses could not agree in swearing:
therefore they condemn me only for my book which I writ in defense of Christ
and his Kingdom, and of the Kings most excellent Majesty's prerogative Royal,
and supremacy against the Pope and Popish Bishops, provoked thereunto by a
Papist; to which duty I was bound both by the law of God and the law of the
land, and my special oath, all which I alleged at the bar, and furthermore
added that in writing against the Bishop of Rome, I intend no such Bishops as
acknowledge their authority from Kings and Emperors, but only such Bishops
that usurp authority over Kings and Emperors, aend their fellow brethren and
the Church of God jurc divinos and se I had prefeced in my Book, which I
openly readt here.

And to speak the truth, I looked for favor and assistance in this combat,
from the Prelates; never suspecting that they would have bin my enemies, for
this endeavor, especially I having also in that place alleged the Acts and
Statutes established by the public consent of the whole Kingdom, in which it
was ratified, that the Prelates have all their authority and jurisdiction which
they now exercise, from the King, as immediately derived from him, and to
affirm the contrary, is to be ipso facto an enemy of his Crown and Dignity.
And as the Prelates were an order established by the King and State, I was so
far from opposing them, that I never impeached their dignity in the least thing
in all the book; neither would I ever have meddled with them, if they had kept
their standing; but they like the evil Angels out of pride, not keeping their
1 station, but openly renouncing the Kings authority, and affirming, that Jesus
Christ made them Bishops, and that the holy Ghost consecrated them, and that
they were Princes and had their thrones, and that before Kings, and all this
Iure divino: by all which, they made me their enemy, they being delinquents
against the King. And because I had ratified, what soever I had said in my
book by the Word of God; they as they had before renounced the Kings
authority, and barbarously reviled me for my pains, most impiously, likewise
vilified the holy Scripture, saying in their Sessions, that they looked for
some great matter in my book, finding me so confident, but more diligently
reading of it, they found nothing but Scripture in it, which was the refuge of
all Schismatics and Heretics: and that the Scripture could not be known to be
Scripture, but by the Fathers, nor distinguished from the Apocrypha, but by the
Fathers: nor the meaning of the Scripture could not be known but by the
Fathers: and because the Fathers, as they said, were in their interpretation
diverse from me (which notwithstanding is not so) therefore they condemned me.

But I pray, are not all these blasphemous, Popish, and Damnable assertions,
could worse have b^n forged in the very conclave of hell? Is not this I pray
you, to tell the spirit of God to his face he lies, and to teach another way to
heaven then by the Scripture; which Christ the Son of God sende^h us to, and
all the Prophets and Apostles, as to the Instructers of the simple, and able to
make the man of God wise to salvation, and perfectly furnished to every good
work, and the which the holy Ghost compares to a Guide, and a Lanthorn for
direction; and a light to conduct us in this our Pilgrimage and peregrination
through the errors of the world, and to keep our feet in the paths of truth,
and with the Prelates this great and glorious light; this Scripture must be so
obscure, as it must be inferior to all things that have a power in themselves
to declare and demonstrate their own nature, as fire to be fire, gold to be
gold light to be light. But the Scripture only that cannot be known, but by
the help of others, to be the Word of God, it cannot be the word of God
without the Fathers, and their Interpretation of them; for the Scriptures
themselves they are the only refuge of Schismatics, the cause of all errors,
and that that comes confirmed and proved only from Scripture, is ever to be
suspected with the Prelates. O Blasphemy, yea the book that has nothing but
Scripture, must be adjudged to the fire, and the Author of it given over to the
Devil, fined 1000 ls, and cenfured to pay the costs of suit, and be debarred
of his practice, only support left for the relief of his distressed family, to
the utter undoing of him, his poor wife and children, and all this for sooth,
because there was nothing but Scripture in it. O horrible Impiety! The truth
is, howsoever they seemed to condemn it; because it had nothing but Scripture
that was not the occasion, but the very cause was, because I writ against the
Pope Father Antichrist, such correspondency there is now between the Pope and
the Prelates, that one cannot write against him, but the Prelates say by and
by, that they are meant by it. The Grolls.

IT is worth the looking on, to see the pride of the Prelates, in setting the
Kings picture over their dresser, in the high Commission Court; for they have
placed his Highness standing, with his hat off before their Worships, like a
delinquent, his Crown and Soepter laid low, as the poor Emperors and Kings
were wout to stand before his impiety, the Pope, when they were cited to his
Courts. Of which stories you may read many in King James, his Apology, to go
no farther and in this very manner, have they set up the Portraits of our
renowned King. And the very intrinsecall Marry-bone of the matter is, they
trample upon his Imperial dignity, while they seem to honor him, with whom
they make themselves in the mean time Ch^ckmates: for they say, they were
before Christian Kings, and had their thrones, and that they were not beholding
to them for their Honor, and Dignity of Episcopality, for they were Jure
Divino, that they were.

FINIS.
