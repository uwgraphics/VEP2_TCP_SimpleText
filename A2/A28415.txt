Bloody News from CHELMSFORD: OR, A Proper New BALLAD, CONTAINING A true and
perfect Relation of a most barbarous Murder committed upon the Body of a
Country Curate, who dies of a great Wound given him in the bottom of his Belly,
by a most Cruel Country-fellow, for being too familiar with his Wife.
To the Tune of Chevy Chase.
GIve over, ye rhiming Cavaliers,
That jeered at every turn;
And sung how Jane toward Elders Cur
In flames of love did burn.
You too that writ how Peter's Hugh,
Was Butchers Cuckold-maker;
Or penned the Courtship past between
She-Filly, and the Quaker.
But come Droll-rampant Hudibras,
Laureat of Garden-Paris,
Bring me the great Bruino's spoils,
(That Champion that so rare is.)
For I would do as Nero fell
With Primitive Christians did;
I Would make a Cassock for my Priest,
And (...) him in Boar's hide.
In Essex (which like Afric still
Some Monster is a yiedling,
Where once was bred a Roundheaded Colt,
And now a Cavalier Gelding.)
Near Chelmsford Town a certain grave
Conforming Parson dwelt,
Chaste from the Navil to the Teeth;
Yet this good man was Gelt.
Dull Laymen have small reverence
For any man of worth;
A Churlish whoreson did the feat:
Sad Hint for Holder-forth!
He dreaded not his Ghostly face,
Nor Circle of his Girdle,
(...) him like to Traitor, new*
Cut down, and laid on Hurdle.
Now you that would the story know,
That nothing may escape us,
Hark how poor Levite came to die
A Martyr to Priapus.
There lived a crafty boorish wight
Near Palace Sacerdotal,
Whose Spouse most amiable was.
The Sum of Beauty Total.
Lovelier then she for whom Jove turned
Himself to milk-white Bull a:
Fair Rosamond was not so bright,
Nor half so comely Trulla.
(...)er then smiles of Infant day,
(...) Servant can^'s to Mistress)
Ah* 'twas the Sorcery of that Face*
Led Teacher into distress.
HE spied her first from Pulpit high
In pause, the first Prayer after,
When zeal had turned up white of ey
To stare on Churches rafter.
(Quoth he to self,) why stand I here
(Giving the Glass a jolt)
To utter Sermon by retail
Which might be done by Dolt?
Is not yon Woman purer Text
To handle then an Homily?
Sure 'twould be fruitful truth to teach
Her, duties of a Family.
Thus having thought, in haste he read
To people printed lurry;
Yet, that he could not say it by heart,
For her sake he was sorry.
For now at spawling intervals
His eye did only taste her,
But race was run with greater speed
Then Nun says Pater Noster.
The Swain her Husband all this time
Watch't whilst the Parson Prayed;
He marked his leers when finger was
At end of Sentence laid.
Observed those Arrows shot from sight
At his fair But were levelled.
But swore the Priest had better bin
In mothers womb be-divel'd.
Psalm sung, As from Cornelius Tub,
The Parson came down, reeking;
And till he found that Hobnails house
Vowed never to lin seeking.
At last he came to humble Cot
Shrine, where his Goddess was
Doublet of Straw, Breeches of clay,
And fundament of Grass.
In Age of Gold, as Poet tells,
(Who seldom see such day)
This was the place where Virtue slept
Upon a lock of Hay.
The Dame, right busy at her work,
Sweet butter was a churning;
When at the motion of the stick
Priest's bowels fell a yeirning.
Fair Nymph (said he) incontinent,
Lay by thy Typical Churn;
(And then the Varlet turned aside
To steal a lecherous giern.)
Phy (Angel blessed) why should that hand
A wooden Instrument hold,
Designed to wield a better thing
Then Scepter made with Gold?
Excellent Creature! be as kind
As fair. " An heart obdurate,
" Is Satan's Anvil, where he knocks?
Shall he knock, and not Curate?
O Woman, put the Devilish behind,
But put the Priest before:
Full many a She for Cloke-divine,
Has done as much, or more.
When I commenced Bachelor,
All Cambridg^ ^^^ld adore me:
Why should a thing of feeble Sex
Think much to fall before me?
"This said: Nay, Pish, the good Wife cried:
Nay, stand away, for shame!
"Are you a Minister, and care;
No more for a good Name?
Good Name (quoth he)? with that She smiled;
And so they snugg'd together:
But He had better slept in the street,
Then in her Bed of Feather*
For just about that fatal hour
When Devilish came for Doctor-
-Faustus; as Key of Lead had him,
And in a dead Sleep locked her;
The jealous Bumpkin blunders in:
Unseasonable Guest!
VVelcome as stones in Oats to Horse,
Or Skull at Egypt Feast.
O Caitiff vile, said Countryman;
And caught him by the throat:
I Will wreck my malice on thy blood,
Thou cursed Canonical-Goat.
"Make me a Cuckold, Reading Rogue!
"No Pulpit serve but Susan's?
"Must Susan's Smock your Surplice be?
"I Will take away that Nuisance.
"Good husband, ( quoth the panting wife)
"Proceed in wrath no further,
"Lest you be turned out Churches pale,
"For one committing murder.
" Sir, gentle Sir, the Priest replied,
As well as he could speak*
For Pesant held his Gouty Fist
Hard on his Enemies Neck.
As Tunes, when Finger's taken off,
From Flajolet do come;
So issued words from Curate's mouth,
When Lout removed his Thumb.
"Sir I confess that I have wronged
You, and your loving wife.
Confess and hang, cried surly Boor;
(And strait he drew his Knife.)
The glittering Blade, as keen as that
Which F^lton bought near Tower,
Made Susan's heart go Pit-a-pat,
And Lovers face look sow'r.
"Hold, honest Friend, Sir Roger cried;
"What? will thou take my life?
" No: but I Will seize those arms wherewith
Thou have subdued my Wife.
Though Theologu' wept, and Wife did beg,
Churl slighted words and tears:
And at one gash from Curate took
Musket and Bandaliers.
Thus RVMP in Forest not content
To fell down Timber tall,
Fanatiqu' Slaves stubb'd root and branch,
Nay, Underwoods, and all.
"Now, Sir, ( said Swain) if ever you chance
"Hereafter to be Pope,
"There will not need a sacred Chair
"Your Holiness to ^rope.
"Go, go, live abaste, as Clergy should,
"(Course taken by your betters)
"But come not near to London-town,
"For there live Capon-eaters.
But lo! while Scoundrel thus did taunt
The man of holy Function,
Wife well perceived that body spent
Had need of extreme Unction.
Then did she wring her sweating Palms,
And loudly did complain:
But sighs and groans, and bellows-snout,
To dying Bums are vain.
The blood continually ran
From place as bare as Common;
Yet, even then, good Curate cast
A dying glaunce at Woman.
"Farewell, said he: bid Parsons all
"Beware of Baver's fate:
"For when they shall be served like me,
"Their dumps will be too late.
This said, -- the Curates mortal Cask*
With Ribband hoopt about*
Rolled down the Hill, and slipp(...) Life
For want of Tap ran out.
The EPITAPH.
COurteous Reader! underneath
These Spires of fading Grass
Lies Curate, who (if Wives may judge)*
An able Preacher was.
We hope his Soul in Heaven is safe.
(Though some scarce think so can:)
For, though he sometimes lived upright,
He di'd no Perfect Man.
FINIS.
