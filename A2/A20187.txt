THE Opening of Heaven gates, OR The ready way to everlasting life.

Delivered in a most Familier Dialogue, between Reason and Religion, touching
Pradestination, Gods word, and Man's Free Will, to the understanding of the
weakest Capacity, and the confirming of the more strong.

By ARTHVR DENT, Preacher of the word of GOD, at South-Shoobery in Essex.

Imprinted at London for John Wright, and are to be sold at his shop at
Christ-Church gate. 1610.

The Epistle to the Reader.
THis Divine work (gentle Reader) though the Author left unprinted, yet
coming to his hands that wished a continuance to the memory of the famous
Writer, and a comfort to the soul of the desirous Reader, he thought good to
bring it to the press: and the rather seeing that the points herein handled
(being in themselves very difficult, and heretofore not so plainly expressed)
are here laid down that the meaner capacity may be instructed, and the
skilfuller more confirmed. Here thou may see Reason contending with
Religion, and Religion resolving those doubts which to Reason seem
dissoluable. Here thou shall know, though Reason tell thee, if God have
praedestinated his elect, yet, Religion will tell thee, except thou work out
thy salvation with fear and trembling, thou art none of Gods fore-chosen: If
from hence Reason say unto thee thou have absolute free will, yet Religion will
tell thee that thy willing comes from God. In a word; here Ignorance shall be
taught by Truth, and Atheism confuted by Religion. Then (courteous Reader)
peruse this worthy Work (of the eminent Preacher Master ARTHVR DENT) wherein
thou shall find the ready Pathway to eternal life; through which if thou will
soiourne, at the end thereof thou shall find Heauen-gates set wide open to
receive thee, and troops of Angels ready to carry thee into Abraham his bosom,
where thou shall rest from thy labor, and have all tears wiped from thy eyes.

A fruitful Dialogue between Reason, and Religion touching Gods
Predestination, and man's freewill etc.
Reason. WHO made this world?


Religion. God of his own singular mercy, for the love that he bare unto
mankind.


Reas. Of what substance did God ere^e it?


Reli. Truly of nothing, but by his (...)ly word.


Reas. And is it everlasting, or shall it ^ee have an end?


Reli. The scripture does testify, that shall be destroyed with fire from
heaven, at such time as the Lord has appointed; Moreover we* are informed by
common experience, that it is by nat^^^ sabiect to dissolution.


Reas. I pray you what are we to think^ of God that wonderful workemaster?


Reli. We ought steadfastly to believe, the he is almighty, righteous in ^^^
things, and eternal.

That of nature he is indeuisible, and yet consisting of three distinct persons
the Father, the Son and the ho^^ Ghost. This God is called God of
incomprehenstble wisdom, according t^ which he has most wisely foreseen, and
appointed all things. He is vnchange able, always one, never passionate: ^^ is
the Lord of reueng, the God of Judgment, at whose breath the mountai^^^ ^oe
shake: whose seat is the lofty Che^^^ bines, whose foote-stoole is the earth,
h^ is a iealious God, striking idslators, a^^ such as derogate, from his honor,
wi^^ terrible plagues, He is a consuming ^ire, the king of kings, the only
Lord ^^ all worlds, the beginning, the end, an^ yet without beginning, and
everlasting He is inuistble, though at one ^^ ^^ant beholding all things, at
wh^ ^ecke, the heavens are obedient, t^ clouds dos gather themselves together
and the earth does quiver and tremble: This God rebukes the winds, calmeth
the seas, limiteth to every star his instuence, course and name: this God
formed light, and darkness, sends and calls back lightnings, thunders,
tempests, fearful commets, bla^ing ^starrs, and all other wonderful
impressions of the ayrs; This is the God, that ^ouldeth the huge earth in his
hand hanging like a Globe, in the midest of the world, that fouldeth the
heavens like a ^crowle, that sends the seasonable springtime, Summer, and
Harnest, Frost, Could, Hunger, Famine, and ^^stil^nce: he it is that by a
certain in^used fertility, causes trees, herbs, flowers, and every little
grass to sprout and ^pring, to the behalf of all living creatures. So that
neither birds of the ^^^^ ^e^^ts of the ^^eld, nor the silly worme^ ^^ ^he
earth, do want sustenance: this is ^^at provident God, that conta^neth the
^welling se^ within her ban^^^s, that or^^reth that marvelous waterchange of
^^owing and ebbing w^^^^s, that feeds ^e whales, and every ^^^ing thing
dwel^^ng in the deepes this is that searcher of ^^ret^s: whom no place does
exclude whose presence, no action, word, nor thought can escape. This is the
good God, that created man according to his own likeness, made him Lord of
the earth; And when he had played the rebe^ against him, that recomforted him
being thrown out of Paradise with the promise of the seed of the woman: This
God is he that sent his people Israel remedy when they were in thraldom, in
the land of Egypt, that parted the red sea, and drowned their enemies, that did
safe conduc^ them in the wilderness, that rained down Manna, that defended
David from the force of Saul, that foiled the G^ ant, that saved Jonas in the
bottom o^ the sea, that delivered Daniel out o^ the Lions den, Jeremy out of
the dung^ on, the three children out of the hot consuming Duen: he is that God
that se^ his well-beloved son, to abide the death, to redeem mankind from the
bondage of sin, and from the iawe^ of satan: Finally this is that God by
whole power all things were man and by whose only providence eue^ thing is
effectually moved, ordered, a^^ brought to pass.


Reas. All praise therefore be unto this ^od most mighty, most righteous, and
^ly, that on this tender wise has loved ^wnworthy wreatches, deserving no^^ing
but the rigor of his Justice. Now I ^ay you declare what was the caus^at moved
God to create man and to set ^im in the world?


Reli. That he should serve him, and ^cri^ie him.


Reas. Which is the way to serve God, ^d to glorify hi^^right?


Reli. To acknowledge him, as he has Romans 1. 16.
appointed by his word.


Reas. Which call you the word of God?


Reli. The same which the Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles received by the
^^ly ghost, and committed to writing, which we call at this day by the name of
^e eld and new testament. Ephe. 2. 20.



Reas. How should a man know, that those monuments left by the Patriarchs,
Prophets, and Apostles, came from God: or that they did ever leave behind them
^^y such writings, as we term the old and new testament.


Religi. As touching the authority thereof, though the orderly disposition of
the wisdom of God, the doctrine it self, sau^ring nothing of earthlinesse, the
Godly agree*ment of all parts together among themselves the majesty of God
shinyng forth in that homeliness of speech, the laying together of the
foresayings of the prophets, and the successes of the same, and many other such
arguments, may ^o^pell the wicked ones to confess, that God is the only Author
of the Scripture yet certainly by none other mean, the^ by the secret
testimony of y^ holy Ghost are our barts truly persuaded, that it is the word
of God, for says y^ Apostle, that which we preach, is the word of faith: And
Ro^* ^. 8
in another place, the whole Scripture (says he) is given by the inspiratio^
of God.


Reas. But what do you say to those sel*lowes ^. Ti. 3171
that account the scripture, a dou^sed or positive law, made for civil
government only and authorized by Antiquity, as if it were the divine word of
God, least man not being restrained of the heddinesse o^ his own affections by
some other terror then that of corporal punishment, should Atheyst. ^^
not yield himself unto necessary order?


Rel. For my part, I have little to say t^ those Monsters, neither by the grace
^ God, in any society, will I have to do with them, but my prayer, shall be that
the lord will suddenly turn their hearts, or ^ his good timt, pay them their
just de^rts. Truly of this sort of me^, I thank God, in all my days
(although I have ^ard of many) did I never know more ^en three, which if it had
pleased the Th^^^ br^th^^^.
lord, were to many by two and one; these ^ree, were natural brethere^n, men
ma^^lous politic insundry sciences, and ^orldly wise, but we the judgments
of God: the two ^ounge^ were hanged, not many years since justly condemned for
^^gh ^reason, and the third being the elder ^rother, was taken in adultery, and
with ^ knife ^iabbed in, and slain by the hands of his own wife: and so far
as I vn^erstand, ther^ is not one of the name left ^liue. The fool (says the
Prophet) does Psa. 14. 1.
say in his ^^^art there is no God, and doubt^esse they which with their toungs
do propha^e his word deny not y^ same thing, or at least y^ which is as ^u^l:
for besides, that between God and his word there is ^lwaies a mutual
relation, so as the one ^^ not without the other, we find in the John. 1. 1.
Scripture, that God is the word; ^s for all those that are departed this life,
in that mind, I leave them to God, (though without repentance, we say they
could not b^ saved,) And as for those that be yet ^^ uing I look for nothing
more assuredly then to hear tell of their ruin, and so likewise I leave them.


Rea. There is yet an other sort, which do not so brodely blaspheame God, as
those Papist^
incredulous wretch ^^ of whom we have spoken: But they affirm, yea and
that very boldly, that through the diversity of translations the Scriptures are
falsified in suc^ wise, that no certenty is left, for belief to rest upon.
This thing although with the grau^ and learned sort may happily not go for
pay*ment, because they are able to judge be twixt every translation, and his
original yet are the mean sort shrewdly handle^ with that suggestion; for thus
streach the^ out that objection. The Scriptures (say they were delivered by y^
Patriarchs, Prophe^^ An object.
and Apostles, set down in the Hebrew, and Greek toungs, afterward
^^anslated aft^ diverse fashios by men: yea suchmen as w^^ either ignorant of
the truth, ^^partial ^ their own ^on ceits, for does ^ot the di^ agreement of
our English translations be^^ witness, and make the case plain enough.


Reli. I know these wranglers somewhat Trim objectors.
to well, and do p^^^eaue the wiliness, not of them (as ^ (...)) but of
S^tan: These men, because they can no (...) ger with their
Pope-holy-righteousne^^^ sit in the consciences of the Godly, and cause them to
embrace that whoredom of the sea of Ro^^, would yet be loath, that Satan should
^eese his intrest, in those that may be ^^ayed, by any swing of reason, to
incline to their part, if those good men would be so good, as to show forth our
errors, they should both be heard and thanked. I remember well yt I have
often heard this objection, but who were Answer.
ye obiectors? truly a few sillymen, either papists, or Newters of some little
judgment more then horses, at whom the wise do laugh, and the Godly hearted
spew. It is sufficient for our assurance, that the Lord has promised, to be
such a patron, and protector of his word, That it Mat. 24. ^5.
shall not perish, when heaven and earth shall be brought to naught; and that
he will have no title added to it or diminished from it. Therefore let us give
them over, and harken to our Savior Christ, promising that. Whosoever
believes shall be saved, is, Apo. 22. 18 19. Mar. 16. 16 Ioh. 20. 29. Romans 10.
13. Act. 16. 31* Job. 3. 3 (...)
blessed, shall be pardoned of all his sins, and have life everlasting. And
contrariwis^ ^^^eatning, that, whosoever believes not, (...) never be saved
but abide the cuerlasting ^^rse of God.


Reas. Well let thus much suffice concerning the word of God. Now I pray God.
you let us return, to speak of God somewhat more: you say that the nature,
or essence that is common in the godhead, among the persons of the Father, the
Son, and holy Ghost, is one single substance, unable to be severed?


Reli So I say indeed, for otherwise should it come to pass, that so many
persons as there be, so many Gods should there be severally divided: therefore
these three persons united together, in nature, are never separated, but
distinguished, so as the father, is the father only, the Son, the Son
only, and the holy Ghost, the holy Ghost only.


Reas. As these three persons are but one God in godhead, so, are they likewise
of one euerlastingnesse or eternity? and of one equality without degree?


Reli. Yea truly, save that in order, (...).
the father is the first* being of none, but himself alon^^ the Son is
second begotten Ord^^*
of the Father: the holy Ghost is the third, by an unspeakable manner
proceeding of them both.


Reas. Surely so far as I can perecaue, this mystery, is most wonderful, and
impossible to be conceived by man?


Reli. Therefore full wisely has he taught us to beleene, and reverence the
secrots of God, that says, Fides non habet meritum vbi ratio habet
experimentum.


Reas. Besides these, what other things Exodus 20. 5.
are we to consider chiefly in God?


Reli. That he is exceeding just in punishing Mercy and justice.
the disobedient, and wicked, and that he is exceeding merciful to the Godly,
and such as love him, for it is written, that unto such the Lord is merciful
and gracious, slow to anger, abundant in goodness and Exodus 34. 6.
truth, reserving mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression.


Reas. But it seems by this order of his mercy and justice, that some things
do come to pass, which God wills not, otherwise should there need no
punishment, and therein I cannot perceive, how his omnipotency is not impeached?


Reli. Doubtless he could not be God, if any thing should happen, that he
would not have come to pass, whereof the Apostle was full wary in this saying,
God brings all things to pass according to Ephesians. 1. 11.
the council of his own will.


Reli. Yet can I not perceive, how his Justice and mercy, do agree together.


Reli. These two are reconciled, and well made manifest, in his son. For
after our first parent Adam, by the eternal decreement, had cast himself,
and al his progeny, into the defilement of sin, God did raise him up again
in this second Adam, even Jesus Christ, for which Apo. 13. 8.
cause he is called, the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world.


Rea. What mean you by that word sin?


Reli. I call any thing sin, that in thought, word, or deed, is committed
contrary Mat. 5. 28.
to the law and will of God.


Rea. And may a man say without sin, that sin is willed by God?


Reli. Surely God ought not to be called the author of sin* for how can
iniquity issue from that fountain, where nothing is, save only the clear^
water of righteousness? Notwithstanding, so far am I of from holding him a
sinner, that reverently does ascribe all things to the providence of God, that
I account him rather an Ignorent, and blasphemous sinner that supposes any
thing to happen by fortune, or chance, as if God were ignorant, or careless
thereof.


Reas. Here I perceive the nail is driven to the head, therefore you had need
go discreetly to work, least God be disabled in any thing, that is dew to his
omnipotency, A mean t^^* be observed.
or that more be attributed to his power, then agrees with his justice. Verily
this is the thing, wherein I have not only long time longed to be instructed,
but also been greatly troubled in mind about the same: I pray you therefore
what is the providence of God?


Reli. By this word providence, is Providence what it i^.
meant the incomprehensible foreknowledge, and wisdom, whereby from the
farthest end of eternity, God did behold, appoint, and provide, when, where,
and wherefore, all things in heaven and earth should be: as also his
unmeasurable, and omnipotent power, by which he has brought, brings, and
will bring, all the same things, in their seasons, effectually, to pass,
according to his own will and purpose.


Reas. But since the Lord is righteous, and so far off from willing sin,
that on the contrary part, he does not only forbid it, but also most
grievously punish it, how can we say that sin does attend upon the ordinances
of God?


Reli. Certainly my very soul does Neither rash, nor ^^morous.
fear, least by over much boldness, I should violate, or seem to neglect
that rule of reverence, that in Gods behalf, is to be observed: On the
otherside I would be loath, that by to much cowardice, I should dishonor the
truth: therefore as there want not testimonies of scripture, to warrant this
doctrine, so I think it not unmeet, that herein, I follow that general
sentence of the Apostle, whereof we have already spoken, namely, that Ephesians.
1. 11
God brings all things to pass according to the council of his own will,
and least I may s^en^e to give to much liberty, to my own interpretation, I
will also incline to the doctrine of Saint Augustine who says to the very same
effect. The will of God is the chief and principal cause of all manner of
actions, and motions whatsoever, for there is nothing, that August. de
trinitat. lib. 3.
proceeds not from that unsearchable wisdom and will of his. Of these two
we gather, that if the will of God, be the principal, and original cause of
all things, that is to say, of all actions and motions: Either that sin does
come to pass according All things are done by the will of God.
to that sovereign will of his, or else that sin is nothing at all: that is
to say neither action, nor motion, which obsurdity by no means can be granted:
wherefore under these two banners, though the first may animate a right
cowardly soldier, I dare now more bouldly show thee a reason of mine own, and
this it is: By Angels and men did sin take possession of this world, as
appears rightly, in the derlining of our first parents. Adam and Eve. But
neither Angels nor Argument.
men, were ever separated from the government, and subjection of their Lord and
maker. Ergo. Sin does possess the world, by the ordinance, that is to say
the will and appointment of God: This thing is witnessed by the ^^ostle. who
says, that: No man shall re^i^^^^e will of God. Moreover behold says the Romans
9. 19.
Lord I have created the Smith that blows the coals in the fire, and him
that brings sorth an Instrument for his work. Esaias 56 41.
I, I say, have created the destroyer to destroy. Many such testimonies may be
recited out of the word of God; But because the wicked will here take the bitt
in their teeth (accompting God the author A restraint to the wicked.
of sin) and run on headlong after their own appetite, to all kind of
mischief as though it were not meerley unlawful: we must before we go any
further, seek to abate their courage, and take away that buckler, where-vnder
they will shield and defend their pretended innocence; Therefore, although by
that almighty eye of God, nothing does pass in the whole world unseen, and
therefore not vnwilled: yet cannot God Romans 9
be called the Author of evil, for says the Apostle, there is no
unrighteousness with God.

But the corr^^^^^n of the mind of the first mon (sai^^ ^^^^ter Calvin) by
which we are ^^c^me ^^eers ^ame partly by the pr^^^^ement of Satan, partly by
Man not to ^^ excused

^ument: That is the only cause of ^ne, which excludes all causes besides
self.

But man in the wicked actions of ^olatry, Murder, Adultery, Theft, and ^^h
other neglects the commande^^nt of God, and so far forth as in him ^^th,
excludes all causes, save his ^ne wicked lust only, Ergo: Man in ^t respect,
is the only cause of sin (...) justly deserves the wrath and correction of
God, as witnesses the Prophet, saying, thy destruction O Israel comes O
sec. 13.
of thy self.


Reas. I have heard thee say ear now, that Angels and men were created
according Angels and men.
to Gods own likeness, that is, of a sound and upright disposition, and will:
which thing truly is very convenient, in the eye of reason, for if they had
been ordained evil by nature, or to that end, that they should decline from
that estate by the will of God, it would argue God to be unrighteous, at least
in respect of that purpose of his.


Reli. Nay it is rather an inconvenience many ways which thou vtterest except
the will of God were not worthy to be the rule of righteousness; but s^ what
other absurdities do arise out o^ Absurdities
this suggestion of thine, as this: God created Angels and men in all points
sound not pretending that they should degenerate, nevertheless they are become
evil and have perverted that estate of integrity, Ergo they have broken the
will of God and conuayed themselves out of his o^ dinance: as who should say
they are therefore exemted from all subjection of their maker, because they
have been stubburne against him. Again, al men at this day are corrupt and
evil. Ergo, All men that are now living, are without the compass of the
ordinannce of God. These and many other such absurdities, do follow
necessarily of thine objection.


Reas. Nay Sir, herein as I take it you have deceued your self, with plausible
Essential estate.
surmises: sor if the essential estate of man be considered apart, from his
faulty quality, not only Adam in the time of integrity, was the subject of
God, but after his fall also, and in this case may the consequent prove, that
the whole route, or sort of wicked men are comprehended within the ordinance of
God; Nevertheless the corruption of natue and all the evil actions of men,
may simply be transferred to the will and malice of Satan, and Corruption.
the fraylty of the workers.


Reli. Truly I must needs confess, that this shift proceeds not altogether
from simplicity. Notwithstanding if we ^end our affection simply to accept of
the ^ame, we shall fall very fondly to consent, (...) the blasphemous Maniches,
which do oppose Blasphemy of the Maniches.
Satan against God, for yet again, how shall God be omnipotent, if any other
success of things fall out, then as does best agree, with his good pleasure?
nay then how shall we not take the holy Ghost napping with infinite leasings
which says, there is no evil in the City, which the Lord has not done.
Again Amos. 3. 6. Lamenta. Iere. 3, 38.
out of the mouth of the Lord proceeds good and evil: he has made all
things for his own sake, yea even the wicked, for an evil day etc.
Notwithstanding, if we alude to that will of God, which he has reveled unto
us, according to which he is truly said to be God, that can in no wise will
sin, but he shall forth with be unrighteous, Prou. 16, 4
so far am I from not consenting thereunto, that on the contrary part I yield
the whole assent of my soul. But Two things to be observed.
that we may discourse of this matter more familiarly, we are especially to
observe two things: the first whereof is this: how, or in what sort sin entered
into the heart of man: the second, of what effect or power sin is against God,
these two, shall make it manifest enough, that Satan never hitherto did,
neither shall a^ any time, hereafter, ruffle out his part, either in this world,
or elsewhere, without ^is pattent, or commission from the Lord: The first.
^s touching the first of these, we agree according to the scripturs that Adam,
in his ^state of innocence in all the instrumen^all par^s of his body, had a
proportiona^le resemblance, as well in soul, as mind to the Image of God (I
mean not in person, but in holiness) so that he stood at that time in such
high and heavenly perfection that no tittle could be added for Note well.
his greater integrity: how be it we are well assured, that God never did
beauti^e him with the ornament of constancy whereby he might have obtained
ableness, and power to stand out in that e^tate. Now therefore is it manifest,
that ^inne, beginning at the same vnconstanty, to insinuat among the good ^arts
of Adam took not even there his very original as a thing happening, or coming
by chance, for this only reason, that God would not furnish him (as in truth
there was no law to bind him) with constancy, (...) well as with all other
notable endou^ents, as in whom he had foreordained, that y^ high estate should
be tickle, and but change ably good. For how was it possible, that any thing
should intrude it self into the work of God, where of he was not only most
wary, and heedful, but of power also to intercept any thing that might osseud
him? for this cause doubtless, it is said. That the people of Israel, and the
gentiles Act. 4. 27. ^8.
did gather themselves together, against our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to
do what soever the hand and counsel of God, had appointed to be done from ever
lasting, in whom (says the Apostle) we were predestinate before the foundation
of the world. Finally we find that before Ephesians. 1. 4.
the instant of man's creation, mu^^ more then before he fell away from
righteousness, God had planted in the ga^ daine, a tree of the knowledge of
good and ^uil: In this truly can we perceive one ^ther appearance of truth, but
that God unchangeable purpose would have hi^ to taste thereof, although he were
forbi^ dent for why? had not this thing bin pr^fixed by the decrement of God,
why mad^ he that tree of nature by yt self contr^^ to all the rest? why made he
any different of good and evil at al? who without doub^ could have made as
easily the things y^ ^ would, as he can easily do the things that be done.
Why made he any of the instruments whereby man was changed, ^amely, Satan, and
the Serpent: lo thou ^ost perreaue (I hope) day light at this little wicket.

As touching the second thing herein to The second.
be observed, namely, of what power or efficacy sin is against God, I say
that albeit many fond and untoward witted men, have maintained in time past two
original beginnings of things, ascri^ing to good things, GOD for the author,
and to the evil things the devil, whom with his evil things, they
diuel^ishly deemed more eternal, then God and good things, and that Maugre the
might of God, the devil played all his ungracious pageants: yet considering,
that every man but meanly instructed in the ^chole of reason, is ready to spew
at this ^lasphemy: I hope a few testimonies, from among many, may serve to
suffice the Godly: we read therefore in the history Job. 1. ^
of that righteous man Job, that Satan could not once touch his person, goods,
nor cattle, before such time, as the LORD had given him leave. Likewise, the
deuells besought our Savior Mat. 8. 31.
Jesus Christ saying: If thou cast v^ out, suffer us to go into the heard of
swine Moreover, if we should hunt out by curious speculation, the creation of
angels the cause, m^^mer, time, and place of their fall, (which little
partaineth to edification but rather to seed their itching and fantastical
ears, that cannot content them selves, with the simplicity of faith) we should
find that Satan in his first esrate was the creature of God, and there fore can
have but a power subject, in the execution Note well.
of such wickedness, as he executes.


Rea. Be it as thou have said, for it accords well with reason: But let us

cause of Adams sall, namely the serpent because I would gladly understand,
whether he served Satan as an instrument in that enterprice, or whether of his
own malice he did help to delude the woman, knowing before hand the
Lamentable event o^ transgression.


Reli. Truly albeit the serpent was most subtle of beasts, before such time
as the gift was taken from him for his fault, and in that respect like enough
to malign the estate of man, if he wear capeable thereof; yet do I perceue
no reason, that he should have any insight The serpent.
at all, into the calamity, of transgression; Nor yet that he might any way be
incensed by mal^tious pretense, to bring mankind into Apostasy: But this does
offer it self more meetely to mine opinion, that Satan, (as says M Calvin in
his exposition, upon that part of Scripture) having then had no familiarity, or
communication with man, standing then in need of an instrument, did choose out
the subtle Serpent, because he was the aptest, or most active for such an
exployt, into whom for the better finishing thereof, he conneyed himself, and
so gat access, more fitly to the woman.


Rea. Well then, as for thine arguments of Gods divine providence, truly I
must needs confess, that I find them in some respect so plausible, and
matching with reason, that thou do almost compel me to yeald unto thee: yet
for as much, as God is thereby Objections against providence.
brought in suspicion of evil I draw back and dare not franckly yeald my
consent: Therefore may it not be said, that GOD does appropriat all things
which have any instinct of nature, besides man to his own direction, and turn
man over to his peculiar choice of well, or ill doing, having reason and the
word of God, as Lanterns to guide him aright.


Rel. Uerrily neither can I perceue any reason that should move the Lord to

was to abuse himself, and to incline to the evil part; Except God were well

these I say, and almost 1 Cor. 3 5.
infinite numbers of such like, do these devout men, as though it were for the
only defense or safety of a Christian commonweal, violently and with whole
thousands of bloody combats, and challenges, like foolish bold champions,
maintain the quarrel of man's free will and power.

And why* for sooth because they would in no wise entangle God, or bring him in
within the lists or compase of evil, this devotion of theirs, will not suffer
them, to entertain such testimones of Scripture, as do make mention of Gods
predestination and providence, wherein they show themselves more nice, or would
be accounted more holy, then the Holy Ghost himself: well let it be that all
their sturres and bra^les do issue forth of that fountain of zeal, and not
from the slaughterhouse of infidelity, and Pagamsme, yet says the Apostle:
All this Romans 10. 2.
zeal is blindness and damnable, as not being seasoned with the Salt of
knowledge: woe be to him, (says the Prophet) that for saketh God, to make
flesh his right arm; Yea hear me not, says our Savior Ioh. 8. 17.

complain by the month of the Prophet saying, I have nourished and brought up
children, but they have rebelled against Esa. 12. 31

But that we may better bethink us, and not so negligently pass over that
pure and unspotted, Roman Catholic zeal, it is necessary that we call
back the nature of mankind to her first creation. And the^ if it be demanded
whether free will were in man's nature at his first creation; I answer, (and yet
not I) but the word of God) there was so, for I make no do (...) free will, be

thing, that yet was not entered into the world, especially, seeing with the
whole assent of his mind and body, he was disposed to obey the commandment of
God: Furthermore, behold I pray you the gallant zeal of these Godly men: which
will in no wise suffer y^ Scripture, according to the wisdom of God, to
transfer all the actions of men to the foreknowledge of The Papist^ zeal.
God: and yet they themselves, will not only not cease with most hateful
blasphemy, to prove him an outward consentor to al ungraciousness, but also
more blasphemosly go about to attaint the very nature of God, of so much
abontynation, and wickedness, as by that general propagation, is descended
from Adam, into his progeny. Here have I need to bestur me apace, for if I
handle not the matter right nimbly, this bold challendge, shall quickly bring
more fists about mine ears, then mine own; but it is no matter, I fear not
the quarrel, and therefore must I now make it good, though I seem to stand in

set before him fire and water, and commit the accepta^ce of either to his
choice; but I find y^ he said unto him, thou shall not taste of the tree, if
thou do, thou shall die the death: go to Genesis 3.
the^: the will of God was always righteous, even so was Adams freeness,
freely righteous, according to y^ righteousness of God, save that it was
cha^geable: but if the defendant will not for shame say, that sinful appetite is
righteousness, either let him confess that Adam had the same appetite, y^ did
carry him from hi^ pure estate somewher else, the^ immediately from y^ hand of
God by creation: or else, let him conclude against God, that that uncleanness
of Adam, came from an vnclean^ workemaister: or at the least that Adam was
never the image of the righteous God, and so consequently prove God a liar, in
that he did so call him. If all this be to no purpose, I desire to be resolved,
how the Papist has not done open wrong to God, and wherein my assertion is
false, they say (perhaps that which they would not) that only the nature of
God, I mean^ his righteousness according to which he created Ada^ has some
respect of evil, as Note.
also y^ there proceeded from y^ hand of God a substa^te corrupted, naturally
inclinable to inquity, but moreover, and most untruly, y^ God by a palable
indifferency, and lukewarm affection, has given his own outward consent, to
all the wickedness of the world, if this were true then shall we never have
needed Jesus Christ, to pay our debt, for no remission needs, if a commission
be once granted: but the word, or commandment of God, does refrain us of all
manner of evil, therefore may we steadfastly believe, that God never gave man
free will to commit evil.

Now Sir let the indifferent give sentence, whether these men have committed
high treason against God, or I have cited them to answer for themselves, by
just accusation: if it be found, that I have done them injury, I will not fail
to seek some way, to make them so large amends, as my fault shall be adjudged
to require, and so to appease their charitable anger: if they be found to have
retained no more modesty or defense, zeal must be ordered by the word.
for the righteousness of God then his own word, let their zeal (a Gods name)
be condemned as foolish, and that I may use the words of the Apostle, without
knowledge: and they at last leave off their freewill and meritorious
righteousness, and Romans 10 2.
reverently give place to the word of God which is not ashamed thus bouldly to
plead in the behalf of his omnipotency, and providence in ruling, and
disposing the actions of all things. The Lord did harden, the heart of Phara^.

Therefore it fared with Adam i^ The cause why Adam fell.

to the gentle courtesy of Lady-fortune. If because we seem to carry the head
in our own hand (which never the less are for the most part restrained of
those things we would) he will say, that God had no purpose, when yet we were
not, what to do with us. What ass will not laugh, if he shall confess, that,
that purpose is inviolable, seeing in all earthly causes the Lord works by
means? who will not think him mad, that shall exclude our thoughts, words
and deeds, from working the end of Gods foreknowledge and purpose?


Rea. But if God in this sort be the worker of all things, it seems that all
freedom of mans-will is bereft, and truly this is even as much as to deny man
to be a reasonable creature.


Rel. Although I have not detracted Freedom of will.
from the freedom of will, so much that thou have cause to gather that
consequent out of my words: yet for my better answer to this objection, I will
use the help of Saint Augustine, who says. It is undoubted that we do will,
when we will, and that we do work, when we work; but to be able to will, and
to be able to work; he brings to pass in us, of whom it is said, God is
he, that works in us, both to will, and to do, again the August. de great.
and lib. Arbit. cap. 16.
same Augustine, which of us (says he) dare avouch that man kind was utterly
spoiled of freewill by the sin of the first man? freedom perished in deed
through sin, but it was that freedom, where with man was created in
Paradise, free to enjoy full righteousness, and imortallity: for the which the
nature of man stands in need August. against Pelag. 2. epist. 1. book. c 2,

do deliver you then shall you be free indeed, free I mean to live well, and
uprightly: for so far is it off, that freewill did perish altogether in
sinners, that by the same freewill, men do offend, especially they that take
pleasure in sin, and which being delighted with sin, do with pleasure
greedily follow their own lusts: thus much S. Augu.

And now to conclude, if by that freedom Freedom granted.
of man's will which thou say is bereft, by the doctrine of providence, thou
mean that man does not evil willingly, and with a plain consent and
tractablenesse unto Satan the tempter, so far am I from bereauing him of that

righteousness: for the more certinty, let a man enter into himself, and
consider, whether it be compulsion, that does cause him to sin, or his own
voluntary will, and I doubt not but he shall soon perceue the whole fault in
his own freewill: but if by freeness, thou mean never so little an ableness
of man's own proper strength, to perform never so little good o^ evil: I
willingly d^e embrace thy objection; namely, that man has no freedom at al,
Fredome denied.
under the warrant of all those places of Scripture which I have already cited
to that effect, and many other such: for who knows not, that if the Lord
himself, by his only magnificent power should not continually support the
world, that we should anon be made an hotchpatch, and tumbled together into
utter confu^^on? how then can we have the face to say, that we have hability
to do this good thing, or that bad thing, be it never so little, as of our
own proper strength.

On the otherside, if thou mean the Papists deliberating, or chosing
free-wilt, as being authorized by God to do, or Another kind of of freedom
not to do his own commandment, who will not laugh at this (...)? for how
can there be free liberty given, and yet a sharp restraynt? again, as we have
already said, those free-willians cease not to make the Lord of so gross and
rude understanding, as if good and evil were all good in the eye of God: but
how can that br^bling be true, when the price of righteousness was feign to be
paid, with the blood of Jesus Christ? or how could he call for satisfaction,
when as by a certain carelessness he had consented to evil, except he were new
^angled according to the manner of men?

against God.

1. First and chiefly, that he is careless of man, whom in such sort he has
given up to himself. 2. Secondly, that God is vain, and idle: for how can he
be otherwise, yt without any mediation, or request, has done such things as
himself in no wise regards. 3. Thirdly, that the Scripture bearing witness
of his tender love, and ^elousts over his people, is false. 4. Fourthly, that
he never sent Jesus Christ, to pay the ransom of our sin. 5. Fifthly, that he
made not man for his glory, with that Angelical difference from insensible
creatures to serve him, but rather to obey his own lust. 6. Sixthly, that God
does communicate with some fellow parteners, as Satan, fortune, or man, in the
government of those creatures, that be his own. 7. Seauenthly, so far as I
can perce^ue, we might from hence show presidents of authority that it is not
unlawful for us to live careless of God altogether, for if God be careless
of us, by what mean should he bind us to so much duty and a legiaunce, as he
has commandstd by his own word; nay it should seem that we might be careless
of such a God as had in none other sort vouchsafed to provide for our safety:
but we know, that all these are false, and therefore do find our selves most
bound to serve our God in all thankefulnes and dutiful obedience.


Now Sir, if Master Adversary will Works foreseen.
cast about, and come upon me with this double blow, according to his custom,
and say, God foreknew indeed from everlasting who were his, and according to y^
same fore knowledge, determined of man all after his desert should requier; and
that answerable to y^ proportion of his good or evil, God did foresee and
purpose to shape out his rewards for him, like to the Tailor, that for saving

my message in his care which otherwise may seem to call him open liar, Saying:
The purpose of God Rom 9. 11. 12.
does examine according to election, not of works, but of him that calls:
and again Romans 11.
That election is of grace and not of works. On the other side, the over
sitting of slat contraries does require, that the reprobates or ^seastes,
should be rejected according to the judgment of God, whom he had prepared for
his glory to destruction: for so does the Apostle witness; besides this also,
very reason does instruct Romans 9. 22 The reprobate predestined.
us, that as often as y^ Scripture makes mention of the predestination of the
chosen sort, so o^t is the predestination of the reprobats confirmed: Now
therefore to give free will his packing penny, we may boldly say, y^ if free

or required to set forth ye assistance of his grace.


Reas, What think you then, of the permission, or sufferance of God, whereby
he is said to suffer sins.


Rel. If in sufferance, we observe always this thing, that God works not
properly in the wicked, but does leave them over to Satan, and their own lusts,
and yet reserve his providence, that he may not stand as an Idle looker on,
surely we ought not to reject it, but if any shall go about, to set Gods
sufferance, and his will at odds, he shall loose his labor, and prove
himself a fool. Hereupon says M, Beza full well, in his book M. (...)
of questions and answers, if sufferaunce be matched against willingness,
first I say it is faulse, and secondly utterly against reason. That it is false
is manifest by this, y^ if ^od suffer any thing to be don against his ^ill,
then surely is he not God, that is to ^a^, almighty: But if he be said to
suffer ^ thing, as though he were retchlesse, ^ow far are we from the
opinion of ^picurus? It remains then, that look what he su^^^reth, to be
dove, he suste^th i^ willingly: herewith does Saint Augustine, ^^^ee saying: If
we suffer such August. against Julian, lib. 5. cap. 3.

^hought accessaries to their wicked^ esse, ^^t God does permit sin to range

there^e to stop the mouths of cauillers, which in no sense will away with
this ^^inction of will and sufferance, but ^on do give sentence by a necessary

most evidently appears: Ergo, they are all cauillers that do say that GOD

Rea. Thus have thou not only defended, and very sufficiently proved the
providence of God, but also as it were by the hair of the head haled free will
of choosing, and all idle sufferance out of doors* which in truth have been
the professed enemies to the same providence of old time: Now therefore I pray
you declar^ in what sort GOD does will sin, and ye^ Gods will and punishment.
Justly punish it with that dreadful destruction of body and soul.


Rel. Thou know the will of God is only the rule of righteousness from

limiteth the courses of righteousness, is not only transgressed, ^ut also no
spark of inclination found ^^ man to perform the righteous^esse therein
required, therefore ^oth the LORD most justly punish ^^nne.


Reason. But this is no answer, for if ^obee the LORD does appoint man ^o
sin for his glory sake, and neuerthe^esse restrayning the execution thereof*
(...)se his rod or correction, shall it not ^e said, that God is unrighteous,
in that ^ee stretches forth his hand upon In^ocents.

may not seru^ sufficient, take this by the way which we have already handled:
The cause o^ sin is resiant: but the cause wherfor^ sin does become sin,

the doer, but to the event and success of the matter, ^t may in no case be
doubted, but God ^oth excute his will by Satan, and all the wicked company of
men: As for example: Examples.
it is said that the Cauldaeans were appointed of God to punish the disobedient
Israelites, theeefore as far as they wrought according to this appointment
which was secret, and kept close from them, they did the will of God: but

Rea. I perceive then the will of GOD Will to be taken two manner of ways.
is to be taken two manner of ways, to wit, either for that provident and
unsearchable wisdom, not always manifested to the world, by which al things
are most measurably ordered according to the everlasting purpose of god; in
which sense we ought to detract nothing from y^ good pleasure of God, because
he should not be omnipotent, if any small success of thinge^ should sal out
contrary to the same: and also that Gods will is taken for that, which by word
or commandment, he has opened unto us, the performance whereof is only good
and acceptable in the sight of God.


Reli. So it is.


Rea. But may we not say that GOD commands sin, seeing he does after ^
sort will it.


Rel. God forbid: it is the most horrible o^ Sin not commanded though willed.
al blasphemies: neither is the conseque^c^ good, God wills althings,
therefore h^ allows al things: for he wills many things, which he does
suffer, not because simply he does allow of them, but after ^ ^ertain manner:
for so far as he suffers so far does he allow and will them: but so far as he
has respect to the Instrument^ whose actions they are, so far does he
disallow and punish them.

Therefore although we do faithfully hold, and believe according as we are
taught, in the confession of Christian faith, that God the father almighty
wills all things, and by his power brings all things to pass, even as
he wills them, yet does it not follow that he is the author of sin,
delighted with in^quity: or that Satan, and men doing evil, do obey God, in
that they do evil, or that they do the will of God, in that they do evil, and
therefore are not to be blamed: for besides that, wicked men do the will of
God, that is to say, those things that are ordained from everlasting, they for
the most part do their own work, that is to say, that which they have a will
in themselves and most greedy appetite to do, as we have oftentimes said
already.


Re. I perceive your meaning nevertheless y^ it is a strange purpose or will
whose effects are not appliable: and familiarly consenting thereunto: yet do
not the effects of Gods Ordinance meet well in that secret purpose of God: for
why? the Purpose and effects.
secret ordinance comprehe^deth al things without exception: and the
Commandment does as it were, countermand all evil, and simply allow of none,
sau^ good things only: Therefore I would have you, by some example, to make
these things more capable, which yet do rather seem to make God contrary to
himself, then otherwise.


Rel. I will therefore take the case to God like to a King.
stand thus: A King consulting with himself, and purposing to declare his
honor, and authority, enacteth such laws, and statutes, as the best industry
of his subjects, shall not be able to observe: pretending nevertheless, of his
own especial grace, to be favorable, or merciful to some, and upon the
rem^^nt of transgressors, to execute Justice: From this head-spring, to wit,
the honor of the King: do distill two streams, the on^ for his beloved
subjects to drink at, and ^iue, the other for the malignant, to brown
themselves in: the courses of these two being made contrary in effect, as i^
respect of their property, by him that had the law in his hand, be
nevertheless made fast in the bosom of the fountain, and do meet together
again, together in the uttermost point, to wit, the honor of a King, as a Be
going out empty, does return laden with honny to her Hiue: for as the King
without laws, had bin no King, nor his dignity discerned: so by his laws his
honor is become twofould as in punishing ^^home he list, and in showing mercy
on whom he will; so that his mercy and justice (if he had had no laws, or if
his laws had been capable to all his people) that had never been known, are
two notable pillors of his Kingdom to his only honor; and the great dread and
admyration of his subfectes, Assure thy self, y^ so it is in that wonderful

my glory I created, formed, Esaias. 43. 7.
and made man. This thiug the heavenly wisdom of God did perceive might come
to pass most conveniently by such a prescription, as should enforce the like
effects to the law aforesaid (though in the first man his justice is very well
defended,) yet note, always between the purpose going before the law (which
is the glory of GOD) and the effects of the law (which are his mercy and No
repugnancy in God.

condemning all men in the purpose of GOD, does show forth his glory, in the
most lively colors of A worldly objection.

Rea. What shall we say then? man is not punished for his due desert, but for
the glory of GOD: and who, I pray you, shall not accoumpt him mad, that will
strike a horse being teathered, because he does not feed at liberty.


Rel. Nay rather who shall not account him more then twice besides himself,

that does resemble the image of God, to a brute beast? Did not God give unto
man understanding, will and ableness ^ stand upright, till such time as he

is he bound, that he may not use the benifit of his will* without controwlment?

himself guilty of so many euiles, as are ^owched in his own nature: does it

and my advise also, that such as do Ande themselves grieved in Adam, seeks
hence forth to be well pleased in Christ.


Reas. Surely I have nothing to say against thee, therefore I come yet back to
that, which thou have partly answered: for why? I cannot be satisfied in this
wonderful mystery, of Gods sea^ret, and reucaled will; therefore I pray you to
enlighten me once again, with some example more familar, then that other.


Reli. Needs must he wonder and to no purpose, that goes about to be as wise
as God, and to under stand all the seacrets of his will (says the Apostle) are
past finding out, but again take the case to An example of gods providence
stand thus; the Lord that disposes of all things in their appointed seasons
puts the partridge into the marlins foot, the pretty bird, into the fowlers
snare, sets the ox foot upon the silly worm, brings the swelling waters
out of their channels to the storehouse of the poor provident Ant, the little
fish into the net, the lamb to the slaughterhouse, the lion to the hunters
hand, and man for his due desert oftentimes to a sharp and sodden death: this
God in his righteous judgment, has pre-ordayned my son to die, amidest the
merciless waves of the sea.

But for as much as nature the enemy to wisdom, does not suffer me to yield up
mine interest, to the ordinance of God (which you must suppose, according to
some extraordinary manner is disclosed unto me) I say unto him, son assure
thy self that no action in this world shall discontinew my favor and good
will toward thee. Again, I make thee LORD, of my whole revenues, use all
that I have, or may procure for thee; so that in consideration hereof, thou will grant me thy true and faithful alegeaunce in this only point; depart
not thy native country, and I crave no more: for at what time so ever, thou
shall commit thy self unto sail and mast, thou die the death, there is no
remedy; thus stands thy safty, thus thy peril, thus my hearty request, and
thus I leave thee. Well, this my son, according to the manner of men, having a
body at home, and a mind else where, then where it should be, neither making
conscience of my great liberallity, commandment, nor any other good desert,
nor yet respecting the danger of his own person, like a man led away with
novelties, and the try: all of strange adventures, rather then esteeming an
honest life, and the duty o^ of a child (commits himself; to the safe
conduct of will, that idle and desperate loadsman, and at last after many
tormoyles, is forced to fish in the deepes without his boat, like as before I
had told him, shall not the man seem to do me injury, that shall reprove me,
for this fault of my son, who every way so well, and fatherly entreated him
as became me?

Thus much I compare with the Lord of Heaven, who created man Lord of the whole
Earth, save that he debard him the tree in the midst of the garden. But if
thou hapily say that all this is not to the purpose, because in the affairs of
this process, I have concealed no seacret but imparted my whole purpose to my
son: well I grant, let us now therefore proceed, even here the case is
altered, let it be granted also, that before I begat my son, I saw the
sequel of this matter: howbeit since it concerned my will, I would not only
observe mine own pleasure in that behalf, but also give my willing consent to
his fatal desteny. I pray you in this case, who shall let me to do the thing
that pleases me? what has my son to say against me, or if he say, and
repine never so much, is it not folly to kick against the prick? but if I, in
the eye of reason, may seem somewhat faulty, or cruel in this action, yet
note that which is most unrighteous in man, is always most righteous in the
Lord of heaven, with whom no creature does stand in comparison: Moreover,
suppose that I see a blind man Another example.
taking a direct course unto a dangerous cave, and before his fall, I step
unto him and say, father beware, and turn the ^acke, for even here at hand is
such a per^ill, as threateneth thy death: the man, not only blind of body, but
of mind lame also, not regarding my friendly admonition, tumbleth down
headlong, and does break his neck. Is it strange to ^ee him burnt, that will
not come out of the fire? but now to the matter, let it be granted, that I set
him in that way, foreseeing his fall, shall he not therefore be in(...)ited of
his own death.


Reas. Surely, but here can thou not go clear away without touch, for had
thou not set the blind man in that way, he might right well have escaped that
misfortune. The like may be said of thy Son also.


Reli. Did I not tell thee that no creature is to be compared with God? who if
he should damn the whole world, setting the desert of Jesus Christ apart were
nevertheless righteous? true it is, if I had never be gotten my son, he had
never bin drowned. But the cause standing upright as I left it, can thou show
any reason, why I should not be get him, seeing it was my will? even so, if God
had never made man, doubtless it had bin long ere man had sinned: but in those
things, which we know the Lord, has justly done for his own glory sake let us
be content and leave off these tovish objections, of iffes, and ands, for what

has much less need thereof, then the sea to borrow some small stream of
water from poor brooks, which the Sun has dried up.


Rea. Well then, considering that nothing in the whole world comes to pass
rashly, or casually, but according to the will of God, that is to say, his
ordinance, may it be said that God has appointed any thing that he
misliketh, whereupon he does take occasion to minister justice?


Rel. Doubtless it must be granted, God appointed all things willingly.
that whatsoever God has appointed is appointed altogether willingly, and
without misliking, otherwise might he seem variable or to be canstrained to
will those things that he wills: but stay thy self, herein appears the
wonderful wisdom of God: for those* things that in their own proper nature are
naught, have yet before him great respect of goodness, whereby Sin has a
respect of goodness.
it comes to pass, that sin exac^ing at the hand of God, the due execution
of justice, in respect of his ordinauncei, is no sin, but righteousness
^ather?


Rea. How prove you that?


Reli. Is it not proof enough, to prove that it concerns his endless glory?
if it (A)

directory in the margeant, shall bring thee to the place, Moreover we may prove
it thus, God sa^eth his chosen by the death of his son, (...)r so is it
written in the Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians: But God should Ephesians. 1. 5. 6.
have saved no man in his son, if there had been no sin, but rather the
Holy Ghost might have told a lie; Ergo, in respect of Gods ordinance it is
just that man is a sinner.

Again, it is greatly to the glory of God, that he shows mercy to sinnere:
but if sin had not been, man should have needed no mercy: Ergo in respect of
Gods glory, it is good that man is wicked; finally, it is greatly to the glory
of God, that he does iustlye punish sin but if there had been no sin at
all, his justice had been utterly unknown o^ obscured, Ergo in respect of
GODS glory, it is necessary that sin be in the world.


Reas. By this reckoning will thou mak^ sin no sin.

of the own nature is so monstrous, that it Gen 7. 20.
deserves some name more odious then sin, because the de^ilements thereof
have in such wise bespotted the nature of man, that the sluices of Heaven are
opened thereby, and the judgments of God daily powered down upon us, which is
well verified in that general ouerflowing of the world.


Reas. But if sin be good in respect of The difference of good and evil.

Rel. If by the same work of his, thou mean his almighty power, that
vphou^deth the world, and all things there in without which nothing can
contain i^ self, I grant that evil things are wrought by God, that is to
say mediatly or by the same power, because no thought of wickedness, much
less any execrable action could burst out if he would take away that life and
strenght that he lendet^ men, which presume to play the rebell^ against him:
but if by the working ^^ sin, thou do suppose the hand of God to be
imediately stretched forth, to per form any wicked action, or else that sin
happens by his together working with sinful instruments: first I den^ the
consequence for it is faulse: and s^ condly I condemn it for the most wicked
of all blasphemies: my reason is this the name of sin cannot agree with GOD,
who is the sovereign root^ Answer.
of all righteousness: the nature of sin cannot once lay hold thereof,
because it is unchangeable, nor yet can the pain of sin touch that thing,
that is not faulty: and yet of necessity should all these follow against God,
laying his hand to iniquity: therefore I conclude thus, the name, the nature,
nor the pain of sin, are any thing accidental to the nature of God, but all
these three are bred, fostered, and found in the soul and flesh of man: Ergo
man is not the instrument so much as the cause of sin.


Reas. It seems therefore that the work of the instrument, and the work of
God using the instrument go not always jointly together.


Reli. This doubtless is very true, for the work that should always be The
work of man often times made double.
^^t one in the opened will of GOD is often times made two-fould by the worker:
yet GOD by his power working in all ahings, works always well, and is
glorified, and the iustruments not regarding his commandments, but obeying
their own lusts, ^oe always work ill, and are justly punished.


Reas. Yet of the contrary part I think, Works ever single.
that the work of God in the good, and the work of the good by virtue of the
Holy Spirit, which works in them, are ever one.


Rel. I grant it, for so far do they work together, that God does work in
them to will, and perform the good works of the Holy Ghost, and they for the
assurance of their well working, do guide themselves by the light of his
word. So then may thou perceive that although by Satan, and the most wicked
men, the just decrees and councels of God are executed, yet are they thereof
for the most part ignorant, and because they obey themselves, not regarding
the will of God, their works are made Examples of single and doble works.
dooble. Of this we have spoken some what before by the example of Joseph, his
brethren. Pharao, and the Caloees punishing the disobedient Israelites: but
that notable example of our Savior Jesus Christ, does yet make it more evident
to our understanding, Christ was the good instrument, out of whom God Colo. 2.
13.
wrought the pardon of our transgression* who before lay fast bound under
si^nne; Mat. 26. 39.
This instrument at all times, and in all things, showed himself obedient to
the will of his father, whereby it is manifest that he always wrought well with
him; but on the other side, what bloody butchers were the Jews, which in
themselves 1 Pet. 1. 19.
did cause the work of God to become double.

Christ being a pure innocent, without one spot of sin, and such a one as
never gave offense did they crucify, not regarding any thing that had been
told them by the Prophets.

Whereby never the less it came to pass that GOD performing that thing by
Acts, 4. 27. 28.
them, which before all worlds he had appointed to be done, did exceeding
merciful and well, and they yielding to their own tyranny committed the most
horrible murder that ever was. The fall of Adam c(...) through God* forsaking.



Rea. Well then to make an end of providence, tell me I pray, whereto shall we
ascribe y^ fall of the first man? I mean whether to Gods enforcing, or to his
for saking.


Reli. Doublesse his falling from God ought simply to be imputed to Gods for
saking: for if we say that GOD did Enforce him by any compulsion, I cannot
perceive, but we burden him with a maruaylous untruth, notwithstanding it is
always granted, that the same fall came by the necessity of Gods appointment,
Mat. 25. 34.
but for as much as that necessity, took not away his own willingness, it
shall never excuse him. So that here in rightly appears the wonderful
wisdom of God, who deriuing his glory The wisdom of God.
(determined off before) from the grosest of all faults, is neither the cause
thereof properly, nor does suffer it to come to pass besides his ordinance: He
allowed so much as came from himself, saying, Lo it is good: but now
forsaking the good, it became evil for want of God: and in the same forsaking
God suffered (yet willingly) corruption to creep under his ordinance, in such
wise into the nature of man, that his own will became the cause of that evil
act of eating that forbidden fruit.


Rea. But why did GOD forsake him, being righteous in his own sight.


Rel. Nay, rather would I have thee to show some reason, that should move God
not to forsake him, whom he knew it most expedient to leave.


Rea. Here again do thou allude to the glory of God, but if I might still
follow the appetite of reason, I should demand why God why such praeposterous
means does exact his glory at the hands of his poor creatures.


Reli. Truly thou may, but I will take a day to answer thee, till such time as
the Lord has called me to sit in commission about the affairs of his secret
council, yet if I say he will be so glorified, because Romans 9. 18.

fault? But take the words of Master Calvin for thine answer in this case, who
says thus.

The first man fell because the LORD did judge it expedient, why he so judged,
is unknown to us: Yet certain he so judged, for no other reason but because
he saw that thereby the glory of his name should most worthily be set
forth, when thou hear therefore mention made of the glory of God, there
think of his righteousness, for it must be righteous that deserves praise,
and let us rather behold an evident cause of damnation, in the corrupt nature
of mankind, which is nearer to us; then seek for a hidden and utterly
incomprehensible cause thereof in the secret council of God, which is further
from us: and let it not green us so far to submit our wit to the
unmeasurable wisdom of God, that it may yeald in many secrets of his, for of
those things which is neither granted, nor lawful to have knowledge, Ignorance
is well learned, and the coveting of knowledge a mere kind of madness.


Rea. Well let us stay here, concerning the providence of God, from which I
perceive nothing can be excluded, and therefore in vain do men babble of
Fortune, Chance, and other casual Goddesses; now therefore let us proceed to
the predestination of God, of which thou often have spoken in this treatise of
Providence, and first of all I would have thee describe unto me what
predestination is.


Reli. Truly the providence of God considered, in that general signification,
Predestination what it is.
that is to say in the foreknowing, or deyning, ordering, and ending all manner
of things, so far as yet I understand, does comprehend the predestination of
God, and is one selfe-same-thing therewith: yet because predestination may be
restrained, in a more particular property, namely to Gods ordering and
disposing Romans 8. 29.
of mankind, thus it may be defined.

Predestination is the everlasting, and unchangeable decree of the almighty,
which going before all causes, draws man to his appointed end, that is either
in Christ to salvation, or else in Adam to condemnation, and the endless
torments of hell.


Rea. And what is election? not the same thing?


Rel. No, for that is utterly impossible, Election what it is.
and against all conueniency of Reason, because the Reprobate is predestinate,
Romans 9. 22. Iud. 1. 4.
as well as the Elect, as witnesses Saint Jude, but we cannot say, that the
Reprobrate or offcast is elected: therefore Election is peculiar to the good,
being chosen out of the total number, and predestination common to the good,
and the bad. The mercy of God, the cause of election.



Rea. But it seems, that before election goes the mercy of God, whereby the
clect are saved: and then does the nature of contraryes require, that the
hatred or wrath of God, should be the cause that the damned, are damned: Ergo,
God damneth some, not for their sins, but because he does hate them.


Reli. If to the word hatred, or wrath, thou had put this litlle word Just
(whereby God in Justice might have cast off the ofcasts, who never does
unjustly) I would have liked well of thy consequent. But I pray you where did
you Sin the cause of damnation.
ever find, that God hated man except it were for sin? show me the place and
then will we conclude against him, that he hates his own work: In the
mean time, content thy self with that which we have already spoken touching
this matter.


Rea. Well: but it may seem a hard and cruel case that some should be appointed
to damnation, although GOD may justly do it for his glory sake.


Rel. I will not see thy folly in these Cruelty and Justice.
two words Cruel, and yet Just. But yet I say it may seem a case more harder,
if God could be found in the fault of reprobation, whereaf he is but the
failing cause, the efficient being grounded in man himself. And if we may
speak of the handnesse of causes, it seems much more harder on Gods behalf,
that if he could be proved the cause of transgression (which is utterly
impossible) that ye^ he may not use his pleasure with his own creatures.


Rea. But what say you to these general 1 Timothy 2. 4. 1 Pet. 3. 9.
sentences, God would have All men saved, God would have all men come to
repentance, that they might not perish?


Reli. You must construe of the word. All, in that place, not after the letter:
or else avouch to the face of GOD, that some are damned whether he will or
not, therefore ( All) has relation The word All.
here to all sorts of men, in degree and calling, that is to say, Princes,
Magistrates, Gentlemen, Bondmen, Artificers, and such other, as well of the
Jews, as of the Gentiles: thus doubtless we must expound the word All. For
GOD forbid that the Doctrine of predestination, the very groundwork of
salvation, should hang in suspense for a few texts that pretend outwardly a
kind of repugnancy: if this will not suffice, then credit the Apostle saying
according to the whole course of Scripture: Though the children Romans 9 27.
of Israel were as the sand of the sea, yet shall but a remnant be saved, Many
are called, but few are chosen, few enter at the straight gate.


Rea. Truly, thou compellest me to yeald unto thee in this point, for if God
would not have some damned, they should in no wise be damned, that be damned:
But here again arises a doubt which troubles many: If that necessity of
things be prefixed by the eternal decreement, it is superfluous The vnrea* so
^^ble cbiection of Worldlings.
and a mere kind of madness to teach what every man's duty is: for why: all
the teaching, and preaching in the world, shall not alter the least lot of Gods
determination.


Reli. Indeed this is the only refuge whereto the fexe flies, being hunted
from every other haunt: But the Lord will one day vnkennel him, when his case
and carcass both, shall pay tribute to the father of foxes, if mean whiles he
offer not to God a more acceptable sacrifice: These be they that make ship
wrack of all religion, although some whiles under the veil thereof, they
would seem for credit sake, to have some little smack of y^ fear of God: But
they which be the children of God, either know or will know, yea and the
wicked also shall know, not only, that in that security which they would draw
from hence, rests the utter contempt of Christ, and of all true knowledge of
God, but also that doctrine Doctrine under servant.
is appointed as an under servant to the Lord, whereby he does justly
accomplish that, which he had purposed touching his elect, as also the
reprobate.

Therefore I pray you what is the drift of this objection other then that the
Lord should leave al things at large, according to the opinion of Epicure, and
the Papist, to a careless happening, whereby man for his behoof, pausing upon
his own ways, might address himself, as of his own proper power, to will
and work these things, that should win Salvation? truly if they were called
together among them al, is not one to be found, that can clear himself of
this intent.

Therefore it is manifest, that they are not enemies alone to the predestination

But why should the reprobate him self account Doctrine unnecessary, ^^ beit
he will not yield himself obedient is he not thereby left utterly without

Moreover it is commanded to b^ set before the reprobate, not because it
might intercept that thing that God has purposed of him, but that by ^^ The

out among these men sundry or se^^ rall effects, one reverently to embrace
another stubbornely to skorne and ^^*iect it: and the third sort, to stand a
lukewarm and careless quandra^^ as if to embrace it, or not to embrace were
all one thing: Again there is no doubt, as it pierces the hearts of the
chosen, and does lead them as it were by the hand to conformity of life,
whereby to their great comfort, they seal up to their consciences their
election: even so ^t strikes the hearts of the wicked, and oftentimes does
restrain their mali^artnesse, albeit it proceed from the mouth of a man: last
of all, if those unreasonable Cauillers could be content ^o take any light at
the hands of the godly, the Apostles should soon persuade them, how necessary
doctrine is. They The Apostles.
^reached predestination, and the free election of God, notwithstanding they
were well assured, that not only them^elues, but all that were predestinate to
^^e, were in no case remoueable from the estate of salvation.

They knew also on the contrary part, that the reprobates by no industry could
^^^rit the kingdom of God: and al^^it before their faces, whole thou^ndes were
caught with this lime^wigge of Satan, and did tipple them^elues with the
drunkenness of devilish ^curity; yet I say were the Apostles never the colder,
to walk in their duties and offices, but painfully, and wi^^ all diligent care
and endeavor, to they continual danger, and at last with the loss of their
lives, discharged them selves thereof.


Rea. But wise men of this world, do Wise men of the World.
plainly affirm, that the Doctrine of predestination, ought not to be taught,
or at least is not convenient to be taught before common people, because they
are not able to comprehend it.


Reli. But if wise men of the world were any thing wise in the wisdom ^ GOD,
this would be far from they thoughts, and twice so far from they tongues.
For I pray you what d^ move the Lord to reveal the same do^*trine, so
plentifully in his word? Some intent of secrecy? Shall the sun neu^ shine
because all are not able to comprehend it with their bodily eyes? Let t^^ same
wise men gatze upon the ground for that is the treasory of their vnde standing:
they cannot perceive how o^ little grass grows, and shall the ear^ therefore
not yield her increase as ^^ Lord does appoint? If hidden and sec^^ causes may
lawfully prevent common profits, then shall it behoue us to wax more sharp
sighted then men, or shortly ^o have another world.

Those men whatsoever they pretend have small regard of Gods true service ^r
honor: therefore is there no cause that the truth of GOD should be dissembled
for their number or authority, be it never so great.

I remember that Saint Augustine Augustine his answer to the enemies of
predestination. Chap. 15.
^ath said full well to the matter. This Doctrine being heard (says he) some
are ^urned into a sluggish heaviness and ^lownesse, and being readily bent to
fall from labor unto wantonness, do go after their lusts: must therefore that
be thought false, which is said of the foreknowledge of God? And will we not
also speak, that which the Scripture being witness, it is lawful to speak?
by likelihood we are afraid, least he should be offended which cannot take
it, and are not afraid, least we holding our tongues, that he which can take
the truth should be deceived with ^alshood. Therefore as true religion is to
be taught, that GOD may be truly worshipped, so is the Doctrine of
predestination, that he which has ears to hear of the grace of GOD, may
glory in GOD, and not in himself.


Rea. But have the children of GOD any assurance in this world of their
election?


Reli. Yea verily, for from whence comes Repentance and the fruits thereof,
but from Regeneration? of the faith of Christ, but this faith is given to the
elect only, Ergo, only the elect do repent and give themselves to obey the
commandment of God, The rest have not ^^ will to think a good thought, much

to do any good, and least of all to continue in weldoing: for that is also a
peculiar mark in election: Therefore letn^ man climb up to the clouds, to
search whether he be enrolled in the secret council of GOD, nor busy
himself with many curious speculation^ below* but let him that would be

promises. Job. 3. 15.


This thing can no man truly bring to pass, exept his name be written in the
book of life.


Rea. What* if a man feel not in himself Romans 9. 33.
these testimonies, should he therefore despair of salvation.


Rel. GOD forbid, let such men rather be sent to the word preached and
sacraments, whereby the grace of election may work these testimonies in them:
and no doubt, those whom the LORD has foreknowne in his good time, he will
call home into his household God calls his children
of faith.

For we know as he has predestined of his own unspeakable mercy, whom
he would, so also he calls them at such several seasons, as he will: Some
early, and some Romans 8. 30. Math. 20. 2 3. 4. 5. 6
late, as it is written in the Gospel of the laborers that were called into
the Uineyard.


Rea. But by that parrable may wicked men take encouragement to neglecte the
time of calling, because they that were called in the last hour were accepted
and rewarded equally with those which came in the first hour of the day.


Reli. Nay, let me show which of those laborers being once called, did refuse
to come: it seems rather to me, that hereby they should learn without delay
to turn unto the Lord, hearing his voice, for we must consider that he is not
bound (...)an (...)to (...)t the (...).

To death we must stoop be we high be we low.
But how or how suddenly, few be that know.

Reas. But yet must they needs be damned that are appointed to damnation?


Reli. It is true; yet always because they are sinners and do not harken to
the voice of the Lord.


Rea. Truly in my judgment, even that is enough to stop any man's mouth, be

they that will shrink one hair breadth from such a simple enemy, having so
mighty a God, with so many legions of Angels watching over them continually,
for their defense.


Reas. But for all this thou know that Gods dearest childeren are oftentimes
ouerset with fear of his power, yea and peeuishly entreated thereby also.


Rel. It is granted, and truly, this may serve for a glass for Gods dearest

sin, that when they are at the best, even then are they not without desert of
Gods chastismentts.


Reas. And what? is the same faith, whose object is the son of God crucified,
the only condition whereupon all the childeren of God in their seasons are
gatheyed up into immortallity?


Rlig. It is so.


Res. Ergo, It is no matter if we obey not the law of God, wherein we learn to
serve him, and to perform such actions of society: as be requisite between
man and man.


Reli. This is but a ^and starting hole, for as the mercy of God is not
extended, but through free election, not without the condition of faith
included by God for the externe: so also is it provided, that the same faith,
be accompanied with righteous exercises. But concerning this matter, and other
mo whereof I am to confer with thee, I would we might meet hereafter at more
convenient leisure.


Rea. I am well content, in the mean time I thank you of your patience in
this discourse, beseeching God that I may always bear in mind the Godly
aduisements thereof.


FINIS.
By ARTVR DENT.

An earnest persuasion to a Worshipful Gentleman, and his good friend to
continue constant in Christian Religion, and to loath and detest the slights of
Superstitious Papistry. By the former Author, Arthur Dent.
ALthough the Be, be not so easily caught in the gynnes of the Spider, as the
poor Fly, or being once entangled, is not so easily poisoned: yet common
experience, does make it a plain case, that oftentimes she is overthrown
therein, and compelled to yeald her-selfe a prey unto tyranny. But considering
how easily our affections be carried away by corruption, to wit, faultiness,
natural to decline to the worse part, it seems most wonderful to me, that
you being so near a neighbor to heresy, are yet vndrowned in the dreggs
thereof more then vntaynted, to the danger of your overthrow yet to come: for
why? are not the best subject to change? I mean the wisest, to folly? and the
holiest to wickedness? let the example of Solomon, wilnesse the truth in this
case, who although he were the only parragon of the world, fell to idolatry, the
most noisome of pestelences, and to all uncleanness of body. Does not
likewise the example of our first parent Adam, make it plain, that our nature
being at the best, is even then most subject, to take the wickeddest course? O
wretched estate, what reckoning shall we make of our selves which seeming to
stand, are ever falling, which outwardly carrying the countenance of security,
have at home, such an enemy, as does practice our continual estraungement with
God! and besides this are environed with a world of ungodly allurements. But
yet amids these dangers, twice, O Merciful God whose grace superaboundeth sin,
whose mercy dispenceth with all our faults, and whose holy spirit does indue us
with wisdom, to destry the subtilt^^s of Satan, with strength to stand
against them, yea and with constancy, to continue in his love, fear, and true
worship. I appeal to your conscience, whether the Lord has dealte with you
less fatherly, then in old time he did with Daniell in the Lions den, with
Jeremy in the miry dungeon, or with Jonas, in the belly of the whale? they saw
their danger imminent, which did put them in mind to repair to the Lord. But
you I know, yea I know it to well (if it pleased GOD it should be otherwise)
have continually laid before you the fairest baytes of the world to betray you,
where-vnder lurketh the perrill of perpetual damnation, and yet the Lord be
praised, do continue his true and faithful servant unvanquished. But to
speak more plainly, thus it is, by reason that the adversaries to all truth,
I mean the Papists, have the colorable access unto you of friendship, you
are always endaungered by there wily persuasions to forsake your GOD. This
truly has been often told me, and I see no reason why I should not believe
it, considering that I know, how busily they use to buzze in every dish, where
opportunity promises the insertion of their loathsome corruptions: But most
chiefly; if they be on a sure ground that their bodily danger is not thereby
threatened, they are imp^bent to blaspheame GOD and his holy Religion with all
treasons of their own wicked inuentious: which thing although commonly and of
custom, it has happened unto you by them, yet am I to restrain my self, to
the answering of one particular, and principal attempt that was made against
you, at your table, by certain Gentlemen not long since, whose names though I
partly know, yet I think not canuenient at this time to deliver to common
obloquy.

These Gentlemen grounding all their religion upon hoarye hayres, which they
call Ambassadors of experience, and upon the grave visors of their Fathers,
which we account the wisest parts of them, having preferred. fancy before
faith: and their own humors before the honor of God, brought all the battery
of their reasons and arguments against the poor bulwark of your only defense
(being a man able to be seduced by the violence of persuasion, or at least to
have bin driven to silence that extreme refuge, had not God been present with
you in the reseue of his own honor) saying was their not in those days,
wherein our religion slorished, a goulden and plentiful world? was there not
love and Charity? unity of religion? the service of God established by general
counsels of holy doctors and fathers? how then should not those ways, be the
best to serve God, which they observed, and have left under the warrant of
sufficient authority to the memory of our present age? have so many wise men
bin deceued, so many learned men lived in folly and ignorance? have so many
Kings and Emperors slept in blindness of heart and died in the darkness of
heresey? Nay has all Christendom wandered out of the way till now. etc. This
threedbare discourse (which they draw out to the whole length of a Carterope)
is able to bewitch so many, as make reason their iools, even as themselves are
bewitched by the wiliness of the devil and their Pope: but let us survey
these waterlesse clouds, and we shall ^asiely perceive them as they be.

Have not these wise men laid true religion in water and sacrifized their zeal
to reason, as if she were some Goddess? here is nothing but a plain
collection of reasons, a^^ Carnal experiences, and shall we make them the
platformes of holiness? is the wisdom of man of so forcible a capacity, and
the word of God ^onuinced of so great debility, that in cases of religion we
shall g^^und upon likelihoode o^ man's immaginations? let us be wise, the Elder
has most pith of all the trees in the wood, but less s^ength and goodness
then any other: the thunder a huge(...), but a little stone and these men great
choice of boas^^gs, but small verity, or virtue in their words.

^ust not that building needs be naught ^e it never so fair, whose foundation
is utterly rotten; and must not that religion of necessity be worse, whose
principles God has flattly forbidden? he calls man's reason, a traterous
enemy to GOD, saying, it never was nor shall be subject to his law: they honor
it, as the Ier. 11. 10. 14.
true penny of their whole trust: he condemns the precepts of our
forefathers, forbidding us to pray for them, which do embrace the same,
because they are Sepulchers full of rotten bones, clouds with out water, and
they themselves hvpocrites, but they esteem them no less then loadesmen to
all piety and life everlasting.

Alas why do we fear their union in idolatry (for that is the vntay, that
they rejoice in, and brag of) more then we sorrow for the dishonor of our
God? or why should we be troubled with the long, and prosperous estate of
Popish religion, more then be comforted in the news and glad tidings of the
Gospel? does not the Apostle tell us that before the dissolution of the world,
there should befall a general Apostasy, and departing from the faith of
Christ? and that all this should happen by one man, namely the man of 2. The^^.
2. 3. ^.
sin, and child of perdition? saying, that he should be an adversary to all
Godliness, and exalt himself above all that is called God? why then should
they go about to blears your eyes with the wonder of such words, more then
instruct themselves in the providence of God, who has provided, and made us
wary of such a G^nerall departing? why say they too char^ge the cannons,
decrees, and decretalls of their Popish fathers (seeing the Lord himself
points out the Pope as with a finger, and deciphereth (...) for Antichrist,
as plainly, (...), to discovered in the secrets of (...) body, by the anatomy
off another) more then yeald their own due subjection to the ordinance and
institutions of their GOD* Nay why should we (whose eyes and ears the LORD
has opened for the entertainment of his truth) lend them away to the view of
motheaten novelties, and to the sound of such false laromes as these, more then
exercise them in their several duties and offices? if they will not confess
that these and such other testimonies of Gods holy word do reprove their man of
Rome, together with them being his vncircumsiced generation of
Antichrist^anity, let us then apply them: the man of sin, (says the Apestle)
exalts himself above all that is called GOD, vaunting himself insolently
in the temple of GOD, if (I say) they will not confess this of their Pope, let
them show us what regard of obedience he has reserved to GOD ward, in making
his book, (I mean the holy Bible) the vassell of vile estamation, which he
does not only bury, in oblivion, by his own despensations ^ but in all
contempt does trample, and (...) under his feet: knowing notwithstanding that
it is the word and wisdom of GOD: let them show us to what prerogative their
Pope has yealded which proclameth himself so many degrees above Angels, or
that denounces himself the spiritual head of the Church of Christ: Has
their Pope performed any covenant 'of league with the Lord, whose searunats and
childeren he has rent from the face of the earth canceling the date of their
days, with more then a thousand butcheries? does the Pope yeald to the
omnipotency of GOD, so much as he goes about to make himself GOD, and is not
ashamed to momise all the effects of Gods power? saying that he both can and
may do all that GOD can do, to wit in the pardoning of sins, in the saving
of souls, in the transmutation of times, in the altering and abrogating of
laws, in the administration of spiritual gifts, to be short in all other
things whatsoever? nay he is not thus content, for more expressly does he
mayntaine his quarrel against GOD, for by certain necessary, conceqences* ^e
proves, that he is above the only GOD of heaven carth. O hellish insination!
how have thou caryet poor ignorant souls to the slavery of this monster? even
in the total of there deeds and belief? what should I article any longer
against him, whom these few have condemned to the pit of hell*

But see the policy, whereby this subtle Serpent has deluded us so long: the
word of GOD, which ought to be the launtorne to our paths,, has her kept
back and led the fruit of one whole thousand years in the wilderness of
barkenesse (God knows to how great confusion) and now braggeth in the
antiquity of his own naughtiness and mischief.

Alas is their any maruill, the world being once covered with the spirit of
slumber, that it should be ouer-taken, with the witchcraft of sleepy deseases:
is it any thing, strange, that men do spew at religion, being made drunken
with heresy? or is it any wonder (the word of GOD being once brought into
(...)rall contempt) that the infection (...)ry has been so common? gl^^ once
the gorge of man with any foul ^inion, and he will hardly be purged thereof:
make him to believe the mortality of the soul, and he will consent with
Protagoras that there is no GOD.

They will say that all this wind makes ^^ corn, and (...) are that we do
belie their Pope and them; truly I cannot blame them, if they would vnfather
him of such hateful blasphemics: but let our selves be charged with the wrong
we have done them herein, and our lives stand, upon the slander, let his own
cannons be convinced of all the evil that have written them, and more then ten
thousand such in exasting of his name, and the Pope himself be condemned of
madness and frenzy, having as like a beast, as a bedlame, and as near the
quality of a bedlame, as the quantity of man, consented unto them, with all
pride and presumption.

O good God, how mearuelous is it tobehould so many wise men, so much deceived,
so many gray headed fathers so childish? so many tgnirant accoumpted wise? and
so many infants allowed for men of grave and ripe judgment? if they can say
against us, where is the city on the mountain, the visible Church? the
catholic and universal Church? they are learned enough: but they cannot
preceaue that these are fained fires, painted out with fair glosses, wherein
is no warmeth, nor that they be Illusions and shadows without substance* Take
their Church from the pontifical hill: take away their Pomp and bravery, or
their general consents, and take away their life, Nay if this were all, it
were well (if evil may be well) But which is worse* they must have their
Churches beautified with* Images, Feminine and Masculine curiously carved,
gallantly gilded, prodigally beset with precious stones, and most delicately
adorned with great choice of Jewels. They must have their Roodloftes with flags
and silken banners, with Crosses, Roodes, and Saints, like a storehouse of
superstition. They must have their brave Altars, garnished with petty Gods,
with well lifting Prelates, and other holy relics: they must have shaven
crowned Chaplens, strangely attired, they must have their Albes, with silk of
all colors, they Mytres and Crossyars, and what should I say, they must have
holy bread, holy water, holy oil, holy ashes, holy candles, an hundred holy
orders, like hypocrites that beautify the outside besides a thousand other
holy things.

Finally they may not want any thing that can please the eye, delight the ear
or slatter the mind: And lo, yet do all these most plainly prove their Church
the (...)y Church of Antichrist: for where nothing is wanting that may allure
the mind to lust after vanity; or to stir the heart unto folly and
wickedness, this may be termed (by much better right) a Court for an Atheist,
then a Church for a Christian, for was Jesus Christ so high set on a hill, that
all the world did worship him, o^ outwardly so glorious, so full of pomp and
bravery, that they have drawn from him such an ensample of imitation? or were
there so many of his church (which yet we doubt not was and is the true Church)
that the same Church has lined their mouths with multitudes, with
universalities, and unities general? Then is this true, Christ himself was
never borne in an an Derstall, but in the Palace of some Monarchy: then was
not he a poor despised soul on the earth in worse case then foxes and birds
which have holes and nestes Math. 8. 20.
to shield them from the wether, but some mighty prince of the world, ruling with
all majesty and power: And then had Christ to embrace his Doctrine not the
Apostles, and a few other silly Disciples, but the general consent of all the
Jewish Churches.

How then came it to pass, that he was put to such a shame full death? was
(...) because he was well-beloved of the multitude? if this be love, I know not
what to make of hatred; but sure I am, that few will consent so to be beloved.

I would to God the Papist would look wisely upon his Church, and afterward
tell us how far it differs from the Churches of the Pharisees, which
reproves, and condemns our Savior CHRIST as a faise Prophet, and all his
Doctrine, as newfound doctrine, and schismatic, saying and swearing that
theyrs was of antiquity, observed of theyrfore-fathers, and having the warrant
and consent of the world, what say they at this day against us which do embrace
the selfsame Doctrine, that was so condemned? Do not they say and swear that
Martin Luther is the father of our religion? Do they not call it a Sect, a
Schism, an^ Heresy? Do they not call us traitors to God and man, giving us
such titles as they themselves deserve, and have they not slain whole
thousands in that quarrel. If we demand of the^ whether y^ Church of God were
at any time comparable to the S^nagog^e of Jews in re^^^ct of the multitude,
which way will they turn the^? if they answer that it was not, they condemn
their own reasons of very much weakness, which do go about to confirm tho
authority of their Church by other marks then the Church of God ever had: If
they answer that the church of Christ was always the greatest, they are
already convicted of as great foolishness, for there-vppon would all this
packet of untruth lustly depend, viz. That the Church of God, was drowned in
the general ouerflowing, when all the world was drowned, and the church of
satan saved in the Arc. That the church of God perished-among the Sodomites,
and just Lot, and his family, were y^ church of the devil: y^ the Jews,
Scribes, and Pharisees, were the Church of Christ, and Christ himself with
the remnant of believers the Church of Antichrist: In conclusion that their
Church is now the true Church because of the multitude, and ours the false: we
will demand but one thing of those multitude of men, which if they truly tell us
and prove, they shall have our hand and* our heart, we will become as true to
them as steel, and consent to any religion of their forefathers; which is,
that they show forth, at what time the estate of the world, was in so good
case, that the best things did please the greatest number, or when iniquity
had not the most consent of adherents (except at that time, when all were
drowned except eight persons) Alas their proof is even as far to seek, as
heaven is distant from hell; God grant therefore the condition of Romans 10. 16
consent, be no nearer unto us. For it is written broad is the way, that
leads Math. 7. 14.
to perdition, and many walk therein, but narrow is the path to salvation, Romans
9. 27.
straight is the gate. and few do enter thereat. And further, though the
children of Israel were as y^ sand of the sea, yet shall but a remnant be
saved; This is yet more plainly verified by Elias the Prophet who saw not one
man free from Idolatry, and the subjection of Belial, Rom 11. 13
besides himself, in all the world, yet did he willingly (all regard of the
multitude laid apart,) serve the Lord of heaven truly.

Wherefore, though our forefathers, served those Gods on the further side of
Joshua. 24. 13 Judith. 8. 19 Ier. 11. 10.
the flood, or the Gods of the Amorstes, or the gods of their own hands: Let
it amaze us no more then it did good Joshua who said (and let us also say with
him) we and our houses, will serve the God of heaven. And with Judith, we will
not follow the sins of our forefathers which forsake their God, and
worshipped strange gods.

The holy Hrophet received from the 2 Timothy 3. 16,
mouth or secret inspiration of God all that doctrine y^ they delivered or
taught: the Apostles proved their Doctrine out of Prophets: the godly of
ensuing ages have rested upon them; And shall we alone be careless, or
account it enough, if many men have gone before us, contrary to the Prophets and
Apostles? No, no, Al men have sinned from the first (except one) and shall do
to the last, yet it is nothing lawful for us to follow their steps therein:
Therefore although our forefathers were Idolaters, yet must we learn to serve
the Lord, And that we may the better perform our duties in that behalf, it
behooves us to be wise in the trying of spirits, least we become clyents to our
forefathers superstitions, or superstitious in our own fancies, and so
ignorantly neglect the precepts of our God.

Let us therefore look upon the injunctions of Popery, that we may be able to
reprehend the Church of Rome, but let us call home their general Councels,
with the rabble of their decretals to the same Prophets and Apostles, And woe
shall anon perceive that we have no cause to fear (their times out of mind)
knowing that an evil custom is no better then a common pestilence, which by how
much the more is old and ancient, by so much the more it is rotten and
stinking: nor yet their common consents, seeing the state of gods children is
oftentimes to be desolate. And because there is no heresy but will challenge
some maintenance out of Gods word, saying that their Church is the Church
Apostolical, which the Papist as boldly swears and takes upon him, as if
nothing were good but his Mass, let them show us the Prophets and Apostles for
their Masses, Dirges, Trentals, praying to Saints, praying with brads, praying
to help souls out of purgatory, worshipping of Idols, Bishopping of baptized
children, kissing of Pares, Creeping to Crosses, baptizing of bells, coniuring
of water, coniuring of balm, coniuring of herbs, buying of bulls and
pardons, and auricular confession; and the rest of their sacraments, paying of
vain vows, going on pilgrimage, pace-eggs, manyples, licking of rotten bones,
Auc-Maryes blessing with two fingers, annoynting, annoyling, absoluing,
kneeling knocking, whipping, crouching, kissing, crossing, shauing, greasing,
and ten thousand such trickets more. I appeal to the judgment of the
wise-harted, whether God abrogating the ceremonies of his own law, did purpose,
that the Pope should institute and erect a new, of such traditions as these.

If we hold them hard to the proofs of these and such other, by the touchstone,
aforesaid (namely y^ word of God) their next leap, is longer then the passage
between Dover and Callice: for they cross the broad ss as to unwritten
verities. But how cold their entertainment is there, we would not much fear
to make the^-selues the Judges, if shame and grace had not forsaken them. In
deed we know and confess that more was spoken, then is written: And that
whatsoever Christ and the Apostles preached, was the word of GOD were it
written or not: But we know also that if more had been necessary to salvation
then is written, God would not suffer us to want it, least with them we might
happen to run a whoring after our own devises: But above all, we are most
assured that the Spirit of God never was, nor will be contrary to it self:
Therefore let us try how truly their berities unwritten do accord with the
written word.

We find in the Scripture, that we ought to worship God alone, and not to
make our selves any graven Image; but is it possible that the Word unwritten
should tolerate their prayers to saints? their sacrificing to Idols, and their
falling down before blocks? In his word written, it is called the Doctrine of
dinels to forbid matrimony to any man, and can it be his word unwritten that
Ministers shall never marry? it is his word written that all that depart this
world in the Lord, do rest from their labors: and is it also in the word
unwritten that they be purged of many torments in the fire of Purgatory before
they do rest: it is plain by the word written, that we have no remission of
sin but in the blood of Christ, without whom we are dead and condemned to
the bottom of hell: but is it as plain by his word unwritten, that the Pope
can save? that who-soeuer shall die in a white friars scapulary, shall be saved?
or he that dies in a gray friars frocke, shall neither come in Purgatory, nor
in hell? and above all is it his word unwritten, that a man may get in s(...)
heap of deseruings ((...) superrerogation) (...)s friends? w(...) against the
hea(...)

Is not this preposterous gear? who would think that these men standing so
much upon the foully* slippers of their wisdom and gray heads would thus
ouershoote themselves: which so far forth as in them lies, do make God a
contemptible changeling: Religion more uncertain the^ the Lesbian rule, and tie
themselves to the continual slavery of their own device? and their master the
man of Rome? and yielding their whole contemplation to the works of darkness.

Alas with what blind spirit are these poor souls vexed, that will have
their Pope and the Church of Rome again exalted? that take away the plain
Doctrine of faith, and justification in Christ? and teach a faith solted up
in an Idle fancy? saying: that we must believe of Christ, as their Church
believes, because their Church believes, as they believe: But if we demand
what they, or their Church do believe, the next way for us to know, is even to
get look: for doubtless they know not, neither can they tell us.

Truly howsoever they cotton y^ matter with devout countenances, or coragious
bragges, with persuasions of the time past, or the scarcety or iniquity of the
time present, or with the outward face or visor of their charity, their estate
is lamentable, it fares with them even as with butchers, that use to blow up
their flesh that it may seem bigger, they are grubling so much in the mire of
their own desert to the world: ward, that they forget or neglect all that true
religion and service they owe unto God.

For note this well, where is that Papist in all the world, that will not
sooner bid us behold his charity toward his neighbor then his integrity in
the worshipping of God? So that charity being the vnderseruant to religion,
and a second thing required, they make it the head-stone of the corner, and the
foundation wher-vpon they build all their righteousness unto salvation: Truly
we dare not deny that in respect of the world (wereit not depraved) the Papist
hash some good matter in him, because his deeds do often times extend to the
benefit of GODS Church: And even in this (I write in the greef of my conscience
wherein I call the Lord to witness) shall they condemn many professors in the
day of visitation, that are lewd speakers, and lewd livers altogether, yet I
say always that in this his only point, if fares with him, as with the Cow
having given a jolly mess of milk, that afterward, does spill it with her
foot.

For to they bear us in hand that they have many good works, and that they
are continual workers, not because they are so commanded of God, but rather
because, thereby they will w^^^e out their salvation and purchase heaven.

Alas it is a Crauen Cock that croweth Cor. 13. 4. ^
no where but on his own dunghill, We know that all the good works of the
world, being done without love, are nothing worth; and that their
superrerogations being examined, and their greatest works of dignity next unto
them, are found without love, mercy, pity or compassion. But if it may be
accounted a deed of mercy, to give rich Altar clothes, to the beutifying of
Altars; a deed of love, to build Chapels and Chauntries, and a deed of pity
to go far on knees, to give great gifts to shrines, then are they passing
full of love, mercy, pity and compassion: otherwise they have none at all, at
least that is acceptable. For they pity the poverty of lime and stones, and
them they cloth.

They pity a sort of foul fat Priests infurr'd gov^nes, and them they deck
with golden Copes, and supply in all other their vanities and Idleness, as if
it were a good deed to grease a fat hog in the tail: But where is the love,
and compassion of their poor brother all this while? I will say no more, let
them that fare the better for these and such other good works, praise them:
but yet Let them beware they sin not there in* like unto these are their
Idols which executors use to give after men be dead, that liberality is idle,
having no good intent, and the reward rotten that is paid back again; which
is, Lord have mercy on the soul of this charitable dead man. O gross folly:
where is the love that should make this deed acceptable? if we should speak
generally of al their works, they are even dross and more shameful vices then
these, if more may be, for I say, and yet not I, but the holy Ghost, if they
be not done in love springing out of the bowels of true faith, they stink
before y^ face of God. Yea but they will say they have al love, mercy, pity and
compassion. Yea but how can this be true. ^^. Let it be granted, y^ they give
many gifts to the poor, that they hely to defend the widow, to harbor the
fatherless, to cloth the naked, to feed the hangry, etc. (...)^ They do not
these things (...) of the needy, but to getto (...) she ^nspeakable benefit of
saiuation, this is love indeed I grant: but is it not the only love of them
selure? For I lend or give a man a hundred pound, because I would gain a
thousand or a thousand, because I would gain ten thousand, whom love I? my
poor neighbor, having need of me? or my self? O blindness, that sees not
these evils, nay twice O blindness that does not see, more then this! what is
it to say that we are able to save and justify our selves before the tribunal
seat of God, but to reprove our most wise God of folly and doltishnesse, in
that without need, he sent Jesus Christ his well-beloved Son, by so great
torment, as he endured to deliver us from the bondage of sin? And what is it
else but to contemn the unspeakable love of our savior, who being a God so
mighty, y^ King of all Kings, and the only Prince of all worlds, disdayned not
to take unto him, the contemptible shape of a servant, and to bear the burden
or all our sins, even unto the death of the vile and shameful cross, that he
might present us blameless before his father. Which gross opinion so
outragiously blasphemous, some Papists at this ^ay waxing half ashamed of, and
daring not so broadly to maintain, will seem to qualify with a poor shift
of deskant. And because very infants or fools in this light of the gospel
(for which the Lord be praised) might otherwise point at them for their folly,
they are contct not to be prive Christ of his dignity altogether, and therefore
do attribute some part of just fication to him, and the rest to themselves.
Surely this is scarcely so good a recompense, as having cracked his crown, to
give him a plaster: for except some insufficiency were or might justly be found
in him, what madness should move them to intrude themselves into his office? But
if these enter commoners with Christ, though they seem to have retained a
certain blind modesty be heedfully examined, in truth they do but practice
to delude themselves and us, having no mind to deal with Christ whot or cold.

For if we demand of them for Gods eternal predestination, whereby he
brings the elected and reprobate sort to the^r appointed ends, they are at
defiance with that doctrine: and even in this have they taken away all that
part of justification, that they ascribed to Christ before, for why? If we be
not safe conducted to heaven by the predestinate on of God in Jesus Christ, if
follows that we are carried thither by same desert of our own, or else that
we never come there at all, it were a strong engine that should hale them from
this opinion, and yet is Christ hereby made altogether Jacke out of office.
Let us not wonder at these men, so much as pray for them: let us not quarrel so
much with them, as persuade with them, nor laugh so muck at their folly and
wickedness as lament their ignorance: for this is true, if they be right, we be
wrong, if we be wrong, we are already sold under sin: contrary wise if we be
right (whereof let us not doubt, because the spirit of truth has sealed us
up in the Prophets and Apostles) then are they wrong: if they be wrong, there
is nothing more certain then their just damnation, unless they turn to God
with hearty repentance (which God for his son sake even speedily grant them) if
it be his will.

And although they are not ashamed to denounce against us, that we are
Libertines and despisers of good works, because we prefer our faith in free
justification: be it as far from us to be troubled at those false
suggestions, as we are free of that fault, we know and confess, that Gods
dearest children, have small feeling of God without righteous doing: therefore
we profess that if we see no good works in our hands, if we perceive not
that the preaching of the Gospel has mortified in our concupiscence, and made
us to hunger and thirst after righteousness, we have small testimony of Gods
election, we may talk til we are weary of our hope and faith in Christ, we may
prattle till we are hoarse of the Gospel and our profession, and we may desie
the Pope and his accomplices to the bottom of hell. But except our selves love
the righteousness of God, and we exercise the same, Satan does feed us forth,
with the strength of illusion: for Godliness is not made of talk as books
are of leaves nor as woods are of trees, but it is such a holiness as does
clime, from vice to virtue, and from one virtue to another without ceasing.

Good sir, this being true, we have need to look about us, and every man have
an especial eye to Gods glory in the execution of our actions: and if we have
attained to some knowledge in the school of Christ; we see in the Gospel,
that he is condemned, that hides his talent, as well as the other, that
riotously wasted it, I pray you apply this to your self whom the Lord has
loved with long continewaunce of his goodness, and you shall find out a right
Christian exploit even in the man, that sat next at your elbow. Set upon it, or
if you have begone give it not over, for the winning of one soul to Christ is
more acceptable in the sight of GOD, then to offer the whole world for a
sacrifice; what though he be a man, the spirit of GOD is able to encounter him,
if he be never so wyly or perverse in opinion. God who is able to rend the
heart, and to pierce the marrow in the bones, is always presont in his own
work.

What though he happily may command your silence, your spirit must be
touched with his sins, you may not suffer him to rest in uncleanness: for
they that are of CHRIST are always careful to bring others to Christ-ward,
but especially those that are so near unto them, as he is to you, you know
that in process of time, the soft drop of rain does break the hard flint, the
silly worm does throw down the mighty oak, and the slow snayle does attain
to the top of Mountains. Therefore let nothing discon age you.

If this opinion be established upon the prescriptions of his forefathers, try
him by the Prophets and Apostles, if the length and continuance of his religion
does seem forceable toperswade him. show him the law, where God punished y^
transgression of Israel with four hundred years blindness; and no doubt he
that would punish the transgression of that Law, the gave by Angels, with so
long ignorance, may as justly persuade him, that the same God can punish the
contempt of his Gospel, with a thousand years blindness; Nay prove unto him
(I say) the general apostasy whereof the Apostles have told us, if he dare not
subscribe to the Gospel, because he may become an offense to his friends,
prove from thence, that he fears his worldly friends, more then he loves
his heavenly God: if he shun the Gospel because of those herestes, that daily
spring up in the light thereof, show him that he never knew, or else has
forgotten the Scripture, which does witness: The Heresies must needs be, that
the faithful may 1 Cor. 11. 19
be tried, if his eyes be presixed upon professors, that he can find many
faults in their manners, let him look back into him-self, and he shall see
that Papists and Protestants are very men, needing the Physician: But if he
find not so great corruption in himself; First let him take 1 Cor. 10. 12
heed least it fare with him, as with men that be sick, which when they think
themselves recovered and nearest to health, ar even then furthest from health
and nearest their end. But if there be not indeed such corruption in them
(which is hard to be determined on either side, considering how partial our
nature is in it own behalf, and ready to sla^ter it self) let him never
impute this to the dignity of his religion, but to the goodness of God the
giver of al good things. If he fear the Gospel because it is ill spoken off,
Let him remember that Christ Romans 9. ^^.
himself is a stumbling stone made for the fall of many: if he be afraid of
corrupt tra^slations, let him either correct, orshew us y^ causes of his
misliking, and he shall be satisfied. Finally if he shall stumble at Jarre that
is now ava^^s among Divines, let him without partiality, read the monuments of
Popery, and he shall perceive ten times more odds among the Doctors thereof:
For there is none of the^ al (and almost as few of the old fathers) but ar so
far wide one from another, yea and most of them from themselves, that neither
Papists, nor Protestants do want matter thereof to authorize and maintain
their religion, nor any heretic that has been since the first beginning of
Papistry. Therefore you may prove unto him, that this fault ought not to be
fathered on the word of God, which does plainly and truly set forth all points
of religion: But rather upon Satan and his malice, whose continual practice
has been, by all means and devices possible, to discredit the religion of
God: for such Darnell did he throw among the Apostles, as did set great
dissension between Paul and Barnabas, and Acts. 13. 29 Gal. 2. 1^.
likewise made Paul and. Peter at open destance.

Al these things I lean to your continual meditation, and by you, to be
employed to the benefit of Gods Church, as your duty and occasion shall
require: And so beseeching you not to neglect any other, that by your godly
study, you can call to remembrance, whereby Gods truth may be maintained, I do
humbly take my leave.
