By the King.
A Proclamation for Buildings.
THE Kings Majesty perceiving the general commodity which would grow to
this City, if the use of building with Bricks, in and about the said City and
Suburbs thereof, were more practiced and put in use, and Timber preserved and
spared, which by great waste and unnecessary expense thereof, is grown very
scant within this Realm: And chiefly also observing, how much it would grace
and beautify His City of London, being the principal place of this Kingdom,
for the reforte and entertainment of foreign Princes, States, and
Ambassadors, which upon several and diverse occasions, do from time to time
come into this Realm, if the foreparts or forefronts of the houses of this
City and Suburbs thereof, bending and looking toward the streets, were all
builded with Brick. The said building with Brick being also (as experience
daily proves) both more durable, and more safe and defensable against fire,
and of little more charge then the building with Timber: Does therefore
straightly prohibit and forbid all persons whomsoever, that they nor any of them
shall, or do at any time, after the first day of August next coming, build,
erect, or set up, or cause to be builded, erected, or set up, any House,
Habitation, or Shop, or whole Story, of any building joining upon any street
or streets of the City of London, or the Liberties or Suburbs thereof, either
in or upon any ground or place, where no house or habitation, or foundation of
house or habitation heretofore has been, or in, or upon any old or new
foundation whatsoever: Except the said House, Habitation, Shop, or Story, so to
be builded as is aforesaid, or at the least the forefronts or forepart thereof,
bending and looking into the said street or streets be wholly built of
Brick, or of Brick and Stone, or one of them, upon pain of his Majesty's
high displeasure, and of such pains penalties and imprisonments, as by the
laws of this Realm can or may be inflicted upon the offenders therein, for
their contempt and disobedience in that behalf.

And his Majesty does also forbid all Carpenters, Laborers, and Workmen
whatsoever, That they nor any of them do attempt or do any Labor or Work,
in, or about the Building or setting up of any houses within the said City and
places aforesaid, contrary to this his Highness Proclamation, upon pain of
such punishment and imprisonment, as by the Laws of this Realm may or can be
inflicted upon them in that behalf. And his Majesty does also command the
Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London, and all his Majesty's Justices of Peace,
having authority within the said City or the places aforesaid, That they, and
every of them respectively do cause this his Majesty's Commandment to be
strictly observed, and duly executed, according to the tenor and true meaning
hereof, without delay.

Provided always nevertheless, and his Majesty's pleasure is, That this his
Highness Proclamation, or any thing therein contained, shall not extend to any
Houses, Habitations, Shops, or Stories of buildings, which from and after the
said first day of August next coming, shall happen to be builded or erected in
any Alley or Alleys, or other so obscure and mean a Lane, as is not fit for
such building.

Given at Our Castle of Windsor the two and twentieth day of July, in the ninth
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.

Anno Dom. 1611.
