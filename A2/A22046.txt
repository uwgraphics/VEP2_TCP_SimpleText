IT has been our desire and disposition in all the course of our Government
(as one of the best and safest remedies) to extend our natural clemency in
forewarning Offenders where reason of State will not permit us to use the same
in dispensing with their offenses; And having lately observed that diverse of
our Subjects have repaired into our Realm of England from the parts beyond the
Seas (being persons of mean condition, and of wandering course of life, and
unknown to any of credit that might undertake for them) who have refused to
take the Oath of allegiance, lately by our Parliament devised: We can not but
conceive that such persons are not unlike to become bad Instruments of practice
and peril against our State. For considering that we had never any intention
in the form of that Oath to press any point of Conscience for matter of
Religion, but only to make some discovery of disloyal affection: the refusal
thereof in any person must both induce a vehement suspicion in it self, and
much more in such a one as may be probably supposed to have come from such
parts, where he may have conuersed with Traitors and Fugitives, and is also of
a needy fortune, which may make him apt for any dangerous or desperate
employment: And therefore We have resolved, and accordingly do charge and
command all persons authorized by Law, to minister the said Oath, that taking
information from the Officers of our Ports, and by all other good ways and
means, they fail not to tender the same Oath at the Ports to all our Subjects
coming from beyond the Seas, (not being known Merchants or men of some
quality) and upon refusal thereof the Law to be severely executed, which
wills to commit them to Prison until the next Assizes, or General quarter
Sessions, and so upon a second refusal to be brought within the degree of a
Praemunire. Wherein, because the penalty is so grievous (of which
nevertheless we can not in our Princely providence make any alteration) We
have thought good to notify our resolution, and order given therein, which we
doubt not, but will be in small time dispersed abroad; to the end that such as
now are, or hereafter shall be in foreign parts, and find in their own hearts
such affections, as can not stand with the said Oath, may know their peril, and
thereby either refrain their coming in, or expect the execution of our Laws.

Given at our Palace of Westminster the xxix. day of April in the sixth year of
our reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.

Anno Dom. 1608.
