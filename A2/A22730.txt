By the King.
JAMES, by the grace of GOD King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To Our right trusty, and right well-beloved Counselor, WILLIAM Lord Knollys,
Viscount Wallingford, Master of Our Court of Wards and Liueries, And to Our
trusty and wellbeloued the Council of the same Court, And to the Master and
Council of the said Court for the time being, Greeting.
WHEREAS We have heretofore published several Commissions, with Instructions
and Directions to you Our Master and Council of Our Court of Wards and
Liueries, for compounding for Wards, Idiots and Lunatiques, now that time and
experience have produced the knowledge of sundry defects, that otherwise could
not easily have been foreseen, which are to be supplied by explanation and
addition to the same Our Instructions, according to Our gracious purpose for
the good of Our loving Subjects, and Our especial care for the true answering
of Our Revenues. And for so much as it does appear by common experience, in the
course which has been held since the first erection of Our Court of Wards
and Liueries, That partly by the slackenesse of the Friends of the Wards, upon
the decease of the Parents or Ancestors, who have forborne to offer timely
Composition, sometimes with opinion, that no Title could be found for Us, and
sometimes with purpose to suppress the same, and partly by the suite of other
men, the Custody of the bodies and lands of Our Wards, have been committed to
such persons, some for one respect, some for another, as (notwithstanding the
care and providence of you the Master and Council of Our Court, to bind them
in great Bonds and Covenants for the well educating of the Children, and
preservation of their Inheritance) have been careless of their education,
married some in mean places, committed wastes and spoils upon their Lands,
and in the end have exacted greater sums of money for the marriages of such
Wards, then they ought to have done in reason and equity; notwithstanding any
their disbursements whatsoever for passing or procuring the same.

And whereas also We have been informed by you the Master of the said Court,
that by reason of the great difficulties that have been found by the Court,
upon sight of Offices, and Surueyes only, to set down Compositions for
Wardships and Leases of Wards Lands, with such equality and moderation
between Us, and Our Subjects, as were just and reasonable; and that through
want of due information in that behalf, much of the profit that might have
been raised for Us, has been diuerted to diverse Suitors and Committees, who by
obscuring the truth of the Wards estate, and by misinforming of the Court
therein, have reaped greater profit, then was intended, if you could by
ordinary means, have come by the knowledge of their values; so as, both We
have received less then otherwise We should have done, and the Wards found
little ease in many cases.

Wherefore, for the preventing of these and the like inconveniences, and to the
end that Our loving Subjects may stand assured, that We desire nothing more,
then that their Children and their Lands; that shall fall unto Us by reason of
Wardships, might after their decease, be committed to their nearest and
trustiest friends, or to such as they, by Will, or otherwise, commit the charge
unto, upon such valuable considerations, as are just and reasonable: And to the
intent that the Parents and Ancestors may depart in greater peace, in hope of
this Our gracious favor; and their friends may see their Children brought up
in piety and learning, and may take such care as is fit, for the preservation
of their inheritance, if they will seek the same in time, and by such means as
are fit and convenient; We have thought good hereby to require you, the
Master and Council of the said Court for the time being, that in disposing
and committing of the custody of the Bodies and Lands of such Our Wards, whose
Ancestors are already deceased, or shall die from and after the date of these
presents, and of such Idiots and Lunatiques, and their Estates, as shall fall
unto Us from henceforth, you shall strictly and carefully observe these Our
Directions following.

FIRST, that no Direction for the finding of any Office, be given for Wardship
of the Body and Lands of any Ward, until the end of one month next after the
death of the Ancestor of the Ward, but to the nearest and trustiest friends of
the Ward, or other persons nominated by the Ancestor in the Wards behalf, who
may in the mean time become Suitors for the same, among whom, choice may be
made of the best and fittest: and if none of the Wards friends make petition by
the end of the month, then it shall be lawful for any other to petition, and
to find the Office for the said Wardship.

ALSO, That no composition, agreement or promise of any Wardship, or Lease of
Lands be made, until the Office be found, and then such of the Friends to
have preferment, as tendered their Petitions within the month, they yielding a
reasonable Composition; and in default of them, such others as were or shall be
Suitors, yielding also a reasonable Composition.

ALSO, You shall do your best endeavors to inform your selves as perticularly
as you may, by Commission, Survey or otherwise, of the truth of the Wards
Estates, as well of his Inheritance, as of his Goods and Chattels, and of the
Estate of the deceased Ancestor, and of all other due circumstances
considerable, to the end the Compositions may be such as may stand both with
Our reasonable profit, and with the ability of the heirs estate.

THAT all Petitions for Wardships, Idiots and Lunatiques, shall be first
delivered to the Clerk of the Court, by the Suitor himself, and the Clerk of
the Court is hereby directed to make entry of the same Petitions without any
Fee, the very day of the delivery of the same, and return them to the Suitor,
who shall afterward present the same Petition openly at the Council Table of
the Court of Wards, there to be ordered by the Officers at their next sitting.

THAT every such Petition do express the several Counties, wherein the
Ancestors died seized of Lands.

THAT all Petitioners that have warrant to find an Office, and appointed to

of the foresaid Cases.

Clerk, in what Counties Our Tenaunts died seized of any Lands, and of the
Lands of Idiots, and that the Feodaries accordingly send up their Certificate
of the best improued value of all the same Lands, lying in their said several
Counties, by the first sitting of the Officers the next Term following.

THAT the Feodary do make his Certificate by view or other special
information of the best improoued value, with his reasons thereof privately
without giving knowledge to the Suitor, or any for him of any value intended by
him to be certified, and without taking any Fee or Reward from the Suitor, or
any for him for valewing the Lands or personal estate.

THAT the Feodaries do name in their Certificats, the Lands in order one after
another, as they lie in order in the Office, and to set down in the one
Margent of their Certificats, the value in the office, and in the other Margent

distributed according to the estates found in the Office.

THAT the Feodarie do certify all Coppieholds, Leases, value of woods, or
other personal estate that comes to the Ward, or any immediate possibility
of any estate of Lands, whereby his marriage may be improoued.

THAT the Feodary shall not mention in his Certificate, any thing omitted out
of the office against the King to abate the Composition, but shall leave the
same to be alleged by the Suitor to be allowed (if cause be) upon proof to be
made thereof by them at the Composition.

THAT the Escheator, and Feodary, and Commissioners shall provide, that Offices
be not confusedly found, by joining diverse Manors and Lands in one gross
value together.

THAT the Certificates of the Feodarie be delivered by the first sitting of
the Officers in every Term, to the Clerk of the Court, close sealed up, and
so to remain with the Clerk vnopened, until the time of Composition: And if
it be delivered by the hands of a stranger, then he to deliver it upon oath,
according to the usual course of the Court in like cases, and to be brought by
the Clerk vnopened, at the Officers sitting there to be opened, and use to be
made of the same.

THAT the Feodaries do find Offices at the best value that may appear upon
search of ancient Offices, or other Records; if there be no Record, then to be
found by the Jury, according to Evidence to be given.

THAT no Office be found within the year after the death of the Ancestor
against Us or a mean Tenure of Us (not being Knights service) for any Ward
within age, until the Feodary or Escheator do first acquaint the Court for
further directions therein, which the Feodary is enjoined to do with all
convenient expedition.

THAT every Feodary and Eschetor, before the third Return of every Term,

Clerks and Officers of the said Courts: And if any person shall deny or
neglect to pay any such due Fees, then upon the petition of the said Clerk to

Commitments of Idiots, and custody of their Estates be made by the Master and
Council of the same Court, openly in the Council Chamber of the Court of
Wards, and by such persons as are authorized by Statute in that behalf.
Nevertheless, the Surueyor of the Liueries, the Attorney of the Wards,
Receiver and Auditors, or any four of them, without the Master, may treat
with any to bring the said Wardships, and the Leases, and the Commitments of
Idiots to a price, openly in the Council Chamber of the Court of Wards, and

same, according to the said Statute.

with provision for fellable Woods, that the Lessees sell them by fit portions.

THAT Fines of Copieholds for lives be made and raised to Our use, when, and
as often as the Court shall think good, by certain particular Commissioners,
to be appointed by the Master and Council of Our said Court; which

Justice of the Peace, to be certified and returned into the Court, before the
delivery of such grant or Lease, in manner and form following, viz.

J. A. B. do swear, That neither I, nor any other to my knowledge, have or
has given, or promised, procured or consented to give or to be given any gift
or reward, directly or indirectly, unto any Officer or Officers of the Court of
Wards and Liueries, or to any other person or persons whatsoever, for procuring
any preferment to compound before an other, or for mitigation in the price or
payment in any Composition or Contract made, or to be made for the Wardship of
the body of I. S. his Majesty's Ward, and the Lease of any the said Wards
Lands, or for the signing or dispatching of any Grants of them, or any of them,
or for the mitigatio^ of the yearly value of any of the Lands of the said Ward
(ordinary Fees only excepted,) And that I will not give, nor any with my
consent shall give, or consent to be given any gift or reward, directly or
indirectly for the causes aforesaid, or any of them; And that I do take the
said Wardship to the use of the said Ward, and the said Lease to the use of
A. B. and not in trust for or to the use of any other person or persons
whatsoever; So help me God.

THAT especial choice be made of the Commissioners that receive the Oath in
the Country, so that the Oath may be truly and fully taken by the
Committees, Lessees and Assignees, and the parties committing trust to any
other.

THAT the Oath be taken by those that are Committees or Lessees upon neglect in
hec verba.

J. A. B. do swear, that neither J, nor any other to my knowledge, or as I
believe or have heard, have or has taken any course, or used any practice or
combination directly or indirectly, by my self or by an other, with any person
or persons whatsoever, to stay or hinder the prosecution of, and for the
Composition for the Wardship of the body of B. C. or the Lease of any of the
said Wards lands, with any purpose or intent whatsoever, that the said Wardship
and Lease, or either of them, by such neglect and default of prosecution, might
come to me, or to any other to my use, or by my means or procurement, or to
my knowledge; So help me God.

THAT no Recusant be admitted to compound, or be Assignee of any Ward of
Body or Lands, or of Idiots.

THAT all tenders and continuances of Liueries, be only made to the Surueyour
of the Liueries, who is commanded to take an exact care of Our just profits
therein, We intending an account of him for that service.

THAT the Feodaries shall make Surueys upon Liueries, in cases of full age,
as well as in cases within age; and both according to the reasonable value,
having respect to the improued value.

BUT touching Lunatiques, let no composition be taken for the committing of
them or their Estates; but let such care be had therein, as they may be freely
committed to their best and nearest friends, that can receive no benefit by
their death, and the Committees bound to answer, not only the values found by
Office, but the very just value of their Estates upon accounts, for the benefit
of such Lunatique, (if he recover) or of his next Heir, Executors or
Administrators, due regard being had to the pains and charges of such
Committees, in keeping, maintaining governing, and curing of the said
distracted persons.

THAT all the revenues of the Wards Lands be immediately paid into the Receipt
of the Wards, unto the Receiver of the same Court, by the Farmors and Lessees
themselves, and shall not be paid unto the hands of any other (excepting such
Rents that be under the value of ten pounds a veere, which are appointed to
be paid unto the Feodaries.

THAT Petitions or demands for any allowance from us exhibited by the
Feodaries, or any other, for any service or disbursments shall not be granted
or allowed until the same be both particularly examined and allowed by the
Master and Council openly at their several sittings.

That the Receivers account be taken and declared every year, according to
the Statute of 32. Henr. Octaui, before the Master of the Wards, Attorney, and
one or both of the Auditors; and after the determination of the said account,
the Master, Attorney, and the Auditor or Auditors, shall all of them set their
hands to the Receivers book of Accounts, which is and shall be for the
Receivers charge and discharge, as the case shall require.

THAT the Auditors do ingrosse into Parchment all the said Receivers accounts,
according to the express time and direction of the Statute of 32. Henrici
Octaui, and do yearly certify and return the same so engrossed, with all
the Warrants, Acquittances and Debenters into the Treasury of the Court of
Wards, there to remain as the Records of the Court, according to the Statute,
and the ancient course of the Court.

THAT all the accounts of the Feodaries be likewise declared and certified
every Hillary Term, to the Master and Council of the Wards, openly at the
sittings of the Officers in the Council Chamber, that the Court may know how
the remains upon their accounts be satisfied and paid, and their accounts to
be accordingly returned into the Court, there to remain.

AND because Our purpose in this course, which now is taken, is to raise with
as little grieuance as may be to Our loving Subjects, that reasonable benefit
which ought to come unto Us, by the Marriages of Our Wards, and by their Leases
of their Lands, whereof a great part has been diuerted by Grants to
Committees, and otherwise: We do hereby declare, that it is not Our meaning
to change the course that has been formerly held and used in finding Offices;
nor to press the raising or improouing of any values or Rates in any
Inquisitions, other then as aforesaid: Neither will We have the Rents which
shall be reserved upon such Leases, or any such Certificats, Informations or
Instructions, as shall by any means be given or appear of the valewes of such
Wards Lands or estates, to be transcribed, or transmitted to any other Court,
Office, place or person; or admitted or used as President, evidence or
inducement, to charge Our Subjects in any other payments now, or hereafter
answerable unto Us, Our Heirs or Successors, or for any other cause.

NEVERTHELES, We are well pleased and contented, that if any Wardship, Lease
of Land, Mean rates before or after full age, now be, or hereafter shall be
concealed from Us, and no Suite shall be made within three years next after
Our Tenants death, for such Wardship or Lease; that in such case the Master and
Council of the Court of Wards, openly in the Councel-chamber, as aforesaid,
may admit any fit person whatsoever, that shall make offer to discover Our
right so concealed, or sought to be concealed and suppressed, upon good matter
or proof, showed for Us and approved by the Court, to prosecute the finding of
an Office, and to pass the said Wardship, lease or Mean rates, without
restraining or binding the said Court, or the party prosecuting, according to
the Directions above mentioned, but that the Master and Council of the said
Court, may openly in the councel-Chamber, as aforsaid, according to the parties
travail, expenses, adventure and service done unto Us, reward him, by granting
such Wardship, Lease, or Mean rates, in such sort as others may be encouraged
to employ themselves in the like Service; And all devices and practices to
deceive and defraud Us of Our due and just Right, be better prevented; Any
thing in these our Instructions or Directions to the contrary notwithstanding.

PROVIDED always, and We do hereby declare it to be Our will and pleasure,
that where it shall appear to you, that neither We nor Our Progenitors, have
enjoyed any benefit by Wardship, Livery, Primer seisen, Relief, Respect of
Homage, Fines or Mean Rates of any Lands within the space of threescore years
last past, where such benefit ought to have come to the Crown, if such Tenure
had been acknowledged: In such cases We are pleased to give power and
authority to you Our Master and Council of Our Court, openly in the
councel-Chamber, as aforesaid, to remit and release all such Benefit and
profit, as have or ought to have accrued unto Us, or to Our Progenitors, by
reason of any such Tenure, allowing to such persons as have prosecuted in Our
behalf, such part thereof as shall seem good in your discretion, not
exceeding a third part of the whole, as the same shall be found by inquisition;
Saving to Us, Our Heirs and Successors, the right and inheritance of Our
Tenures; And saving Our Prerogative, and the benefit and profit of such Tenures
of Us, or Our Progenitors, as do expressly appear by matter of Record; And
also such as have been created, or otherwise come unto Us within the same time
of threescore years.

AND now that We have so sufficiently directed you, as We make little doubt
but you will be careful of Our profit in the execution of your places; So
nevertheless, We let you know hereby, that seeing Our own judgment tells
Us, that there may fall into your considerations many circumstances, which must
guide you in assessing the Fines for the marriages of Our Wards, and Renting of
their Lands; some arising either out of the broken estate of the deceased, want
of provision for his Wife, his great charge of children unprovided for,
infirmity or tenderness of the Heir, uncertainty of the Title, or greatness
of encumbrance upon the Land, so as some Heir, that may in respect of his
degree, blood, or living, in opinion of the world be judged to deserve a
greater Rent or Fine, then some other persons more obscure may, yet in regard
of the causes above mentioned, or some other of like sort, less fit to have
any greater charge laid upon him: We do therefore, notwithstanding any thing
contained in these Our Instructions, give you full liberty, that as these, or
any other the like considerations, shall offer themselves unto you, you may use
that good discretion and conscience which is fit, openly in the Council
chamber, as aforesaid, in mittigating or abating the Fines or Rents upon the
said Grants or Leases, to the relief of such necessities; So always as care
be taken, that by any such pretenses, that profit which should accrue unto Us,
be not diuerted to any others that shall seek to draw to themselves a private
benefit out of this Our gracious care and consideration. And Our will and
pleasure is, and We do hereby direct and authorize you the Master and
Council of the said Court, and the Master and Council of the same for the
time being, that with the advice of Our Judges, Assistants of Our said Court,
you diligently examine, search out, and reform all fraudulent devices and
practices, devised or to be devised and put in ure, to deceive and defeat Us
of Our Wardships, or Leases of Our Wards Lands, or of any due or just benefit
belonging unto Us, by reason of Our Tenures.

AND lastly, that the Master of the Wards, Surueyour, Attorney, Receiver,
Auditors, Clerk of the Court, and his Deputy, the Clerk of the Liueries and
his Deputy, and all the Feodaries, and the Masters Secretary, and all other
Officers, and persons employed in his Majesty's Revenue of the Wards, shall
take an express oath, openly in the Council chamber of the Court of Wards,
in manner and form following.

I, A. B. do swear, that neither I, nor any other person for me by my
appointment, knowledge or consent, shall take or receive of any person, any
gift or reward directly or indirectly, for any Composition or preferment, or
causing any person or persons to be preferred to compound before another, or to
have any mittigation in the price, or payment in any Composition or contract,
at any time hereafter to be made for the Wardship of the body, or Lease of
the Lands of any his Majesty's Wards, or for the custody of any his Majesty's
Idiots, or Lunatikes, or their Lands, Goods or Chattels, or for the signing or
dispatching of any Warrant for any Grant of them or any of them, excepting
ordinary Fees: So help me God. In witness whereof We have caused these Our
Letters to be made Patents.

Witness Ourselfe at Westminster the eleventh day of December, in the
sixteenth year of Our Reign of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland
the two and fiftieth.
