AN ADMONITION By way of QUERE, To all such as desire to be true to the KING.
I. Whether our joining With the City to fetch home the KING to them, will
consist with our allegiance, and his advancement? Considering, First, that the
KING did never desire us to fetch him home to the City. Secondly, That the King
did never Declare, that he had rather be in the hands of the Citizens, then
where he now is.


II. Consider whether the interest of the City, and their engagements in the
late War, will stand with that freedom as they pretend they will allow to
the KING.

III. Whether they will not Press the Covenant in so strickt a sense, as His
Majesty cannot with a safe conscience condescend thereunto?

And therefore it is seriously desired, that every one who is true to His
Majesty, would (before they engage themselves) join in a Petition to the Court
of Aldermen and Common-Councell-men of London, to desire them to declare in
particular manner, what they intend to do, touching the settling of the KINGS
Prerogative, both in Ecclesiastical and civil affairs.
