By the Queen.
THe Queens most Excellent Majesty being credibly informed that many
Vagabonds, Rogues, idle persons, and masterlesse men having nothing to live on,
do daily resort to the Cities of London and Westminster, and to the Suburbs of
the same and also to the Borough of Southwarke, and other Villages and Towns
near adjoining to the said Cities and Borough, and there are suffered to live
very disorderly, by occasion whereof many Robberies and Fellonies, and other
horrible crimes and offenses be committed and done, to the high displeasure of
Almighty God, and to the great hurt of her good and loning Subjects, the chief
occasion whereof seems to be the want of the good execution of good Laws and
Statutes made for the punishment of such Masterlesse men, Idle and Vagrant
persons: Wherefore her Majesty minding with some severity primely to have the
said good Laws and Statutes already provided against such persons to be duly
put in execution, has thought good by this her Proclamation to notify the
same her Highness pleasure to all her loving Subjects; And therefore does
straightly charge and command all persons, that by the Laws of this Realm may
be taken for Rogues and Vagabonds, and all Idle persons and Masterlesse men,
having not wherewith to live in no living by any lawful Labor or Occupation,
and being her natural borne Subjects, that they and every of them do within
two days next after the publishing of this Proclamation, depart and avoid
themselves from the said Cities of London and Westminster, and Suburbs of the
same, and from the Borough of Southwarke, and all other Towns and Villages
within seven miles compass of the said Cities and Borough, and from thence to
repair to the Countries and places where they were borne, there to tarry and
adide in some lawful work and exercise, as they ought to do, upon the pains
and penalties limited and expressed in the Laws and Statutes provided against
such offenders. And her Majesty's further pleasure and express Commandment
is, that the Mayor, Aldermen and Recorder of the said City of London, and all
Justices of Peace within the Counties of Middlesexe, Rent, Surrey, and Essex;
and specially all those Justices that be within the limits aforesaid, that
they and every of them, as they will avoid her Highness displeasure, as
occasion shall serve cause good watch to be set, and search to be made in all
places where they shall think convenient, for the apprehending, arresting and
taking of all such idle vagrant persons, and masterlesse men, and that they
cause the same with all speed to be imprisoned, and duly punished according
to the tenor and effect of her Majesty's Laws and Statutes in such cases
provided, without any toleration or favor whatsoever to be showed unto any of
them. And her Majesty does also especially charge and command the said
Mayor, Aldermen and Recorder of London, and all Justices of Peace, Bailiffes of
Liberties and Franthises within the said Cities, Towns and Limits, that they
and every of them within the limits of their Jurisdictions, do from time to
time cause good search to be made as well in all common Tabling houses, Innes,
Alehouses, and Tippling houses, and also in all Bowling Alleyes, and other
places, where any gaming or play is used and frequented, and there to apprehend
and take such suspected persons being Masterlesse men, of evil name and fame,
not having where withal to maintain their idle life, and the same so
apprehended and taken, to commit to prison, there to remain, until they shall
receive such punishment and correction, as by the Laws and Statutes of this
Realm, is and shall be due unto them. And her Highness is further pleased and
contented, that the Mayor of the said City of London, shall have power and
authority from time to time, to proclaim and publish this present
Proclamation within all places, within the said City and Suburbs, so often as
to him shall seem needful and convenient.

Given at Her Majesty's Honor of Hampton Court, the xxxj. day of January 1578.
in the xxj. year of Her Highness Reign.
Imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queens Majesty.
