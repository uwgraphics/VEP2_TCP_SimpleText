By the Queen,
Right trusty and well-beloved, we greet you well. We understand by sundry
means, that where of late we ordered a proclamation to be publyshed in
certain Counties upon the Sea costs, for the licensyng of such as reside in
any ports of the Sea, or others, for their defense and safegarde to do their
uttermost against any the French kings subjects, with further alowaunce of
prizes of French vessels taken upon the Seas, as further in the same
proclamation appears: Sundry light and lewd persons about our City of
London, and suburbs of the same, have by color and false pretense of the
said proclamation, being neither proclaimed there at all, nor yet so intended,
as by the manifest words of the same proclamation appears, have entered and
seized the persons and goods, not only of diverse French men and women, living
quietly and orderly without offense of any our subjects: but also of such as
are denizens, and so accounted in a manner our subjects, and besides that
(which is not to be suffered unpunished) of sundry others, being in deed
English borne, pretending them maliciously to be French, and others being
borne under the obedience of other Princes and states out of the French kings
obeysaunce: By which disorder we perceive that much disquietnes has risen. And
therefore we will and command you, that you shall notify in places most
notorious within our City of London, and suburbs of the same, that all
persons, of what sort soever the same be, that have been thus molested in body
or goods, by pretense aforesaid, within our said City or suburbs, shall be
restored to full liberty, and that the disturbers be arrested and compelled to
answer for their violences and misdemeaners, as breakers of our peace, and
trespassers, according to the order of our laws, either at the suite of the
parties damaged, or at the suite of you being our Mayor and Lieuetenaunt of our
said City, so as some sharp and evident punishment following, may give cause
to others hereafter not to use such outrages, against order and without
authority. And this our letter, or the substance thereof, you shall publyshe
and notify.

Yeuen under our Signet at our Manor of Richmond, the second day of August,
the fyfth year of our reign.

GOD save the Queen.
