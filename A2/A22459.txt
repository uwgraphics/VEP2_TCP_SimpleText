care of them, and Our Royal directions given for keeping them there in good
order) wilfully continue, lurk and remain in Our City of London, or the
Suburbs of the same, and straggle up and down in the high ways, and other
places, to the ill example of the rest, the offense of Our people, and contempt

with their fellows, and demean themselves in orderly manner, upon pain of
Our Indignation and high displeasure: And that all such Soldiers as shall be
so found in or about Our said City, and the Suburbs thereof, or elsewhere,
contrary to this Our Proclamation, and shall not presently, after the
publication hereof, repair to the Companies of those Regiments whereunto they
respectively belong, to be there Billeted and remain with their fellows,
shall be reputed and taken as Vagrants: And such as shall do any violence or
outrage, or otherwise carry themselves then becomes Soldiers in orderly
discipline, shall be proceeded against by the course of Marshall law, or
otherwise; straightly charging and commanding all Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of
Peace, Bayliffes, Constables, and other Our Officers and Ministers, from time

Our Royal pleasure and Command, and will answ^^e for the contrary at their
perils.
