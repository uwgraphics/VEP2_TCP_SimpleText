EDVARDI. VI.
An Act, concerning the city of Chester, for wears in the river of Dee.
The.xxv. Chapter.
IN most humble wise, shows unto your royal majesty, your true faithful
and obedient subjects the Mayor, Aldetmen, Sherifes, Commonaltie, and
Inhabitants of your graces city of Chester: that where thesaid city, is one
of the auncientest Citees within your realm, whereby the tounes and contrees
adioynyng, have heretofore had great relief, commodity, and profit, and is
the chief keye and defense in those parts, to furnish and serve your grace in
all your affairs, and weighty business, into your realm of Irelande and
Scotland, and has no other aid or help; whereby thesaied city is chiefly
maintained, but by the river of Dee, runnyng and coming to thesaid city, and
the haven there very shalowe and dangerous for all ships and vessels, to
repair and come unto thesaied city, so that as well the inhabitants of
the same, as also strangers at this day, with their wares and merchaundises do
not read or have recourse there, as they heretofore were accustomed to do, to
the great detriment of the same. And forasmuch as diverse persons having
lands adioynyng to the same river of Dee, for their private lucre and
commodity, not regardyng the common weal of the whole countries and
citizeins, have heretofore made, reared, and caused to be fixed and set up,
in, and clean over thesaied river of Dee, sondrie wears, gores; great
hedges, piles, gates, fish gates, nets, and other ingines, for taking of
fish within thesaied river, and still do preserve, keep, and maintein the same:
By reason whereof, the merchauntes, and other enhabitantes of thesaied city,
cannot have recourse, ne liberal and direct passage, in, and upon thesaied
river, with their Cogges, Kielles, Boats, fleutes, of buildyng timber, fuel,
and other timber for making of ships, and vessels for the conueighyng and
bryngyng of the same and other their wares and merchaundizes by water, in, to,
and from the maine land or country, neither also the inhabitants of the
country there, can conveniently have any passage to conueigh, come, or bring
by water, up, or down, to, or from thesaied city, any fuel, timber, corn,
or other thing necessary to serve thesaied city, but only by land, by the
which their travel and recourse, by land to the markettes, faires, and all
other times, the high ways and lanes, are not only so foul and deape, that
no person in the winter time, can easily escape the anoyance and daungier
thereof, to come to thesaied city, to bring, victual, wares, and
merchau^dizes, which causes great scarcity, want and dearth thereof: but
also the brood and fry of Salmon, and other fish in thesaied river, is, and
be commonly thereby destroyed, which said inconveniences, incommodities and
other enormities, as heretofore have been expressed, is, and has been, by
reason thesaied city, being parcel of the County Palentine of Chester, has
been always exempted, excluded, and separated from your high court of
Parliament, to have any Burgeses for thesaid city within this honorable
Court, till now of late, at the Parliament holden at Westminster, in
the.xxxij. year of the reign of your late father of most famous memory king
Henry the eight. By reason whereof thesaied city and inhabitauntes, have
hitherto sustained manifold disherisons, losses and dangers, and this thesaied
city is like to be utterly empouerished go to decay, and utter ruin and
destruction, unless spedy remedy be in that behalf shortly had and provided.
And for that every city of England, has the commodity of the rivers and
great waters, coming to their citees, to have free passage, to transport,
conueigh, and bring up and down, at their pleasure and liberty, all wares and
other things, behouefull and necessary for them: but only your graces city
of Chester. For redress and reformacion whereof, pleases it your most royal
majesty, that it may be enacted by your said majesty, with the assent of
the lords spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament
assembled, and by the authority of the same, that all and every manner of
persons, of what estate, degree, or condition, soever he or they be, that
heretofore have reared, fixed and set, or hereafter shall reate, fix or set,
