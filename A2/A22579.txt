DIEV ET MON DROIT HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King. A Proclamation for reforming and preventing the frauds frequently
practiced, as well in the ouer-weight of Butter-Casks, as in the false packing
of Butter.
WHereas Our loving Subjects the Freemen of Our City of London trading in
Butter and Cheese, have by their Petition lately presented unto Us, Humbly
showed that time out of mind every Firkin of Butter has used and ought to be
of the weight of fifty six pounds neat Butter besides the Caske, and the Caske
eight pounds and no more; But by the greedy and coueteous practices of some
deceiptfull persons, who are the makers and packers of Butter, most part of the
Firkins that are filled and packed, do weigh some twelve, and some fourteen
pounds the empty Caske, And both Caske and Butter for the most part, weigh not
above sixty or sixty and two pounds, and many times but fifty eight pounds, And
that by means thereof Our loving Subjects are daily deceived of four, six,
and eight pounds of Butter, and sometimes more in each Firkin, and so
accordingly in greater and lesser Vessels: And likewise that the makers and
packers of Butter do usually pack up corrupt Butter with their best
Creame-butter, to the no less abuse and deceit of Our loving Subjects; For
prevention whereof Our said Subjects the Freemen of London most humbly prayed,
That We would be graciously pleased by Our Letters Patents to appoint one
person of trust, Authorizing him and his Deputies to Brand and set a Mark on
the outside of each Firkin, Kilderkin, Barrel and other Caske, and Vessel
whatsoever wherein Butter is to be packt and put up, within Our Kingdom of
England, and Dominion of Wales, to express the weight of the same with
allowance to each Caske for seasoning.

And withal to prohibit all makers and packers of Butter not to fill or pack
up Butter into any Firkin, Kilderkin, Barrel, or other Vessel whatsoever,
until such Officer or his Deputies have so Branded or marked the same empty
Caske or Vessel, upon pain of forfeiture as well of the Butter as the Vessel.

And that the said Officer, and his Deputies, might have power to search for,
seize and take away all such Firkins, and other Vessels of Butter, as he or
they should find filled and packed unmarked and falsely packed as aforesaid,
which Petition we referring to the Consideration of the Lords, and others of
Our privy Council, upon due Consideration had thereupon, it was thought very
requisite that the said deceits and abuses should be speedily reformed: And the
best means for the doing thereof was also conceived to be by appointing such
an Officer to Brand and mark all the said empty Caske and other Vessel
before they be filled, thereby to express the weight, and contents on the
outside thereof, as was humbly desired by the said freemen of London: We
therefore for the avoiding and preventing hereafter of all the abuses, and
deceits before specified for the good, and benefit of all Our Loving Subjects,
did by Our Letters Patents, dated the second day of July last past, for us, Our
heirs, and Successors, appoint, erect, create, and make an Office, as well for
the gaging of Butter, as for the Branding, and marking of all empty
Butter-Caske, and Vessel.

And We reposing trust, and confidence in the fidelity, industry, diligence
and experience of Captain John Read, did at the nomination of the said freemen
of London, Trading in Butter, and Cheese, thereby give and grant to him, his
Deputies, and Assigns, during his natural life, the said Office of gaging,
Branding and marking of all empty Butter-Caske, and Vessel within Our said
Realm of England, and Dominion of Wales. And also according as was thought fit
by Our said Subjects the freemen of Our said City, We did by Our said letters
Patents, as also We do by these presents ordain and appoint that the said
Captain John Read, his Deputies and Assigns, shall have, take and receive of
all and every person and persons whatsoever, who shall bring the said Caske or
other Vessel to be marked or Branded, upon the Branding or marking of every
Firkin the sum of two pence, and so proportionably according to the same rate
for every lesser or greater Caske or Vessel.

And We do hereby straightly charge, prohibit, and forbid all and every makers
and packers of Butter, within this Our Realm of England, and Dominion of
Wales, that they nor any of them do at any time or times hereafter, from and
after the first day of March next ensuing the date hereof, presume to fill or
pack up any Butter into any Firkin, Kilderkin, Pot or other Vessel
whatsoever, to be put to sale, before such time or until the said Captain
John Read, or his Assigns, or his or their Deputy or Deputies have first gaged
and marked every such Caske and vessel, and set his Brand or mark thereupon
expressing the weight thereof on the outside, whereby the buyer and buyers of
any such Butter, may have fifty six pounds of neat Butter in every Firkin,
and so after the same rate in every other Vessel, Pot, and Caske to be filled
with Butter, proportionably. And likewise we do hereby prohibit, that no
person, or persons whatsoever, from and after the day aforesaid, do buy any
Butter, put up in any Vessel or Caske, unless the same be first Branded and
marked as aforesaid.

And also that the said makers and packers of Butter do not presume to make
up, or pack into any such Vessel, or Caske, any bad or corrupt Butter, with
good Creame-butter, upon pain of being punished in Our Court of
Star Chamber, as contemners of Our Royal Commands, and as falsifiers, and
deceivers of Our people.

And We do hereby give full power and authority unto the said Captain John
Read, and his Assigns, and to his and their Deputy, and Deputies, and every
of them with the assistance of a Constable, or other Officer, to enter into any
place, or places whatsoever, at convenient times, to search for all such
Vessel, and Caske, as shall be filled with Butter unmarked, or vnbranded, or
falsely, or corruptly filled as aforesaid, and finding any such Caske, or
Vessel, to seize and destroy the same, and to cause the Offenders to be duly
punished.

And that Our purpose herein may be firmly executed for the good and benefit
of Our Subjects, We do hereby prohibit and forbid all and every person, and
persons whatsoever, that none of them, other then the said Captain John Read,
and his Assigns, and his and their Deputy, and Deputies do take upon them,
or presume, or attempt to mark, gage, or brand any empty Butter-caske, or
Vessel whatsoever, or intermeddle, or do any thing to the said Office
belonging, or appertaining, contrary to the true meaning of these presents,
upon pain of Our high indignation, and displeasure, and of such other pains,
penalties, and punishments, as by the Laws of this Our Realm of England, or
by Our Prerogative Royal, can, or may be inflicted upon the offenders herein,
for breach, and contempt of this Our Royal pleasure and Commandment.

And lastly, We do hereby for Us, Our Heirs, and Successors, straightly
Charge and Command, all and singular Majors, Justices of Peace, Sheriffs,
Bailiffs, Constables, Headboroughs, and all other Officers, and Ministers
whatsoever, of Us, Our Heirs, and Successors to be ayding, assisting, and
helping, unto the said Captain John Read, and his Assigns, and his, and
their Deputy, and Deputies, and every of them, in the due execution of the said
Office, and of Our Will and pleasure herein expressed in all things, according
to the true meaning of these presents, and in no wise to hinder him, or them,
in the execution and performance of this service, As they tender Our pleasure,
and will avoid the contrary at their perils.

Given at Our Court at Theobalds, the thirteenth day of November, in the tenth
year of Our Reign.

Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1634.
