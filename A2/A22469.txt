A Proclamation for the repressing of disorders of Mariners.
WHereas the Mariners lately employed in our service, might not be dismissed,
until due satisfaction made of their wages, and We have, and still do take
care with all the speed We may, to discharge, and make payment of their
entertainements, and in the mean time see to provide for them, that they may
not want that which is necessary for their lodging and diet, fitting for their
quality: And as it is fit, that whilst they remain in Our pay, they should be
restrained from those outrages, and tumultuous assemblies, which they daily
run into, under pretense of their wants. And whereas, by the advice of Our
Privy Counsel, We have already given order to the deputy Lieutenants, and
Justices of Peace of Our County of Middlesex, for the billetring of the said
Mariners, in, and about the Towns, of Wapping, Ratcliffe, Limehouse,
Blackwall, and Stepney, in Our said County, to the end the same may be orderly
performed: These are to will and command, that the Purser of every Ship, with
two, or three only of the Officers of the Ship, bringing with them a true list
of the number, and names of the Mariners of the several Ships respectively,
shall repair to the Commissioners of Our Navy, and shall from them receive
Tickets, directing each Mariner contained in the said List, to the place and
house where he is to be Billeted; upon receipt of which Ticket, by each
Mariner from the Purser, he is to repair to the place directed by such
Ticket, where he shall be provided of meat, drink, and lodging, according to
the rate of three shillings and six pence the week, which we will justly and
duly satisfy.

And We do further will and command, that no Mariner do presume to make
their address to Our said Commissioners, or any others, under pretense of want
of their wages, or provision for them, in greater numbers, or otherwise, then
as aforesaid; And if they, or any of them or any others under that pretext,
shall from henceforth presume to assemble together in multitudes, or commit any
outrages, or disorders, as formerly they have done, We do further will and
command, That the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen of Our City of London, within the
said City and Liberties thereof, and the Lords Lieutenants, and Deputy
Lieutenants of Our said County of Middlesex, and Counties adjacent, do raise
and arm their Trained Bands respectively, and do therewith repel their
insolences, and assail them in hostile manner, as rebels to the State, and
enemies to the common Peace, and Government of the same, Of which Our Royal
command, in, and concerning the premises, We do hereby will and require all
and every person and persons, to take knowledge, and thereunto to yield due
obedience, at their uttermost perils.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, the seventeenth day of February in the third
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.

most Excellent MAJESTY. M.DC.XXVII.
