By the Queen.
A Proclamation for the dearth of Corn.
THE Queens Majesty hearing by report out of sundry Countries in the Realm,
or the unreasonable increase of prices of Grain, to the grief of her poorer
sort of people that have no living by Cillage: And though the sellers of Corn,
as rich Farmers, and Ingrossers, do pretend to raise the prices by color of
the unseasonableness of this Summer: yet that being no rust cause to raise the
prices of their old Corn of the last years growth, but that the Farmers and
Ingrossers of Corn, of mere covetousness have very lately, even within two
months, most uncharitably haunced up their prices, not collerable to be
suffered. For remedy whereof, to the relief of the great multitude of her
poor loving Subjects, lacking Corn for their food, and also for reformation
of many other abuses committed by such covetous and uncharitable persons, being
void of all natural compassion toward their neighbors: Her Majesty calling
to her remembrance the good orders by her Majesty's commandment published the
last year, especially for the stay of the dearth of Corn, to be executed by
the Sherifes and Justices of Peace in every County of her Realm, the good
observation whereof would remedy these disorders of the ill and wealthy sort,
and to the relief of the good and needy: Does therefore charge and
straightly command all her Sherifes and Justices of Peace, and other
principal Officers in Towns Corporate, forthwith upon publication hereof to
assemble themselves in their places accustomed, and there diligently to peruse
the said Orders published in the year of our Lord, one thousand five hundred
fourscore and fifteen, and diligently to consider all such points of those
Orders, as may tend to the reformation of all persons, that by their disorder
and covetousness, and breach of the said Orders, are the causers directly or
indirectly to increase the prices of Grain in this lamentable sort beyond
reason, and forthwith to proceed to the execution of all such orders, as may
with good reason give remedy to the furniture of Markets, and to abate such
unreasonable increase of prices. And of their doings her Majesty commands
that the said Sherifes and Justices, and other principal Officers, do
certify her Majesty's privy Counsel monthly, or oftener, until the last of
December next, with particular notifications of such Justices and Officers as
shall herein bestow their labors, so as her Majesty by such certificate may
be duly informed, who they are that shall duetifully toward her Majesty, and
charitably toward their neighbors, perform their charge committed to them,
and contrariwise to mislike of such as shall neglect the execution of this her
commandment.

And in like manner, her Majesty being informed of an abuse greatly tending to
make a scarcity of Corn meet to make bread, by making of Starch within the
Realm, of Corn of the Realm, does straightly command, that no manner of
person shall make any Starch of any Corn, or branne of Corn grown within the
Realm, or that is, or shall be brought into the Realm, nor wittingly sell or
utter any such Starch (except such as has been made by virtue of her Majesty's
Letters Patents.) And whereas her Majesty has already, by her said Letters
Patents granted to one of her loving Subjects, the making of Starch to be
made of Bran only: To the end, the poorer sort may be relieved this way also,
Her Majesty does also straightly inhibite and forbid the said Patentee, his
Deputies and Assigns, and every of them, (notwithstanding her Majesty's grant
by the said Letters Patents) henceforth to make any Starch of Branne, during
this time of dearth, upon pain of imprisonment by any Justice of Peace, or
other public Officer of justice, and forfeiture to her Majesty's use of the
same Starch so made, either of Corn or Branne, or any other Grain, or
wittingly put to sale by the said Patentee, his said Deputies or Assigns, or
by any other person or persons whatsoever.

Given under our Signet. At our Manor of Greenwich, the last day of July, in
the xxxviii. year of our Reign.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of CHRISTOPHER BARKER, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty. 1596.
