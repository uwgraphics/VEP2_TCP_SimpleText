royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
WHereas, out of Our own observance in the late Reign of Our most dear and
Royal Father, We saw much disorder in and about his household, by reason of the
many idle persons, and other unnecessary attendants following the same; Which
evil, We, finding to bring much dishonor ot Our House, have resolved the
reformation thereof, and have under Our hand directed to Our Knight Marshall, a
List of the number of all such as sshall be allowed to follow Our said Haushold
in their several places and Trades, whereunto they are assigned, upon good
caution first taken for their good behavior, and performing such other
Articles as therein shall be contemed; Whose rooms and places be coming void,
Our pleasure is, shall be supplied by Our Knight Marshall for the time being:
We do therefore straightly charge and command, That all Tent-keepers,
Artificers, and Landresses, together with all such idle persons, and hangers on
Our House, (others then such, whose particular names are entered in the Roll by
Us signed, as allowed to follow Our House) shall within four and twenty hours
after this Our Proclamation, depart from Our Court, and not return thither
again, upon pain of imprisonment, and other corporal punishments, and
penalties to be inflicted for their contempts in this behalf: And We require,
and straightly charge Our Kningt Marshal, and all Officers, and Ministers under
him that he and they do take a daily and constant survey of offenders in this
kind, to the end that they may be condignely punished, and that they take care
that Our pleasure herein be from tune to time strictly observed, by restraining
all others (save such as are licensed and allowed, as aforesaid) to follow, or
have dependence upon Our House; And for such Tents as are allowed to follow Us,
We will that they be appointed and placed by the direction of Our Kinght
Marshall or his deputy, in such manner, as they may be no offense or annoyance
to Our Person, or Household.

And for such as do follow, not having any dependence at all, Our will and
pleasure is, That every such masterlesse man, shall forthwith depart the Court,
upon pain of whipping.

Also, that all Petitioners, having had their answer, do presently depart the
Court, upon pain of imprisonment.

And also, that all servants whatsoever, being put away for misdemeanors, be
presented to Our Marshall or his deputy, whereby they may be known, and this
upon pain of Our displeasure.

And that no Chamber-keeper, nor any of Our Footmen, or other Our servant or
servants, shall give entertainment to any person whatsoever, to follow or depend
upon him or them, but such as shall be allowed, according to Our late
Proclamation in that behalf published, for restraint of disorderly and
unnecessary resort to the Court. And the better also to suppress the disorders
and abuses happening in Our Court, by reason of Landry-women having daily
access into Our House, We do therefore straightly charge and command, that no
Landresse shall have recourse to any Officer, lodging within Our House, but
that the Offices and Chambers unto which they wash, do send their servants out
unto them with, and for their linen; and that all such Landresses as are
allowed to follow Our House, as well the Landresse to Our Body, as others, shall
follow themselves in person, and not supply their places by their servants and
maids, who living without government, are the cause and occasion of so great
disorder amongst them that follow Us: And to that end, We will and command Our
Porters at Our Gate, to see this Our pleasure to be duly observed and kept.

And lastly, We straightly require, charge and command Our Knight Marshall to
have an especial care for execution of this Our Royal will and commandment,
as he will give acount to Us thereof, and tender Our high displeasure, for
neglect of this service so acceptable unto Us.

Given at White Hall the six and twentieth day of May, in the first year of
Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.

Excellent Majesty. 1625.
