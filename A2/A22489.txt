A Proclamation declaring His Majesty's Royal pleasure touching the English
Soldiers late employed at Sea in His Service, and now discharged.
WHereas His Majesty has lately employed in His Service at Sea, several
Troops and Companies of English Soldiers, and has now upon their return paid
unto them their Wages, and entertainment due, and discharged them from His
Service, and furnished them with printed Passes, and money in their purses for
their necessary charges in their return to the places mentioned in their
Passes; Now to the end that no idle wandering, or dissolute persons, under
color of having been Soldiers, or of travailing home to their friends or
habitations, should slander that profession, and be burdensome or offensive
to His good Subjects: His Majesty has thought fit, and does hereby publish
and declare His Royal pleasure and proceedings in that behalf, and does
hereby charge, and strictly command, all the Soldiers so lately employed, and
now paid, and discharged as aforesaid, that according to their several Passes,
and the days thereby limited unto them, they use all convenient diligence, and
endeavor to return to their several places mentioned in their Passes, and
there bestow and employ themselves in their honest Vocations, until His
Majesty shall have some other occasion to use their Service. And His Majesty
does further charge and command all and singular Mayors, Sheriffs, Justices of
Peace, Constables, Headboroughs, and all other His Majesty's Officers,
Ministers, and loving Subjects, that if any of the said Soldiers, or any
other, under the name or pretense of having been a Soldier, shall at any time
hereafter be taken without a Pass, or having a Pass shall be taken begging,
or wandering contrary to the Law, or in any sort misbehauing, or misdemeaning
himself, that then, and in every such case upon notice thereof given or taken
in that behalf, they shall be corrected and punished according to the Law,
and according to the nature or quality of the offense; Whereof, every one whom
it does or may concern, in his several place, is hereby to take notice, and
duly to observe and perform His Majesty's Royal pleasure and command, in all
and every the premises, at his peril.

Given at Our Palace of White Hall, this fifteenth day of November, in the
fourth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton, and John Bill, Printers to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty.
