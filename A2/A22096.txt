By the King.
A Proclamation for the continuance of His Majesty's Farthing Tokens.
WHereas the Kings most Excellent Majesty for the suppressing of the manifold
abuses, in passing of Farthing Tokens, of Lead, Brass, Copper, and other
Metal, between Uintners, Tapsters, Chandlers, Bakers, and other the like
Tradesmen, and their Customers; did publish His Proclamation, bearing Date at
White Hall, the nineteenth day of May, in the eleventh year of His Majesty's
Reign, of Great Britain, France and Ireland, As a provident Remedy of the
said abuses; whereby his Majesty did prohibit the uttering of all Farthing
Tokens whatsoever, and was pleased to give full power, and authority, to John
Lord Harrington, his Executors, or Assigns, to make, or cause to be made, such
a Competent quantity of Farthing Tokens of Copper, as might be conveniently
used within his Realms of England, and Ireland, and Dominions of Wales,
according to His Highness Letters Patents under the Great Seal, for the sole
making and uttering thereof, as by the said Proclamation, and Letters Patents,
more at large it does appear. Now forasmuch as His Majesty is informed, that
upon the death of the said Lord Harrington, the elder, and more especially upon
the death of the late Lord Harrington his Son, by means of some false bruits
spread abroad, by lewd and evil disposed persons, some doubt is made of the
continuance of the force of the said Proclamation, and the use of the said
Farthing Tokens of Copper: insomuch that thereupon some not well disposed, do
either refuse to use them, or do continue to utter their own Tokens, of
Brass, Copper, and other Metal, or matter, contrary to the true intent of
His Majesty's said Grant, and Prohibition, and of the said Proclamation,
whereby the said abuses, and the licencious use of them does in some part still
continue; His Majesty therefore finding how acceptable the said Farthing Tokens,
made by the said Lord Harrington and his Assigns, have been to his Majesty's
Subjects, unto whose hands they have come, and especially about the City of
London, and most chiefly for the relief of the poor, indigent, and poorer
sort of people; Has thought fit by this His second Proclamation, to publish
his Royal pleasure, for the continuance of the force of the said Proclamation,
and the confirmation of His said Letters Patents to the Lady Anne Harrington
widow, late wife of John Lord Harrington, the Patentee deceased, and Executrix
of the last Will, and Testament of John Lord Harrington her Son likewise
deceased, and to her Assigns, and for the continuance of the said Farthing
Tokens of Copper accordingly.

And does therefore by these Presents, not only publish and declare his
Highness will and pleasure, That the said Farthing Tokens of Copper, shall
continue without any alteration of the Stamp or Print now used; And shall, and
may pass amongst his loving Subjects, according to the tenor of the said
former Proclamation; but also does straightly prohibit and forbid all, and
every person and persons whatsoever, as well to use or receive any Tokens
whatsoever (other then the Farthing Tokens made and uttered by the said Lord
Harrington the Patentee, or the said Lord Harrington his son, their or either
of their Assigns, or made, or to be made by the said Lady Anne Harrington her
Assignee or Assigns, and uttered, or to be uttered, as aforesaid) as also to
make, or counterfeit such Farthing Tokens of Copper, or the Engines or
Instruments, whereby they are to be made, according to the Tenor and true
meaning of his Majesty's said Letters Patents, and former Proclamation in that
behalf; Willing and commanding all his loving Subjects* to use their best
endeauours for the finding out and apprehending of the said offenders in the
Premises, who shall be well rewarded for the same, and the offenders receive
condign punishment.

Given at Our Manor of Greenewich, the one and twentieth day of June, in the
twelfth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland. God save
the King.

Majesty. Anno Dom. 1614.
