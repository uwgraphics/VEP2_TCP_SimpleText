(...) ble deed, as mendyng of high ways, or such like: Her Majesty enioyneth
and strayghtly charge the governors and companies of every such Church, to
employe such parcelles of the said sommes of money (as any wise may be spared,)
upon the spedy repair or reedification of any such monumentes so defaced or
spoiled, as agreeable to thoriginall, as the same conveniently may be.

And where the covetousness of certain persons is such, that as Patrones of
Churches, or owners of the personnages impropriated, or by some other color or
pretense, they do persuade with the person and paryshioners to take or throw
down the belles of Churches and Chapels, and the Lead of the same, converting
the same to their private gain, and to the spoil of the said places, and make
such like alteracions, as thereby they seek a sclaunderous desolation of the
places of prayer: Her Majesty (to whom in the right of the Crown by
thordinaunce of Almyghtye God, and by the laws of this Realm, the defense and
protection of the Church of this Realm belongs) does expressly forbydde
any manner of person, to take away any Belles or Lead of any Church or Chapel
now used, or that ought to be used with public and divine service, or
otherwise deface any such Church or Chapel, under pain of imprisonment
during her Majesty's pleasure, and such further fine for the contempt, as
shall be thought meet.

And her Majesty charge all Bishops and Ordinaries to enquire of all such
contemptes done from the beginning of her Majesty's reign, and to enjoin the
persons offendyng, to repair the same within a convenient time. And of their
doings in this behalf, to certify her Majesty's privy Counsel, or the
Counsayl in the Star chamber at Westminster, that order may be taken herein.

Yeuen at Windsor the.xix. of September, the second year of her Majesty's
reign.
God save the Queen.
