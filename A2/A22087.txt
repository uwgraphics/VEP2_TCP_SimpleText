By the King.
A Proclamation for the prices of Victuals within the Verge of the Court.
WHereas heretofore diverse Bakers, Brewers, Inholders, Butchers, and other
Victualers, through their greedy desire of unlawful gain, not contented with
reasonable profit in uttering and selling of Victual unto Our Subjects in the
Common wealth, And specially within the Verge of Our Court, where Our
Nobility, Servants and Train (daily attending upon Our person) are lodged and
placed by Our Harbengers, are unlawfully exacted upon with unreasonable and
extreme prices, by the said Victuallers, enhaunsing the same Victuals,
Horsemeat, Lodgings, and all other necessaries at a more dear price, then it
was sold for (to Our common Subjects) before Our coming, And for that of late
it appears unto Us by the Records of Our Compting house, that all the Kings
of this Realm, (Our progenitors) have always had a special care to
restrain the excess gaining by the aforesaid Victuallers and others within
the Verge of their Courts, And also for that it further appears unto Us, that
of late more extreme exaction is used by the foresaid Victuallers, and others
toward Our servants, Train and Suitors, attending Our Courts wheresoever We
make Our abode, then heretofore has been, Nothing respecting Our Prerogative,
nor the Laws of Our Realm, Therefore Our will and pleasure is, and We do
hereby straightly charge and command, that all persons do obey and keep all
such prices, as is and shall be priced, asseassed, and rated by the Clearke of
the Market of Our Household within the Verge of Our Court, as well within
Liberties as without; And the Jury before him, or his lawful Deputy, by
virtue of his Office sworn and charged from time to time, The same Rates and
prices not only to be certified by Our said Clearke of the Market, or his
Deputy into Our Counting house, But also fixed and set upon the Gates of Our
Court, and other places within the Verge, as well within Liberties as without;
And that no manner of the person or persons aforesaid, of what estate or degree
soever he or they be, do in any wise pay more for Corn, Victuals, Horsemeat,
Lodging or any other thing, then after the rate and form aforesaid, upon pain
of imprisonment, and to be Fined with further punishment that shall thereof
follow, The same pains and punishments, and every part thereof to be executed
upon al those persons, and every of them which do, or shall presume to ask or
demand, utter and sell any manner of thing, or things, contrary to the true
meaning of this Our Proclamation. And moreover We do straightly charge and
command, that no manner of person or persons, now using, or which hereafter shall
use, or of right ought to use to serve any City, Borough, town or other place
where Our repose and abode is, or shall be, or elsewhere within the Verge of Our
Courts, as well within Liberties as without, with any kind of Corn or
Victuals, or other necessaries, as well upon the Market day, as at any other
time, shall be any thing the more remiss or slack for making of provision for
the same, then they or any of them heretofore have bin, nor use any color of
craft to deceive the buyers thereof, Nor hide or lay aside their Corn,
victuals, Horsmeat, Lodgings or any other necessaries to diminish the Market,
whereby Our whole Train within any City, borough, town, and other inhabitants
of the same, and other Our Subjects thereunto resorting, should not be as well
ferned and as plenteously furnished in every behalf as it was before, or of
right ought to have been in defraude of this Our ordinance. And furthermore we
straightly charge and expressly Command all Our Officers of Greencloth, Our
Justices of peace, Our Clarke of the Market, his Deputy or Deputies, Majors,
Bayliffes, Sheriffs, Counstables, and all other Our faithful Officers and
every of them, of Cities, Burroughes, Towns, Hundreds, and other places within
the Verge of Our Court as well within liberties as without from time to time,
when, and as often as need shall require, upon Complaint by any party iuffly
made, diligently every of them within their authorities forthwith to endeavor
themselves to see tuff punishment, and due reformation of the premises against
such person or persons as shall offend herein, according to Justice and prices,
as aforesaid.

Given at Our Court of Whitehall the fifth day of November in the eleventh
year of our reign of England, France, and Ireland, And of Scotland the seven
and fortieth.
