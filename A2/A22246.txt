JAMES, By the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all and singular Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, Deanes, and their
Officials, Parsons, Vicars, Curats, and to all spiritual persons. And also to
all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Constables, Churchwardens
and Headboroughes: And to all Officers of Cities, Boroughes, and Towns
corporate: And to all other our Officers, Ministers, and Subjects whatsoever
they be, as well within Liberties, as without, to whom these presents shall
come, greeting:
WHEREAS we are credibly given to understand, by a Certificate under the
hands and Seals of our trusty and well-beloved Subjects, the Mayor, Aldermen,
and Sheriffs, of our Town of Kingston upon Hull, within our County of York,
That our poor distressed Subject William Chapman of the same Town, Master and
Marryner, has heretofore bin a man of good worth and ability and a very
skillful and sufficient person in his vocation, having had heretofore frequent
trading and Commerce in diverse places beyond the Seas, until such time as it
pleased God to visit him with sundry great losses from time to time, as namely
by the King of Poland in Danske, under whom he was forced to serve in a Ship
called the Angeleuer, in which Ship he was the same voyage taken by the King of
Sweueland, who despoyled him of all he had in the said ship. And afterward he
making in the said Ship a Fishing voyage to the Wardhouse for the good of the
Country, it so fortuned that the said Ship and goods to the value of Eleven
hundredth pounds, was taken by certain Denmarkes to his great hinderance and
almost utter undoing. Also he made another voyage for Amsterdam in the good
Ship called the Content, in which voyage be lost Seauenty pieces of Carsey to
the value of One hundred and Fourscore pounds more, by reason of all which
losses and hind rantes together with some ill Debtors (Amounting in the whole
loss to the value of Fifteen hundred pounds) our said poor, Subject is now
quite undone, who before these untimely losses lived in good credit and used
the trade of Merchandise, relieved the poor and set many men at work, and yet
he is not now able to help himself, nor to sustain his poor Wife and
Children, who live in great want and are like to continue the rest of their
days in great misery, unless some charitable course be forthwith taken for
the relief and comfort of our said poor Subject, whose poor and unhappy
estate we much pity, and have thought good (upon the humble request of all
our foresaid trusty and well-beloved Subjects, the Mayor, Aldermen and Sheriffs,
made unto Us on his behalf) to commend the same unto the charitable
consideration of all our loving and weldisposed Subjects within certain places
hereafter mentioned, not doubting but that all good Christians well weighing
the premises, will be ready and willing as feeling members one of another
misery, to extend their liberal contributions toward the relief and comfort
of their poor distressed Brother in this his great necessity.

KNOW ye therefore, That of Our especial Grace and Princely Compassion, We
have given and granted, and by these our Letters Patents, do give and grant
unto our said poor Subject William Chapman, and to his Deputy and Deputies,
the bearer or bearers hereof, full power, license, and Authority to ask,
gather, receive, and take to Alms and charitable benevolence of all our loving
Subjects whatsoever. Inhabiting within our Counties of Norfolk, Suffolk,
Essex, and Kent, with our Cities of Canterbury, Rochester and the Cinque
Ports, with our City of Norwich, And in all other Cities, Towns Corporate,
Privileged places, Parishes, Villages, and in all other places whatsoever
within our said Counties and not else where, for and toward the recovery of
his said losses, and the relief and maintenance of himself, and his poor
Wife, and Children.

WHEREFORE we will and Command you and every of you, that at such time and
times, as the said William Chapman, or his Deputy or Deputies, the bearer or
bearers hereof, shall come and repair to any your Churches, Chapels, or other
places, to ask and receive the gratuities and charitable benevolence of our
said Subjects, quietly to permit and suffer them so to do, without any manner
your lets or contradictions, And you the said Parsons, Vicars, and Curats, for
the better stirring up of a charitable devotion, deliberately to publish and
declare the Tenor of these our Letters Patents or the Copy of Brief thereof,
unto our said Subjects upon some Sabbath day, when as the same shall be
tendered unto you. Exhorting and persuading them to extend their liberal
contributions in so good and charitable a deed. And you the Churchwardens of
every Parish, where such Collection is to be made (as aforesaid) to collect and
gather the Alms and charitable benevolence of all our loving Subjects, as well
Strangers as others, and what shall be by you so gathered to deliver it to the
bearer or bearers of these our Letters Patents and to no other person. when as
thereunto you shall be required. And lastly, whereas we are informed of the great
abuse which is now crept in amongst these poor people, who sell their Lycences
unto some other person, whereby men's charity goes not the right way, but unto
such as deserve it least: That from henceforth our will and pleasure is, that
if it may appear unto you or any of you, that the said William Chapman, has
contracted any bargains, or made or shall make sale of these our Letters
Patents, whereby the benefit should pass from him to any other person, That
thereupon these our Letters Patents shall be void and of none effect. Any
Statute, Law, Ordinance, or Pronision, heretofore made to the contrary in any
wise notwithstanding.

IN witness whereof, We have caused these our Letters to be made Patents for
the space of One whole year next after the date hereof to endure.

Witness our self at Westminster, the Five and Twentieth day of January, in the
Eighteenth year of our Reign of England, France, and Ireland: And of Scotland
the Four and Fiftieth. 1620. Steward.
God save the King*
