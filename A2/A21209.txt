A new Yorkshyre Song, Entitled: York, York, for my money: Of all the Cities
that ever I see, For merry pastime and company, Except the City of London.
AS I came through the Northcountrey,
The f^shions of the world to see,
I sought for merry company,
to go to the City of London:
And when to the City of York I came,
I found good company in the same,
As Well ^isposed to every game,
as if it had been at London.
York, York f^r my money,
Of all the Cities that ever I see,
For merry pastime and company,
Except the City of London.
And in that City what saw I then?
Knightts, S^^ires, and Gentlemen,
A sh^o^ing went for Matches ten,
as if it had been at London.
And they shot for twenty pounds a Bow,
Besides great cheer they did bestow,
I never saw a gallanter show,
except I had been at London.
York, york, for my money, etc.
These Matches you shall understand,
The Earl of Essex took in hand,
Against the good Earl of Cumberlande,
as if it had been at London.
And agr^ede these matches all shall be,
For pastime and good company,
At the City of York full merrily,
as if it had been at London.
York, york, for my money, etc.
In York, there dwells an Alderman, which
^,
I never heard of any such,
in all the City of London.
His name is Maltbie, merry and wise,
At any pastime you can devise,
But in shooting all his pleasures lies,
the like was never in London.
York, york, for my money, etc.
This Maltbie, for the Cities sake,
To shoot (himself) did undertake,
At any good Match the Earls would make,
as well as they do at London.
And he brought to the field with him,
One Specke, an Archer proper and trim,
And Smith, that shoot about the pin,
as if it had been at London.
York, york, etc.
Then came from Cumberland Archers three,
Best Bowmen in the North country,
I will tell you their names what they be,
well known to the City of London.
Wamsley, many a man does know,
And Bolton, how he draws his Bow,
And Ratcliffes shooting long ago,
well known to the City of London.
York, york, etc.
And the Noble Earl of Essex came,
^o the fi^lde himself to see the same,
Which shall be had for ever in fame,
as soon as I come at London.
For, he showed himself so diligent there,
To make a Mark and keep it fair:
^t is worthy memory to declare,
through all the City of London.
York, York, etc.
And then was shooting out of cry,
^he skantling at a handful nie,
^^d yet the wind was very hie,
^s it is sometimes at London.
They clapped the Cloutes so on the rags,
There was such betting and such bragges:
And galloping up and down with Nagges,
as if it had been at London.
York, york, etc.
And never an Archer gave regard,
To half a Bow, nor half a yard,
I never see Matches go more hard:
about the City ^f London:
For, fairer play was never plaide,
Nor fairer lays was never laid,
And a week together, they keept this trade,
as if it had been at London.
York, york, etc.
The Mayor of York, with his company,
Were all in the fields, I warrant ye,
To see good rule kept orderly,
as if it had been at London.
Which was a dutiful sight to see,
The Mayor and Al^ermen there to be,
For the set^ing forth of Archerie,
as well as they do at London.
York, york, etc.
And there was neither fault nor fray,
Nor any disorder any way:
But every man did pitch and pay,
as if it had been at London:
As soon as every Match was done,
Every man was pa^^ that won,
And merrily up and ^^^ne did run,
as if it had been at London.
York, york, etc.
And never a man that went abroad,
But thought his (...) well bestowde:
And money laid o(...)eape and load,
as if it had been a^ ^ondon.
And Gentlemen there, so frank and free,
As a Mint at York again should be,
Like shooting did I never see,
except I had been at London.
York, york, etc.
At York, were Ambassadors three,
Of Russia, Lords of high degree,
This shooting they desirde to see:
as if it had been at London:
And one desirde to draw a Bow,
The force and strength thereof to know,
And for his delight he drew it so,
as seldom seen in London.
York, york, etc.
And they did marvel very much,
There could be any Archer such,
To shoot so far the Cloute to tutch,
which is no news to London:
And they might well consider than,
An English shaft will kill a man,
As has been proved where and when,
and Cronicled since in London. York, etc.
The Earl of Cumberlands Archers won,
Two Matches clear, ere all was done:
And I made have apace to run,
to carry these news to London.
And Wamsley did the vpshot win,
With both his shafts so near the pin,
You could scant have put three fingers in,
as if it had been at London. York, etc.
I pass not for my money it cost,
Though some I spent, and some I lost,
I wanted neither sod nor roast,
as if it had been at London.
For there was plenty of every thing,
Redd and fallowe Dear for a King,
I never saw so merry shooting,
since first I came from London.
York, york, etc.
God save the City of York therefore,
That has such noble friends in store,
And such good Aldermen send them more,
and the like good luck at London:
For, it is not little joy to see,
When Lords and Aldermen so agree,
With such according Communaltie,
God send us the like at London.
York, york, etc.
God save the good Earl of Cumberlande,
His praise in golden lines shall stand.
That maintains Archerie through the land,
as well as they do at London.
Whose noble mind so courteously,
Acquaintes himself with the Communaltie,
To the glory of his Nobility,
I will carry the praise to London.
York, york, etc.
And tell the good Earl of Essex thus,
As he is now young and prosperous,
To use such properties virtuous,
deserves great praise in London:
For, it is no little joy to see,
When noble Youths so gracious be,
To give their good wills to their Country,
as well as they do at London.
York, york, etc.
Farewell good City of York to thee,
Tell Alderman Maltbie this from me,
In print shall this good shooting be,
as soon as I come at London.
And many a Song will I bestow,
On all the Musicions that I know,
To sing the praises where they go,
of the City of York, in London.
York, york, etc.
andGod save our Queen, and keep our peace
That our good shooting may increase:
And praying to God, let us not cease,
as well at York, as at London.
That all our Country round about,
May have Archers good to hit the Clout,
Which England cannot be without,
no more then York and London.
York, york, etc.
God grant that (once) her Majesty,
Would come her City of York to see,
For the comfort great of that Country,
as well as she does to London.
Nothing shall be thought to dear,
To see her Highness Person there,
With such obedient love and fear,
as ever she had in London.
York, york, for my money,
Of all the Cities that ever I see,
For merry pastime and company,
Except the City of London.
From York, by W.E.
Imprinted at London by Richard Jones: dwelling near Holburne Bridge. 1584.
