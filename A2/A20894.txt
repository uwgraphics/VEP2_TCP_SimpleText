Eplicit /
Here begins the book of fayttes of arms and of Chyualrye / And the first
chapter is the prologue / in wh^iche xprystyne of pyse excuses her self to
have dar enterprise to speak of so hye matere as is contained in this said book
Capitulum primum
By cause that hardynes is so much necessary to entrepryse hye things /
which without that should never be enpryses That same is couenable to me at
this present work to put it forth without other thing / Seen the lytylhed of
my person / which I know not digne ne worthy to treat of so hye matere / ne
durst not only think what blame hardynes causes when she is folyssh / I
then nothing moeued by arrogau^ce in folyssh presu^pcion / but admonested of
very affeccion and good desire of noble men in thoffyce of arms am exorted
after mine other escriptures passed / like as he that has to forn beten down
many strong edyfices / is more ^ardy to charge him self defye or to beat down
a castle or for^^^esse when he feleth him self garnysshed of couenable stuff
thereto necessary / Then to entrepryse to speak in this present book of the
right honorable office of arms and of Chyualrye as well in things which thrto
ben conuenyent / as in droyces which thereto be appertenaunt / like as the
laws and diverse auctours declaren it / to the purpoos / I have assembled the
matters and gadred in diverse books for to produce mine e^^encio^ in this
present volume / But as it apperteyneth this matere to be more executed by fayt
of dylige^ce and wit than by subtyltees of words polisshed / and also
considered that they that been excersyng and expert in tharte of chyualrye be
not comunely clerkys ne instruct in science of langage / I entende not to
treat / but to the most plain and entendible langage that I shall mow / to
that end that the doctrine given by many auctors / which by the help of god
I purpose to declare in this present book / may be to all men clear and
entendible / And by cause that this is thing not accustomed and out of usage to
wymen / which comynly do not entremete but to spynne on the distaf and ocupie
them in things of household / I supplye humbly to the said right hie office
and noble state of chyualrye / that in contemplacion of their lady mynerue born
of the contre of greece / whom the au^cyents for her great connyng reputeden a
goddess the which fo^de like as old wrytyngis saye^ / and as I have other
times said / And also the poet boece recyteth in his book of clear and noble
wi^men / and semblably recyten many other / the art and manner to make harnoys
of iron and steel / which will not have netake it for none evil / if I a woman
charge my self to treat of so like a matere / but will ensewe the^seigneme^t
and techyng of seneke which says / retche the not what they say / so that
the words be good / And therefore and to purpos in manner poetyke / it plaiseth
me tadresse such a prayer to the foresaid lady / O mynerue goddess of arms
and of chyualrye / which by virtue of hye ente^deme^t / above all other wyme^
fo^dest and institutest emo^ge the other noble arts and sciences which of the
took their beginning thusage to forge of yro^ and steel / armours and harnois
propice and couenable to couure and targe the body of man against the strokes
of darts / noyous shot and speres in bataylle fayttes of arms / helmes /
sheldes / targes / and other harnoys defe^sable fro the first comen /
institutest and gave manner and order to are^ge batailles / and tassaille and
fight in manner / Adoured lady and hie goddess be thou not displeased that I
simple and lytyl woman like as nothing unto the gretenes of thy reno^mee in
cu^nyng / dare presently compryse to speak of so magnyfike an office as is
thoffice of arms / Of which first i^ the said renomed contree of greece thou
gave thusage / And in so much it may plaise the to be to me favorable / that
I may be somewhat consonau^t in the nacyo^ where thou was born which as then
was named the great greece / the contree beyo^de y^ alps or mo^taygnes / which
now is said puylle and calabre in ytalye where you were born / and I am as you
were / a woman ytalien

Here shows how wars and batailles emprised by Just quarelle / moened in
their right and droit / is thing of Justice and suffered of god Capitulo ijo^
Chaton the vayllau^t co^batau^t or fyghtar / by whose force and stre^gthe of
arms / the romans had many fair vyctoryes / and which never in bataill was
dysco^fyted says that it ought more to have proffyted to the common well the
writing of rules / techyngs and dyscyplyne of arms which he had composed and
made in a book / than in any thing that he ever had doo^ with his body / for
he says all that ever that a man may do / endures not but one age / But
that which is wreton endures to the common prouffit evermore / by which
Innumerable men may the more auaylle / so is it then by this reason proved /
that it is not a thing of lytyl prouffyt for to write and make books / But to
the end that this present whrke by some enuyous might be reproched saying that
it is but ydlenes and loss of time as to treat of things not lawful / first
it is to wit if wars and bataylles / chyualrye and faytes of arms of which
thing we hope to speak / it is or not / o thing just / for as in excersysing
of arms ben done many great euyllis / extorcyons / and grieves / like as
occisio^s rauayne by forces / to bre^ne by fire and infenyte harms may seem to
som^e that wars and bataylles should be acursed thing and not due / And
therefore to ansuere to this question / it is to wete / that it appiereth
manyfestly that wars e^prysed by just cause be permysed and suffered of god /
like as we have founden in ye holy scripture in many places / how our lord him
self ordained to captains of hosts that which they should do against their
enemies / like as it is wreton of one that was called Ih^us / to whom he said
that he should ordeyne him to bataylle against his enemies / and made an enbusshe
for the better to vaynquisshe them / And of other ynowe semblably is recyted /
And also the holy escripture says of god that he is fires and governor of
hoostis and bataylles / And war and bataill which is made by just quarrel
is none other thing but right execuco^n of justice / for to give the right /
there as it apperteyneth / and to this accords the law deuyne / and
se^blably the laws ordained of men for to repress the arrogaunts and
malefactors / and as touching the harms and euyllis that been done above the
right and droyt of war / like as other auctours sayen / that comes nothing
of the right of war but by euylnes of the people yt vsen it evil like as I
hope by the aid of god to touch here after where as it shall fall where as I
shall speak of things lymyted after the laws and droit canon in the excersyte
of arms

Here it deuyseth how it is not leefful but to kings and souerayn princes to
empryse war or bataylles of their si^guler auctorite / against any what
someuer they be / Cao^ iij
Now have we in this first chapter touched shortly how wars and batailles by
good right e^prysed is a thing just / then is it to be take heed sith they
be of right / it apperteyneth to every man to do just and rightful work / if
it be leeful to any person to empryse war for to keep his right then it
should seem by this reason that without to mesprise every man may so do it / But
for to declare the truth to / them that in this point might err / it is to
wit that without to make any doubt / after the determynaco^n of right and of
the laws / it apperteyneth to none to e^pryse war or bataylle for any manner
cause / but if it be to princes souerayn like as emperous kings / dukes / and
other lords terryens which ben merely pincypall heedes of Iuredictions
temporal ne to a baron what someuer he be ne to any other be he never so great
without lyce^ce / co^gie and volente of his souerayn lord and that this law
is of right / manyfeste reason shows it ynowh / for if it should be other wise
/ werof then should serve princes sovereign / which for none other thing were
establysshed but for to do right to euerych of their subgettis that should be
oppressid for any extorcio^ and for to deffe^de and keep them like as the good
sheppard exposes his life for his sheep and therefore owes the subgette to
resort to the lord as to his refuge / when any grief is done to him and the
good lord shall take his arms for him if it be need / that is to say he shall
help with his power to keep his good right / be it by way of Justice or by
execucyon of Arms

Here is devised what ben the mouemens wherrof first sourden wars and
bataylles Capitulo iiijo^
Then apperteyneth it only unto souerayn princes te^treprise wars and
bataylles / now is it for be taken head for what causes after the law ought to
be e^prised or mayntened wars and in this well aduysed / me seems that
comynly five pryncypal moeuyngis there be upon which they be founded of whom
the three ben of the law and droyt and the other of will / The first of the
law wherefore ought to be enprysed or mayntened war is for to sustain right
and justice Te second for to withstoude the evil that would defowle grieve /
and oppress the land the contree and the people / and the third for to
recoure / lands / seignoryes / or other things / by other taken and usurped
by unjust cause / which to the prince or to the iurisdico^n of the co^tree or
of the subgettes ought to apperteyne Item of the two of will / that one is for
cause of ve^gea^ce for som^e grief received of other / that other for to
conquer and get lands and estrau^ge seignouries / But for more particulerly
to declare / first and by especyal the first of the three which is of justice /
it ought to be known / that there ben three pryncypal causes by the which it is
leefful to a king or a prince to entrepryse or sustain arms / war / or
bataylles The first is for to bear and sustain the church and his patrimony
against all men that would defoule it / as all christian princes ben holden / The
second for his vassale / if he be required in caas that he have just quarrel
/ and that the said prince have to fore dewly endeuoyrd him to make accord
between ye parties / in the which thing thaduersarye be found not treatable /
and the third is that the prince may justly if it please him to aid and help
every prince baron or other his alye or friend / or any contre or land if he
be required / in caas that the quarrel be just / and in this point be
comprised wi^men wydowes / orphans / and all them that may have necessite / of
what part that they be wronged of any others power / for this cause and
se^blably for the other tweyne a fore said moeuyngs that is to wite that one to
withstonde the evil And that other for to recouure his propre things lost /
is not only leefful to a prince to moeue war or to maintene it / but it is
to him pure debt to make it by oblygaco^n of title of seignourie and
iuredico^n / if he will use it after rightful duete / but as touching the other
ij points / that is to wit that ne for vengeance of som^e grief received by
power and might of another / and that other for to get strange lands without
to have any title / what someuer the conquerours / alexandre the romans and
other be much preysed in the tytles of chyualrye / and semblably they that
greatly be vengid on their enemies be it well or evil / and what comynly therin^
is done I find not in law deuyne ne other scripture / that for these two
causes without other moeuyng / is lawful to empryse upon christian men war or
bataylle / but well the contrary for by the law of god / it apperteyneth not
to a man only to take ne usurp nothing of others / nor in no wise to coueite
it and semblably ben reserved to god the vengeances / and nothing apperteyne to
man to do them / but for more plainly to declare upon this part / and ansuere
to the questions that may be moeued Truth it is / that it is leeful to a
prince to keep to him self the same right / that he should do to another and
for as much as a just prince shall do / felyng him self wrongyd by an others
might and power / ought he then for to obey to gods law to deporte and
forbere without doing more thereto forso^^ nay / for that deffendeth justice /
but the faytte requires of (...) trespaas pugnyco^n and for that work justly
he shall hold this way / he shall assemble great counseyl of wysemen in his
parliament / or in the counseil of his souerayn if he be subget^e and ^e shall
not only assemble them of his contree to the end that out be put all suspeco^n
of favor / but also of strange contrees that may be known not adherent to
neither party as well auncye^t / nobles / as iuristes and other prsent them
self shall purpose or do be purposed all the troth and without any favor for
god may not be deceived all such right and such wrong that he may have / and
in concludyng shall say yt of all he will report him and hold to the
determynaco^n of right shortly for to say by this manner / this thing put in
right well seen and discuted so and by such way that it appear by true
judgment that he has just cause / Then he shall do som^one his aduersarye
for to have of him restytuco^n and ame^des ofthyniures and wrongs by him
received / Then if it happene / that ye said aduersarye deliver deffences and
will gaynsaye it / that he be entierly herd without favor to him self in any
wise ne propre will ne heinous courage / These things and that which
apperteyneth duly made / in caas that the said adversary be found refusyng
to come to right and law / the prince may Justly and surely entrepryse war
/ the which ought not be called ve^geaunce / but pure execucion of rightful
Justice /

Here ben devised the consideracions and regardes that the king or prince
ought to have in the fayte to entrepryse war and the manners that he ought to
hold / to fore he conclude the said war / Capitulo quinto
Sith it is so that it is leefful to a prince tentrepryse war and bataylles
/ and them mayntene for the causes above said / And how be it that these
things be great and poysaunt / as they that touch pryncypally the life / the
blood / thonnour / and chyuau^ce of infenyte persons / without which regard
all before the work / ought not to be emprysed / ne for light moeuynges ne
young wills but that it ought to be redoubted tempryse new wars / but for to
modere him self we have ensamples ynowe / O remember / that the puissaunce of
auffryke / ne thorguillous cite of cartage which was chief and heed / and the
spaynards / ne the right puissau^t king anthyochus lord of a great part of the
orient / which brought so much people to bataylle that it was infenite with
their dredeful olyphau^tes / ne also the right mighty prince king metridates
which lorded upon.xxiiij. contrees / and also all the world / but yt the right
lytil puissau^ce of romans might well subdue them / and therefore ought no
prince lightly to put him self in peril which is for to be determined by the
destribuco^n of fortune / of which noman may know to what side it shall turn
/ Then it is necessary that the prince be wise / or at the lest will use
the cou^seyl of wise men for plato says that the royame or contre is blyssed
and well happy where the wise men gouuerne / and the thopposite or contrayre it
is acursyd and unhappy like as witnesses the holy scripture And without faylle
there is nothing so much necessary to be conveyed by wisdom / as is war and
bataille like as it shall be said her after / for there is no fault made in any
caas less repayrable / than that which is executed by arms and by evil
gouernyng of bataille what shall then do the wise prince to whom shall be of
necessite for som^e of the caas aforesaid tempryse war or bataylle / first to
fore all thing ^e must be hold and take heed what puissau^ce or power he has
or may have as much people / as of synau^ce and money / without the which the
two pryncypal things to be well garnysshid and surely it is folly tentrepryse
any war / for above all things they ben necessary / and in especial money
/ for who that has money ynowh / and will enploye it / he shall alleway find
aid and help of men ynowh / and more than he would: witness of the wars of
ytalic: and in especyal of florence: of venyse: and other places y^ which
comynly fight more with their money than they of the contree: And therefore
without pain: and uneath may they be vaynquysshed: And it should more auay^le
and be much better to a prince: if he feel him not well garnysshed of tresour
or of rich subgettes full of good will to aid him: to make sum trayttye
with his enemies: if he feel him self assaylled: Or for to deporte and forbere
tempryse war: Rather than to begin if to mayntene it he has not whereof:
For be he all certain: that if he entrepryseth in hope to take more of his
subgettis than they may bear and against their will / it shall encreace the
nombre of his enemies / so should it be to him lytil prouffyt for to destroy
the strange and far enemies / for to get pryuee and nygh enemies / for it is
to wite that ye prince capitayn ought not despise no puyssau^ce of enemies
though it seem to him but lytil for he may not know what fortune ye other shall
have for him self / as it is wreton how yt there was a shepherd named vriacus /
to whom fortune was so propice / that she held him in puissau^ce with great
foyson of thieves and pillyardes which he had assembled for to make war to
rome / which was so mighty by the space of / xxiiij / year / that he did
much grief to them / And often times vaynquyssed in bataille / and the romans
might never destroy him / but fynysshed his life by one of his owen men which
slew him / and therefore to the end that he be not deceived he shall assemble to
couns^il the four estates of his contree which ought to be called or he
emprise so chargeable a thing / yt is to wite thau^cyen nobles expert in arms
which know what the fayt of war mounteth / Item the clerks legystes / by
cause that i^ the laws ben declared all the caasis of whom ought to sourde
just war as many ensamples we have to this purpoos / Item the bourgeises by
cause it is of necessite and by cause they part in the myse and tresour which
thereto by houeth as said is / and that they take heed to the fortificaco^n of
towns cytees and enduyce the mean people to aid their lord / Item som^e of
the men of Craft for more to honor the said people / And that they be the
more inclined and the better willed to aid their lord with their goods / of
which thing they ought all to be swetely prayed / O how is that a proffitable
thing in seygnourye / Royame / or Cite to have true subgettis / and of great
love / For they faylle not in bodies ne in goods / like as it appiered many
times in rome / when ye tresours of ye cite despe^ded in great wars in so
much that they had no thing / Then the ladies them self of their propre
moco^n brought their Iewellis and rich adournemens / and with their good will
brought and delyuerd them for to socoure to the necessite of the town and cite
/ the which afterward were gretely restored again as good reason was / And for
to hold this way / well gaaf ensample the good wise king charles the fyfthe of
that name / fader of this that presently regneth the which anon after he had
be crowned / what did he as in the age of xxv / year / as he beheld that the
englissh men held evil the couenau^tes made of the treatye of the peace /
which he had by necessite and diverse fortune acoorded to them how well it
was to him right do^mageable / and that not with^stondyng that it was agreed to
them to hold great part of the duchye of guyenne and many other lands and
seignouries in other places in the royaulme of france but that suffysed them
not / but marched defowled and grieved by their pride and ouerwenyng the other
contrees neighbors which apperteyned nothing to them / sent the said king
by advise his ambassiadours auctorised to the duc of lancastre sone of king
edward of england and to his people which had done the said oultrage / that
thereof he would cesse / and make ame^des of the grieves and do^maiges made sith
the said peace of which thing such was theffecte / how well the ansuere was
curtoys ynowh / the said ambassiadours were slain in that journey or way /
wherefore ye good wise king seen that by constraynt had accorded the
dishonorable peace the which englyssh men evil held / and for many other
reasons which should be over long a thing to recounte / assembled at paris at
his parliament the forsaid four estates / and with them all the wise iurystes
strangers / as well of boloyne the craas / as of other places such as he might
have / and to them purposed his reasons against thenglyssh men demaundyng their
aduys / if he had cause to bygynne war / for without just cause / the
regard and deliberaco^n emonge them / and the consent and will of his good
subgettes in no wise he would do it / at which counseyl by long deliberaco^n
was concluded that he had good and just cause to begin again the war and
thus the good wise king entreprysed it / in which thing god has be so much
favorable to his good right loved be he / with the great prudence of him /
that all the lands lost he gath since reco^querd with ye sword / like as yet
it appiereth

Here is devised how it is not expedyent that a king or souerain prince goo in
bataylle for the peryllis of aduersayre fortune Capttulo vjo^
Then by the way aforsaid ye wise king or prince shall determyne to work in
the fayte to entrepryse wars and bataylles / And for as much as it is a
thing notayre / that in such a fayt to bygynne / mayntene / and continue
four pryncypall things / That is to wite an heed or chief / hardynesse /
Strength / and constaunce / without the which all should goo to confusion /
ye if that only one of them faylled / now it is to see if it be good that the
king or souuerayn prince in his propre person goo to his war / And be in
the bataylle / For as the faytte ought to touch him more than / any other / By
which his presence might represente the foresaid four things / And with this
that it is no doubt yt his knights and men of arms and all thoost should have
the better heart to fight / seeing their lord in ye place / ready to live and
deye with them / without faille for to a^suere to this q^stion not
Wih^thstondyng all that any may say of the well and good that might ensiewe /
and that many ensamples should be fou^den of kings and princes / to whom it is
well taken to be present in their bataylles / lyk as the king alexander in his
conquestes / and also many kings of france / as the king clodoneus /
charlemayne and ynowe of other / and also charles which presently regneth
being a child in the age of: xiiij: year newly crowned was in the batayl of
rosebek / against the flemyngis / where he had noble victory / it is not to be
delibered ne lightly to be concluded / that the king ne souerayn prince goo in
his propre person / and better is it teschewe it ^ than to goo thither /
alleway reserved some cas that is to wite against his own propre naturel
subgettes / in caas that they be rebel to him / the cause is for as much as
naturally the subget fereth to offe^de the mageste of his souerayn lord in
especyal in his presence / whom they may not deny ^ what someuer paruerse
will they have / that they should lose hertes and me^bres like as they were
vaynquisshed / they seeing against him: whom they ought to aid / and also to
be with him against all men / and in especyal the confusion is great against
them / And the right is great for the prince ^ when he is to them good and not
cruel ne tyrant / But not for what someuer necessite that he see / he ought
well to take heed ^ that he be set so surely in the bataylle / that the peril
of evil fortune may not fall upon his person / But the reason general
wherefore it is not good commynly that he goo to bataill is by cause that none
may know to what party god shall give the eure of the victory / wherefore if
the fortune came against the prince being there in person / by which he take
death be take or flee / that should not be perdycyon and deshonour only to his
said person: but to them of his blood: and generally to all his subgettis
land and contrees perdico^n and infenyte inconuenyent / like as ynowh^ may be
known by thexperience of caas semblable in this royame / and ellis where late
happened / And therefore it is not to be chosen that for the regard of som^e
particular vtilite is put in adventure and peril that / of which may come
infenyte harms and inconuenye^tes and therefore a prince ought not be byleued
that therein should be over wylly and courageous / but he ought to be put fro it
/ and the causes and reasons to him assigned with examples which ought to
refrain him / Considering the right great peril / not only of his person as
said is but of all his subgettis and royaulme / And to this purpoos verily may
well serve for example / the wit and good governance of the forsaid wise
king Charles the which he not mouyng fro his trone ryal in palace / conquered
again all the lands lost by his predecessors right cheualerous / like as the
truth is manyfested / and that it be true to this purpoos / that wit and
diligence be more expedyent in faytte of war than in the presence of the
prince / semblably it appiereth by the first duc of mylane fader of this that
now is: the which not partyng fro his palace: conquered by his wysedom as many
lands and seignouries in lombardie and in the marches: that to the seygnourye
of a Cite he attrybued and gate so many other that he made it a right great and
notable duchy

Here is devised what conestable ought to be chosen for to be maistre of the
chyualrye of the king or prince: and the condycions that he ought to have
Capo^ vijo^
NOw we have how the king or souerayn prince for the well and surete of the
common well ought not lightly delybere ne conclude in him self to goo in to
bataylle / The^ ne is it to be aduysed to what persons ^ for to one only
suffyseth not to be co^mysed the fayttes of so great offices / as maystres and
conduytours of his chyualrye / that for him and in his name excercyseth the
fayt of his wars / of which thing without faylle by right to take heed is
none other of more great regard / than to make thelection of them ^ for of so
much as thexcercyte of their office passes in poys and peril all other / of
so much it apperteyneth and byhoueth the more couenable persons / and by
especyal ought by great advise to have regard and delyberacio^ to chese him to
whom is comysed ye princypal charge above all other / The which office the
auncye^s called duc of bataylles or souerayn maistre of the chyualrye / whom
we call now in france Conestable And after in following thusage of france the
two marchallis under y^ which pryncypall offices / ben after set diverse and
many captains of certain nombre and quantyte of men of arms / In thelection
in specyal of the souerayn maystre of the chyualrye of the prince / ought to be
aduysed ^ that he be a person right notable / especyally in all that which
behooves in things that require arms / That is to wite / that by long
experye^ce he be so used / that it be to him as a naturel craft or mestier /
and that the contynuel excersite has rendrid h^ym a master of all that which
byhoueth / as he which by many times h^ath be founden in diuerses adventures
happened in fayttes of war by diverse contrees and naco^ns / For vegece says
that length of aage / ne great nombre of years give not only art and manner
of fyghtyng / but thusage / So that he be not to learn the ordres and manners /
which ought to be holden / in treatyng of men of War and of Arms / be it in
time of rest / or in trauayll of War / And that he can mayntene / led /
conduyte / And put in arraye so and in manner as it apperteyneth for the best
/ And it is to wit that in the said election ought to be more regard to the
perfection of the said things / with the other manners and condico^ns / which
apperteyne to him / Than to the gretenes of his lignage and hye blood of his
person / and all that he may assemble to be shall be much expedyent / by cause
that of somoche as he shall be more noble of blood / so much the more shall he
be the more dradde and hold in reverence / in h^is said office / the which
thing is necessary to every captayn / for to this purpoos recounteth valere /
that the auncyents / which made the great conquestes / for to be the more
doubted in their oostes / faygned them to be so great and so hye in lignage /
that they said them self parents and kynne to the gods / But nevertheless it
suffyseth not this only couenablete / without the other propretees therefore
the regard of the eliseurs or chesars ought more to pourueye to the well of
thoffyce / then to the person For it should be a thing much to be reprened to
chese one of hye blood being ygnorau^t / and to set him in thoffyce / in
which subtylte / wysedom / and long usage has often more great need / than the
quantite of people or any other strength / For Cathon says that of all other
things the faults may be amended / sauf such that be done in bataylles / of
the which the pain ensieweth anon the fault / For evil perisshe they that
can not well deffende / and to fugityues uneath or with great pain comes
again the heart to fight / There fore also with the other forsaid things it is
necessary that he be wise / of good naturel wit / as he to whom has be
co^mysed the knowelege of many things / and that is as chyef of Justice and
lieutenaunt of the prince for to do right to euerich^ of causes that may
happen in caas of arms and feattes of cheualrye / of all them that be under
him and also of strangers which often happen in dyuerce manners / And it is to
wete that after the right of gentilnes and hye noblesse of courage apperteyneth
to a good captain which uses thexcersyte of arms / in all caases that may
to him happene of all that gentylnes requires if he will get honor that is to
wit that also to his enemies he be ryghtful and verytable in feat and in
Judgment where it shall fall And with this that he honor the good and the
valyau^t in like wise as he would be of them honored / And this manner held
the valyau^t king pirrus of Macedone whereof he gate great loos / which by
cause he had found so many valyau^ces in the romans / how well they were his
great enemies ^e honored them right gretely / when an ambassade came to him And
also them whom he slew in bataylle / he did do bu^^^ them honorably / And
of the noblesse of this king and of his great frau^chyse it is yet wreton /
that he had in so great (...) the prysonners which he had taken in his
batayl^es (...) would not keep ne reteyne them as pryso^ners / but rend^^d (...)
deliuerd them all quyte / The manners and condico^ns (...) belongen to a good
conestable ben these that he be not (...) hastyf / hoot / fell / ne angry / But
amesured and at^empo^a^ rightful in justice / benygne in conuersaco^n of hye
mayn^^^^ and of lytyl words / Sad in cou^tenau^ce no great dys^ur of truffes
/ verytable in word and promise hardy: sure (...) dyligent: not coueytous /
fires to his enemies pyetous to them that be vainquissed / and to them that be
under him he be not lightly angry / ne be not moeued for lytyl occasion ne
believe over hastily for lityl apprence / Ne give faith to words which have ne
color of truth ^ ne that he be not curyous of mygnotes / Iolyetes / ne of
iewellis ^ but be he habylled and arrayed / rychely in harnoys and mou^tures /
and contiene him fiersly / Ne be he not slouthful / sluggyssh / ne slepy / ne
curyous in metes and festes in life delycate / and in serchyng alleway thestate
and couuyne of his aduersaires / and be he subtyl / pourueyed and wyly to
deffende him fro them / and wisely to assaille them / well aduysed upon their
espies and watches. and that he know to gouuerne his owen people and hold in
order and dread / and to do right where he ought to do it / And that he be
not over curyous to play in no games / to honor the good and them that be
worthy / and nyghe to him / and well to reward them that deserve it / And that
he be large and lyberal in caas that it be requysyte / and that his common
speech be of arms: of fayttes: of chyualrye and of the valyau^ces of good men.
And that he keep him well from avauntyng / and be he loving his prince and true
to him / favorable to wedowes / to orphans / and to the pour / ne make great
count of a lityl trespace done to his person / And small debate to pardone
lightly to him that repents / and above all other thing to love god and the
church and to sustene and help right / These said condyco^ns bylongen to a
good conestable / And by consequent to the marchallis / and to all them of
semblable offices /

Here allege to purpoos of excercyte of arms som^e auctours which hereof have
spoken / and the manners which helden the valiau^t au^cyens conquerours in
arms / Capio^ viijo^
AFter that we have devised what officers ought to be chosen or at least them
that have condyco^ns next and most like to them a forsaid / which shall be
co^mysed capytayns and conduytours of the chyualrye of the prince or king / it
bihoueth us to say in what works and things their excersyte shall extend /
And by cause that dyuerce auct^urs learn me to speak which have wreton / I
shall produce in to wytnes their sayengis / And pryncypally vegece which in the
time of valentyne the emperor notably / made a propre book of the dysciplyne and
art which the right conquerours helden / which brought to end by wysedom
and virtue of arms / things / which now in this present time should some as
Impossible And this thing well affermeth by his word / the said king pyrrus /
when he had assayed and proved the valyau^ce of the romans / Of whom a lytyl
qua^tyte wythstood against his oost / which was so great that they couerde
then montaynes and valeyes / Then the said king pirrus said / if I had
such knights / I should conquer all the world / And by this it is to suppose
/ that great wit trauayll / and propre industrye achieuen so hye empryses as
to conquer the world / like as did the romans and other co^querours / of
whom the manners / and ordres that they helden many wise men registered them /
the which things for e^ample to be conformed to them if they seem good ben
for to be herd propyce and expedyent / For the said vegece says who that
will have peace / let him learn to fight / and who loves victory owght to
know the feat of arms / and the knight that desires good adventure / let
him fight by art or craft / that is to wit by wysedom / and not at all
adventure ^ none dare grieve ne anger him ye supposes shall surmou^^e (...)
overcome if he be assaylled / So is it by the great conquestes / that the
auncyens did sum time / that the people be not now so valiant / as they were
woned to be / And of this whom it is a long / or causes the fornamed vegece
rendrith the reason that says ^ that the long peace rendryth the men / which
herto fore by long and contynuel trauayllis were woned to excersice the feat
of arms set nothing by that occupacyon / But now ben put in delight / rest
and to couetyse of money / which the noble auncyens preysed nothing but honor
of arms / ne set naught there by / And thus is chyualrye set in neclygence
/ and as it were forgoten and not raught of / And he said / the romans in like
wise which had gotten many lands and conquerde / left on a time thexcercyte
of arms / which by their discontynuaunce they were by hanybal prince of
auffryke desconfyted in the second bataille / where as they lost all their
seignourye tofore canes in puylle / which was so horrible / that almost all
they of rome were deed / And their chieuetains taken and destroyed and also the
noble chyualrye in so great quantite that after the desconfiture / hanybal
which did do search the field had three mues / or busshe lis / all full of
rings of gold fro their fyngres like as thistorye says / the which he did
do bear in to his contre in sign and Joy of that vyctorye / But aftre whenne
the said excersice of werre was of the noble auncyents taken up again they
always had victory / Therefore concludes the said auctour to the loving and
praising of the contynuall excersyce of arms that more profitable is to a king
or prince to see his men used and well taught in the said art and fait of arms
how few or lytyl qua^tite of people that he has / than to take and reteyne
under him great foison of strange souldeours that he knows not / and nothing
so ferme ne stable says he ne that more is to be commended than is a contree
where foyson of good men of arms be well learned and taught in all that longs
to the fayt of werre / for nethre gold ne silver nor precious stones
vaynquysshe nor overcome not the enemies nor make not thenhabytans to live in
peace as does and may do the might of worthy chyualrye well taught / And of
such folk ought not to be Iuged aftre the folysshe sentence of the king
Bynytus of gallya or france / which aftre he had enuaysshed the romans with
/ Ciiij / soore thousand men armed / and saw hem come against him with so lytyl
a quantyte / despised them and said that they were not men enough for to
satisfye thappetit of the dogs of his oost / But not withstandyng was there
men enough for to dystresse both him and his great oost / as is happed soon
after like as thystory recounteth / And this for to conferme after the sayng of
the said Auctour / we shall first speak of the doctrine and lore that
thauncyent nobles yaue unto their children in time of their youth / And then
shall we return to the matiere of the said chieftain or chieftains of the
chyualrye / The said vegece to purpos says in the first chapter of his first
book / We by noon othre means nor manner can perceive ne see / the cite of
rome to have subdued unto her the countrees of the world / but by use of arms
and by techynges of ostes of knyghthode / For all enough may be presumed / that
so small a quantyte of folk as the romans were at the first should do lytyl
harm to the great multitude of frenshme^ The wit of the grekis as Titus
liuius says did resist against themalyce and strength of them of affrique And
by this we conclude as it is before said that bettre is a small quantite of
folk used and well taught in fayt of arms by co^tynuel excersice of all that
thereof may fall in the doubtouse hap of bataill / than is a great ml^tytude
of rude folk naught knowing / for as he says ^ the manner of connyng to know
that / that in werres and bataylles b^longeth grows norissheth and gives
hardynes to fight / as it is so that noon doubts to do that in which he
feleth himself learned expert and taught / And al sciences and crafts are
known and learned by contynua^s of usage / Thus if it be truth says vegece
that this be in small thingis ^ bettre it behooves to keep the same in things
that been right great / O what is it of men used and made to the werre and that
be subtyl in thexcersice of arms / with pain can they be overcome by no
manner of strange adventure that never was seen before / As it appiered that
time the romans found the craft and the manner for to sle the multitude of
Elephantes that been so great and ferfull bestis wat both men and horses of
their sight were affrayed / that the cartagiens and they of parthe had brought
against them / And the wise romans made engyns by the which they lanchid and
cast unto them sharp bars of brennyng iron / and thus distroyed them / And
therefore says thauctour that of al arts or crafts in a land more to be
commended / is the art of fighting in excersice of werre For by that is the
fredom of the land place or country surely kept / and the dignite of the
province is there by encreaced / and the ancient worthy men / as it is said
soueraynly kept the same / first the greeks and they of lacemodone right
valiant and strong werryours / And then this art to learn and vndrestande
above al other thing were the romans curyous and feign / and the fame and
honor that ensued them for the same / appiereth and is well known

Here deuyseth and shows the manner that the noble ancient worthy men kept
to thyntroduction and lernyng of their children in the doctrine of faites of
arms Capio^ ixo^
The ancient noble men then that by haultnes of courage desired al ways that
thexcersise of arms should be continued / to the end the common well of their
lordshipes and cytees should be the bettre amended and deffended made not
their children to be norisshed in the kyngis and princes courts for to learn
pride / lechery nor to were wa^ton clothing But did so by cause in time to
come of their flowryng aage might serve the prince and the country in that
office that apparteyneth to noble men / and had of a custume when their
children were com to / xiiij / year of aage they made hem to be taught in all
such thing that longueth to knyghthed and in faites of werre / And is to wite
that there were in certain places propre sooles where they were induced / And
taught to were harneys and handlyng of staves and deffensyng and the fayt and
the ways of the same / And therefore will vegece say there as he speaks to this
purpoos in his fourth chapitre of his first book that the noble men ought to
pain hem self to draw their children in their first youth to the love of
fayttes of arms / for ye young child is able to conceyne and keep in mind that
/ that men show to him / and naturelly children are glad and wyllyng to tyse
hem self to such thingis as men see / that they wrestle lepen and play one
with other moeuing their bodies / So ought then to be showed unto them the
tournez of swiftnes to cast and fight with both their arms / and the
manner how they shall glau^che or with drathe themself from ye strokes that in
trauers or sydlyng may come / to lepen oner trenchis or dyches / to lanche or
cast sperys and darts and the way to couere and save hem self with their
sheldes / and to do al other semblable thyngis / And unto them they showed
also how in castyng of sperys or darts they should set their lift foete a
fore / by cause in launching shaking or casting that wiche they hold and would
cast out of hand the body should be more steadfast on the ground and the might
in casting gretter / but as to come hand to hand for to repulse or shoue forth
with sperys they taught hem to set the right foot before / by cause that the
stre^gthe of shouing is at the lift side of men And for to teache hem bettre in
all things to fight and to sawte / they were oftymes put in arraye of
batailles by their maistres / by cause they should know by very use the
conduyte and the order that ought to be kept in a bataille / And all renged in
fair ordonaunce made hem to march forwardis a quantite of paaces for to teache
hem to keep hem self clos togidre in good ordenaunce without gooyng out or from
the rowte of their bataille / And with light stauis at the first by cause they
schuld not hurt each othre / made one party to sawte that othre / And to
the end that no rancour ne anger might not be norryshed among hem / they that
had the victory were at another time put for to fight with them that they
so had ouercom / against othre After this they were put in certain places to
keep them that one place against that other / And as their bodyly strength
grew more and more / they made hem for to take axes and swerdis and almaner of
other wepens of werre and assayed and forced them self to smite against certain
stakes that for the nones were dressed and there made great appertyses of arms
/ as hit had be against their enemy mortal / and all this was / by cause they
should bear trauailles and be used in ablyng of them self And so assawted the
stake al a bout glanching and tournyng here and there / and in this manner of
asawte took in hem self strength and breath and the manner of fyghtyng and
sawtyng they learned / And as their strength and age grew / so was given to
them greter charge and more poysaunt / and namely bygger armures and more heavy
stauys than thoo that are used in a feld or bataille / by cause that common
stauis should seem to them easy and light at a need / They learned them also to
stryke with a foyne which manner of foynyng was first brought in use by the
romans / for they scorned them that smote edgelyng / and said with pain might
one slay another aftre that guyse / by cause the bones that be hard with
holds and keeps the stroke / But of a foyne is the wound dedely if the head
or the body enter the depnes of two yuches / And for this reason also is the
strok of a foyne bettre and surer by cause he that smyteth edgelyng / in heuyng
up of both his arms shows him self naked and bare and discovered a long his
right side / and this does not he that smyteth with a foyne / but keeps him
self clos as he strikes / and may hurt his enemy / er that other heue up his
arms for to smite edgelyng / And with all this they excited and taught hem for
to bear some heavy fardelis all armed as they were for to be the redyer to
suffer trauaillis and pain / and to the end if need were / they might bear with
them their own vitaillis / And for this lesson to conferme ^ to this purpos
says vegece / that nothing is grievous which of before is learned by long use /
nor so heavy a fardell but that by custom of beryng shall seem easy and light /
And virgille in like wise confermeth the same use / there as he says that the
valiant romans bare of times with them their necessaryes with the fardel of
their armures / And beside al this were there horses made of tymbre upon which
they learned to lepe up of both the sydis all armed from head to tooe and the
spear in their hand / to clemme up with cords to the wallis lightly / to make
ladders hem self and ropes knotted for to clemme up ward there with all

Yet of the same Capio^ xo^
In all the forsaid vsages and in othre moo the nobles au^cye^t introducted and
taught their children so that by long contynna^ce / with the good doctrine of
such honorable wordis as they did put in to their corages / that when the
very fait of a bataylle came. they were not to seek in no manner of point /
but as al learned and right wise made great appertyses and faitis of arms /
Such doctrine was necessary in the time of the great conquestis / and yet
expedye^t and good hit were in france and in all other lands where as
som^tyme of need harnoys and armures ben taken Saluste to this purpos says /
The knight or men of arms is to be chosen that from the time of his youth
has learned the trauayllis of arms and the manners of bataille / And that by
usage can the wyes of knyghthede / And bettre it is says he / to a young noble
man to escuse him self of that he has not yet learned / than to make sorrow and
mourn in his old age of that he conde never nothing / wherefore thauncyent
praised so little the noble men that could nothing / that they put no
dyfference between them and the landishmen / But much they set by the noble
men that were wortly and valiant / as it is known by vegece that thus says
to the lawdyng and p^aysyng of them / O men of great and laudable merueilles /
that this noble art and doctrine of knyghthede / have so longue excersyced /
that of very kind hit abides still with you / Ye ought to be hyghly
enhaunced as they thithout which other men nor the land can not be deffe^ded
ne live in p^ax It is then great advantage to a young man that is willing to
do well / When both time and place he has and power to learn the art and
science of arms which is not to be thought of litel importans nor with litel
pain gotten and to him says he that in such dyscipline is well taught / fere
ne dread of fyghting is to him nothing against who soever his enemy that it be /
but rathre is to him as a joy and a delyt And with this adds the auctours
showing in what lesson they of the people were taught / that is to wite in
shotyng and casting thith slings which does great aid to them that well can
skyl there with / and was much used by thauncie^t time wherefore vegece in
praising of such co^nyng says that how be it a slinge be of no weight / it
is profitable and namely in sawtyng or fensyng of a forteresse a slynge is good
and couenable / whereof they say / that such manner of shot was som^tyme so
greatly set by / that in some Isles of greece the modres gaf no fode to their
children unto time they had hit^e their mete with yt stroke of the slynge /
and also learned hem to shote with a long bow and with a crosbowe both and
their maistres learned them to hold their bow with the lift hand and to draw
the cord with the right and with great strength unto there eerys / and that
the heart and the eyes they should see that thing that they would shote at and
that ententyfly should take their mark with good head / and in this art
namely englishmen are learned from their young age / wherefore co^tynui^gly they
pass al othre archers / vegece says that this manner of art will be continued
and often excercised namely to the good maistres / and that the ham^tyng and
continuau^ce thereof be needful / cathon says in his book of arms / that good
archers ben much profitable in a bataille / and this testifies claudius that
says that by the archers and they that were taught in the manner of castyng of
darts / overcome Alexandres enemies in diverse batailles with a lityl qua^tite
of his people / and this witenesseth also the noble warryer scipion of africa
/ also he taught hem to cast stones to bear sheldis and ye manner to couere
with the same to cast speris and ye ways to do al such othre thing and as
thauctours sayen diverse and propre maystres were / that by the phizonomye of ye
yongmen and by the body they know which were most able and more propre to
the discypline and teching of arms / as were they of whom the eyes and
spirits were open and moeuable / that had a straight head a large breast /
great sholders and well shapen arms long and bygge and well made / long hands
and of great bones small belly and the reins well formed / bygge thyes / leggis
straight well shapen full of synewis and dry / broad fete and straight / but as
for the height of the body made no force / and above al other thing took head
to the vigor and courage and to the swiftnes of the body / and to such
yongmen put their mastres their besy cure and deligence to teache them the
said art and connyng of arms / and as they saw hem with their ablenes of
body / of good and wise vndresta^ding / they had hem myche dear / and taught
and showed unto them al things that behouen to the chief captayns of arms /
with all this / they learned hem for to swi^me in ryuers or in see / And says
vegece that this art of swi^myng is right couenable to almanere men of arms /
as sometime it is needful to them when strength chasseth them to pass over
watres and ryuers for to eschew parell or for to short their ways / or for
some othre need / as may be / for to com at a certain owre there as they would be
/ or for to take or com^ by thees ways upon their enemies vnbeware / and so
did drive thau^cyent their bagage harneys and fardels aftre them by subtyl
craft / as upon pecis of timbre and upon dry thorns cast in the watre which
they ladd al swi^myng aftre them / And by this art of swi^myng may a man of
arms eschew the parel of death diverse ways / as it is writon of julius caesar
yt for to warau^t his own life sauf did swi^me in ye see / iij / c passes also
ye right worthy and preu baitailler cena ye romain escaped al alone sore
wounded from the great multitude of his enemies by his swi^myi^g over a great
river / and thurghe thees way of swi^mi^g were ye people of a castle yt was
besegid helped yt vitailles by their friends that swi^med over / with all by
night unto them not knowing their enemies of the same / and in especyal by this
art thau^ciens led their bestis and horses / and for to assoyle the rayson of
them that might say / that such thingis as above ben said / are light to the
saying / but hard to the lernyng our auctour says that how be it al things
seem dyfficyle to the dysciple or sooler er he can hem if the maistre be
tending and diligent of teching there is noon so hard a connyng / but that hit
wylbe light by long contynuacio^ of hauntyng of the same / And yet in
contynuyng the manieres that the romans kept such an use a monge othre they
had / that the noble men bare a garment unlike to them that were unnoble / and
with this was their robes of Joy and robes of sorrow which they wered aftre
the fall of their good eure or evil fortune / that is to wite if they had
lost any great bataille / or that some land were rebel unto them or some great
Iniure done against hem that required ve^gence then they took and wered the
robes of sorrow without othre garment upon hem unto time they came to their
above and were aue^ged / and then they took again their robes of joy

Here devised the proprietes that men of arms ought to have and in which they
ought to be taught Capio^ xjo^
WE have devised al enough the manners and introduccions of fayttes of arms
that thau^cye^t gaff to their children / the which for an ensample are good
to be kept in mind / and so behooves us to return to that / that is said
before / that is to wite in what things the good and wise captayn or his
lieutenau^t shall aplie him self first he shall as it is said before draw unto
him al ye best and most chosen men of arms and shall cherysshe hem / And sith
it comes to speak of good men of arms / vegece recounteth of the propryetees
yt behouen unto them / and says that with hardynes without which he may not
be ought / must be taught and be maystre in helping of him self in his harneys
and to be in at his ease to the end he may lightly assaylle his enemy / and to
be able to lepe lightly over a dyche and to clymme if need be upon that that
may let him to entree the lodgis of the adversaries over hedgis and over
tents if he sees his time / to bow aside forto void ye strokis by
delyuernes of body / and to enuahisshe leping upon his enemies if the manner of
the bataylle requires / And says that such manner of appertyses abasshen the
courages of the adversaries and put hem in a fere and so has thaduantage
over hem / And thus it has be full often that one has had the bettre upon a
stronger man than^ him self / and sooner wounded him that naught was
appareilled for to deffende him self / And of such touches says he / used the
great pompee when he faught / And if ye demanded of me where shall the best men
of arms be taken / I say for an ansuere / what so ever it is said that the men
that be in the hot countrees nyghe the son how wise that they be subtle and
malicious / are not much hardy / by cause they have not foyson of blood / for
cause of the great hete that there haboundeth / and also to the contrary / they
say that they of yt cold countries are hardy and not wise / and thus
cosequently none of both ought not be taken / but they of that land which is
betwix both te^perate ought to be taken / but as to me I hold yt in this none
othre rewle ought to be kept / but for to chese tho o men that most have seen
/ and that take most delight and have plesur^ in thexersice of arms / in
which labor is their glory and their Joy set / and that none othre
felicite nor worship^ they require / but only that / that may com^ to them by
mean of their cheualrouse deeds / and such of what nacyo^ that they be of /
are to be taken and received / and troth it is that with thauctours all good
wit ought to accord that if the captayn has need of folk of the comynaltee
he ought singulerly to chese them that can^ some crafts / as bochers that are
woned to shede blood and to smite with axes ^ carpenters smythes and all other
that excersyce their bodies in trauaill and in works that be done by might of
mann^s ^and Also men^ of the country to whom hard lyeng ^^yne and labor is
not strange and are norysshed of rude f^de such be good to suffer pain and
trauayll / without which thing is not made werre that long is demened and kept
/

Here begins to speak of the manners that behouen to a Constable or cheff
captayn in executyng of his office Capitulo Duodecimo
IT is so then / that the werre delybered and bygonne and by the prince and
sovereign received and sent deffyau^ce as the guyse is / The wise captain that
committed is to the same / shall ordeyne and see first of all that the
fron^yers (...) borders be well garnysshed as well of good men of werre as of
artyllerye of al manner shot and of all othre deffensable necessaryes and /
almaner of garnysen of such qua^tite as ^ym sh^l seem good aftre the qualyte
of the adversaries And the towns and fortresses so garnysshed lack of nothing
he shall advise what nombre of men he needs for to do that he has and shall
have to do upon his entrepryse So shall he chose out among all other the best
men of arms and semblably of them that occupye shotyng gonners and othre unto
the nombre that necessary is for him ^ And by cause that now commynly it is so
taken that that the vyctorye of the bataille by reason ought to fall to that
party that more folk are / Against this oppynyon says vegece / that it
suffyseth for a common bataylle to lead a legion of good men of arms with thyr
aids / A legion of men of arms is in nombre / vi / Myll / lxvi / that we may
so take as we say for sperys / And al othre auctours that hereof have writon
accorden what vegece / saying that as in an ouergrete quantite is confusion /
it suffiseth at the most against al multitude of enemies two legions without
moo of good men of arms so that they be conducted and ladd by sovereign
ordinance which be in nombre lytil more than: xiij: myll sperys / And it is
found that many ostes have be dysconfyted by their own multitude more then
by the force of their enemies / and why / certes a good reason is thereto / for
the great multitude is more strong to be kept and holden in order / and oste
falls to a great myscheff for her great and pesau^t weight and is more nedy of
vytailles / more debates be there / And more long to pass forth away / and
it happeth often easily that the enemies / how well yt they be of litel quantite
awayten to ouercom^ them as they go thrughe narow passages and ryueres / And
there is the parell for tauau^ce nor haste hem self they can not but they shall
let each othre / and namely in arre^ged batailles they ouerpresse and
ouerstep one over that othre by such amauere that they smoldre each othre /
And therefore as it is said before / the ancient that the thing that be
co^uenable to a bataille had taught / and the perillis showed by experience /
commended more to have a litel ost well taught than a great multitude / The hie
cheff captain shall ordeyne over such folk as he shall have diverse captains
and conestables under whom he shall commytte certain nombre of men of arms / to
some more / And less to some othre aftre their suffysaunce / and like wise
shall depart with them his gonners laborers and shoters / And then him self
and such as he has commyted shall see them mustre diverse times in the feldis
that one after that other / There shall be take good head that noon be retained
but he be passable so that no fawte be neythre in his person nor in harnoys
of what astate that they be / And there shall be wise comyssaryes that good head
shall take / that for couetyse of the payeme^t of the souldyours no decepcion
be made by retenue of such that be unable / and from old time were the head
captains first of all right straytly sworn / that they feythfully and truly
should serve the prince or the country without that for fere of death nor for to
eschew what soemer parell that it were they should not fle nor for sake the
bataille / And they in like wise took the oaths of every man of arms when they
retained hem in wages / Thees things well and duly made / after that he shall
see that he have good surete and assignacyon for the payement of his men of
arms for the time that he thinks that this armee shall last / For to this
ought singulerly al cheff capp^taynes to take good head / as to that thing
pryncypall that may eythre make or deffeate their entrepryse / For noon
entende for to have good men of arms without they be well paid / For none
sooner declyneth their payement but that their coragis fayllen

Here deuyseth the manner that to a chief captain longs to keep / in lodgyng
of his ost / after that the books of arms sayen Capio^ xiijo^
ANd if it be so that the said chief captain goo purposyngly to assemble in
bataille with his enemies of which he awayteth their coming / wherefore him
needs to keep the feldis for a space of time and to lodge there his ost he
shall advise with a good head after the supposyng that he has of coming of
his adversaries / to lodge his oost in the best wise he can / and to take first
if he may the advantage of the ground and the best way for him self to the
hurt and hynderaunce of his enemies / And tytus liuius says that some time when
they of gallya were goon with their oostes upon the romans / which knowing
their coming went against them / and as they first took thaduauntage of the
feld and of the place did lodge hem self in such manner that they were betwix
their enemies and the river For the which cause they vaynquisshed and
overcome their enemies more by thurst / than by arms / And it suffyseth not
to take a good place in a field / but such that their enemies if they approach
may not chese for them self any bettre So shall he establisshe his lodgis to
the highest part of the feld nyghe the ryuere and that no hille shadow them
if he may and that the place of their lodgis be of good air and of good
compass if he may / And after vegece / in a place where pastures water and wode
be / and that the feldys be not disposyd to keep rain watre long upon the
earth / nor where as to the enemies might fall great russhyng and habondance of
watres by brekyng of some pondes and stangs or some scluses / And it is to wite
that after the quantite of folk and the plente of charyotis and cartis baggage
and fardellages must be taken the spaces of the lodgys in such manner that a
great multitude be not to narow set / nor also more a broad than it needs for
to be / For of less strength they should be thereby / and ought the cartisand
caryage to be set round a bout Ioynyng to gyder / and more fair is the
lodgys holden when the place is taken more in length by the third part than
it is in the bread / And in the myddis ought the place to be fortyffyed most
of all / As a strong hold made with tymbre if men may and that need be / Of
which the yate shall be even against the front of the enemies / And other yatis
must there be / by which the vytaylles shall com^ in / And vegece says that
many baners ought to be set there up on high / and if the chyef captain
thinks to keep his oost long there he shall do fortifye the place with dyches
and palis round a bout and with closur^ made of tymbre as it were a castle
wherein shall be (...) the garnysons / to the vytayllyng of which ought to be
(...) / for before al other work right wisely and well (...) as vegece says
more gryeuous is honger than wepe^ (...) many thyngis may be borne and suffered
in an ost but ^^^cessyte and lack of mete in a feld has no suffraunce (...)
remedy without vitaylle com thither / how be it ^e says (...) al thing is
couenable to an oost yt a man concence (...) self with a lityl mete / And
therefore the wise captayn ought so to purueye / that vitailles faille not or
ever the siege which oftymes lasts longer than men wene of be raised or go
fro / For when thaduersary feleth the ost nedy of vitaillis so much more sharp
and fers he is against hem and as (...) think lightly to take hem and for this
cause it happeth y^ folk of an oost force them self so much to take vitaille
one fro that other / and in especyall folk that keep a siege before a
fortress do so / wherefore good head would be taken that the dyspensatours and
vitaillers of the oost be not theuys hemself and rob not the oost as they by
crafty wiles may do / for by such away has many an oost suffered emonge great
honger and much mysease and great parell / wherefore it is good and wisely done
to look thereto /

Yet of the same Capio^ xiiijo^
With all the things a boue said / the good captain that will maynten^ and
keep his werre justly against god and truly towardis the world / ought to
endeuoire himself to see his soudyours be paid so well that they need not to
live of no pillage upon the contrees of them that been their fre^dis / and by
this manner of way the oost shall have no deffaulte / For why all manner
goodis and vitailles from every part shall come thither / so that marchau^ts may
surely come / and that he make an ordinance upon pain of death that no thing
be taken but it be paid for / nor naught mysdoo to the merchant / which now
would god that it were done so every where / great good it were and I bileue
that al thingis should therefore come to the better end / great peril is in
fayt of werre and in an oost when couetyse of pillage ledeth to hit men of
arms more rather / than does the good intent that they should have to keep
the right of their party / or the honor of knyghthode / or for to get
preysyng and good fame / And such folk ought bettre to be called theuis and
robbers / than men of arms or cheualrous / and this showed well the frenshmen
that time they overcome the romans and there great oost in bataylle upon the
ryuere of the rosne and great proyes gate upon hem / but in token that they
setted naught by the same / and that their intent was not set there upon /
they took all the proyes / as pylfreys and rich harnoys / gold silver and
plate and cast all to gyder in the said ryuere / the which thing so don put
the romans which such another deed had never known in great fere and dread
/ The wise captain then well purueyed of tho thingis that been said a boue /
shall not trust only upon that / that his fourragers shall bring by cause
oftymes they find naught to take / but he shall be purueied before his partyng
/ not only of al his garnyson / but also of al vitaillis that upon cartis he
shall do carye with him as is corn / and / mele / wynes / flessh / benes /
salt / and vinaygre refressheth to drink it with much watre in the somer when
wyn failleth and al other thingis couenable that wisely he shall do to be
dispensed / Yet says the book of arms that if the oost should tarry long in a
place and that a great puissance of enemies wayteth to come thither the place
ought to be fortyffyed round a bout with good dyches of / xij / foot deep and
/ xv / foot broad and as straight as they can be made at that side of the
enemies / with stakes (...) other thyngis to let them that would descend for
ten^re but and so be says he that the oost should not abide long^^ that he
awayteth but for a few folk / it is no need of so great fortyffyeng / but
suffysseth if men will dygge that the dyches be made of / viij / or / ix / foot
of depnes and of bread vij foot / And ought the good capytayne to commytte good
men of arms with gonners and men of shot for to keep and wait upon the
laborers and werkmen which such fortyfycacyons are in dooyng / And for to
bring a bout all such thingis the wise captain shall be right well purueyed of
al Instrumentis couenables as shouillis with iron at for end / ratellis /
pycosis / sawis / axes / nails / wymbrekyns and of al other ferrementis for to
make lodgys or for to pydche and dress up tents and pauyllons / and of such
werkmen that can good skyle of the same / Not wythstandyng vegece says that
folk of oostis ought al to be maystres hemself of kuttyng of wodis and of
fellyng down of great trees of making of ways thrughe hedgis and busshys / of
byldyng of lodgis / of making of cloysours of timber in sawyng of bordis and of
making of brydgis if need be / of fyllyng of dyches with fagotis and bondellis
of read for to find passage / of making of ladders and of al such thyngis And
after the said Auctour the ancient conquerours carried with hem in their
oostis forges ready made where were forged and made salatis / and helmetys /
curacys and al other manner of harnoys / and al such instrumentys of iron as
must be had to make bows and arowes sperys / dartys and Iauelots / and such
werkmen that conde skyle in all thees craftys / And their souyrayne care was to
see that in their oostis al thi^gis couenable for the same should be found as
it were with in a cite / For to their houses they returned not soon / Also
mynours they lad with them that conde full craftly dig under the earth for to
over take the enemies vnbeware / With this shows vegece thoo thyngis that
are to be considered for to keep the oost in good health if hit must tarry long
in one place / Whereof five things he assygneth thereunto / yt is to wite place
/ watre. time medecyne and excersyce / a place must be chosen fer from any
palusche or maresgrou^de / and a watre that is unwholesome foul and still wythym
a dyche full of vermyne ought not to be had / but must see to / that in somer
time they be not during the great hete without shadowyng of trees and pauyllons
and no deffaulte of good and sweet watre for them self and for their bestis /
Medecyne they must have / that is to be garnysshed with notable leches and good
maystres of Syrurgye that shall give help and socour to the syke as well as they
were in a cite / And excersyce they must also have / that is to enure hem self
so to pain and trauayll and to be hard / that syknes take not hem in time of
need for fawte they be not woned thereto / Thus ben they couenable to bataylles
that been acustomed to endure and suffer both hete and cold Hard rest and
sharp fare for no thing can com^ unto them but they have assayed and known
it a fore / And in this manner after vegece the wise captain shall do set up
his lodgis where by a good order shall stablish his captains with their folk
under diverse baners and standardis as they should goo to a bataille by the
manner and form as he shall ordeyne to them / And he with his men shall be in
the myddis with his standard dressed up a high /

Here deuiseth of the thought and care that the head captayn ought to have to
take good head upon his oost Capio^ xv
Among the other virtues that souerainly ben couenable to a duc and chief
captain of an oost is necessary that he be a good man and feythfull / as by
ensample it is (...) of fabricius leder of the romain oost / that for his gre^e
worthynes and bounte / the king Pirrus his aduersarye would have given him the
fourth part of his royalme and of his tresors / so that he would take his party
and to be his felawe in arms / To whom he ansuered that ryc^es by treason and
malice gotten was to be despised ouermoche and that possible it was him to be
overcome by arms but not by untruth nor treason / With this vegece says
that the captain to whom is committed in hand so great a thing as is the
bayll and charge of the noblesse of knyghthode the deed of the prince / the
common well of the land the sur^ee of the cytees and the fortune of the
batailles / ought to take heed not in general upon all the oost without moo but
also partyculerly over every person / For if any myshappe fall / the common
damage is attribued te his culpe and deffawte / And therefore the valiant duc
and chyef captain of an often so committed and deputed by the prince as it is
said shall endeuoire him self to take good keep of al his folk and that they
keep good rule in their lodgis and do as they should do For the book says
that these young esquyers when they be in rest ought to dysporte hem self by
ways of strengthes of arms / gyuyng by this manner to vndrestande that they
be bettre plesed with the excersyce of the same / than with ydlenes of which
grows comynly among young folk that be to gyder noise and ryote if they be
not kept in fere of their captain / And for this cause ought the sage duc to
be right curyous in taking of good keep upon his people in this byhalue / for as
the wise maistre says they that be ryotous and full of rancour and anger are
peryllous in an oost Wherefore if a captain has any so dysposed in his oost he
ought by ways of fayrnes to make him self quyte of hem / and not to be
rygorous and hoot upon them as he dyschargeth hem which should cause them to
turn to the other party against him / or to procure and machyne sooner evil
against his oost / But with fayrenes ought to send hem away somewher in feynyng
a cause why wherefore he does so to them / Morouere says the master that if
need constrains that such men be pugnysshed according to their ryotous
dedis with iron / they ought not to be spared / for right wisnes will that it be
so to the end that other may take ensample there by and for correction of
themself / than that men should suffer hem to Do offense and to hurt
oultragiously diverse other men / But yet he says that the captains of whom
the men of arms are mesurably and sadly demened by good rule and by good
doctrine / are more to be praised / than thoo whose men of arms are kept and
trayed from malice and evil / only for fere to be punysshed for the same /
And to this purpos says thauctour that folk which is gadred out of diverse
placis and of strange nations bring up some time wilfully noise / tumulte and
debatis in an ost / And this comes oftymes by some of them that have no
will for to fight which feyne to be angry by cause they well not goo to the
bataylle / And this comes to them for one of two causes / or ellis for both /
that is to wite by cause that either they are bettre willing to that other
pertie of their enemies or ellis by cause they be wou^t to be idle and to live
wau^tonly ^ therefore the grieuousnes of the traueyl in which they be (...)
enurid with before / is sore noyouse unto them / and the bokis saien that right
great worship it is to a captayn when his people rules themself couenably in
an oost / and to this purpos it is said / that when cymars the messager of king
pir^us was sent in to the oost of the romans for to treat of (...) with them
/ he found the knightis there of so high a manner and noble mayntyen / y^ he
reported by them and said that he had seen an oost all of kingis thus the wise
captayn that of all thi^gis shall be purueied shall take good head to see that
through his fawte nothing be left yt is to be thought upon or to be done / not
long sleep shall he take / but a litel and mesurable rest for out of a
courageous heart in what thing that it is sete^ unto / comes the great labor
of / he shall be therefore curiouse and dilligent to send for the here and there
his espies subtylli for to enquere and vndresta^de ye purpos of his enemies and
what their way be / and by their report made unto him what folk in nombre
his enemies be to the regard of the qua^tite of his own ost / what manner of
folk they be and what his own how strong and how they are armed / which of
both perties is bettre horsed / what appareill and ordinance they have / what
comynaltee they have / and of what nacio^ what socours and of whens it may com^
/ as well to his (...) and what advantage has the one party more than that
other / And herupon he shall take thaduis and oppinion of diverse chyualrous wise
and good captains that shall be of his counseil / old and good true men of good
and sad counseyl and expert in faytis of arms / Nor he shall not do nothing
only by his own heed but shall make his entrepryse after thaduys of many men /
by whose regard and direction he with them shall conclude by good delyberacyon
that which is best for to be done / to give bataille to his adversaries / or
not / soon / or late / or whether he shall abide and tarry till his enemies com
to sawte his and him keeping always good watch and every man at his ward for
to deceive by some cawtell his adversaries / But and if he can know his
enemies to be waytyng after any socours / he shall make haste to fight with
them / And if he him self abides for socours he shall tarry if he be not able
having alweyes good keep and good watch / and to see that althyng be redyly
pressed at hand / to the^de that at their mete or by night time they be not
overcome vnbeware / For as the master says / in most surete / is often woned
to fall great peril / And therefore ought the head captain if he see his time
to assaylle his enemies while they be at mete or a sleep / or ellis when they
be traueylled and weary of the way / or ellis when their horses taken their
pasture and their fode / when they think to be most sure / For to them says
he that be so overtaken / neither virtue nor strength makes no force to them
nor multitude of people may not proffyte hem / But him that his overcome in a
bataylle / How be it that his wit in the art and use of arms / might not
that time profit him / Natheles in his wrath he may complayn upon fortune But
he that vaynquysshed is or hurt by the subtylnes of his enemy / can blame
noon / but only the deffauwte of his own self / For he might have eschewid
his hurt if he had be as kepefull and dyligent to keep him self / as his
enemy was for to make a surpryse upon him / O how well showed / that of wise
assayllyng or sawtyng and was a master / yt valiant scipion of affryke when
that he so much did / that he fond a way and a mean by might / that all the
lodgys of his enemies were set al on a fire / and soon after ran upon hem
so sharply that they wist not where at they should a wait nor take keep / and
thus they were dysconfyted more by abaysshment than by arms And this purpoos
of espyeng of enemies vegece says that much proffytable a thing it is in an
ost to have wise espyes that can well find the ways to learn and vndrestande
the couuyne of the adversaries / For such can entremette hem self by yeftis or
great promesses and by subtyl ways to draw to them sum or many namely if
they may that be of the counseyll of that other party so that they know what
is their intent and purpoos for to do / And by this may the chyef captain /
see what it is best for him to do / And with this says yet vegece that much
it proffiteth to find ways who may / to make disce^cyon among the enemies /
and that they dysdayne to obey to their capytayne / of which the condicyons
men ought for to know / and to take him who may thrughe his own manners of
dealyng / and hereof ought the wise capytayne to be well aduysed / for no manner
of nacyo^ how litel that it be can not in all thyngis be put a down by
enemies without it be that dyscencyon and debate hap to fall emo^ge hem self
and se^blably the duc or captayn that so shall send out his espyes shall take
good keep yt he himself be not nor his couine discouerd and there fore right al
thus as they that goo by the sea that know not the paryllous passagis that be
there in dyuerses placis and costs of the same will have all such parellis
painted in parchemyn or paper for to eschew them as they shall saylle / So in
likewise the captains and leders of oostis ought to know the ways and the
passagis the mountains / the forestis and the wodis the waters the ryuers and
the narowe passagis / where as they must pass / And how well the good captain
be well informed of all this / yet for fere of falling in this caas / he shall
take with him if it needs such of the country to lead his oost that can the
ways well / The which so taken with him / shall make them to be so well kept that
they may not escape to the end that they have no space if they would to betraye
the oost / So shall he give hem money and shall promise hem a great reward if
well and truly they led him and his oost / And by thretnyng he shall also ^raye
hem if they do the contrary / And straytly shall command the head captain to
them all that be of his counseyl upon their oath that they shall vttir nor say
what way he purposes to goo / nor where he thinks to lead his oost nor what
his purpoos is to do / For uneath without any traitors is any oost / And
hard it were that there as great quantyte of folk is gadred to gidre namely
where great foyson of strangers be that they all sheld be of a good co^^ag^ /
But he ought to ^orte that no thing of less suffraunce is in the world to
pryncis / lordis / and heed captains of an oost ^ Than they that be known
such / evil reward they ought to have for what soever trayson that they do /
well showed this the romans to them that traytoursly slew. Centoryus their
lord / by cause that (...) it he was a ^ommayn he had made great werre against
them of rome for despyt and envy that he bare to other princes of the romans /
But when the traitors came for to have and receive their reward / death was to
them ^ouen for their payement / and was told hem that such reward ought to
have al such traitors / It is semblably wryton that king alexandre did so to
them that thought to have a pleasure of him that slew king darnis their lord
With this he shall committee also such of his that be good and true and well
horsed to search a fore and there for to take keep that the oost ^e not aspyed
and watched / And vegece says that ^spyes must be sent a fore as though they
were pilgrims or labor^^s that both day and night seek about / to wite and
see if (...) be laid oughwhere / and if thees spies comme (...) again / then
ought the captain to take another way (...) may / For it is a token that they
be taken and such men (...) ^^^tourment and pain done to them / of times
show (...) they know of He shat not be no pren^^z also in (...) his oost
when he departs in fair ordenaunce and (...) that is to wite the best of his
men with foyson (...) that side as he thinks that more great peril may (...)
fall / and shall comaunde that the feblest part shall (...) most part of his ost
/ and shall ordeyne and commy^^^ (...) other ^ety captains / that be in the
forewarde ^or (...) march forth in fair ordinance / that one (...) to that
other and alweyes ready for to (...) if it need be / And after shall follow the
(...) and shall march paas by paas Joined (...) thycke as awalle with their
(...) fleyng out a broad with the (...) shall (...) the ^rryere guard by
semblable (...) says that the ca^ti^ and bagage (...) forewarde for the more
surte of the same / or ellis by fore the arriere guard And by cause it happeth
some time to be sawted on the sides by some embushe that falls upon vnbewarre
/ the captain shall there fore ordeyne for socours to be ready at any time on
every side / And the book of arms says that the captain ought syngulerly to
take good head to the manner of going of his people / that they make their paas
egall and like / and that they keep still good ordenaunce / For an ost
vnordynatly renged wherrof that one felawship hastes to march / and that
other withdrawith / it his in great peril / nor no thing is mor preiudicyable
in a bataille / than dysordonaunce or to go out of array / and he says that
the Journey of an ost ought to be of / x / m / paaces in the somer / or ellis /
v / owres that may amounte to / v / mile of way / and if need ledeth hem /
they may go yet as he says: ij: M paas and no more / and ought to be well wise
that by long way nor trauayll his ost fall not to some syknes for fawte of
rest / wherefore he must see to depart at a couenable owre / so that they may
com^ to lodgyng er the night com^ upon hem / And that in the short days of the
winter they depart not so late that thrughe rain snow or froste they must go
a great part of the night / and he shall see also that his ost be alweyes
purueyed as he goes with wode for to make fire with all / For noothyng so
needful is in an ost as is the fire / and that they use of noon evil watres
that might engendre in them some pestilence / that in such an assemble syke
folk need not / and it is a great myscheffe when necessite of bataylle
chasseth them that by syknes are as dysconfyt to do more than they can

Here speaks of the passage of ostis over flodes and Ryuers Capio^ xvijo^
IT falls sometime so that an ost must pass over great watres and ryues which
thing is great acombrau^ce and full of parel / and the remedies for to pass
them over / dyscriueth vegece / sayng / that first men must wisely know where
the watre is lest and most low / and there in trauers ought to be set a route
of folk well horsed and another in like wise vndrenethe / and thus shall pass
betwix them both the great flote of the oost / And says that they that be
upward shall hold the swiftnes of the watres / and they yt be donuwardis they
may keep up them that ye watre might throw a down / And if the watre be so
great that this remedy can not serve / and that needs it must be passed the
captain shall have his bridgis ready made tofore which shall do to be borne
always with him in charyotis or cartis of which bridgis some may be made upon
pipes bounden togider and well teyed with ropys by trauers of the ryuere and
bordis well fastued thrupon with pynnes made of wode / which bridge may be soon
dressed upon the water as men do upon leuys by wit of subtyl maystres / and
some may be made with stakis fast pight within the watre with ropes that shall
retche in trauers from that one stake to that other upon which ropes the
cordis shall be set for folk to go over Another manner of bridgis may be
found / that is with ships covered with bordis and well made fast that one
vessel to wat other / and this manner of ways is the surest for a bridge who
that can recover so many vessel is / and yet men may make a bridge with long
peers of timber and set hem in trauers of the ryuere with hyrdellis thereupon
and covered with horse donge and they must be ancred withim the^ watre that they
may be steadfast / And by such manner of ways they may pass hem self over
lightly ^ but diverse other remedies fond in this byhalue the king Cirus of
perse when he went for to take the cite of Babilonne / For as he came to the
ryuere of Euffrates / he fond it so large and so de^e that hit semyd as
Impossible that any ost of men should have past hit over / Wherefore by force of
men he did do make dyches and dalue the earth so that the said flood was
parted in / iiij / C / lxvi / ryuers And by this mean he and his great ostis
did pass over / And thus there is nothing but that the wit of man can reche
when wisdom and will be to gider set thereto / With this it is recounted by
thauncyent historyes that the conquerours in old time were so taught and so
good maistres of swymyng that they set but litell for to have goon over a
great watre / and had great pecis of tymbre made holowe as chestis in which
they drew their harnoys and vitailles after hem / and other made fagottis or
boundellis of dry read and bound hem up and so passed over / And if the
bridge must of need abide still for to pass contynuelly and repasse over / it
must be fortyffied with dicbes and with strong palis that shall be kept of good
men of arms and archers at the side of the enemies / And where this manner of
dooyng should seem light by heryng say / and hard of dooyng to them that have
not learned the way thereof / that might say that of such thingis it is but a
dreme / It is no Iape that when ye great oostis of the romans during the space
of / xxx / year and moo went diverse times fro rome in Affrike unto the cite of
cartage and yet ferther in other countrees where they must pass great flodes
and great ryuers and like wise through all the landis that they gate and subdued
/ they had no bridgis made of stone nor no vessellis they fond for to pass
hem over / wherefore they fond as for need al such ways of making of brydgis
/ And if it happed that they passed over on the might by the move light or
ellis so secretly that the enemies can not know nothing thereof / they must
as soon as they be past arm hem self and put hem self again in good
ordinance that they be not overtaken vnbewarre And keep forth on their way
with a fair little paas by such an order that if any enemies com upon hem they
may be able and ready to bear more pain and suffer more perell than they can
give hem / But if they may eschew hem by mountains and leave their enemies
vndrenethe it is a great auauntayge and surete for them / And if it be so that
they find the ways narowe by combraunce of busshes and hedges it is bettre /
as vegece says that they cut hem and open hem a broad with their handys for
making of the way / than that they should abide or suffer great peril in the
high and broad ways

Here speaks of the maneres that the chyef captain of an ost ought to hold
and keep when he thinks to have shortly a bataylle Capitulo xviijo^
After that which a boue is said must be here spoken of certain poyntis /
aduyses and ways that to a captain / are good to be kept that time he
supposes to receive soon a bataylle / after the book of arms and other
auctours that have spoken of this matere / And it is to wit that when men feel
their enemies coming wylling to over run the land / they ought not if they
can to suffer hem to enter the country / but shall go axenst them with a great
oost / For much bettre it is to hurt anothris land than to suffer his own to
be dommaged / When a captain then is com^ to that place as he thinks to
have shortly Anthiocus of Europe / that is to wit by night when their oostys
were traueylled and lacked rested / And no keep they took of them self / the
which rommayns being but a few in quantyte slew more than / lx / thousand of
the foresaid two kyngys men as thistorye recounteth / And vegece says that
where a bataylle is done in two or in three owres after which al manner trust
and hope is goon from that party that is over come / And by cause that the
fortune of the vyctorye can not be known of before / The wise captain ought
not to put nor vaunce forth him and his men lightly to a bataylle in a plain
feld but if he see that it be to his great avauntage / And that a day of
bataylle set / is to be dradd and redoubted as a thing that is putt in a
great I^opardye / Well it was assayed and prouyd of the rommayns that time they
had sent their great oost in to hyspayne that turned rebel against hem /
Where as of the bataylle which they found there ready against hem remained not
of hem all one person that might report the tydyngys to rome / but knew hit
a good while after by strangers / Therefore ought the Duc to hurt his enemies
little and often by fair scarmysshes / by watches / and by busshementys / And by
such way to mynushe them day by day as much as he can / Item he says also
that when it happeth that prisonners be taken during the werre in scarmyshyng
or otherwise / men ought to entreat and fare so fowll with them that they be
put thereby in despair of their lyffe If hit be so that they that so have
taken hem / Awayte after the bataylle / by cause that their enemies having
no trust to find another pity nor mercy in them if they were vaynquysshed of
them / should deffende them self and fight more corageously for their lyffe /
For many a time it has be seen that a lytyl quantyte of men thus desperate of
mercy and pytie / dyscomfyted and over came a great and a mughti oost / by cause
that they would rather dey fightyng / than to fall in the cruel handys of
their enemies / And so it is a great peril to be fight such men / For
their stre^gthe grows and doubbeth with in hem Therefore ought the Duc or
captain says he to vndrestande and know as a rygtewys Judge does the truth
of a matere or he give his sentence / Alswel the strength as thaduauntage that
his enemy has over him and how and wherrof he may hurt him / whereupon he shall
take wise counseyll to wit what he has to do / For by this manner of way
has of times a small quantyte of folk that ledd werre by wise captains /
over come a great multitude as it is said before / But if it hap says vegece
/ that thyn enemy press the much for to give him a day of bataylle and that
he hastes to be fight the / take heed whether it is at his advantage and to
thy hurt and dommage / but do nothing nor meddle not but if thou see thy time

Here shows the manner of behauyng that a chyef captain ought to hold if
hit hap that he will depart from the feld witout abydyng or gyuyng of any
bataylle / Capitulo xix /
But we put a cas / that the prince hap to send word to the captain that
he turn again wytout gyuing of any bataylle nor that he make no more adoo /
or that the chyef captain would take him self upon him for certain cause to
leave the feld / it is to consydere and to see what manner be sure / Then
shall come out upon hem they that be in busshementys set for them and by
great virtue and stre^gthe shall hurt and damage hem / And how so ever it is He
that departs from his enemy ought by all manner of ways to puruey / that if
he be chassed and followed / that they that chasseth and pursiewith him have some
myshap at his return ageyn / eythre by setti^g of a watch for them or else
by some other manner / And if it needs them that shall make chasse after the to
pass over some flode or ryuere / leye thy watch so for them that they that
shall pass first may be over run by thy men / and that another party of thy
people be put in a busshement at the bac side of thim enemies if thou can for
to sawte them that yet awayten for to pass over the ryuere / And if thou need
thy self for to pass thrughe woodis or by some narowe ways see that thou send
a fore some persons of the oost that be feithfull and true that can report
unto the / the paths and whether any busshement be there laid or not / For a
less shame it were to receive a dommayge in fightyng openly with his enemy /
than to have any combraunce and lettyng by some awaytyng set / whereof men had
take no keep unto it thorughe necligence /

Here shows how the head captain of an oost that falls in a treatee of peace
or takes trewes with his enemies ought to keep himself and his people from
such peryls as he may be brought or fall in to by wylys and decepton^ / C /
xxo^
And to the end that no thing that couenable is and expedyent to be put in
this our book be not fogoten / as touchi^g ye caasis yt oftentimes happen or y^
may hap by faites of arms / it is good to speak of athi^g yt over much may
hurt and over sore an ost and yt may overcome and hurt more / than does yrone
or any other thing / and that soueraynly is to be eschewyd and to take good
heed unto / the which thing is hard to be put fro / when it is ones set
in an oost / as it shall be declared herafter / We have devised al enough how
that an oost may depart more surely fro the field if cas be that his best
counseyll will not that he fight / Now wol we put another cas / that is to
wit / that both thostys be In a feld with a great strength on both sides
and ready for to take a day of bataylle together / But by certain means they
fall in a treatee of peace / It is then necessary in such a caas / That the
captain as we have said by fore / be sage and wise / so that he may w^rke al
thingys to the best / And for to follow the way that wisdom techeth / He
shall first take heed to two pryncypall thyngys / One is that he shall consydere
/ What the persons be that treatten and what moeueth them thereto / That other
is / he shall be hold and see what and upon which condycyons is founded and
rests the same trayttee / What the demand which is done to him is / and
what his offer is / As to the first of two it is to be aduysed if they that so
treaten ben his frendys or if he so reputeth and holds them / or whethre they
be men of egall mean not parcyal nor synguler for another of both parties / or
whether they be symply sent and admytted of that other party / or not / If it
be so that ^it comes by the simple motyon of that other part ^ it is a good
token / that no deceyte be not with all For either god has so inspyred them /
or it appears that they doubt fere ye battle / but never themore for this /
he shall be well advised of ye manner of their askyng with ye manner of their
proffre thou be more proud therefore wenyng to have hem at advantage if the
bataylles happed to be / whereby thou would not fall to accord / But rathre
to be found the harder For any proffres that were done unto the / nay
certeynly / For with pain it might be found that ever it happed that they
that refused just proffres what someuer right that they had nor what great
nombre of people that they had against a few folk / But that at the last they
repented full sore / And it semyth that god in this caas hates them that such
raysonnable proffres comtempnen and reffusen / And punyssheth hem there for /
But herto thou ought to take heed for in this lies the pareyl / that is to
wit / that thou be not deceived by trayson thrughe false means under the
shadow of the treatyng of the peace / And how shall thou know this / For sothe
I say that by conjectures thou shall mow have a color of the doubt thereof /
Wherefore be thou always upon thy watch / Wherefore if it be so / that the first
moeuing of the trayttee of peace be comen of sum of thyn / thou shall mow
know by the condycyons of him / what the cause may be that has moeuyd him to
speak thereof / For if he be wise and a good true man and that thou know him
for such / thou ought not for to merueyll if such a man would gladly see
that a good mean were found that might eschew effusion and shedyng of mannys
bl^de by some good and worshypfull trayttye and that peace might be had / But if
he be a man that is not wont to find him self in such a caas / And that is of
lytyl courage / though he be malycyouse and a well spoken man / thou may
think that this comes to him by cowardnes and feebleness of heart / But not
therefore thou ought not to put his reasons all a back / But shall see if
they ben good and to thy profyt and honnour / Another thing is to be considered
/ that is that in heryng him speak / that the way of the treattye peax shows
and counseilleth unto the / thou shall feel and see whethre the peax may bettre
be and come to his proffyt / than the werre / And if in his talkyng he peyneth
him self to put the in will of making of a peax / the which for great
desire that he has to hit / should not be unto the well honnourable / or if it
is any couetouse person to whom this may be made to be said by yeftes and
promesses / To thees if thou may hit know / thou ought not to add nor give
no credence nor feyth / but shall put them aside if thou be of their
conditions suffysauntly informed / For an untrue counseiller will never give
good counseil but if it be to his singular proffyt / but a true cou^seiller
sees more to the common we will / than to his own parcyall proffit / And now it
is to the necessary during the traittye of peax / that like wise as the
ambaxadours comen to the from that other party ^ so shall thou send again
sum of thyn / Therefore thou must in this well see that thou be not deceived /
For a great parel may be thrynne but if they be true men / For by such ways
and by such ambaxatours many cytees / land^s and royalmes as some time was
troy the great and other diverse have be deceived by such traitors
ambaxatours feynyng them self good and true / nor no parel there nys like unto
the same / by cause that it is so hidd / that with pain may noon keep him self
how wise that he be / from a traitor if he has entreprised to hurt him by
treason / And therefore no bettre remedy to this there nys but to se^de such
ambaxadours that be most nyghe thy noble person if such thou have with the
that greatly setten by thy death and destruction so that he may have both
worship and good fame thereby and we evermore to be preysed and worshypped with
him for the same / and that his good grace we may please thereby So have we a
good cause fair lordys to sawte by fires courage and to enuaysshe wyllyngly
our enemies I dare well say For they be in the wrong / and so is god with us
where fore we shall overcome them without faylle without the defaulte be in us /
and thereof I make you sure / Now be ye willing then my dear friends every
man as much as he may / to do so well that I may have a cause to report by you
that which ye shall be the bettre for / And as to me I swear you by may faith
/ That whosomenere shall bear him self well now of whatsoeuere degree that he be
of / I shall so greatly Reward him that he shall be while that he lives the
bettre both in honnour and proffyte / Now late us goo without fere and hardyly
my dear children / friends and brethern^ against thees folk commending our
self unto god that he will grant us the vyctory over them as we all desire
the same / Such maneres of words shall say the head capytayne unto his men and
that this ought to be do / all the auctoures accorden in one that of this caas
have spoken / and sayen that thees maneres kept Iulyus Caesar / Pompee /
Scipyon and the other conquerours / And with this afferme and holden that the
wise capytayne ought to be large and not couetouse / For it is to be known
that the books of knyghthode learn no couetyse to be had in no manner of
capytayne but only to see for the price and worship that longen to the
fayttes of arms / And certeynly this showed well the good duc Fabrycyus the
which for example of his bountefulnes we so often Remember him in this book /
When that the king Pyrrus his enemy that sore much desired to draw him with
his party by cause he was so worthy / sent him a great quantyte of plate
both of gold and of syluere / For by cause that he vndrestode that he was so
pour that he was served at his own board with vessellys of wode and platers
made of tree / and sent him word that to so high a man as he was apparteyned
well rich service / But he reffused them / and ansuered that he loned bettre to
ete his mete in treen dysshes with worship / than in dysshes of gold with
reproach and shame / Then thus it behooves that the said head capytayne / be
benygne and gracious emonge his folk / For otherwise he were not worthy to be
amytted to that office / For they say that by the means of his largess and
benygnyte he may the bettre draw unto him the hertes of his folk to expose
and Ieoparde with him both body and lyffe / than by any other other thing /
His benygnyte ought to give hardynes namely to the least and that been of simple
astate / that they dare show and sygnyfye unto him some thing if hit seems
hem good that concerns the faycte of arms / As it may hap sometime that some
of low degree may be of good aduys and of good counseyll / For why / god
Imparteth his gifts of grace where he will And it is writon that the valyunt
conquerours that be past and goon departed largely their conquestes and proyes
to their men of arms / And for them self it suffysed to have only the
honor of the bataylles / and therefore they did with their folk what they
would / And that drawing words are good / vegece says / that the good
tysynge and the admonestyng of the worthy duc euerraceth in an oost hardynes /
courage and virtue / And therefore in onys face trobleth his sight full sore /
And likewise does the wind that fylleth them with fond / And also the shoot
of an arowe borne with the help of the wind a lights more sore and bears a
gretter strength / And also mynussheth and takes away the force of the shot
of the countrary part / And it is here to know that by two maneres of wyles
over came the Rommayns in bataylle them of Sycambre / that was by enuahysshyng
of such an art that their enemies had the son to fore them / And that
other was / by soubdayn coming upon them so that no layfer they had to put
hem self in ordinance /

Here deuiseth shortly the manner after the use of the time present to renge an
ost in a field for to befyght his enemies Capytulo / xxiij /
WHere vegece puts many maneres of ways for to renge an oost in bataylle /
as it shall be said herafter the which in some maneres may be dyfferentes to
the regard of the ordynaunces of the time present / The cause perauenture is
by cause that the folk comynly in tho days faughten more on horsbacke than a
foot / And also where no thing there nys in the ordres of humayn deeds / But
that it is by long process of time changed and turned / me semyth good to
touch shortly somewhat in most entendyble terms of the common ordynaunces of
the time present / as enough it is known of them that faytes of arms
excersycen / That is to wit to make his auauntgarde of a long train of men
of arms al clos together and renged full smothely that the one pass not that
other the best and the most chosyn in the first front and the maresshalles
with them by their baneres and standartes / and at the formest sides are made
wings in which ben all maneres of shoters renged and in good arraye / asswel
gonners / as balesters / and archers After the first bataylle that men call
the Forward comes the great bataylle where as all the great flote and rowte
of men of arms is put al arrenged in a fair order by their capytaynes that
have among hem their banneres and signs al up / which are by diverse rows
one after a another full smothly renged and not steppyng out of place / For the
Connestable does a cry to be made that noon upon pain of death shall dysrowme
him self / And some say that if any quantyte of commons be there men ought to
fortyfye with such manner of men the wingys of both sides by fair rows well
ordered at the bak side of the shot / the which commons shall be taken and com /
mytted unto good capytaynes / and in like wise they shall be renged before the
great bataylle / so that if they would flee they might be kept in still by the
men of arms that be behind hem / In the mids of this great bataylle is
put the prince of the oost and the pryncypall bannere borne before him to the
which is the byholdynge of the bataylle / wherefore it is taken to hold hit up
to one of the best and pryncypall of the said oost / and a boute hit ben of the
best and most approved men of arms / as well for the suretee of the prince as
of the same / After following this great bataylle comes the third that men
call the ryeregarde the which is ordained for comfort And help them that
be a fore / that semblably are put in arraye by a fair order / And behind
this bataylle ben fayrely put the yomen on horsbacke that helpen their
masters if need be and holden and maken an obstakell that on the baksyde of the
bataylle they be not enuahysshed / Of the which thing if there be enough of
men of arms and that they be in a doubt les that the enemies will com at that
side / thoo that surely will fight and that been wise in fayttes of arms / maken
another bataylle that tourneth the bak towardys the other bataylles a foresaid
/ all ready appareylled for to receive them that would comme / And with thees
said things commonly are ordained a quantyte of men of arms expert of the
craft / and well mounted upon good coursers which ben full ready on the side
for to com and break with courses of horses thordynaunce of the enemies as
they shall be renged and assembled together / And therefore the bataylle is often
time won by them that best can shyfte and deal wythall / And where this
manner of rengyng of an oost is most couenable / yet some that been expert in
arms do counseylle / that when men have no great quantyte of commons but have
for the moo part all men of arms / that all the holl assemble be put
together only in one bataylle without noon other forward nor arryeregarde but
only the wings of the front of the bataylle as it is said a fore / and sayen
that more surely they fight so / And this manner was kept at the bataylle of
rosebeke where as the king of France Charles the sixth of that name had the
vyctorye against / xl / thousend Flemyngys / and semblably it was done but
awhyle a goon at the bataylle of Lyege where as Johan duc of bourgoyne that son
was to phylyppe the son of the king of France with a small quantyte of his
men was vyctoryous against / xxxvj / thousand Lygeoys /

Deuyseth yet the manner of rengynge of bataylles / Capitulo / xxiiij /
How be it that it is said here by fore and after of the manners of fighting
and of rengynge of an oost / sayen thauncyent that of this matyere have spoken
that the best manyere to give a bataylle is in roundnes and that men put many
bataylles in the fore front / and at that side that they know their enemies
shall come they shall keep hem self by good ordinance well nyghe clos together /
and with pain shall they mow be overcome nor desconfyted though that their
enemies be moo than they ^ And if it fall so that the adversaries be of less
folk / the bataylle ought to be then ordered and made in manner of a horse shoo
/ and thus says he thou shall stop hem about if thou goo to hit wisely /
And if the other be foyson of folk ordeyne ye the bataylle as with a sharp
end before for to perse forth / But late the capytayne be well aduysed says
vegece / that at that same owre that the bataylle shall assemble he change not
this manner of order nor led not bear nor there no nombre of people ont of
their ordinance / For that were for to destroy all / and should put trouble
in his bataylles / Nor nothing profyteth more in a bataylle says he / than to
keep the order that ought there to be kept with the interualle or dystance
that ought for to be betwix every row / For men ought to see by great cure
that they ouerpresse not each other / and that they also large not another ye
one from that other but shall keep themself in couenable order togider / For
they yt were to nyghe each other should lose their strokys and their fyghtyng
for lack of more rowme and space and that one should so let that other / Also
they that were over large ordered should give to their enemies an entree
thrughe them self / And so were they in parell to be broken and sparpeylled a
broad / Whereof the fere that they should have to see their enemies so comen
wythyn them / should yield hem as dysperate and lost / Yet says vegece / that
by fair order ought to make an issue in to the field where as the capytayne by
diverse times shall have put hem in ordinance for to show unto theyme / how
that they ought to maynten and be have hem self when the bataylle shall come in
hand / the first bataylle so ordered as it ought for to be / and the second
bataylle after and the other so that the ordinance be in every point kept as
it is said by fore / And some capytayne says he has had a manyere to turn
their bataylle in a square and syn in a manner of a tryangle that men called
at that bersuell / And this manner of ordinance has proffyted much in
bataylle / And when any great strength of enemies did comme upon hem / they
put hem self in a round and the best to the formest row and so kept theyrs
that they turned not for to flee and that they were not over charged with to
great a dommayge / And a manyere had the ancient that they put never al
their folk in one assemblee / but made many bataylles / to the end they that
were fresshe should comme for to socoure and help them that were weary / And
bythys way with pain they might be dysconfyted all for that which one
bataille lost / that other bataille recoured hit again Nevertheless al deeds of
bataylle ben done at alaventure / wherefore noon ought to trust thereto in hope
to have the bettre of hit by cause that often times it falls al contrary to
that / which men thought a fore / Example hereof / For who should ever have
trowed that that of the ^yght great oostes and great assemblees of men of the
Cartagyens / and of the rommayns that werred each other / should the slawghter
and occysyon be so equal in a bataylle / that ones be fell between hem / For
there abode not one man a lyve of neythre of both parties / Item he says /
that that day that the bataylle must be It is couenable for men for to ete
lytyl to the end they have a longer breath and that they may be the more light
and more moeuable / But some good wine ought men to drink who that may / by
cause that the wine moevyth the spyrytes and the strengthes of man so that it
be mesurably taken / And it happeth of times says he that almost all the
corages of men are troubled in hem self when they shall goo to the bataylle /
but to them that be first chaffed and angry is the force and hardynes encreced
wythyn hem / and do forgete al parell / And therefore the wise capytayne for to
give a cause unto hyemen to be more fyers and hardy / ought for to have had
them first at a scarmysshe against the adversaries to the end that for the
strokys and sorys that they have received of them they may be in anger and
chaffed upon them And yet he says that the less wise and the less bold are
wont for to give up the escr^e by fore that the bataylle be bygonne Which
thing ought not for to be do / But the calling and the scry ought to be with
the first strookys / The ancient had a respect in thassemblyng of their
bataylles that the men of arms were not made a ferde in bataylle by the scrye
and alarm that the landysshe people or commons maken some time / And therefore
they instructed and aduysed them thereof by certain sown of a trompette / Also
thoo that be not excersyced in arms nor learned Redoubten sore the bataylle /
And therefore the book says / that such men ought to be occupied in other
things than in fayttys of werre / For thoos that never saw no man kylde nor
no shedyng of blood they are a ferde to see hit / And for this cause when
they ben at hit / their thought is more to flee / than to fight / and thus
they may let more / than do any auayll at lest if they be not put under
the Rule of some good captains / Some say that they ought to be put by fore
all the other to gyder / And some sayen nay / but ought to be meddled emonge the
good / Yet again / for to speak shortly by recapytulacyon of that that is
couenable to be kept in the ordinance of bataylles after the teghyng of the
noble ancient / there ben seven things whereupon the good capytayne ought to
take keep unto / The first is that he have take first the aduauntayge of the
place if he may as it is said a fore where as he shall have set his people in
fair ordinance / The second / that they be at the one side of them shelded
or paueysed with hills that naught may let them / or ellis with the sea or
with a ryuere or some other thing that shall let that noon enemies shall
conne come upon them of that side / The third / that they have another son
nor wind that can combre their fight with pouldre or glysteryng / The fourth
yt much couenable is to them that they shall know if they can the astate of
their enemies / What nombre of people they have which way they comme and in
which array / And what order they keep / For after the knowledge of the same
they may ordeyne and set hem self to the best for to abide and to receive
them / The fyfthe / that they be not mated nor traueylled nor made the more
feeble for honger / The syxth that they must be al of one courage and purpos for
to keep the place / and to be wyllyng rather to dey than for to flee away /
And thus such men shall not be brought lightly unto no manner of dysconfyture
/ And the seventh is that their enemies know not what their entencyon and
purpoos is / nor what they think for to do / nor what course they will take /
Nevertheless after that / that it is said a boue the falls and the adventures
of the bataylles ben wondrefull and merueyllous / For hit happeth at such a
time as god will help that one party and naught that other / As it did fall
that time when the rommayns fought some time with the two mighty kings of
Oryent Iugurta and Boctyus / For at that time as the hete of the son was so
brennynge boot and so fervent that almost hit smoldred the rommayns / suddenly
rose up awynde so mighty and so great that the archers shot / of which thees
two kings had foyson / had as almost no virtue / and syn came a rain that
refresshed all the rommayns which thing was contrary to ye other by cause hit
slaked the cords of their bows / and their elephantes whereof a great plente
was there which is a best that can not well suffer wet nor watre a boute hem /
might uneath moeue hem self and ye girdell that held up the castle upon
their backs were also slaked and the castelles charged with water that sore
combred them / And by this manner of way the Rommayns that al ready had
recoured their strength by the refresshyng of the rain / did envaysshe so
vygourously their enemies / that how be it that they were much less in
quantyte of people yet they obtained and had the victory /

Deuyseth after vegece of vij maneres of arrengyng of an oost and of fyghtyng
Capitulo / xxvo^
Yet after vegece in his third book in the eight and twenti chapter there ben
/ vij / maneres of ways how an oost shall fight in a field and vij maneres of
ordynaunces of bataylles / the which ways and manner how be it he gives hem
derkly enough for to be vndrestanden / but only of such that been excersyced
in thoffyce and maystrye of arms they ben declared here as follows / The
first manner of rengynge of folk in a field is that which is to be made with
a long fore front as men do now / but this manner of way as it is said is
not right good / by cause that the space of the grownde must be long and that
the oost be al stratched in length / and hit happeth not always that the
place of the field is found propyce nor mete so for to do / And when there
ben dyches or dales or some evil paths the bataylle is lightly broken by the
same / And with this thaduersaryes if they be any great nombre of folk they
shall goo to the right side or to the left side and so they shall enuyrone and
close the bataylle a boute whereby many a great parell may be fall / as
thauctour shows that says that if cas be that thou have more foison of
people than thin enemy has / take of the best of thy folk and enuyrone thyn
adversaries if thou may within the bosom of thyn ooste / Te secunde manner is
best for if thou ordeyne by the same a few of thy folk most valyaunte and
well assayed in some place covenable thou shall mow have lightly the victory /
though thyn enemy has more people / of the which manner the way of
fighting / is such / that when the bataylles comen for to assemble togider /
thou shall change then thy lift wynge from her place in to another to
the end that thou may see far unto the right cornere of thyn enemy / and
thy right wynge thou shall Join with the left wynge of thyn aduesaryes / and
there by the best men of thyn ost thou shall begin the bataylle sharply and
strong / And by great strength both an horsbake and on foot / the said lift
wynge of thyn enemies shall be assaylled of thy men that shall goo a boute
shouynge and rennyng upon till that they comme at the back of thyn enemies /
And if thou may ones depart a sounder thyn enemies that been so coming upon
thy folk without doubt thou shall obtain the vyctorye / And that one part
of thyn ost that thou shall have withdrawn from the other shall be sure / This
manyere of bataylle is ordained after the lykenes of this lettre / A / And if
thyn enemies ordeyne their bataylle after this manner of way and make issue
first out / then shall thou put thy men in a long row that shall march
forth all of a front with thy wings all in a good ordinance at the lift
corner of thine oost and by this manner of way thou shall wythstande thyn
enemies / The third maniere is like unto the second and no dyfference is
there between / But that thou must set first with the left corner of thy
bataylle upon the Right corner of thyn enemies And if thy left wynge is
bettre than thy right wynge / than shall thou put with hit some right strong
and best fyghting men both on horsbake and on foot and see that thou first of
all when it comes to assemble togider hand to hand / that thy lift / wynge
be Joined and set upon the right wynge of thin enemies / and as much as thou
caust / put from the a back ye right hand of thyn adversaries / and make
haste for to enuyrone them / And that other part of thyn oost which thou
know not so strong / dysseuere them as much as thou caust from that other
contrary wynge / so that sperys nor darts may not light upon them / And thou
must take keep that thyn enemies make not a plowmpe of their folk to enter
and break thy bataylle in trauers / In this manner then men fyghten
profytably / and in special if the fall happeth that the left corner of thyn
enemy be of less strength than is the thine / The fourth manner of fightyng
in a field is such when thou shall have ordained thy bataylles with four or
five hundred fyghtyng men / or ever thou make any approach upon thin enemies
thou shall so suddenly do moeue thin oost secretly with both thy wings in a
good ordinance / that from both the corners of thyn enemies as naught
purueyed shall be constrained for to turn their backis and flee away / and
if swyftly thou caust do so thou shall have victory / But this maniere / al be
it so that thou have men right strong and well excersiced in arms / I hold
hit peryllouse / For if the half of thy bataylle is constrained to desseuere
and depart thyn oost in two parties / and that thyn enemies be not overcome at
the first coming on they shall have occasion to assaylle thy men of arms that
thus ben divided / The fyfthe manner of fyghtyng is like unto the fourth but so
much more it is / that ye archers and they that been lightly armed shall be
ordained by fore the first bataylle / to the end that they be not broken out of
ordinance / And shall also assaylle and enuaysshe with the right cornere of his
bataylle / the left cornere of his enemy / and with the lift the right / And
if thou may do so / thou shall soon overcome them / But the myddell bataylle
is not in peril by cause it is deffe^ded by them that been lightly armed and by
the archers / The sixth manner of fighting is right good and almost like unto
the second / And with the same are wont the good fyghters to help semself in
hope of vyctorye how well that they be but a few folk for to ordeyne well
their bataylles / The bataylle of the enemies then al renged in a row /
thou shall Join thy right cornere to their lift / and there thou shall
begin the bataylle with the best men that thou have on horsbacke and a foot /
And that other part of the ost shall follow of far the bataylle of thyn
enemy / the which part shall be spread all straight / and if thou can come
to the lift wynge of thyn enemies they must needs turn their backys / and
thaduersary may not be socoured of his right wynge nor with his myddle battle
he can not help the other / For the taylle of the ooste is exceded unto the
lyknes of the most long lettre / L / and fro far hit departs from his
enemy /

Of the same Capitulo / xxvj /
THe seueth manner of fyghtyng is when the rowme and the place is propyce for
him that first takes the feld that is to wit if thou have a place where as at
the one side of hit thyn enemies can not come / as it is said for cause of the sea / or of flodes or of montaygnes / mares ground or other letti^gis how be
it that thou have good men and well renged in bataille by good ordinance / And
at that side of the place where as noon such lettyng is / thou shall put thy
men on horsbacke / and then fight surely if thou be assaylled / For by the
said lettyngis thou art kept sauf of that one part and like wise of that
other part by the stre^gthe of them that be on horsbacke / And it is to be
take heed unto / what side that thou wylt fight / that thou put first the
most valiant men / And for any little quantyte of people that thou have be not
dysmayed therefore / For vyctorye has well acostumed to be had of few fyghters
/ so that the wise duc ordeyne them there as proffyte and rayson requires and
it is to wite that namely the same time they help hem self in their bataylles
by diverse maneres of engyns and wyles for to break the bataylles / at it is
said here before / as of oxen that had the fire set under their taylles that
were chassed towardis the party adverse / And namely also they used at that
time with semblable engyns as ben thoo that now be called Rybawdekyns / For
even thus were they set upon awhele and a man withyn as withyn a lytyl
castle that was made al of iron / and shot with a gonne or with arbalaster /
And had at every side of him an archer / and sharp yrons were dressed to the
foresyde of the same engyn / as hit had been sperys / And with the strength of
men or of horses made many of such engyns to enter al attones wythyn the
bataille of the enemies /

The order and the manner that the capytayne ought to keep when good Fortune is
for him Capitulo / xxviij
SOme that know not well the tournes of arms wene for to help hem self in a
bataylle with closing of their enemies withyn a certain compace of a place /
or by enuyronnyng of hem round a boute with multitude of folk so that they
can not issue out by no way / but this does much to be doubted For hardynes
grows wythyn the hertes of thoos that been so enclosed a boute / by cause that
the more that they think hem self but as for ded or ouercomen having no hope
to come nor escape out they wol selle full dear her own flesh / or they be
take And therefore was the sentence of Scypyon preysed that said / that men
ought to make away to the enemies where thrughe they may flee / and to put
abusshement where as they shall pass fore by / For when they ben so sore
ouerpressed and see away where they may go out if they will / they wol soon
take hit and put hem self to flight trowyng to be sauffe thereby and then
they may be bettre thus slain / than in deffensing of them self / And many
cast fro them their armures and harnoys for to flee more lightly / and thus
they ben slain as bestes by them that chasse them / And the more great
multitude that they be / the greter is their confusyon / For no no^bre ought
to be set by there as the corages ben for fere dyscomfyted al ready / The wise
men of arms sayen that when a good fortune comes to that one of the two
parties so that she ouercometh that other party in bataylle / men ought for to
pursyewe still his good fortune al unto the end while that she endures and
that the enemies ben assaylled / and not to be over joyful nor so proud for
so^ what of victory that is had at the beginning / that men leave all wenyng
to recouere hit of light again / as many have found them self deceived thereby
that never syn conde hap to have hit / for a wittenes whereof may be taken
hanibal the which if he had goon after the bataylle of Cannes straight to rome
he had taken hit without gaynsayng of any man / For the romans were so
affrayed and so full of sorrow for their great loss that to gaynsaye at that
owre they durst not / but he that wend to return there at his pleasure when
it should please him / and that waited but only to dyspoylle the country a
boute from al manner of riches cowde never sith com thereto how well that he
forced him self with al his powere so to do /

Here shows another manner of way that the chyef capytayne ought to keep
when that the fortune of the bataylle is against him / Capitulo / xxvijo^ /
NOw is there another point / that is to wit / if one part of the oost
ouercometh / and that other part flees / that part that keeps and abides
steadfastly / may trust to have the vyctory / For diverse tymys it has be
known that they that men held under have gotten the field at ye last /
Therefore ought such pepl^e to reyse hemself by calling of mouths and by
sown of trompettes whereby they may moeue and bring the enemies in to affere
in comfortyng of hemself / as though they were vyctoryouse in every part of
their oste / And if it happeth that the myscheffe be thrughe al thyn oste /
nevertheless thou ought to seek a remedy theru^to / for fortune sometime has
recovered to their above many one that fled away / And the wise men of arms
sayen that in fayttes of a plain bataylle the capytayne ought to be purueyed
and aduysed how he shall gadre again to gyder his folk / as the good pastor
does his sheep / for how be it that they al begi^ne to flee and run away he
ought to be awaytyng with all his power for to save them that be so over come
and to withdraw hem about him in to some cornere of a way / or upon a hille if
any be nyhe him / or in to some other sure place / and if he may thus gadre
togider again some qua^tyte of valiant men in good ordinance of array they shall
mow grieve full fore their enemies / for commonly it falls that they that
pursyeue the chasse folysshly and that be out of ordinance here and there /
ben soon put to flight if their adversaries work wisely / And thus are
slain they that chassed first / and no gretter confusyon may come a monge hem
/ then when their pride and fyersnes is so changed and turned in to a
dread / And therefore what someuere adventure that falls men ought to
recomforte and redress by couenable exortacyons them that overcome / and to
bring hem togider again / and to garnysshe the rowmes again with new men and
harnoys if men can / And a souldayne help beh^^^th then to be thought upon
the soudbdayne adventure that come / That is to see how a watch shall be so
set that the enemies that have followed them may be recontred in some place /
And thus by the good capytayne shall the fere of them that re^ne away be
turned in to boldness for to wythstande and pursiewe if need be / Wherefore the
good capytayne ought neuere to dyspeyre him self of what soeuere a fortune that
comes to him if he be wise / For oftymes it falls that thurghe a good hope
of propyce fortune / they that trow to have wonnen all / arreyse hem self in
to arrogaunce Whereby not so wisely as they should do they set upon their
enemies the which that be well aduysed receive them with great courage and
beteth hem / And by this ought the good capytayne to see upon all such falls
that mow happen ^ by cause it has happed full often as it is said that they
that were over come and chassed / had soon after the vyctorye upon their
enemies / And to know that it is so / the fall of the rommayns shows hit al
enough / whenne they were dyscomfyted at the bataylle of Cannes / whereby they
at / as dysperate that they should never more be of power to recouere any good
hap or propyce fortune / would for sake their own cite / and chese in to some
other parties their place of habytacyon / But one of their princes that right
wise was and valyau^t kept hem here fro saying that he should fight against hem
if cas were that they went / And thus he put hem in hope of a bettre fortune
/ and assembled them again al togider And of gadred folk he made many knights
/ and with such a power as he might have he went and assaylled hanybal that
neuere had thought that he should have done so / and thus took him unpurveyed
/ and was at that owre so entyerly dyscomfyted that he neuere sith cowde have
vyctorye upon the rommayns /

Here follows a short recapytulacyon of some things that been said a fore /
Capitulo / xxix
TO recapytule shortly almost all the substance of that which vegece will say
in his book where as by epylogacyon in manner of prouerbys at the end of hit
he says thus / Thou that will have worship in arms / do that the lore of
yougthe lerneth the to be a maystre of the tournes and fayctes of knyghthode in
thy parfyt age / For a more fair thing it is to say I can this and that / that
to say ha a why have I not learned / do euere after thy powere all that may
let thyn enemy / and that may be profitable for the For from that time that
thou cease to grieve him / thou hurtest and let thy self / do so that
thou know the knights or euere thou led hem to the field / For much bettre
it is to doubt his enemy keeping him self upon his ward surely / than to
trust upon folk that men know not in a field / and a great surete it is for
to call his enemies that be run away who that may for they may hurt more
sore the adversaries / than they that be slain / And the capytayne with peine
is overcome / that with the his and with his adversary may help him self / And
bettre it is to keep a side al enough and aid beside the bataylle y renged /
than to make an over bygge bataylle having no socoure be side it / for they
that be weary may be helped by them that comen freshly upon to socoure them /
and more helps virtue / than multitude / And often is a rowme bettre than his
strength in a field / A man proffyteth by labor / and by ydlenes he wastes /
Late no knight be had nor l^ed to a bataylle but that hystrust be to have the
vyctorye for if he mystrusteth in his courage / he is as half overcome / And
the things that suddenly be done fere full sore the enemies / Who that
follows the chasse upon his enemy unwisely he puts his enemy in a hope to
have that vyctorye that he himself had had first Who that appareylleth not the
bataylle in an oost he is overcome without stroke / To keep order in a field as
right would / gives victory both to the strong and to the feeble / when thou
know that the sides of thyn enemies are hydyng hem self a bout thyn ost /
make thy folk to withdraw within their lodgis / if thou have any supecyon
that thy counseyl be showed unto the enemies / change thine ordynauce / No
counseylles ben so good / as they whereof the enemies have no knowlage of unto
the time that they be brought awerke / Adventure gives often vyctory more than
does force / Impossyble it is to Judge to the certain the end of the bataylle
of which fortune dysposeth ^ All that is contrary to thin entencyon thou ought
treatte and show among many one / But thy propos thou ought to say or show
unto few folk / withdraw towardys the / the hertes of strangers by yeftes
and by promesses / and chastyse thyn own folk through thretnyngys / By cause
that good capytaynes redoubtyng the fortune of bataylle are both to fight with
an oost assembled together / Great wisdom it is to constrayne his enemy more
by honger than by iron /

Here follows the second party of this present book which speaks first of
the cawtelles and wyles of arms Whereof the first chapter speaks of Scipyon
IN this second party that we have devised after vegece pryncypally the
manieres that sometime held the noble and valiant conquerours of the world in
fayttes of arms during the time of their great conquestes / by cause that
they cowde well help hemself with moo than of one manner of werreyng / it
seems me good to the end that our matyere may be yet more increased and
multyplyed always to the proffyte of them that pursyewen cheualrye / that we
add unto this matyere the ways and the manyeres of the cawtelles /
subtylitees / and wyles that the said ancient conquerours vttred and held in
their dedys of werre ^ which subtilites and wylis are called by the auctours
that have thereof spoken Stratagemes of arms / of the which Stratagemes made a
book a valiant man that men cle^ped Froncyus in which book he deuyseth and
shows the propre deeds of the foresaid right noble and worthy conquerours /
the which to here may be of good exsample to them that find them self in
such a cas after the dyuersyte^ of the auentures of arms / out of which book
we have ex^stracted to our proffyte some tytles / Thus then says first the
said Auctour Froncyus that the worthy conqueror prince and head capytayne of
the great oost of the romans Scypyon the Affrycan that all hyspayne / Affrike
^ and Cartayge did conquerre by the sword / ones emonge other as he was with
a great oost upon the feldes against the king Syphax that semblably was coming
against him with a great oost of folk / did send toward the said king as by
manner of ambaxade one of his knights named lelius with the which he committed
to goo some of his most wise captains in arms in manner of yome^ or as they
had be litel servants to the end that by all ways they should see and advise
well both the order and the manyere and the quantyte of the said king syphaxs
oost / which capytaynes as they were come there endeuoyred them self so well y^
naught they forgate but they took good head unto and for to ouersee bettre all
the oost they feyntly let for the nones goo loos one of their horses as he
had escaped and broken loos from them whereby they following after all a boute
saw plainly all that was in the same oost and as wise and right connyng in
such a cas marked al things full well / Wherefore after their return and
their report made unto their duke Scypyon that by their saying knew that
great plente of stuble and of read was in the said kyngys oost / fond aweye
that fire was put by night thereunto in many places And this done as the
enemies were besy and awayted for to socoure their lodgys from the fire / he
ran upon them in a good ordinance / And by this way full subtylly
dyscomfyted them vttyrly the said duke Scipyon /

Of the duke Maryus and of Xertoryus of dynlyus and of perycles / Capytulo / ij
/
MAryus right cheualrouse duke of the oost of the rommayns when he was set
for to fight against a folk full fyers and proud that men named Tymbres or
otherwise called Thewtoniquys / had in his oost many souldyours out of Gallya /
And to this propos for to ensyewe the techi^g of the wise that says prove the
man or ye trust him much / he would prove the truth and obeyssa^ce of the
said souldyours of france / his lettres he sent to them where as emo^ge other
things deffe^ded and charged them straightly that they should not open afewe
lettres which were chosed within the great lr^es that he sent to them unto a
certain day that was named therynne / but or euere the day was come he sent
again for them and for thoo that were open / And where the said souldyours
had trespassed his commandment he knew that they were not trwe to him /
wherefore he trusted them never after in no great thing / Ite^ a worthy
knight named xertornis conductour of a great ost came in to hyspaine where he
had a ryuere to pass ouere / and where his enemies followed him fast nyghe for
to run upon him at an narowe passage where he and his oost should pass ouere
/ he aduysed him self of a cawtele / he did tarry still upon the bank of the
watre and made his lodgis to be made there in manner of half a cercle as in a
compass somewhat far fro the river and was al made of bows and of wode and
syn made hit to be set all on fire / and while hit brenned thus he passed and
his oost over the watre surely mawgre all his enemies that might not come to
him but they must come thrughe the fire / Item dynlyus a duke of the romans
oost / where as he ones to boldly had auaunced him self in to the haven of ye
cite of Cyracuse where his enemies were that for to close him therynne did
heue up the chain / but when he saw this well and fair he cheuysed therewith /
for the prowere which is the foremest party of the ship he made to be
turned toward the chain side / and the pouppe which is the hindermost party
of the ship was toward the side of the land and then soon he made his men
to draw them self all to the pouppe / and thus was the formest party of the
ship light so that hit heued up a boue and with strength of orys made a
great part of the ship to leave upon the chain / and then he made his men
to goo again to the formest party of the ship / And then was the hynderm^st
party of the ship heued up / And thus with force of orys the ship passed
over the chain / And by this way he escaped fro that parell / Item perycles
sometime duke of Athenes was ones by them of the cite of Pelopenes that chassed
him / driven in to a place that was closed with high and horrible montaynes
and were but two yssues / and when he saw this / he did do make soon at the
one of the yssues a great and a deep diche as though he did so to the end his
enemies should not enter upon him at that side ^ and at that other part he
led his men as though he would awayte to issue out there / And when the
enemies saw this by cause that they trowed not / that he would nor might have
goo over the dyche away / they set hemself for to have deffended that other
issue like as they would have besieged him therynne / but perycles that
malycyously did so made soon good brygges that he had do make to be set
over the dyche / And by this manner he went his way without knowledge of his
enemies

Of them of the cite of Boyaux of hanybal and of Denis the Tyrant / Capitulo /
iij /
IN the time of the conquestes of rome it happed ones that the oost of the
romans should pass by the forest that is called Latyne for to goo upon the
cite of Boyaux And when the dwellers were aware of hit they went soon in to
the said forest and did saw al tho trees by the way there as they should
pass by / so that a little thing would have brought hem down / and after they
had thus done they hided hem self within the thykke busshes of the forest / And
when the said oost was entered therynne / they that were hid lepte fourth /
And did shoue the trees that thus were sawed upon the oost of the Rommayns so
that a Right great part of them were there by feld adoune and slain / And by all thus they were delyured quyt and free fro the said oost / And semblably this
was another time done / Item Hanybal prince and emperor of Cartayge and of
Affryke was always wont to lead many elephauntes with him in bataille / It
happed him ones that he must pass ouere a great watre and there was no way to
pass his elephantes / but he aduysed him self of a subtylyte / He had in his
company a man emonge other that could swyme right well and was full of courage
bold and hardy / to him he commanded that he should make angry one of the most
cruel elephantes that he had there / and when the man had done his
commandment and had hurted sore the elephante / he right soon plonged him
self in to the watre / And then the great best full of ire and cruel
followed the man withyn the watre for to be avenged / and in like wise all the
other elephantes entered in to the ryuere after him / and in this manner the
said Hanybal made hem all to pass over the watre / Item Denis the tyraunte
prince of Cyracuse in Cecylle knew that they of Cartage would com in to
Cecylle with a right great oost against him / So did he right well garnysshe the
towns and castelles where they should pass by / And gaffe commandment by his
ordinance that when the enemies were comme nyghe / that his garnysons should
issue out of the castelles and towns as though they were a ferde and that
they should come to hyme at Cyracuse / And then the Cartagyens that trowed
to have gotten all the country took and seized all the said fortresses and
towns and garnisshed them with their own people / and of so much was their
oost made less / And the oost of Denis encreaced / which delivered them
bataylle soon after where they were overcome and the other cartagiens that
kept the said towns and castelles were famysshed /

Of them of hyspayne / of Alexandrie / of Pirre / of Lapcenes / of hanybal /
and of other Capitulo / iiij /
UPon a time the spaynardes should have fought against Amulcar ye leder was of
the oost of Cartage where much folk were in a good ordinance / They be
thought hem self of a wyle for to break ye bataylle of their enemies they
took many oxen that drew the plonghe / and enoyncted with oil and brymestone
a staff that was put under their taylle / and was all covered with towe of
flax that well embybed were with oil / and this oxen they did put at the
forefront of their bataylle when they should assemble with their enemies /
And when the fire was set in to the said towe they chassed and droof hem
fourth against the Cartagyens / the which oxen as full of a Rage entered and
brake al their bataylles / and so was the said Amulcar dyscomfyted / Item
Alexaundre prince of Pirre / had werre against a folk that men callid Illyriens
that bare habytes and gowns dyfferent from al other garments / The said
alexaundre took with him a great quantyte of his men and clothed and rayde them
after ye maniere of the Illyriens / And thus arrayed commanded them that when
the Illyryens were so nyghe that they could see hem / they should take upon hem
self for to brenne their own corns that grew upon the feldes and that they
should make hem self as besy as they would dystroye and waste all / Of the
which thing / the said commandment accomplysshed / the enemies that saw
the same / trowed that they had be of their folk / and followed them that so
went fourth destroyng al things before hem / unto ye time that they came in to
a narowe way where as Alexaunder had put a busshement / and there the
illiryens for the most party were taken and slain / Item in like wise did
Laptenes prince of Syracuse to them of the cite of Cartage that upon him were
come to bataylle / For he made his own men to set on a fire certain of his
own towns and castelles / whereby the Cartagyens that wend that it had be of
their folk that thus wasted all / would run thider anoone / but Laptenes
had set awayte for them by the way where they must pass / and thus they
were al slain / Item Hanybal the good werryer duke of cartage of whom I have
spoke before / should ones goo upon them of Affrycke that were rebel / and he
knew well that folk was sore set upon this wine / So made he then to take
thereof a great quantyte and me^gled hit with certain herb that is called
mandglorye which makes folk to be soon drunk and slepy / And after al for
the nonys made a lityl bataylle of his people to be ready to whom he commanded
that they should run away as though they were aferde when the enemies should
come nyghe hem / And when the other that trowed to have wonnen all were come
nyghe / Hanybal with his folk making as he durst not abide hem left his
lodgis al alone that was full of goods and of this meddled wine and departed
about nydnyght / and on the morn when the enemies saw there no body they
came to the lodgis with great Joy and dyspoilled hit about / and as folk that
deed was for honger ete glotonsly of the sweet metes and drank of the wynes
evyl appareylled for them / For they all were made heavy a sleep and so drunk
thereby that they lay still as ded men / Then came again hanybal when him list
and al them he did put to the sword / Item thoos that fought against a folk
that men called Heryteos took the sword of their enemies and made hem to
confess and tell there couuyne and their propos / and after took their
rayme^tes fro them and reuested their own folk with the same and made hem to
ce^me up upon a high hille that they might be seen of the ost / And because
the enemies had comau^ded to the said espyes that after that which they should
find they should make hem a sign / and they that were upon the montayne made
a sign that they should come more nyghe / and they did so by cause they
wend that hit had be their espies in so much that they entered in to the
busshementes of their enemies / where as they were al slain /

Of Menoles king of the rodes / of Scypion / of Xertoryus / of Hanibal / of
Lentulus / of Acoriolo / and of Fuluyus nobilius Capitulo / v /
MEnoles king of the rodes was at an oost against his enemies and had more
and of bettre men on horsbacke than his adversaries / which kept the montaynes
to the^de that menoles might not lightly befyght them / So aduysed Menoles a
cawtele for to make them to come down / he took a knight of his wise and hardy
/ and him charged that he should behave him self as one that was fled from his
oost and that was evil content with him and of his wages and that he should goo
to that other party / And he did as he was charged / And with other euylles
and harms that he showed to hem of menoles / he made them to believe yt
through his evil ordinance was a great dyscencyon in his oost / and that for
the same cause many one departed from him / and to the end that they should
believe bettre thees things Menoles did depart / diverse of his folk so that
they that were upon the hills might see hem goo away / but he made them to be
leyed in to diverse busshementes here and there / And by this manner of deceyte
thoo that were upon the montaynes came down when they see the ost of Menoles so
lessed that they thought to be able for them / but right soon they were
enuyroned all about with the horsemen that killed and slew them euerychone /
Item when scipion should ones goo against the spaynardes with a great armee /
the king syphax sent him certain messangers that showed him great threttnynges
and words of great feere / as well of the hardness of the land / as of the folk
of the same and of their quantyte and strength / of the which thing not sore
affrayed was the valiant man scypion but to the^de that this^ ambassadors
should not sprede such words a broad emonge his folk whereby they might be
affrayed for he sent them full soon again and made words to be noysed about
that the said king had sent him word as to his friend that he should soon go
to him / Item xertorius fought ones in a bataylle / where one came and told
him that his constable was slain / but to the end that his folk semblably
should not know of hit whereby they should be a ferde / he slew with a spear
that he held the messanger / Item in the time that hanybal descended in to
ytalye for to goo upon rome / three thousand carpenters that he led with him
fled from his ost upon a night / and when he knew it / because his folk
should not be put in no feere nor abassed therefore / He made words to be
cast through ^ut his oost that they were so goon by his commandment / and
for to give credence and feyth to thees words he sent yet diverse other away
that he knew should do little good and that were symply armed / Item a time
that Lentulus had assembled a great oost for to be fight his enemies and had
taken in his company a cohorte of macedonyens for to help him / a cohorte is
/ vj / C / lxvj / men / But when he trowed to have been helped of them / they
did advise hem self soon and out of his oost departed and went to that other
party / And when Lentulus that diverse and many tournes of arms knew / saw
this he was not abahysshed / but could well take hem by their own barat / and
also to the^de that his oost should have no feere therefore he made to be
noysed a bout / that for the nonys he had sent hem before for to meddle and
assemble first with the enemies / And for to gyffe a bettre believe to this
thing he departed soon and followed them / whereby it happed al in effette
that where fore he did so / For the adversaries that saw the macedonyens
coming wend that hit had be true / and that they had come against them for
to have the first bataylle / turned toward them and bygan strongly to lanche
upon them and so of force they must make deffence whether they would or not /
And Lentulus was at that other part that in the mean while enuaysshed his
enemies / and by this manner of way he had the said Macedonyens to his help
whether they would or not in so much that he had the vyctorie

Of Acoriolo duke of Dace of Fuluyus nobilius / of Pamynodas / of Fabyus
maximus / of Scypion Affrycan the second / of Xertoryus / and yet of Pomodas
duke of Athenes Capitulo / vjo^ /
THat time that the rommayns were in dyscencyon the one against the other and
during the cyuyle werre / and where diverse natyons had syn the time of their
prosperyte conceived a great envy and dysdayne against them seemed by especyall
to them of dace that the time was come that they might well run upon hem / And
where they had diverse times admonested before this their duke Acor^alo for to
do so which would not be agreeable thereunto / he at he last by cause that
they pressed him so sore / and for to give hem a knowlage by an example did
make diverse dogs to be brought before him in a place before the palace and
were set that one upon that other in so much that they bigan strongly to be
fight each other / But in the most strength of their bataille when it seemed
that they were most angry and fyers that nothing could depart hem / he made
a wolffe of which he was pur^eyed a fore to keep emonges hem and as soon as
the dogs saw him they l^fte the bataille that they had togider emonge hem /
and they al of one acoorde run a noone upon the wolffe / and by this example
showed the said duke to his men / that what soeuere awerre that any nacyon have
emonge each other / they shall not suffer therefore / that a stranger shall
hurt hem / but rather they would make accord togider for to ^e^ne upon him /
Item Fuluyus nobilius head capytayne of the ost of Romans fond him self ones
so nyghe taken by them of Samoys that need and force was to him for to abide
the bataylle / of the which thing by cause that he knew well that his folk
were sore a ferde by cause that their enemies were of more quantyte than they
were / he did advise him self for to take away their feere by this cawte^^e
He said unto his folk and made hit to be cried and publyed thrughe al his oost
/ that he had turned unto him for money the hertes of a hole legyon of the
Samytes / And that they should Join with him when the bataylle should / begin
for to help him / And by cause they should believe bettre this thing he borrowed
of them all the gold and the syluere that they might make / as though hit had
be for to prepare the said folk / A legion of men is in nombre / vj thousand /
vj / C / lxvj / So it happed that for hope of this / the romans took so great
a boldness in their corages / that they enuaysshed hardyly and prondly ran
upon their enemies which they fond al enough dyspurueyed by cause that they
preysed hem so little and setted naught by them for cause that they were so few
folk to the sight of them / and so the romans vaynquissled the Samytes and
gate the field upon hem / Item Pamynodas the worthy duke of Thebes should ones
fight against them of Lacedemonye / So did he see in him self for a subtylyte
whereby the strength and hardynes of courage might grow in his men / He made
hem al to come before him and said thus al ahighe in audyence that he would
advise hem of that that to his knowledge was come for a truth / It was that
the Lacedemonyens had ordained affirmably / that if they had the vyctorye they
should kylle and slay all the men and the women of Thebes / and that they should
dystroye the cite and should take the children in to thraldom perpetuelly /
For this denoncyacyon they of Thebes moeued with great ire and anger did fight
sore as men that set naught by their lives and overcame the Lacedemonyens
that more folk were without comparyson / Item Fabyus maximus should fight ones
against his enemies and was his oost enforced right well with pales and of
strong lodgys wherefore he doubted that his folk should not fight strongely
enough for cause of the places where they had their wythdrawht and refut were
so sure / And therefore he made to be set all a fire or euere he began to
fight / Item when Scypion the second Affrycan conduytte his second oost in
Affryke hit happed him to fall to the ground when he issued out of his ship
/ he soon behilde the contenaunce of his folk and perceived that they took
this fall for an evil token / and that they were al ready as dysconforted
therefore / Then aduysed the right wise werryour in him self of a wise word
for to say whereby he might give surtye to h^is people of their doubt he
byganne to laughe and said boldly / O god be thou preysed here may ye see a
good token For I am sesed al ready of the land of Affrike hit will be mine
without faylle / And thus by this word he turned the evil hope of his folk
in to a good / the which thing happed after as he had said / Item as
xertorius should ones have fought it appiered in his ost a merueyllouse sign /
For the sheldes of his men of arms and the brestis of their horses becam al
covered with blood the which thing was to them occasion of a great fere but
the valiant duk assured them full well / saymge to them with a glad chere
that it was a right good token and that by the same they ought to vndrestande
that they should have the vyctorye For thees parties ben thoo that are and
ought to be comynly blody with the blood of the enemies / Item pamynodas the
wortly duk of Thebes should ones be fight the Lacedemonyens / and where the cas
happed that the bataylle was somewhat dylated / his chaere was brought unto him
for to set a little upon abiding the owre of the bataylle / but percase of
adventure his chaere turned under him and fille done beside / of the which
thing his folk were much abashed and took hit for an evil betoknynge The
said duke then which rose up quyckly saying unto them with a hardy face in
this wise / Now up up lightly my good knights the gods done forbede us the
so^ourne and taryenge / For they have admonested us by this token for to goo
soon to the bataylle / and our shall be the vyctorye /

Here speaks of the Lacedomyens / of Julius Caesar / of Papyrius cursor and of
Pompee / Capitulo / vij /
THat time when the Lacedomyens had werre to they me of the cite of Messynes /
they knew ones by their espyes for certain that the Messynyens were so sore
set in ire upon them that they should bring to the bataylle both their
wives and their children for to have thereby a gretter courage for to obtain or
ellis dye togider / For the which thing the Lacedemonyens with drew them
self and differde the bataylle / Item Caesar had ones so brought his enemies by
taking of water away fro them / that they dyeing for thruste were in dyspeyre
of their lyffe / and as they that be forced with a great rage issued for to
fight with him / but he would not at that owre / but wythdrewe fair his men
away / For him seemed not good that they should fight at that time when
dysperacyon and wrath rewled the courage of the adversaries / Item as Papyrius
Cursor should ones fight against the Samytes and that he knew by his espyes
that the more nombre of folk were his enemies / wherefore his men redoubted to
deal with them / he took soon a certain of his folk that he most trusted
with him / and secretly commanded them to take a great quantyte of bows and of
read / and that they should draw hit after them from a hye hille where both
the ostes might see hem / for to styre and moeue therwithall in to the air the
pouldre and duste of the feldes / and that they should make the grettest noise
that they might with all / and as soon that this was done so and that
Papyryus saw them he bygan to make a scrye with a high voice so that his
folk and eke his enemies herd hit / and semblably made to be cried diverse
times / that hit was his felawe of arms that he had left in to abusshement
which had dyscomfyted a part of his enemues / and that they should do so
much that his felawe hadd not al alone the glory of the victory / And hereof
it happed as he thought for thereby his men were made hardy and bold and lost
all feere / And the Samytes that for the great dust that they saw flee above
the earth wend that it had be a thing of truth / wherefore they turned
their bakkis and fledd away Item pompee was in a doubt that a certain cite
should be more favorable to his enemies / than to him self / and that she gaffe
them aid and socoure by fore the stroke / And therefore he required the
enhabytantes that they would receive withyn hem diverse syke men that might not
follow h^is oost unto his return again for to ease and heel hem self / And
that both gold and syluere and goods enough they should be^re with them
for to reward well them that should receive hem / And when this thing was
granted Pompee made to be put in diverse and many litteres of his best and
most hardy knights bound and bended as though they had be sore wounded and
syke / and in males / and other fardellages he did their harneys to be carried
with them as hit had be their gowns and their hauoyre / For the which
thing when thees knights saw their time ^ay rest they ran upon the commons
and so much they did that they had the maystry of the cite and so kept hit

Of Alexaunder the great / of Caesar Augustus / of Crates of Athenes / Capitulo
/ viij /
When the great alexandre had subdued and overcome the third part of Assie /
by cause he doubted les that they should turn rebel after his departing / he
brought away with h^ym all the kings and princes of the land as though he
would worship them / and principalli such that him seemed were most wroth
and heavy that they were subdued and vaynquysshed / and to the people that he
left there / he constytued and stablysshed certain captains that he chose
out of hem self / And by all thus he gate the love of the princes by mean of
the worship that he showed unto them / and eke also the love of the commons
by cause that he made them to be governed by such of the comynaultee as they
were hem self / And thus if they would be rebel they might not well syn that
they had no captayn / For a people that has learned to be rewled under a head is
naught worth by him self / And for to have them more subgett he did do bylde
diverse castelles nyghe by their towns / but for to pease them of this doing
he garnysshed thees fortresses with their own people / Item when Caesar
augustus had subdued al Germanye and that the Alemayns had yolden hem self to
him he then for to bear a more lordshippe over them he bylded many
fortresses nyghe by their towns / but for to content hem of this thing he
boughte the grownde of them where he set the said fortresses / For the which
deed they held hem self so well content that they had his lordship right
aggreable / Item Crates duke of Athenes was lodged in the feldes and he had but
a few folk but he waited after a great secours thus he doubted les y^ his
enemies y^ in agrete no^bre were assembled should come upon him by cause they
knew him feeble / but by cause he would purueye to this Inconvenient he made to
issue by night a great part of his folk / and commanded them that on the
moro^e they should come again a long the ha^gyng of a montayne making a
great noise so that they might be herd and seen of their enemies that should
trow that it were some new socours / And hit happed even thus for the which
symulacyon he abode sure unto the time that his help was come /

Here it is showed of Lisimacus king of macedonye / of Fabyus maximus / of
Denis the tyrant / of Alexaunder and of Yphytrates / Capitulo / ix /
LYsymacus the king of macedonye had beseged the cite of Epheze which had to
her aid an Archepyrate / that is so say a great thef of the sea that much
harm did to the said king and nauye of his ships he took often fro him a
great quantyte of prisoners / but to this he fond a remedy For he did so
much that he corromped the said rouer by mean of money so that he did fille
his ships with the said Lysymacus folk well garnysshed with their harneys
and led them in to the cite as they had be his prisoners / which soon
after by night wh^an they see their fairest and that they of the cite took non
keep they ran upon the spies and slew them / and so was the town taken and
delyured unto Lysymacus / Ite^ fabius maximus that time he beseged capne he
did waste all the corn that grue about hit wherbi it seemed that his intent was
not for to besege the town / and then departed far from the same / and
tarried his coming thither again unto the time that they had sowed their lands
again whereto they had employed their corn and had but lytyl kept / And
then returned again Fabyus / And for fawte of bred gate ye strong cite of
capne which was famisshed Item Denis the tyrant after that he had taken many
fortresses in cecyle / he came before roges which he knew well garnisshed of
vitaille / for the which thing thex kept hem strong / So feyned Denis to make
a peace with them and that he would goo to another part / but in the covenant
made between him and them was comprysed that they should delyuere him vytaylles
for his money unto a certain day And when he saw that all their vitailles
were almost gone and consumed away whereof they rought not because they trowed
to have had peace and that their lands were almost ripe for to be reped up /
he came on a fresshe upon them that soon were famysshed and thus took hem /
Item when alexau^der would take the cite of lencadye which he knew was stowred
with vitaille he took first diverse towns and castelles / and for the nones
suffered the people that was ynne to enter the said cite of lencadie whereunto
they fled full fast / to the end y^ their vitailles should the sooner be
consumed and goon / and he took good head that no vitaille might com to them /
and by all thus he took hem / Item Yphitrates when he kept tharente he found a
watch man a sleep / and so struck and slew him / and when men blamed him for
the same / he ansuerde that he had left him as he had found him that is to
say / that he reputed a man aslepe / as for deed /

Of amulcar duke of cartage / of haymo Emperor of affryke / of hanybal and of
valesius Capitulo / xo^ /
Amulcar duke of cartage knew well that the romans were wou^t to receive
benigneli their enemies when they turned them to their part and that in
great worship they kept hem / and y^ specialli the soldiers of gallia / and
therefore by cause that he would have them by such away / ordained agrete
quantyte of them of his oost that he knew most true to him / And made them to
goo to the ost of the rommayns as they had be rebel unto him and would take
part with the romans / So was this subtylite double worth unto the said duke
/ That is to wite in as much as his enemies were of them slain / and that
they durst receive never syn noone of the his that would depart from him /
Item Haymo emperor of Cartage had a much great oste in cecylle against the
romans / and knew that in his oste emonge other of his folk he had well four
thousand Frenshmen that were accorded emonge them self for to goo toward the
romans for to take their part / by cause that they were not well paid of
their wages / Haymo durst not punysshe hem for fere of rebellion / but he
did purueye thrughe means of a wyle to this inconuenyent / He called unto him
the captains of the said folk and speak fair to them and a promise he made
hem that within a certain day he should make satisfaction unto them / but the
last day of the term except one that he should keep his promise which he
would nor conde not accomplysshe / wherefore he wiste well that they should
depart / he sent toward the duke of the oste of the rommayns one of his
knights that true was to him as though ^e had run away as rebelle unto him
/ that told the said duke that he should keep him self well / and that upon the
night next coming four thousand of his enemies were poynted for to enter upon
his oost / whereof the romayn duke for fere lest this should hap ordained yt
and the most party of his ost for to watch y^ night the which full soon
ran upon the said frenshmen when they saw hem come / and by all thus came this
well to pass for haymo for ye romai^s lost there many of their folk and was
adve^ged right well of them of galia yt so had goon away from him for they were
al disconfi^ed and slain Item by such anothre manner was adue^ged hanibal
upon diverse soldiers yt he know were goon away by night from his oste for to
goo to ye romai^s for he made to be published through his oste ye noone should
take nor hold them that so were departed from his ooste for falce nor rebel
and yt they as worthy knyghtis and good they were so goon away by his
commandment and secret ordinance / because they should know the couuyue and
counsel of his enemies / and for to do a certain thing that he had comytted
them unto And this did so hanybal because that he wiste well that the romans
had some espies in h^is oste that soon should goo tell them this / and so they
did / wherefore the romans took incontynently al thoo that came from hanyballis
oste and made their hands to be smytten of and syn they send hem again unto
him Item the head captains of the roman folk kept the fortress of tharente
and he sent his messangers to hasdrusbal that had him beseged / that he should
yield to him the said fortress so that he would late him goo sauf and hole /
But while this parlyament was kept by which hadrusbal held him self as al
asseured and evil watch he set / valeryus that his advantage saw lepte out
of the castle and with his power and strength ran wisely upon his enemies
which he dyscomfyted and slew the said hadrusball / What should I say more of
the stratagemes of Frontyn many full fair ben contained in his book which
shald be long to say / but thus much shall now suffice except some fair
notables which I will show that be comprysed in his book to this propos

Frontyn in h^is fourth book says of Cesare domycius of Emilius / of Scipion
Affrycan / and of Gains scipio Capitulo / xjo^
Caesar said that men ought to use against his enemy of the counseyl that the
leches given against the syknesse / That is to wtte of dyete and of honger or
euere iron be attempted / Item domicyus carbulo said that men ought first to
hurt his enemy by all maneres of wylis and subtyltees of wit / or euere that
the body be exposed thereto / Item the emperor emulus paulus said that it
behooved to a good capytaine of an oste for to be old of condycions Item
scipyon affrycan ansuered to one that wited him that litel he did of his
hands in a bataylle / My mother said he childed me as an emperor / and not as
a fyghter / that was for to say / that almanere a captain or prince of an ost
ought to suffyse for to set and ordeyne well his folk without to put^e his
body in Ieopardy of strokis Item gayus maximus aunsuered to an Almanye that
called him to fight with him body against body / If my liffe were noyouse unto
me I should have found the means long syn^ for to have be slain / Item
scypion said that men ought not only to make a way to his enemy for to flee
/ but also ^o show hit to him cl^erely / And me semyth that to the propos of
these things may well serve that that the wise c^arles the fyfeth king of
France said when men said unto (...) that agrete shame it was that with money
he recovered his fortresses that some of his enemues held and kept from him
wrongfully / seeing that he was of might great enough for to have recovered
them by strength / It semith me said he that that which may be bought ought
not to be bought with mannys blood

In the book of valeryus it is said of hanybal / of a ki^ge of greece / of
another in a semblable cas / and of the romans that had need of soldiers
Capitulo / xij /
Ualerius speaks to this propos in his seventh book and says that hanybal of
whom it is spoken before / hated much the right worthy duke Fabius maximus
because he constrested or gaynstode him in bataylle and bare him great hurtes
and domages / And because that Hanybal could not let nor grieve him with
strength / he thought to help himself against Fabyus with subtyletees and
wylys / he wasted all the feldes about rome and all the maneres of other princes
there / except them that apperteyned to the worthy knight fabius which he
spared and mysdide them naught / to the end that he might do vndrestand the
rommayns by the same that Fabius had some alyance or treatee with him / and with
this he did yet more / For he secretly wrote certain lettres and sent them to
rome for to be diretted unto the said Fabyus which lr^es contained and spoke
as though among they had be certain conuenant that Fabius should commytte
trayson against the romans / and did ordeyne this thing so that the Senate of
rome had knowledge thereof / But they that knew the truth of Fabyus and the
malice of Hanybal made no force thereof / Item a king of Greece was sometime that
had envy of the romans and for this cause and for noon other occasion he
hated them sore much / and if their great might and power had not be / he
would gladly have hurted them / And so he knew of no way so to do but by
barat and symulacyon / wherefore he feyned that te loved them well / and diverse
lettres he sent hem of humble recomendacyon concerning the great and tender
love that he hadd to them / And he sent hem word at last that he desired
sore for to see the cite of rome and the noble ordinance that was there / and
when he was come to rome he was greatly received as he that was for a friend
reputed and taken But the more that he there saw the felycyte and the worship
gretter ye more encreaced the sorrow the secret envy that was hid within
his stomach / whereof did grow such an effet that he did so much by his
malice or euere he departed that the barons there he set to a dyscordaunce
and debate so that a great sedycyon arrose anoone emongys hem / And thus as he
thought in him self he might not hurt the cite by no bettre manner of way /
Item another that in like caas hated rome / when he had made stryffe and debate
to be thrawen emonge the rommains that had need of socours and took strange
souldyours for to help hem / But when time came that the bataylles should mete
togider for to fight the said souldyours departed out of the oste of the
rommayns and went upon the hanging of a montayne for to byholde which of
both parties should have the bettre that they might hold with them when they
should perceive that one party to be overcome / But to this did purueye full
wisely the captain of the rommayns that saw his folk afe^de therefore / For
he went all along every row where they were renged / saying that such
departing from his oost was done by his commandment of to run upon the
enemies when they should assemble togider / And thus he assured his folk and
hadd the vyctorye /

Of the cawteles of the rommayns that were beseged in an oste / of Quintus
metellus king of Sezyle and of Hanibal / Capitulo / xiijo^
AT that time when rome was taken of the Frensshemen and that they had beseged
the capitole which is a fortress that can not be taken but if hit be
famysshed wherefore they kept the ways that no manner of vytaylles should be
brought thither and so would make them within to yield them self or ellis to
dey there for honger / But the romans that sometime were full subtyl in all
deeds of werre for to have away from their enemies the hope that they had of
the famysshyng of hem / they took of such few vytaylles as they hadd and
left thereof a great releff about the bones which with diverse reuersyons and
small gobettis of bread they myngled with the fylthes and swepynges of the hons
and casted altogider out of a wyndowe whereby when they of gallia saw this they
merueylled greatly wenyng that they had be well garnysshed of vytaylles /
wherefore they fell in a treatee of peace / Item when hanybal and hadrusball
princes of Cartage were with a great oste in ytalye / the rommayns sent against
them two dukes that led great ostes which dukes kept and maynteyned them so
wisely that the two ostes of the Cartagiens could not come togider / For if
they had done so they should by their great nombre of folk have wasted all
the country / but the Romans did so much upon a night that both their own
ostes were assembled togider by fore the day that they should give a bataylle
to one of the said ostes of Cartage which was soon overcome and dyscomfyted /
Item Quintus metellus being in hyspayne with an oste might not enter by
strength in to a town which he had beseged / And therefore he departed fro
the syege and took him to purueye his oste here and there and a long espace of
time he did goo from one place till another in so much that his own folk
merueylled thereof / and also his enemies did mock him therefore and took his
doing but a folly / But so much he went dooyng al ways thus / that at last
he saw his point when that his enemies were weary and sore peyned with
contynuel watch / And so he took them vmbeware / Item a king of Secille was
be fought of the Cartagiens / but when he saw that they had occupied all his
land and that no Remedy he conde put thereto / he departed with as many of
his folk as he might have and went in to Affrycke / and in like wise there he
did brenne and dystroye the country al about / And for this cause the
Affrycayns of Cartage that so had wasted and occupied his country were feign to
make peace with h^ym and to make him amend and restitucion of the dommages that
they had done to him / Item when hanyball should ones have fought against the
romans at the bataylle of Cannes that sore do mageable was for them / he used
with three maneres of cautelle / the first was that he took a place for to fight
where as he should have the son and the wind at the back of him With this
he ordained that after the bataille were bygonne one part of his folk should
make as they fled away by fore a covert where abusshement was for the nones
comytted and set for to run upon the romans that should follow the chasse
after them that so fled And thirdly he ordained that four men of arms should
in like wise flee toward the romans / as they should feere the bataylle and
should yield them self to them / This ordinance thus brought to effect / and
that the bataylle was bygonne / the romans were sore troubled and let by the
son and by the duste that took the sight and also by the said busshement that
over renned them where many of them were slain and thirdly by theyme that had
yield hem self to them the which after the manner that was then were
dysarmed and put out behind the bataylle / But they hadd covertly under
their little doublettes rasers where with all they did cut the synewes of the
legs of the Rommayns while they faught / And thus as Valeryus says by the
malice of Affricke more than by bataylle was overcome the strength of the
romans /

Here begins to speak of the manner of be fyghtyng and sawtyng of castelles
and towns / And first of the manner of byldyng of them / Capitulo / xiiijo^
SYn that we have devised after the books of arms and of other more new
custom / the ways that be good to be kept in fayttes of batayl that be
renged and set in array / We folowyngly shall say after vegece and as other
Auctours techen / of the maneres and ways that be proffytable and good to be
kept as well in fayttes of befyghtyngis and sawtynges of Cytees / towns and
castelles as of the deffensynge in like wise of the same / And also ensuyng
this matere we shall speak of the bataylles that be made upon the sea or upon
flodes and other fresshe watres / So devised and shows first the said Auctour
the manner how for the most suretee the ancient did bylde their fortresses
so that they were closed round a bout with strong walls and with dyches /
And by the form following he techeth hit thus saying / Who that will bylde a
good and a durable place ought first to take heed to five things / First he
shall see that the place be of a high ground if it may be / that is to wite
upon some right well set and in a good country / But if the dysposycyon of
such a place as he has be not syttyng / he shall advise for to close his
edyffice about or at lest one side of it with the sea or with sum ryuere
that may bear ships / And if it so hap that the place be so conuenable that
the sea may enter of both parts / the ryuere that shall run thrughe the
towns is much proffytable and of great socours if hit can bear ships / The
second that the air be there good and wholesome and far from plashes of
watres and of mares ground / The third that the country be fruytefull and
gyuynge abondantly al manner things that be needful to the lyffe of man / The
fourth that no hylle be so nyghe that any shot can grieve hit / And the fyfth
is that the cytuacyon of the place be free and not in boundage / And the same
auctour yet says that the wise ancient made not the cyrcuyte of the walls of
their cytee or fortress all right up even with a live as men do now / For
they said that the walls so made were more ready and bettre dysposed to receive
the strokes of al manner engyns and to dress up ladders thereunto / and
therefore they made hem crooked wise with certain yssues and steps well
massonned and the stones strongly bounden with lyme and zande / and compassed
them squarre to the end that they might make deffense in many places where as
many strong toures and deffensable were thikkly set al round about / And
with this techeth the said auctour how walls may be doubly fortyfyed against
all engyns / that is to wite that two walls of strong stuff must be made
with an Interualle or space withyn forth of tuenty foot broad fro that one
wall to that other / And the earth that shall be dygged and taken out for to
set the fondementes which ought to be made as deep in to the earth dic^^s
about Shall be hadd bettwyx both the foresaid walls till that the said space of
tuenty foot be filled there with all and shall be trodden and stamped upon as
hard as can be / And the wall must be first made up above / and so thykke
and so broad that aleyes may be there made with holes and splytes that Archers
be set for to shut and cast there thrughe al manner of gonne stones and al
other shot / And a propre place must be ordained and made at every face of
the walls for to set gonnes and other engyns for to shute without / if need
be to make deffence / And mayntelles and barbakanes of tymbre shall be made fast
to the batelmentes of the walls without forth in manner of targettes and
pauoyses against the shot / And the ancient also made great hyrdelles and
broad to be tide fast with chains and with ropis to the walls without forth
that waued and brake the strokis of the stones that were cast against the
walls with diverse maneres of engyns / so that they could not hurt nor appayre
the walls / Or else they made hour deys or obstacles full thykke of thorns
and ready luted them with dong and stones against the walls which by this were
kept fro brusynge of the great stones / And sedyng watre / brennyng ashes / and
al such other things they had pressed and ready for their deffence / The yates
that were made of strong timber they made to be covered in time of werre with
Lamynes of iron or with raw leder by cause they should not be set on fire /
and thereupon they had a barbackane / And yet was there a hole made thrughe the
wall where was set a portecolys that hanged with rings and chains of iron
/ so that if the enemies came there they should be surprysed and enclosed
vnbewarre by the said protecollysse that men should late goo down upon them /
and other holes were also there wherthrughe great stones and other things
might be lached and cast upon them / Item the dyches ought to be made of a
great bread and so deep / if cas be that no ryuere be rennyng there / that the
fortres may not be vndremyned / but if namely hit were set upon a roche / But
the ancient kept well their fortresses from this inconuenyent / For with good
betun / lyme and cyment they bond their byldyng so fast and namely the
fondementes of their fortresses that they might not be persed / Also ought the
dyches to be so deep and so large that they be not of light filled by the
enemies / and some ancient made hem in old time past to be massonned as a
wall up right at the without forth side so that one might not descend him
self a down theryn / and yet with this they strak full thikke al douneward the
wall with sharp hokes and pynnes of iron that men call caltrappes that letten
right sore them that go down the which things are commonly known as I trow
/ and semblably diverse other closes and garnysons of deffence / wherefore it is
no great need as me seems that I recyte no more thereof syn that the maystres
of such works ben thereof well learned and taught in the time present /

Here devised of the garnysons that behouen to castelles and towns in time of
war / Capytulo / xvo^ /
Little is worth the strength of the walls of a castle how well that hit be
garnysshed of al deffensable things / when lack and fault of vytaille is
there / if hit be beseged / as it appyered by the strong place of pnemon that
closed was round about with seven panes of strong walls al made of marbell
stone / and was set upon a roche and fortyfyed with great toures al about /
that were well garnysshed with good men of werre / the which fortress was
famysshed by long setting of the syege that was laid before / And by cause
that enemies commonly at a syege force hem self to take away the watre fro the
fortress And it is good to make there ready against the engyns Cyment / beton /
oylle / pytche / and foyson of tawe to brenne the said engyns with all / stele
and iron to make and forge al manner of harnoys for the men of arms / and
maystres that can good skyle in making of the same / And foyson of timber to
make sperys / demylaunces and other stauys with all And a great plente of
flyntstones or other hard stones must be had upon the batelementes of the
walls and toures for to make deffence with all / And also ought to be purueyed
for pypes and other vessels full of quyk lyme that shall be thrawen and shouen
a down upon the enemies that wol clyme up to the wall to the end that the
mouths and the eyes of them that be most hardy may be stopped and filled
with all when the vessels shall break in falling on the ground / Item
behooves to such a garnyson a great quantyte of bordes and herdelles / and
foyson nails and pynne both of iron and of wode for to make entablementes
against te walls without forth / And for to say in general they must be well
purueyed and garnished of Lyme / of Zande / of Stone / and of Plastre for to
make cloysons and contrewalles / and of carpenters and massons for to make hit
if need were / Item a great stoore must there be of cords and strengys for
balestres and long bows and senewys and other stuff to make hem with all /
And if yt happed that senewys might not be recoured / the horses manes and the
tails and namely the herys of women are at a need full good to make
crosbowes cords and strings with all / For with this as vegece says the
romans helped hemself right well when Hanybal demeined hem so sore and so
long that al manner of cords and senewis were faylled emonge hem / And then
the worthy ladies of rome that had right fair and long here trayllyng to the
ground and that had at that time in their heerys their most curyouse and
most playsante appareyll / had leuere to be defiled and naked from their
right fair and yelowe treshes or lokkes for to socoure the ire cite with all /
than to be arrayed full fair with their long and yelowe heerys / and soon to
be brought in to captyuyte and thraldom under the hands of their enemies and
therefore they proffred their heerys to the archers and shoters / whereby rome
was warauntyzed and kept / Item also they ought to be well garnysshed with
horns of bestes for to amend again their crosbowes / and in like wise of
raw leder for to couere again their engines and their other edyffyces to
the end that they may not be set in a fire and to see a good garnyson of men
able and expert in all points of arms and good archers well learned and taught
in all that bilongeth to assault / and having the ways of making deffense
against their enemies and to be of a no^bre couenable as the place requires /
For as a proverb says / The walls maken not the strong castelles / but the
deffense of good folk makes hit imprenable / and it ought not to be forgoten
that where as the place is most feeble there must be applied more great a
deffence ^ For at that side are the enemies wont for to sawte most sore*

Of habyllementes of werre / Capitulo xvj
AFter that we have devised in general of many things that be al enough
couenable / as well for vytaylles / as for deffense that to a garnyson of a
fortress apparteynen against the enemies / It seems to us expedyent to show

How a fortress ought to be stoored and purueyed of fresshe watre Capitulo /
xvijo^ /
Where it is so as vegece says / that a great proffite and great ease it is to
a cite or a fortres when quyk springes of fresshe watre may be there in
conduyttes or wells / Nevertheless if it be so that in some parties the kind of
the ground be not dysposed to no fresshe watre / a remedy must herto be hadd
to the best / that is to wite if the fontaynes and the spyrynges be without the
walls of the place al most nygh the cite or fortress / it behooves to them
of withynne for to keep and deffende their watre with good shot and by
strong hand / if cas where that the enemies would keep hit from them / And if
the spring be somewhat far fro the place / then must there upon be bylded
and made a little toure deffensable by which shall the watre mow be kept and
deffended with the strength of men of arms and by shot / And with this in all
such citees and fortres ought to be made diverse cisternes in such places
where men may receive June the rain watres that fallen down a long the
thackes of thappentyzes and houses / and to keep them euere more full of such
watre and namely of conduitte or ryuere watre / for the watre is well kept in
such cisternes by mean of the gravel and zande and is full wholesome to be used
/ se^blaly says Aristotle that salt watre of the sea or that comes out of
bitter conduyttes and sprynges becomes good and sweet if it be passed and
straygned thrughe pypes made of wax / And morouere is a great quantyte of
vynaig^e much proffytable to be hadd and nameli ^ Some time / For hit
reffrescheth well the body to (...) it with watre / which thing is right well
known in ytalye / And if the fortress is set upon the sea and that salt
hap there for to faille / men shall take of the watre of the sea and shall be
put in vessels that shall be of little depnes and broad / which vessels
shall be set to the son or upon a fire till the watre be consumed away / and
by this manner of way shall the salt be fond in the botome /

How it is of necessite that to a garnyson of a fortress be put good men and
true And herto gives an ensample Capitulo / xviijo^ /
For all things or the most part to show and deuyse that be needful and
couenable to the deffense of cytees and fortresses / it is to be known that
the soue ayne garnyson that longs thereto is of good and trusty men and that
love the place well / For where as al things were acomplyss^hed and well ordered
and that this only thing should be fawted all should be naught there / and to
take this for a tro^the / and that a great evil may come thereby / where then
following this propos / where as ensampl^es be commonly more penetratyffe in the
eeres of the herers than prouffes that be made by arguments or reasons / shall
bring forth many one for a wittenes of the same And first in rehercyng that
which the other Auctoures testyfyen and sayen / that is / that the grettest
good that can be / is peace love and unity to be had in a comynalte without
diuysyon / and that an over hard thing it were / that such people might be of
what someuere puyssau^ce or power dyscomfyted and dystroyed / and this
approves the ansuere that the wise magicien tinsealx madevnto Scypyon when he
axed him how it might be that they of the cite of Munyence had kept hem self
so long against the puyssaunce of the rommayns / he said that it was by the
right great concordaunce that was emonge hem / and with peace and unite is also
right good to be had in a fortress or cite such princes or soueraynes that
owe great favor and a love to the place / as the noble Canullus well showed
that sovereign was of the romans oste / when that Brenyus of swaue had
dystroyed the cite of rome by werre and went away with proyes and great
rychesses But the said noble men not wythstandynge that the romans had
exilled him wrongfully out of their cite / when he knew the great myshappe he
was full sorry / And gadred soon of folk all that he might do for he was of a
great auctoryte / and went against Brenyus that no keep took of him / and slew
a great part of his people and him self put to flight and a great hauoyre he
did conquer there of the which he bylded rome again and brought in again
with him them that were banysshed / And for this cause he was called the
second Romulus / And even thus as a right great good Joy and good hap is or
comes to a cite when she is in peace and unity within her self / right so / all
evil / desolacyon and parell is there in time of dyscorde and ofdiscencion the
which thing is her total and very destructyon / as namely says the holy
scripture / For by dyscorde and altercacyon comes and aryseth comynly a great
dyfferent and contencyon among the comynaltee of a town / that is to wite
thrughe cause of pride and of arrogance one against another by envy and by
coueytyse whereof may no good come / as it happed in rome of their bataylle
cyuile that to the rommayns was so greatly preiudycyable that al most they had
vttirly undone and dystroyed hem self thereby for the great pride that was in
their princes that is to wite Scilla and Maryus to whom were come to aid of
two parties pompee / Pertorius and Marius that othre high men were of great
proesse and auctorite In which werre were slain in diverse bataylles or euere
hit ceased / as Recounteth the historye / xxiiij / of their princes that were
head captains / six of their souerayns and / xl / high barons / and of the
romayn people / C / l / thousand without other ^ strangers that were to their
aid / So ought well to be eschewed such an evil and acursed contencyon and
debate

Of the same /
YEt to this propos of puttyng trusty folk in to castelles and cytees / and
that good keep ought to be taken that they be not over much covetous / as by
this manner of way many cytees and towns have been betrayed sold and robbed /
It apyereth by thensample of the cite of Sinopen that was great strong rich
and full of people / which Mytryda^^es the king had taken to two knights that
he reputed good and true to him / but full evil they kept hit ^ For them self
with their folk dyspoylled it / and after that they had set hit a fire they
fledd and went away whereof a merueyllouse adventure happed For then as the
duke of the oost of the romans did arryue there for to set his siege before
the town / he had great merueylle what that might be And when the cas was
told him he made to call at the yates / and when the yate was open he
gyuyng to them of the town good assewrance / made his own folk to put out
the fire / And thus was werred the said Sonopen by them that should have kept
hit sauffe / And socoured and helped by them that trowed to have dystroied hit
a noone / Item that couetouse folk may be of great hynderaunce unto a cite or
castelles / It appyereth by the words of Iugurta the king of Munydye that a
great envy and couerd hate bare to the rommayns hydd under color of feynted
love / but for to deceive hem bettre he gaffe great gifts unto the
pryncypalles of them / and in this dooynge he sewed sedycyon and dyscorde
emonge the cytezeyns / And thus werred them their enemy that they reputed
for a friend without that they perceived it nor were aware thereof till that at
his departing fro rome where as by fyctyon of great love he was come / he could
not keep his heart that was swollen with envy / but he must cast out such
aworde / This strong cite were lightly to be taken who that had enough for
to give / With thees things is to wit that many a time is happed a great
Inconuenyent in cytees and lands / and namely in an ooste by cause of great
quantyte of strangers / as hit happed in Rome in the time of their conquestes
where they had an use to take in scruyce with them the prysonners that they
took for to do such occupacyon and besynes as they would set hem for to do
/ Whereof it befell that ones so many they had / that more than tuenty thousand
arrose together as rebel against the rommayns and bare them much great dommayge
or euere they could comme at an end for to destroy hem / But after thees
things thus said which may serve for ensample we shall return to the first
propos

Of leyenge of a syege / and of sawtyngys of fortresses Capytulo / xixo^ /
WHen the time is comme that an oste comes to lay a syege before some cytee or
fortres / which time ought commonly to be if the head capytayne be wise in the
season of heruest or soon after / by cause that then it is to him profitable
for two reasons / One is / that he shall find more of vytaylles upon the feldes
/ and that other by cause that he shall grieve dobly his enemies / that is to
wit by syege and assault and by taking away fro them their corn / and
their wine and their other vytaylles when they should gadre them for to
fournysshe their town / And he shall see that his ost be lodged the most
nere that he may / and shall well advise before the ground and the sytuacyon of
the place if be he not by some other suffysauntly thereof informed / to the end
that the syege be laid best to his advauntage for to dress his engyns upon a
conuenyent ground / and to advise what part he shall best give assault / And
if it seems him best he shall do make about the ooste good dyches and shall
fortefye the ground about with palys as it were a fortres / to the end they
may wythstande to them that might comme for to reyse the syege / or namely to
them of the castle if they issued out against them / And if it be so that of
all sides the place may be beseged / the bettre it is / but if there be any
hylle or some other thing that lets / Nevertheless to all the parties that be
plain shall be made trenchez or pallys fro one syege to that other / so that

ordeyne semblably sewre deffense and good watch at every owre / And so shall
advise by what manyere the place is most prenable / And if it be to be scaled
he shall first late make dowble ladders as many as shall need / and shall make to
be had away with the shot of engyns all that that lets of the walls / and
then shall the ledders be set up that shall be armed at the upper end with
great hokes of iron that shall a grype the batellementes or fensynge of the
wall / and the neder end shall be harnessed with sharp hedes of iron which
shall be set deep in to the earth to the end they be not over thrawen down by
them that deffende the town / And forthwyth of all sides shall begin the
assawte / And if vndremynyng semyth him good / good wherkmen that can skylle
shall be set to work for to delue up the earth / and they shall begin so
far that they of wythyn shall not by no way see the men that bear out the
earth / And so deep shall the mine be made that hit shall pass under the dyches
which shall be under shored with good tymbre till that they comme to the
fondementes of the walls or lower / And by this manyere of way they shall
find the mean to enter ynne if gaynsayde be not done to hit / And wyle this
vndremynyng is a doing the wise Capytayne ought not to be still lest they of
wythynne feel or vndrestande by their scowtwatche the said vndremyners / But
shall trouble and vex them with diverse and contynuall assawtes / so that the
noise the doing and the bruyt shall stop their heerynge / For strokes of
crosbowes thykker than flies / Bombardes / and gonnes with the horrible sown
of their stones cast against the wall / the noise of the assawters / the
sownes of Trompettes and the feere that they have of them that cleme up the
laders shall give hem ynouge to do / and so they shall not be lytyl occupied /
Item and if it hap that the said myners may perce the walls without they be
perceived / they shall soon set on a fire all the tymbre and shores that they
have set under the walls which shall then break and fall down al attones
/ and thus shall enter the town the men of arms / And if this thing can not
help by cause of the great strength of the place and of the great garnyson /
the wise capytayne that desired to have hit shall seek by another manyere of

Capitulo / xx /
WHat that vegece upon whose book of knyghthode we have founded the most party
of this present work has spoken in general terms after the manner and usage
of the preu ancient conquerours past enough suffysauntly to good
vndrestanders of the things of arms / As Well in this that touches or may
touch fayttes or deeds of bataylle and of that that depends thereof / as of
that which bylongeth to assaylle Castelles and Towns by see and by land / As
it shall be said herafter / Nevertheless for to give a more partyculer
vndrestandynge / not to them that know hit / but to them that in time
coming shall mow read and here it desiring the knowledge thereof / Where the
scripture in books is a thing perpetual as to the world / it seems me good
to add in this our said work more partyculerly thoo things that be good

so and semblably that in the things said and to be said we have helped us of
the saynges of the book of vegece and other Auctoures / We shall in this help

other bountez Wysedomes worthynesses of knygthode and noble / virtues that been

not therefore despise hit / but shall be content of the same / thynkyng ye
dommage it were that the feebleness of a lytyl paper that Rotyth in a little time
should have brought to naught the mind and remembrance of so notable
ordinance which is well worthy to be enregistred to the end that it may be

Devised the manner for to let and keep the haven fro the enemies Capitulo /
xxxiiij /
By cause we have said here by fore that for to assaylle a fortress great and
strong of which the one side is upon the sea or upon a great rynere / were
expedyent the forsaid appareylle to be had / It byhoueth also to advise how
thayde and socours that by the sea might come to the said fortres might be
let / It is to be known then / that there must be had / x / or / xij /
great old vessels of the sea that shall be charged with stones as much as
they can bear which vessels thus laden shall be brought in to the hauene of
the said fortres or town and there they shall be drowned so that they shall
compryse and fylle all the said hauene that noone other manner of ship shall
mow come therynne for to approach the said fortres another by floode nor by
high spring of watre / And for such vessels to conveye by cause no
lettynge cowde be put thereto there shall be a good captain ordained that shall
have with him four thousand men of arms and five hundred men of shot or moo /
which shall be in other ships and shall draw after hem the said ships so
laden with stones And if any gytee wharffe or any brygge were there or some
other great ryuere whereby the dyches were filled / this felawship might break
hit therwhiles and give an issue to the watre for to have her course to another
part / And upon the said ships so drowned as it is said may be made two
bastilles that should be made in manner as bolwerkes / that is to wite an
edyfyce made with great tymbre as high as men will / which may soon be done
that has help enough and this bastylle must be aduironned with hirdels
about and dawbed thykke with earth and clay thereupon / and it may be set
upon wheles / And this edyfyce feereth another fire nor stroke of gonne by cause
the pellettes and stones that are shot fowndren deep in to the earth that soft
is / nor ^yre may not take thereto / And the bastille of which is spoken before
made with palysses ought to begin at this bastille made of earth / And thus
to goo round about the fortres or town who that may from that one bastylle
made with palisses to that other bastylle made of earth / And al thus by taking
away of the ryuere and to do after this manner if the place be so dysposed
the dyches shall be made dreye / And with this men shall mow make a gytee
about the town in manner as bolwerkes as it is said / by cause no gonne nor
no manner of shot shall hurt the ost / And by all thus men shall mow mine
the castle or town syn the watre is taken from him / and when the catte and
the bewfrais shall be left up and dressed / and that the gonnes shall have broken

Devised the engyns that be couenable to the fayttes of assawtes / Capitulo /

ANd it is to be known that for to sawte all strong places there ben five
pryncypall engyns as vegece says by the which men may take hem / that one is
that same of which by force of a pouldre made of charcolys Salt petre /
brymstone and such mix^ions that behouen thereto are cast by great strength
so great stones that they bruise and shouen a down all walls / houses / toures
/ and all that they recontre and of them be some of merueyllouse force that one
more than that other / Item men maken another engyne which after is called as
vegece says mosselle or motelle / and is made as a flat hons and large / and
covered with horsdonge because that no stones nor no fire may hurt nor gryeue
hit / and it is made upon wheles and may be carried where men will / within this
engyn are folk hid that draw after them branches of trees and all things
that be good to fylle dyches with all / and by the same way men may use thereof
in such a cas that will whereby away shall be given to other engyns to be
brought unto the walls / Item the third engyne is called Mowton / and is
made of tymbre in manner of a house covered above / upon which covering and
all round about are nailed rowhe hydes and all wete and fresshe by cause fire
shall not mow take thereto / In the forefronte of this house is a great maste
that has the end covered with iron great and massy Men draw this maste with
chains / and it is made by such manner that men may shoue it forth and
wythdrawe hit again so that they / that be within the engyns may smite great
strokes with this maste against the walls and so shaken that they be all
astonyed with all / which engyne gives his strokes even so as a ra^me does
when he reculeth a bak for to hurt whith his horns / and therefore is this
engyne called a Mouton / Item the fourth is called vygne of which men use but
seldom but if it be to a great effort / It is made of great timber / and it
has / viij / foot of bread and / xvj / of length / and is couerd with hyrdell
is and horsdonge / to the end that stones may not hurt him / and enuyromed al
about with hydes rowh^ for the fire / Under the same engyne ben the men of
arms that percen the wall and upon pow^t leveiz that be made fast thereto
which are called flyghyng brygges and may reche unto the walls / they set
and dress up their ladders to diverse stallages / Item the / v / engyn is yet
of more great strength and less in usage by cause that it byhoueth not but to
the sawtes of great and notables cytees or fortres and strong places sore
desired where as a syege be kept by long leyser / This engyn is called Tower
It is an edyfyce made of great timber and of tablementes with many loftes and
stallages / And therefore says vegece that so great an edyfyce ought to be well
kept / It behooves him to be covered that may with lamynes of iron lest fire
should be cast or set therein / or at the least with hydes rowh^ all fressle
/ To the which engynes men given light after as they be high or low For some
be of / xxx / foot / some of / L / And namely some there ben so high that not
only they surmonten the walls / but also the highest towers / This engyn is
set upon moeuable wheles that by force of men and of horses are led as
nyghe the walls as men can / And flighynge brygges there be that as they be
let down men may thereupon reche ouere the walls / And if it hap that this
Tower may be approached (...) the walls / ouere hard a thing it were / but
that the town shall be taken soon at an owre / For therynne ben great foyson
of men of arms in all the loftes and stallages / of which they of above with
good shode and hand to hand fyghten with them that been upon the walls and of
light may overcome hem / They of the low loftes or stallages percen the wall
/ And thus is the cytee or fortress enuaysshed of such effort that they of
withynne wot not what part to resyste nor deffende / so ben they abashed and
lightly taken / And it is that which vegece mente when he says / the more
parts and by more engyns and more strength that thou shall assaylle the
fortres all atones / the more are abashed they that make deffence and the
sooner they shall yield hem up / And by cause that for to do this / serven the
ladders and much proffyten herto / and in like wise all engyns that can be
made for to clyme high / It is need for to make bettre this manner of clymers
/ that men know first the heyght of the walls / And therefore for to know this
vegece techeth it by two ways / and says that an arowe shall be thrawen unto
the height of the wall / to the which arowe shall a long threde be made fast
that shall be hold vndrenethe / and by this shall mow be known the heyght of
the walls / Item that other way is when the son is so turned that he
casted the shadow of the walls and of the towers to the ground / then men
may mesure the space of the walls with two staves y pyght at either end of
the shadow / And by thaduyse of a good and wise consyderer may be esteemed what
heyght the ladders and other engyns most have

IT is certain that lightly enough might al manner of a strong place be
overcome and taken / without folk were there that should deffende hit and
therefore even so as vegece did put in his book for the doctrine and
techynge of (...) / the manyere for to assaylle citees and towns / and
semblably for to deffende and keep hem / here he says that ay^nst the engyns
above named and other diverse paryllis whereof might be used in faytte of
assawlte / if there be wytty deffensours that have in them y^ virtue of
knyhthode / mar^y a remedy may be hadd / For there is no syknes / but that
some socours is given thereunto / And in arms is subtylyte mykel more worth
than is strength / as it happeth often / namely in taking of castelles and
cytees / As it beffelle some time of the rommayns that by a subtyl polycye and
wit / took the cite of capsa that longed unto Tygram the king of Armenye
that werred them / For as the ambaxatours of the said cytee went and came for
to treatte of ^eas / the rommayns malycyously made on a night abusshement of
them self within the gardyns that nygh were to the wall / and when the said
ambaxatoures trowed to have entered again within the yates of the cite / the
rommayns ^epte upon the brygge so hastly that they took the yate / And so long
kept hit till the oost entered al ynne / And thus by craft and subtyl wit was
the cite taken that was so strong and so well garnysshed that by no sawtynge
hit might not be taken / And moreuere says vegece that they that keep and
deffende a place have more avauntage than they that do assaylle hit for diverse
reasons and namely in befyghtyng / For that which men cast from high be it
sperys stones darts or other shot / the more high that it comes fro / the
much more hit hurts / To the which things if great virtue and might be
put thereto / no manner of warantyse can not keep them that so assaylle if
they be hytte with all / but that they shall be beten down as the thondre fell
upon hem First of all they of within may be socoured by their lord if he be
not there him self / that with a power of men shall mow come to reyse the syege
and to give hem socours / or by some other of their fre^des whom they shall
ahue sent word and prayde for help and socoure / as it be fell when the duke
Lentulus head captain of the ost romayn went against the king Mytrydates / that
sent word to his folk that were withyn the cite of Mycene that so strong was
that the sea smote there at the one side of her and was aduironned with double
walls / that they should not abashe hem self for the great puyssau^ce of the
king Mytridates and that soon socours they should have / And a great thing it
was to the messau^ger for to pass thrughe so many folk and goo there / but it
was by night and swymyng / where he did put two great boteylles under his
okselles and swymed / viij thousand passes in the sea / and by this manner of
way he came and entered in to the cite / And soon after was Mytrydates
contresieged where his oost was brought to a great mischief for deffawte of
vitailles that from no part might not come there / which thing is facyble to
be do against them that hold a sege / Item they hem self or part of hem if
they feel hem self strong enough / may issue out with right fair ordyinaunce
that owre when the enemies be not aware of if they see their point / and
likwyse to sawte them as they be sawted / For by such away has been an ost
keeping a siege oftymes overcome and dyscomfited and it is necessary to al folk
that goo to bataylle for the deffense of their country or cite that they have
great hope in god to have the victory for the good right that they have / or
other wise they should not mow fight hardely / And that they should have this
hope / it has be seen oftymes by the effect that thereof happed to such
fyghters / thus namely as it seemed that it happed to them of the cite of rome
when ones emonge other times / Hanybal with a right great ost came by fore the
cite for to have hit dystroyed / but where as the rommayns issued against him by
great boldness though they were less by the third part / than their enemies
/ our lord that would not that the town where as in time to come he would
edyfye his church / should be dystroyed / sent such a great shower of rain
that owre that they should assemble togider / that their harneys was so sore
charged with watre that they cowde not help hem self / and forced they were to
withdraw them self / And after that three times this had happed thus to them as
it were a very miracle Hanyball said / that he would not entrepryse no werre
against the gods / for well he saw that they were favorable unto rome / Item
how be it that pactes and conuenaunces that been and may be often times done ben
some time namely more vaylable to honor and proffyt to them of within than to
them of without Natheles when they be thus as^sailled as it is said it
behooves hem to deffende them self therynne by virtue and strength of their
bodies without other remedy / and a good courage mystereth them much which
may be seen by ensample of them of the cite of Cartage which or euere they
would delyuere up their cite to the romans that would have destroyed hit /
they loved bettre to deye / And kept the romans still with fair words till
that they had forged their harneys whereof they had deffaulte of gold of
syluere / of Coper and other metalles by cause that both iron and stele were
faylled them / and with the same armewres they deffended and kept their cite
unto their death / So it behooves to such folk to help hemself with engyns
/ fire / iron / and stones / strongly by great might and vigoure / that is to
wit with good shot of crosbowes / and great stones that shall be casten by the
might of the engyns / and they must have appareylled ready pitche / oil /
brymstone and towe to make with all great stopselles that shall be shoten thykke
to the engyns of their enemies so long till that they be set a fire And men
may make staves of dry wode all holowe withinne and full of fire / of cyment
of oil and of towe and shute them to the said engyns / And semblably men may
dystroye hem with an engyn castyng a slynge of iron with rings / and beside
this engyn must be made a forge in which shall be a great bar of iron fire
glowyng hoot which shall be cast to the engyn without in what place that hit be
/ and against this brenninge iron may have no defense row leder nor also lamynes
of iron /

Item of the same
ITem men may let down fro the walls certain persons in great maundes by
night that shall bear fire with hem and in diverse places they shall set the
said engyns on fire / Item it has be seen oftymes that they of withyn have
issued out suddenly and have dystroyed both by fire and iron the engyns of
their enemies / With this he says morouere that they of within ought to
advise that of that part of the wall where the said great engyn called Tower
is set / if such be there / the said wall be made higher so that it may
over retche always in height the said engyn / For certain it is as he says
/ that if the wall be more high / than is the said engyn of lytyl value but
the besegers have como^ly one manner of a polycye that first they do bylde the
said Tower in such wise that it seems lower than the walls / but after ward
wey make another small toure with bordes and tablementes which is al ways
couched down unto time that they will join this great engyn to the walls /
and then suddenly they dress hit up with cords and with great hokes And by
this way the men of arms assaylle suddenly al attones the wall / and without
great deffense be made then of them of wythinne they shall enter and take the
town by force / But against this polycye must be purueyed certain great
mastes armed above with sharp ferrementes and with the same they shoue the said
engyn abacke fro the wall / Item he says that some time when the cite of the
rodes was beseged with such manner of a Tower moeuable of a merueillable
heighte and much more highere than the walls were / they of withyn seeing the
same great edyfyce coming against hem aduysed them self the night before of a
great cawtele / they perced the ground under the foundementes of the walls /
and there as they thought that the said great engyn called toure should be
brought / they dalff the earth and made a great pit as a cave under the
ground there / through which polycie when the day was come that ye said
toure was brought thereupon his wheles and was of merueyllouse poys and heavy /
hit foundred and sanke down in to the ground that holowe was vndrenethe so
that hit might not be had up again / And by this way was the cite warauntyssed
/ And it is to be known that some time every moeuable Ioyncture of such engyns
had a name appropryed / as it shall be exposed hereafter / And so when the said
Towers were Joined to the walls / the archers the slynge casters and al men of
shot / and in like wise the men of arms eueryche of hem in their rowme forced
themself to take ye walls upon and fro them of withinne which after their
power challenged and kept them from ye enmies / So were the walls pourprysed /
And set round a boute with ladders Where as they of without put hem self
In great Ieopardye of their lives for to cle^me up to the walls the which
manner of clemi^ge up with ladders was first found by them of the cite of
Capne / upon whom they of within casted vessels full of stones and them and
their ladders with them bare down al a tones / there were also engi^s that
called were sambuce / exester thelemon / sambuce is an engyn which is made in
manner of a harp able to perce awalle and it is made fast with cords to the
said tower / Exester was called the brygge that was let sodai^ly down for to
go upon it fro the tower upon the walls / thelemon was an engyn that was pight
in the ground in manner of a high maste / and at the top of hit was made
fast croswyse another more long that went up and down like a balance does /
and at the one end of it that was towardis ye wall a litell castle made
with hirdellis and bordes well joined and when this litel castle was filled with
men of arms / ye other end of this thelemon was lad adoune with cheines and
ropis till that other end was a litel higher than the wall and thus fought
there the said men of arms that were within the said litel castle age ynste
them of the town / The deffe^ce aienst the said engyns were good mangonnelles
and great bombardes and great stones that with engyns were cast / and great and
big crosbowes well bended with synewes and strong ropys

The remedies aienst the forsaid engyns of asawte / Capitulo / xxxvj
Against the engyn which is called mouton vegece techeth many a remedy that is
to wite / that coyltes or matrases or sacques full of dounge large and wide as
coyltes / shall be hanged down against the wall where as the maste shall smite
/ and by the softnes of thees things so hanged a long the wall the stroke of
the said engyn shall be corremped and vain / Item men make another engyn which
is called wolffe that has an iron bowed with great and sharp teeth which
engyn is in such manner set to the wall that hit comes and gropith the
maste of the mowton / and holds it so fast that hit can not be draw another
forward nor bakward / and some time they draw him with ropes up wardys so that
hit can not hurt them no more / Item and if it happeth that the wall be by
force perced or taken then shall they of the fortress make with all haste
another wall against the broken wall / and shall close their enmies if they
can between both walls and there they shall slay hem

Remedy against the mine / Capio^ xxxvij
Against that other manner of sawtynge of a fortres that is to wite by way of
vndremynynge that made is under the earth / may be such remedies had / First
they of within must always set a good watch upon the hyhest parties of
their towers / to take good keep whether they can see from any where men
beringe earth or some sign whereby any suspecion may be had / and with this they
ought often to harken both day and night down of the wall if they can here
any noise or smiting of hamers / and if it happeth them to perceive any thing
/ they ought soon to make a co^tremyne till that they come to the vndremyninge
of their enemies / and there with good sperys and demi lances shall keep that
they shall delue no ferther / but first they shall have ready at the entree of
their contremine great tubbes and other vessels full of water and of piss /
and then they shall make as they did flee and at their gooinge out they
shall lightly spylle ye watre castyng the tubbes and other vessels dounward /
and if by the help of the women the watre might be sedi^ge bote hit were yet
the bettre for / and by such manner of way diverse myners have be caughte and
slain / Item we put cas that they of the ost should have do so much that
they had won the walls / the towers and the yates of the cite / shall they
of withi^ne let hem self be slain therefore as bestes / and by busshement and
fere to be taken as men take the quayle under the sperhawke / Nay / but as
valiant vasselles deffendyng always to the death and having still a good
hope / they ought to mou^te up to the wyndowes of the houses and upon ye
thakkes / and with great stones and tyles / sedynge water / hot asshis and
quyk lyme / they shall kylle and slay their enemies as they go here and there
by great hepes for to spoylle the town / and as they shall trow to set the
houses on a fire then shall they of the town brain hem with stones which
they shall cast down / and so dear they ought to selle their flesh that
hit be not for their enemies avaylle / For in such a cas a bold courage
doubts no thing / and by this manner of way many cytees and towns that
were surprised of their enemies have be delivered free fro them to their
tryumphall victory and to the shamefill rebuke of the enemies / for it is an
ouere great a thing for men of arms to enter in another town so that hit be
well garnysshed and the dwellers of the same being of a good courage for to
deffende and naturally al man is bold in fensinge of that / that is his own /
O what great and a merueillable bronde of courage had they of the cite of
mayence against their enmyes when they saw that they might no more hold against
ye romans that had kept siege so long before their cite / for as they ye
would rather deie and distroie the ire cite and their gods / than that their
enmyes should thereof be mastres nor enjoy their great tresors / for sore
rich they were / they did set al their cite on a fire / that great horroure
was for to see all that there was in a flame where as perysshed both women and
children / And a noone after issued out and full dear they sold their great
ire and their death unto the rommayns their enemies / of which were many
slain or ever they could bring them at an end / and nothing they gat there
/ One thing lerneth vegece / It is that if thenhabytantes are come to this /
late hem well keep hem self that they shette not the yates of their town / For
he says / that in such a caas men ought to give rowme to his enemy for to
goo a way if it seems him good by cause that if he were kept close / than
might his strength be doubled within him self said that no power he should
have to slay if need were / Item it happeth oftentimes that they of the oost
do feign by cawtelle that they depart away and with this goo some what far
as some time did they of Greece / before the great Troy after the feigned peace
But soon after when they thought that they of within were as assured and that
they made no great force of no watch nor kept not hem self upon their ward
/ then the greeks all still by night time returned and dressed their ladders
to the walls / and went up where they fond the watchemen sore weary of long
watch done in time past / that trowed then to be sewre / a sleep and cowpled
one to other and so lightly they slew them all / And by this manner of wyle
many cytees and towns have be taken / Thus was the great cite of troy
distroyed and semblably should the cite of rome have be dystroyed that time
that haniball of cartage was at sege before had not be the cry of the ghoos
that by adventure awaked the watch / and because that such things are
como^ly at all owres / And little houses ought to be made upon the walls for
to keep the watchemen from cold in winter / and fro the Son in the somer /
And in old time was an usage to norrysshe great mastyuys and sore bytynge
dogs in the said little houses and within the towers / to the end that by them
should be known by their smellyng the coming of their enemies / With thees
manners and ways of deffences / techeth vegece to them that be beseged and
closed to be curyouse and dylygent for to wite and know by spies and other
means the couyne of their enemies / Nor nothing is more helping For by this
they may the bettre appoynte their doings / Whereby if they be of a good
courage and that they may know that their adversaries be not upon their ward
/ or that they be at their refeccyon taking / or sportyng here and there / nor
have no suspecyon that they of within com out to be fight hem / then shall
they suddenly attones run without the town upon hem / Ane namely if they
can^ issue out of some fause door or posterne at the bak side it is the bettre /
and they must keep well that their couyne and entreprise be not accused nor
known / whereby some busshement might be set for them by their adversaries
that should slay hem as they should com out / But if they can / surpryse them
by the forsaid manner of way and that a hardy courage led hem / they shall
mow make hem self quit at that time of them / and to this purpos of a hardy
courage of cytezeyns making deffence for their cite / hit was seen full
merueyllouse within the hertes of them of the cytee of munyence in hyspayne
that time that the romans by diverse bataylles / had brought hem so low that
they durst make no more noon issue out of their strong cytee / Nevertheless
they delybered among hem that they should rather d^ie all than to live as
bo^dmen / but first they would selle hem self fall dear fightyng with their
enemies / And therefore of such a quantyte of corn as they had did brewe a
drink myxte withsuche manner of gere ye astre they had taken hit they were all
dronken So issued they out then and so great fayttes of arms they made /
that or euere they could be all dystroyed / they had slain almost al their
enmyes / And if that any party had be equal in quantite to that othre party /
not one Romayn should have be left there alive But to the first purpos says
vegece And if it hap to fall so / that this enterprise be not fortunable for
them / and that they be Robustly rechassed / they must before have ordained
that the yate be redely open for them And if the enmyes be so hardy that they
come till upon the brygge or namely within the gate following the chasse / they
must be soon shet and closed wythinne / and that upon the wallees be stones
enough / and good shot for to co^ueie them th^ns ^ al manner of engyns so that
they all nor no great ^ee^e return not a live / so shall not the getyng be al
together for them / But yet it is a great parell for to fight upon a brigge /
Exsample by a king of Gallya called Brenyus which with his great oste that he
led against the rommayns / he onercharged so sore the brygge that he had do
make of timber upon the ryuere of the rosne that hit brak and therefore were his
men peryssed there / Item and if it hap that by a manner of patysse or by some
accord or treatee should be bespoken for to have or delyuere afortresse men
must soueraynly be aduysed and wyly that the untruth and trychery of some
evil and malycyouse folk may not deceive the innocencye of the simple / For it
has be seen many times that evil couenaunces and peace by fyctyon made under
color of good concordaunce have let much more than has done strength of
arms

Of bataylles that be made upon the sea / Capio^ xxxviij
Following the things be fore said he touches shortly enough at the end
of his book / of some couenable weyes longing to bataylles that be made upon
the sea or upon flodes and ryuers / And first he speaks of the facion and
making of the ships and galeyes / saying that another in march nor in
aperyll the trees that then have habondaunce of humore ought not to be field
a down for to make any ships with all / but must be cut and thrawen down
in Iully and in the month of Auguste when the humidytee of the trees begins
for to dry up / and that namely the bordes that thereof be sawen and made
thereof ought not to be occupied till that the weet be cleen goon fro them and
that they may shrynke no more / With this he says that for to naylle the
bordes of ships / the naylles made of bras are best / how well that naylles of
iron be stronger / but by cause that the bras has more of moistenes within him
self it keeps bettre and more long in watre without rotynge Item he says that
they that by the sea wol goo be it in armee or to some other adoo / ought
syngulerly to purueye of good maryners expert and good maistres that be able to
that office / and that can well skyl of the wyndes / and which thing may
let hem and which not from the parelles of the sea / and that know the
ways and the straytes / and al so the manner of coming out and of al manner
hauenys and passages / and that can good skyle of the light marynall that is
to say the signs and sterres of heaven whereunto the good maryners taken their
regard and dresseth them to their right way / And also in all other tokens
wyhche shown fortune of the sea to come shortly which tokens appyeren as well
by the son as by the move / by the wyndes and by the birds and namely by the
fysshe of the sea / And that they be all mastres of rewlyng of their saylles /
of drawyng of ropys and kables when time is / and as well of casting as taking
up of their ancres when need requires as when they find hem self in bataylle
upon the sea / and in other adventures Item the purueaunces duly made as it
apparteyneth / for to arraye a caruell right well for the werre or such
veselles as men have / they must be well furnysshed with good men of arms and
of shot / and he says / that thoo that goo for to fight upon the sea /
apparteyneth to be bettre and more strongly armed / than thoo that fight upon
the land / by cause they meue not so much / So ought they to have among hem
some small vessels made at advauntage that may row and saylle before all
other every where for to aspye and know the couuyne of their enemies / and
when they come nyghe to seek them / men ought then to great hem right well
with good bombardes and stones cast with diverse engyns and with strong
balesters / and when the ships ben proched till each other / the valiant men
of arms that trusten in their strength put down the brygges and passen
ouere in to the ships of their adversaries and there with good swerdes axys
and daggers they fight together hand to hand / And in the grettest vessels of
werre men make some time towris and barbacanes to the^de that like as men do
from the high walls they might cast done dartis and wound and slay / It is
a cruel thing of such a bataille where as men not only by arms but also by
fire and by watre do perysse and having no powere to glanche a side nor to
flee / are lyuered oftentimes there all quyke and hole to the flode and unto
the fysshes brennyng arowes and darts ben there thrawen that be lapt in tawe
in brimstone in pitche and in oil / against the bordes of the ships that be
made of dry wode and enoynted with pitche which lightly be taken with the
fire / And thus sum perysshen there by iron / some be there brent and the
other be constrained to lepe in to the watre without any mercy / and by thees
ways perysshen dyuersly many one that fight upon the sea

Deuyseth of the garnysons that behouen to men of werre that been upon the sea /
Capytulo / xxxix
SO ought fyghters upon the sea to be garnysshed of vessels full of pytche
and of rosyn / of brymstone and of oil which things ought to be meddled
altogider and lapt al in tawe / and thees vessels kyndled and glowyng hoot
men ought to cast in to the ships and gallees of the enemies / and to
assaille hem strongly forthwith / to the end that they have no leiser to
quench the fire / and it is to be known that there is a manner for to make
and compose certain fire which some folk call grekys fire / and yt may be so
called well / by cause that it was first found by the grekys being at the sege
before troy / as some sayen / This fire brenneth namely in watre / and stones
and iron and al other things hit wastes Nor hit can not be quenched / but by
certain myxtyons that men make for this cause / Also there be made certain
poisons so strong and so mortal / that if any iron were touched with the same
/ and after ward shot or thrawen to the body of any man so that the blood lytyl
or great came out / the wound should be dedely / But such things ought not to
be do nor taught for cause of the evylles that might follow For they that so
do are deffended and accursed It is not good to write them in books / nor more
plamly to recyte them / be cause that it is not lycyte to no christian man to
use of no such inhumanitees that namely ben aienst all right of werre / It
they that fight ought always to awayte of al their powere to drive and set
their enemies a ground and to keep them self in the depnes of the sea / Item
to the maste of the ship ought to be made fast a bygge tree which shall be
armed with iron of that one part / and there set by such a craft that men
may have him up and down for to give great strokes with all against the ship
of the enemies and so may be bruised to pieces / which engyn may serve as does
the mowton a forsaid / It they must have great foyson of arowes with broad
hedes that shall be shot against the saille till that it be so peced and so rented
that it can not hold wind no longer so shall they not conne goo no ferthere
Item a crooked iron mistereth them made after the facion of a ze^^ll well sharp
and trenchaunt with a long hafte where with all they shall cut asondre the
ropis and cords that seruen to the ship of the adversaries and with hokes of
iron that they shall cast withinne they shall grype her / and so shall bring
her and theires together so that they shall not mow escape It it is good to have
great quantyte of pottes filled with soft zande / which after they be ones
cast in to the ship of the enemies they can vnuthe stand upon their fete so
slydrye it is so fall they then in to the watre that be nyghe the borders of
the shypp / And semblably ben good to be cast therinne pottes full of quyk lyme
made in to pouldre which at the brekyng of hem shall fylle al their eyes and
their mouths so that with pain they can see before them / It with this they
ought to be garnyshed of certain men that be learned and taught to swyme and
plonge in to the watre / and with a long breath to keep them self therynne /
which men shall goo under the schip of adversaries whiles that the bataylle
lasts and with great wymellis and awgours shall perce the ship vndreneth in
diverse places so that the watre shall enter on all sides / Item great foyson of
stones / and sharp yrons ought to be there lanched aand thrawen and al other
things whereby they may sooner break the ship / After the foresaid things I may
now well use of vegece his own words at the end of his book thus saienge /
I believe that from hens forth I may well hold my peace of the dyscyplyne of
arms / For in thees things the custom and usage find often more of the art
and of new things than thau^cyent doctrine does show /

Here fynyssheth the second party of this book / and sequently follows the
third party that speaks of the ryghtes of arms after the laws /
THe first chapitre deuyseth by what mean xprystyne added to this book that

Here after begins the third part of this book which speaks of the
ryghtys of arms after the law wryton /
The first chapter deuyseth by what mean Crystyne added to this book that
which is said in the law of the fayttes of arms
As I did awayte for to enter in to the third party of this present book /
and that my wit / as almost weary of the pesau^t weight of the labor concerning
the two other parties precedent / and as surprysed with sleep lyenge upon my
bed appiered before me the semblau^ce of a creature having the form of a
stately man of habyte of chere and of maynten / and like to awyse and right
auctorised judge which said unto me thus / dear love crystine of which in deed
or ellis in thought the labor of ye excercyse of studienge never more does
cease / at the conte^placyon of the great love that thou haste to thoo
things that the lettres can show / specially in exhortacyon of all noble
works and virtuous condycyons am hither now come for to be as to thy help in
the perfourmynge of this present look of knyghthode and of fayttes of arms
where as thou by great dyligence moeued with agood will do occupy thy self
/ And therefore confortinge the good desire that thou haste to give a cause unto
all knights and noble men that shall mow read or here hit / for to employe and
more embellysshe hem self to thoos deeds that nobleness requires / that is to
wite to the said excercyse of arms / as well by labor of the hody as by the
right that after the law wryton behooves them / It is good that thou take and
gadre of the tree of bataylles that is in my gardyn sum fruytes of which
thou shall use / So shall vygoure and strength the bettre grow wythyn thy
self therefore for to make an end of thy pesaunte work / and for to bylde an
edyfyce pertynau^t and couenable to the sayenges of vegece and of the other
auctours of which thou have taken help / thou must cut yet asonder some of
the branches of this said tree / and take of the best / and upon the same
timber thou shall set foundement of one of thy said edyfyce / For the which
to perform / I as master / and thy self as dysciple / shall be there with the
as thy helper / Thees things herd me seemed then that I said to him / O
dygne master I know that thou art that same study which I love and have
loved so much that of nothing more I remenbre me by whose hauntynge and virtue
I have al ready thanked be god brought at an end many a fair enterprise /
Certes of thy company I am right glad / But where it ought not to dysplease
the master if a dyscyple desyrouse of learning moeueth questyons / I pray the
to tell me if any rebuke shall mow be cast to the regard of my work for
this that thou have counseylled me for to use of the said fruit / S^re love
to this I ansuere the / that the more that a work is wytnessed and approved of
more folk / the more it is auctorysed and more auctentyke / and therefore if
any d^o murmr after the gyse of evil speke^s sayieng that thou beggest in
other places I ansuere them that it is a common use emonge my dyscyples to give
and depart one to other of the flowers that they take dyuersely out of my
gardyns / And al thoo that help hem self with all they were not the first that
have gadred them / Did not master Ioh^n de Mown^ help him self with in his
book of the rose of the sayings of Lorrys / and semblably of other / It is
then no rebuke / but it is lawde and praysynge when well and proprely they be
applycked and set by order / and there lies the maystrye thereof / and it is
a token to have seen and vifyted many books / But there as were evil to propos
men should do serve things which were taken ellis where / there were the
vice / do so then hardly and doubt the not / for thy work is good / and I
certyfye the / that of many a wise man hit shall be yet right well commended and
praised

Crystyne demands if by right the emperor may moeue werre against the pope
Capitulo / ij /
Then me seemed that I said so sithen yt it is so / right solemn judge that
I shall add in my book of arms and of knyghthode yet of the fruytes gadred
out of thy gardine by thy commandment / using of them I shall ask of the
so^me questyons / which apparteine to the said matiere of arms / that is to
wite of the ryghtes that behouen thereto after the law and right wryton / And
first of all entering in the said matyere I demand of the Since that it is
truth that as in the beginning of this bok I said / and thy self well I wot
shall not deny hit / that werres and bataylles after right behouen not to be
mayntened nor Iuged but by the erthely princes that of no thing hold their
lands and countrees / but only of god / as Emperoures / kings dukes and
other namely that be lords / Whether the Emperor of rome that as to
temporell Iurisdicyon / is the pryncypall of the world / may make after right
wryton werre against the pope / and if it so be that he thus entrepryseth hit /
whether his men and sugettes / be bounden for this cause to come to his
calling / For hit seems that they should do so / by cause that Iurysdyctyon
and lordshyp is due to him more than to any lord of the world / and another
more strong a reason there is / that is to wite that it apparteyneth his
subgettes to be to him obeyssaunt / or ellis forfayt and forswere hem self of
that which they have promised him what so euere he be good or wikked al were
he stismatyke and acursed / dear love to this question I ansuere the / that to
moeue him werre after right / he may not / and see here ye reasons that the
law writon theru^to does assygne first for because that he is procuratoure of
the church / So it were a great oultrage that the procuroure should be
against the master the which he ought to deffende there as he should offend
It the emperor is subgecte to the pope / this can he not deny / For hit
appyereth clerly by this that his electyon apparteyneth and so much lies in
the pope that hit bilongeth to him to inquire if he be a man ydone and hable to
the sea Imperyall / and whether the electyon be duly made or not And for to
crown him / Thus then since that he is subgette unto the pope It were great
wrong that subgette should do against the sovereign / And yet I say to the
more / that if the Emperor rules not him self and his Empire after the laws
of a good Emperor / the pope / may take from him the dygnyte Imperyalle / And
shall stablysshe another in his place / So ought not then nor may not the
subgettes obey after right to the calling of such a werre but if they will
dysobeye god in persecutyng of his church

Whether the pope may moeue werre against the Emperor or not Capitulo iijo^
Since that it is so sweet master / that the Emperor may not nor ought not to
moeue werre against the pope / I ask the wether the pope may moeue hit against
him / for it should seem nay / seeing that he is lieutena^t to Ih^u christ in
earth so he owes to ensewe his steps which were all peasyble nor never
helped him with werre and with this he said to his apostles / that they should
not use of lordshyppes as do princes and lords / Item with this said saint pol
/ that they of the church ought not to Revenge hem / but ought to overcome by
suffrau^ce / I ansuere the putting thees reasons apart / and all other such /
that the pope without faille may moeue werre against the emperor in some cas /
that is to wite / if he by adventure be heretyke or scysmatike / It if he would
usurp the right of the church and take from her her patrymonie and her
enherytau^ce and Iurisdycyons / and well I say to the / that in thees cases / he
only may not make him werre / but should be holden all Christian princes and
other namely of the empire / to help the pope as some time it happed to the pope
Alexaundre the third of this name / the which persecuted of the emperor
went for his refute to the king of France that put him again in to his place
/ and nothing it were that some should say / that god said to saint peter /
that he should put his knyfe again in to the shede / which was for to say
that with no gleuys the church should not smite / For he said not that he
should cast hit away from him / but that he should put hit up in to the
shethe again / which was to be signyfyed / that he should keep hit for the time
to come / For at that owre he would not use of hit in deed /

Of the puyssaunce and auctoryte of the captain of the princes knyghthode
after the law / and for wh^at things men of arms may run in to capital
pain / Capytulo / iiijo^
Master it suffyseth me enough as to this cas / But please the to tell me if
I have here before all enough suffysauntly spoken of thoffice of the head
captain of the oost of the prince how be it that other times I have be
infourmed of many things pertynent to his office / yet I desire to here more
thereof of the / fair love to this I ansuere the that fair / and well thou
haste said thereof Yet may thou add thereunto other auctorytees that the
laws give him with the charges that apparteyne to him / that is to wite to
give license to his men of arms for to go where it is need / as well for their
own besynesses in time couenable / as for the fayt of y^ werre with out which
license they owe not to vndretake no thing / So it apperteyneth to him to
comytte them here and there to the proffyte of the werre after his good advise
and the counseille that he has / and to him apperteyned to give good keep
that fro the country no man of werre depart for to goo some else where without
the lordis leave / And ought to keep the keys of the castelles and of the
towns there as be gooynge to the werre has lodged him self Item to him
belongs to comytte and ordeyne them that shall keep watch in the oost / and
to take dylige^tly keep upon all the his what mesure of corn and of wine / and
that the weight and all such things be there Just / and to punysshe them
that falsely use of the same Item to him apparteyneth to here and vndrestonde
the debates and questyons of them of the ost / and to Judge thereof dooyng right
to every one / be it gentyl man merchant or other that to him does complain
upon any of his / Such and many other ben that long were for to sa^e which
behouen to a head captain But with this for to learn the bett^^ I will say the
cases after our laws whereby the men of werre may run in to peine capital /
the law says that ^e that smyteth the captain by evil will ought to lose y^
head / and like wise he ought to lose his head which is rebel and gainsainge in
ordinance of a bataylle / It semblably he that first renneth away fro ye
bataille if the other abide stylle there It he yt is sent as for a^baxatoure to
ye adversaries or for to aspye them if he opens or by any way declares ye
secrets of his party / It he that excuses him self by a made and untrue
escusacyon by cause he wol not be at ye bataille with his lord / Item he
that deffendeth not to his power his captain if he see other that assaille him
/ It who that departs fro the ost without leave for to make other armees
renneth also after the law in to pain capital what someuere other good or
fair act that he make other where / It that lets that peace be not made /
It that procures that in the oste be dyscencyon and mortal ryote made / Item
that steleth or robs the prouysyons of the oste /

Whether the vasselle is holden after right for to goo in his lordys werre at
his own costs / Capitulo / v
By cause that it is of costume that every king or prince or lord do sommone
or call his vassell for to be his aid in faitte of werre I ask if the said
vassell is holden for to goo after ye laws to the calling of his lord / and
if it be thus that he is bound for to do so / whether it ought to be at his
own expenses and costs or at the costs of the prince or lord / dear love
for to ansuere the bettre to thy demand it behooves to advise and see what
thing conteyneth the oath of fydelyte that he makes that enters in feyth of
some land or possessyon moeuable in fee from some lordis lorshyp / so ben there
then six pryncypall couenau^ces after the decret and law civil / The first
is that by his oath he shall neuere pourchasse that day that he lives the
do^mage of his lord Nor in no place he shall be to his knowledge where it is
machyned nor purchassed The / ij / is that he shall neuere dyscouere nor tell
his secret of that thing that to him might be preiudiciable / the / iij / that
he shall be for him in all manner of cas just good and reasonable against all men
exposynge both his body and his powere at his need in fayttes of werre well
and truly at al times that he shall be required / The fourth that he shall
neuere be consentyng to the damage of his goods / possessions nor herytages
nor against his well The fyfth that if it hap that his lord have to do of
him of any thing that he goodly can do he shall not excuse him / saying that
ouere strong and to dyficyle it is to him for to do / The / vj / that he
shall not seek no way for to excuse him self for to let that he shall not
goo to his lord at his commandment and calling / Such ben or ought to be
after the decretall and civil right the promesses by feythe and other made of
the vassal to his lord / By the which promysses hit appyereth enough that
the vassalles be holden for to be with their lord and for him in his werres /
and to serve him well and truly with all their puyssaunce under thoblygacyon of
lesynge of all their lands that they hold of him as forfayt to the sovereign
And as god says in the gospel / who that is not with me is against me / so
ought to be reputed to be against their lord thoo that faille him in this
behalffe / And therefore they ought to be dyspoynted of the lands that they so
hold but nevertheless no law byndeth them not that they at their own
costs should serve / but to the lords own propre wages / without it were
that the land were bound so to do of auncyente / As it is of certain towns
that at their own costs and expenses be holden to serve their prince
during certain space of time of some quantyte of folk in his werres / And good
is there the reason why they ought not so / For why nor for what occasyon
should the lord take the lences of his lands upon the men and many other
charges / but it were for to maynten his estate and put in tresoure for to
sustain with all his werres if need be to him / but not therefore without
faylle / if it were so that the lord had no more where with to maynten them /
and that his demayne suffysed not / and had necessyte specially for to keep and
deffende his land / his subgettes of right are holden to set a subsydye upon
them self / or ellis to gadre them self together till a certain nombre all
appareylled in arms for to help him at their own expenses / And in cas
that they were not willing so to do / they may be of right constraygned
therefore / specially if the enemies were come upon his land to run upon him
/ For after the law deffensable werre is preuyleged much more than is the
werre offensable / But truth it is that if a prince or lord had need to take
such aid / he ought to keep well that it be not to the undoing of his people /
nor he ought not to employe hit to noon other use / lest hit should be to his
great charge / and the cou^seiller that other wise should conseylle him / hit
were to his dampnacyon Nor no good king or prince ought not to take heed nor
harken after the feyned words of such a counseyller / but ought to hate him
as enemy both to his soul and to his body / For he should counseylle him his
dampnacyon / and should put him in the way to lose the love and good will
of his subgettes /

Whether the feed men or vassalles ben more holden to help their sovereign
lord / than namely their naturell lord And if a gentyl man holds two
feodable tenementes of two lords which make werre one against that other /
which of both shall the gentyl man help / Capitulo / vj /
Sweet master soylle me this question / I say sith that it is so that a
vassal is holden for to help his lord of whom he holds his land against
every man It seems then that if a king or prince had werre aienst some of
his barons / that the subgettes of the baron of whom they hold should be
bound to help their lord against ye king or prince / For to the king they
have not promised no fealtee but only to their lord of whom moeueth their
life lode whithout excepcyon Dear love to this questyon I shall shortly ansuere
without faylle / how well that by reasons ynouhe thou may argue with saying
that as well may the little man help him self of his after the law / as d^eth
the great / and thus then / why shall not the baron help him self with his
men that fealtee have promised him / and not to the king etc^ / And many other
things that thou might adledge to this purpos / nevertheless I tell the
that all reasons to the contrary / after our laws ben admilled and of no
value / For in good feyth no subgett is not holden to help him of whom he
holds his land against his sovereign lord / but mysdoeth and puts him
self if he so do under pain capytall / as he that offends the ryall mageste
/ For what thowhe the baron be lord natural to the subgett / Nevertheless the
king or prince under whom^ they be is sovereign / And if thou say to me /
then do they forsuere hemself / I ansuere the / Nay / For noon oath can not
bind noone to do evil / which they should do for to hold in wykkednes with
their lord that would be against their sovereign lord / Dear master a more
hard questyon and that all enough depends here of I will to ye make I
suppose that two barons of the reame of France or of some other country have
werre one against the other for the which cause they send and call their men
/ and soon hit happeth that the king for his werres and deffence of his land
has need of men and he makes his maundement in which are comprysed the
subgettes of the said two barons / so ask I now of the if they be bound for
to come to the king at his maundement and calling / or ellis to goo to
their lord / To this question conformynge the precedente / I ansuere the that
after right and law they are holden to come to the king and leave their lord
/ And three reasons assygneth thereunto / the first is / that the kings werre or
of the prince sovereign beholds the common well and vtylyte of all the realm
or land / the which werre ought to be more previleged than the synguler
vtylyte of a baronye / The second is / that they are holden to the king of a
general iurisdictyon which is of most auctoryte / and has a hghe powere
ouere the low Iurysdycyon of a baronye / Te third reason is / that hit
apperteyneth not / that the low offycer have auctoryte nor puyssaunce to be
obeyed before the lord / and leseth his powere / as soon as the auctoryte of
the sovereign prince comes forth / as the light of a candelle is little and
is lost / as soon as that the bemes of the some comes on / Yet another
questyon I put unto the / I suppose that an Earl or a baron of the realm of
Fraunde / holds certain lands of the king of Arragon or of some other king
/ and that it happeth so that all upon one time the said two kings of France
and Arragon / send for the said Earl or baron for to help them in their
werres / to which of thees two kings shall he then obey / For Imposyble it
is to be in two places attones / and it should seem that he might be excused
fro going to another of both / I ansuere the shortly that he can not excuse
him self another of the one nor for the other without he wol lose the right of
fealtee / That is to wite / that he must goo to that one of which he holds
most / and to that other he shall send a certain of his men / A more hard
questyon I the demand / if it hap that the said two kings a boue said make
werre one against the other / I can not feel nor vndrestande to which of both
he ought to goo / but that he shall lose one of his Lands / I say to the /
that the precedente ansuere may yet serve to this questyon after some opynyons /
that is to wite to goo to the one / and send to the other / but this thing
cowde not be well supported in right / For if he should do so / then must
his own men be against him / And therefore no bettre remedy nor way I can
herto / but to chese the one that him shall best please / and to leave and for
sake that other of all points / or ellis to have grace of either of them that
he shall not arm him self nor noon of his for to give aid to another of both
/ And know thou what to such a vassal apperteyneth / On my feyth / to
endeuoyre him self of all his puyssaunce that peace may be found between hem
both

Whether all souldyours may goo after the law to al manner of werre and
deuyseth the parell wherynne the man of werre puts him self for to goo to
the werre other wy^se than the right of werre requires / Capitulo / vij /
Master as by the I vndrestande me seems that the subgettes be bound for to
goo to the werre with their lord if they be called and sommed for to do so
/ not at their expenses / but taking wages of their lord etc^ / So soil
me then if yt please the another questyon / I ask the / though hit be so
that the coustume is enough general emonges men of werre / that who will take
wages of all lords / towns or countrees for to serve in all manner of werres /
they all being of one country borne or of what strange lands that they be of
/ If this men of werre that be not all of one Country nor subgett / may
licytely do so For it should seem nay / seeing that fayttes of werre must be
excecuted by occysion and other diverse euylles / which things be deffended
emonge christian folk by the laws of god / To this questyon dear love I ansuere
the And thy self have touched of hit al enough in the bygynnyng of this book /
that to al Just werre may goo every man that will and take wages for to serve
to the same / for a Just werre for to keep or recouere right / whereof the
right ways thereof be not trespassed / that is to wit that spoyllynges nor
robberye be not made upon the country where friends be / nor other diverse
greuaunces and dommages of which men of werre comynly vsen wikkedly in which
dooynge they mysdoo greatly / is not unjust nor deffended by the law / but it
is permytted to be / For it is a very excecusyon of Justice that god suffered
and consents / to then de that wrong may be brought again to right / thonghe
that god suffers werres to be made some time dyuersly against right and reason /
the which is as the scourge of god / and punyshyng for the sin of the folk
/ but for to come again to the first propos / I say to the that every man that
right wisely will expose him self to werre / he ought first to be right
enfourmed of the quarelle / and know whether the challenge be just or not and
if thou ask me how he shall mow know the same For of all parties that folk
do make werre euerychone says that the caul^e of his quarelle is just / Late
him enquere if such werre has be Iuged first of good Iurystes or lawers / or
whether it be for cause of deffense making / For in cas of deffence al werre
is good that is to wit / to deffende his country if hit be assaylled / And
that hereof ought the man of werre to be well enfourmed or euere he put him
self thereto / I wol thou know that if the quarelle be Unjust / he that thus
exposes him self dampneth his soul / and if he deyeth in such astate he
goes in to the way of perdycyon without great repentance at the last / but
litel force they make thereof / For enough there be that care not what the
quarelle be / so that they have good wages and that they may rob / Helas the
dolent and sorrowful death coming oftymes suddenly may send them in to hell
anon with one stroke only /

Here speaks of the wages of Souldyours / Capio^ viii
TO the end that the noble men that this present book shall mow read or here /
as well for the time present as that is to come / may know of which things
the law gives license to be done in the werre / and of which not And by
cause dear love that here before thou have remembered me of wages that
souldyours ought to have / I shall tell the one party of that wherynne the man
of werre byndeth him self taking wages / and also in what manner the lord is
holden to pay the said wages / and in what manner not / For such things be
contained in the law First it is to wite that every lord / or certain town
or common lordship / that taken folk in to wages / is holden to pay them for all the time that they be so taken be they put to work or not / and namely
supposed that they were soiournynge and did nothing / so that the fawte were
not in them and that they were always ready for to employe themself / and if
fawte of payement be there made after the promise I say that by right and
reason / they may ask hit by fair Justice / Now master since that in this
matere we be entered and that ye say that the lord is holden to pay the men of
werres wages supposed that they were al ways abiding in one place naught
dooynge / I wol to this propos make unto the some demau^des / First I suppose
that a capytayne with a company of folk be retained in to the kings wages
and by his comau^dement is sent in to Guyenne or somwhere ellis against his
enemies and in going thither hit happeth so that they lodge hem self in a
certain place where the folk of the town have malycyously poysonned both
the bread and the wine there / whereby some of them dey and the other tarry
ther^e syke by the space that they should have served wherefore it is not in
their powere to serve the king as they had promised / So demand I of the
if they ought to have lost the wages of that time to this questyon I ansuere
that nay without faille / seeing yet that their maladye is caused of the
service / For syknesse by the law excuses the man nor for this case he ought
not to l^ese any dystrybucyon / sith that the malady is com to him after his
retenne in to wages / Another questyon I will make unto the If a souldyoure be
retained in to wages for a hole year and that in this mean time he have a do
in his house / wherefore he comes to the capytayne and takes leave of him for
to goo see his wyffe and his household for the space of a monethe / I ask the
if by right he ought to have his wages for the time that he is so absent / To
the same I ansuere the / that the nature of the right of arms is such / that
so great a might has the leave and license taken of the captain and it is of
so great a preuilage / that sith that the captain has with good will
granted the said leave / the said man of arms ought to be reputed as for
resydent and present / For always he is abiding servant to the lord sith
that he was retained for a hole year / But it is well truth that if he were
bound by dyuysyon of time / that is to wite that without moo he were retained
at a certain for every monethe / there should I speak otherwise / Another
questyon I make / A knight for a hole year is taken in to wages for to serve
the king in his werres / and after that he has served one quarter of the
year he wol depart and ask his wages for the time that he has served / and
the capytayne then gaynsaith hit saying that for one hole year he had taken
him / and if he had not be he should have taken another / and that whosoeuere
performs not his service he leseth his hyre / Wherefore if cas be that he goo
his way so he mortyfyeth his hyre / To this I ansuere the that good right
has the captain / For if the man of arms faylle first of his promysse / It
is not reason also that covenant of wages be kept unto him / Yet namely more
strong I tell the that if by h^ys own deffawte he had lost his ^orses or
his harneys / and that he might not recouere noon other / whereby he were not
able to serve / he in this cas ought to lose all the time that he has served
for service ought not to have no hyre till that hit be complissled / in cas al
ways that noon other covenant were made / For covenant and bargayne made
passes all law / And by all thus thou maiste see that the evil thing that
medl^ed is with the good / retourneth the good wyththe euylle / Master now
ansuere me to this demand / A valiant man of arms is taken for to serve all
a hole year soon after it happeth that he has much to do at his house
wherefore he wol goo / and taking his leave he says to the captain that he
shall put another for him in his rowme for to serve as he should him self /
and to this gaynsaith the capytayne saying that he had taken him for cause of
his worthynes good manh^ode and wisdom / and that with pain he should find
one that should suffysauntly keep his rowme / the souldyoure replycketh saying
that certain a do and besynes is come upon him whereby he should lose his land
and h^ys heritage if he in his own person were not there / and that by reason
he is more holden to help him self with his own strength and wisdom / than
any other / wherefore he may not nor can not compelle him to abide / The
capytayne ansuereth that he is bound unto him by oath upon the h^ly euangilles
and that a man is not at his own lyberte that byndeth him self to another /
Now master determyne thou this questyon / For seeing the reasons of the said
man and that in his place he will leave for him a suffysaunt man / hit should
seem that quyte he might goo / I ansuere the that for to determyne his questyon
great consyderacyons must be had / For it is no doubt but that of a common man
of arms should suffyse man for man / but to say that if he were so solemn
and so greatly able that with pain might another keep his rowme / and that he
should leave another for him much less than him self and not able / it were
not reason / but if it happed that he did put one as good as he / then wol
not I gaynsey his departing / For as I have told the before / a man of arms
is not master of him self / sith that he is bound to another by oath /
Therefore I tell the that such a man should not be thereof quyte what soeuere a
do that he hadd / but that the prince or head captain should hold him for
quytte by grace especyall / and a good reason is there / For if he had bound
him self to pay ten else of Scarlete and that he should pay instead of that
ten else of course kendall he ought not to be hold quyte therefore / thaughe it
be so that all be clothe /

Whether a captain of men of werre may change and take other at his will
after that they be ones retained / Capytulo / ix /
Master another questyon I make dependynge ynowh of that other aforsayde I
suppose that a capytayne of whens someuere he be is retained in to wages for a
hole year with an hondre men that he has brought with him wiche (...) made
all their mustres and are writon / It happeth (...) monethe after / he wol
change his folk all or a part thereof and put other in their places / I
ask of the if after right he may thus do and it should seem ye For it ought
to suffyse if he have a / C / men of arms couenable as he has promised / and
with this / if he might not do so and that he had noon auctoryte thereof hit
were to his great preiudyce / For if emonge his nombre he saw some evil men and
of perverse condycyons as thieves or keeping evil rule to the great hurt of
the other that be good / whereby he might be blamed / were it not then bettre
that they were changed / than left still in their rowme / to this I ansuere
the / that right is so Just a thing and so reasonable that hit wol be
vndrestand of every one without wrong to be done and therefore I tell the that
the pety captain which is under the captain pryncypall / may not godely do
this without the license of his greter / for if it were so / hit should lie in
him to make many extorcyons to the small felawes if hit should please him /
that is to wite / to take other for some favor or for coueytyse to take fro
them a part of their wages / or by what soever wyle / and to put out thoo ye
bettre were / so ought he to be aduysed before hand to take such felawes with
him that it be no need to change them / And if they must be changed by some
aduersyte that is in them / it is his dysworshyp when such he has chosen /
and if it happeth all ends that there must be change made and put another
he without faylle ought not to do so with out the love of the sovereign of the
oste / and that it be yet by a great consyderacyon / And if it happeth that by
himself and of his own auctoryte he d^eth it / It is no doubt / but that he
that so is put out of wages may complain him to the head captain specially
if be a man good and able / and ought to have right thereof / And to return to
the propos of the captains that be couetouse that many decepcyons and barates
may do to the small felawes there ben enough the which receive the hole
payement that they keep in their own hands and it suffyseth them to content
and pease their men with a lytyl thing / And paraduenture such felawes dare
not complain by cause their covenant / and bargayne was so made with them
for to be taken in to wages whereunto by such means they be retained anoone
which is a great sin to al capytaynes that so do For they be constrained
therefore to do many euylles more than they should do if they were well paid /
So should the head capytayne take good head to such things / For at lest
may not the pour souldyours being a foot or on horsbacke men of shot or other
but to have that pour payement and salarye that they win putting hem self
in parell of their lives and to so great a traueyll of their bodies ^ So
does he great sin that takes fro them or minushe^h their wages of any
thing / and also the ancye^t would never have suffered this / but they were
more contentthat the getyng should turn rather to the souldyours / than to
their own prouffyt / For the auaylle they would that they had / but the
honor did suffyse them to be reserved for them self / Here shows / if a
lord sent a man of arms for the garnyson of some fortress of his own
without that any wages be promised him / and it happeth that he is dystressed
and robbed by the way / to which of both he may ask his interesses and
damages / or of the lord that sent him or of him that so has dyspoylled him

Capitulo x /
ANother demand I make unto the I suppose that a lord has werre with
another lord / so sends he a knight to some fortres of his own for to keep
it without that any covenant of wages he make to him It happeth to this knight
by the way that his goods / his horses and his harneyse be by force taken
from him / to which of both may by right ask the said knight his loss or
of him that sends him / or of him that has robbed him I ansuere the that he
may ask it of either of both / that is to wit of him that has sent him by
actyon of maundement / and of the other by actyon of vyolence done in deed /
And if by the first is restytucyon made unto him / than is he holden to leave in
his hands thactyon and the right of the demand that he might have made to
that other / by strength and virtue of which / the lord that so has made
restytucyon to this knight may recouere hit upon that other / Now tell me
morouere / a baron has certain werre unto whom a knight of his curteysie
comes to his aid and in his felishyp whout that he be required thereof ^ I
demand of the / if the same knight after his service done may ask if it
please him any wages / For it should seem nay For why / he was not called
thereto / and it seemed that his intent was to serve him for a curtoysye / I
ansuere the to this / but if that he be of his kynne or lynage / or that he be
greatly holden to him / or that he were thither com by way of charity and love
/ he may curtoysly make asking without faylle some what for to sustain his
astate and living if it so pleases him for to do / For the law says that
noon is holden to arm him self for another at his own costs So ought to
suffyse the lord that he has had the socours of that other / And in asmoche
that more freely he is com the more beholden is the board unto him / And ought
to satysfye him / other by wages or by other gifts or benefayttes / Master I
suppose that the king of Arragon should send to morrow a great oost of his
folk to socoure the king of France in his werre for a certain space of time
of his own pure curtoysye without yt he had be required by no manner of wise
/ but should do this only for to yield again a such and semblable curtoysye
as he did receive some time / I ask of the whether this folk after their
service done may ask wages / For it should seem nay / sith that they have been
sent as a thing that was due / For how might they ask payement of that
wherefore they be come for to make satsfactyon there as they be bounden / I
ansuere the my love / that if the king of France has served some time the
king of Arragon or other in his werre of acerteyn nombre of men of werre paid
for space of time / as it is enough of custom emonge princes being good
friends / to do so that one to that other / Semblably is bound by right of
gentilnes the king of Arragon to do for the king of France at his need / Not
so / that by Right the king of France might ask hit of him / but if other
condycyon of covenant were there / For he that freely gives may not constrayne
to be rewarded / But in what som^uere manner that the coming be / the king of
France is holden by right to reward hem with yeftes / Yet I demand of the /
I suppose / that a lady the which is a wydowe holding a lordshyppe / be
oppressed by werre wrongfully of a great lord or knight / to the which
wydowes help goes a gentyl man moeued with pity and for to keep the ladies
right and to encreace his renommee in worthynes of knyghthode / and to say all
/ he does there so great fayttes of arms that thrughe his prowess / bri^geth
the said lady at a good end of her werre / and does a plain restytucyon to
be made unto her / might then this knight after ^ ^hees things by him thus
done ask any salary or wages for his benefayttes / as he that well has
deserved hit I ansuere to the that Nay / For without her mandement or call^ng
he might not constrayne her to give him wages / and if thou will say to me that
greatly he has done the proffyt of the lady / I ansuere the that more great
honor he has made his own / in as much that he is enhaunced thereby in
renommee of honor and worship So is he paid al ready of the salary and
reward that he sought / But well it is truth / that if the lady be of power
and that she have whereof she ought to deal so with him / that she give him
exsample and namely to al other in such a wise that if she had to do another
time she might be gladly socoured yet again /

If a king has werre with another and is wyllyng to run him upon / Whether
the lords by whose lands he and his oste must pass / may challenge him the
passage or not Capytulo / xij /
OF the things of arms I wol make unto the other manner of questyons I
suppose that the king of France for cause of some challenge or quarrel will make
werre against the king of hongry wherefore he does call his oste togider for
to go upon him / for the which cause the king of France writes to the duke
of austeryche yt thrughe his land he may pass away / and he assures him that
neither evil / hurt nor no damage shall not receive his country another by
him nor b^y his men / but rathere good and proffyte in asmoche that for his
money he shall take vytaylles there / The duke of austryche that makes doubt
of this promise / ansuereth to the king / that thereof he will be made sure by
good hostages / that restytucyon shall be to him made if any greeff or damage
is done unto him at this cause / So demand I now of the / what of right is
to be done in this byhalffe / For the duke says that he is prince withyn h^ys
land / so shall no man pass there through that bears arms without hit
please him / And of that other part / we put cas that he consents the same
/ yet it should be hard that such an oste should pass nor might pass
without great oultrages should be done and therefore he will have of restytucyon a
good surete / Love I ansuere the that by the right wryton / he that for his
good right and just quarelle goes to werre may and ought to have his way and
passages and common ways by all realms and lands so that no greeff nor hurt
be there made by him nor his men / And thus then sith that right gives it
him he needs not to give noon hostages for that which of right ought to be do
and this is wytenessed by the decretall where as it recyteth thystorye how that
when the people of Israel went against their enemies they must needs pass
through the country of the Amorres the which folk would gaynsaye the passage
/ but when they saw that they could not cheuyshe with them by love / they
wanne by force the passage as god ordained for them / So say I that semblably
it should be right and reason thus for to do in every cas like / I demand of
the master / I put cas that a baron of France / have moeued wrongfully and
by his oultrage werre against a knight in which he has borne him great damages
and gryeues / But for the time he can not find no way to have right of him
by Justice / Nevertheless he calls togider with him his friends with a great
rowte of men of werre for to run upon the said baron / the which of his
part deffendeth him self so well that he can not enter his land nor damage
him And by cause he hurts and domageth in deed the contreys that be next
neghbours to the land of the baron for because yt they he favorable to thaide
of his said enemy so takes he there proyes out of all sides and wexeth rich
thereof in so much that he can well show asmoche or more than he had before of
damage It happeth then that in paris they mete both togider afterward /
where as the said knyghtdoeth somone the said baron in the court of parlyament
/ and there he asks him restytucyon of the domages that he has done to him
wrongfully and without a cause in the said werre / To the which thing that
other ansuereth / that it ought well to suffice him of that which he has
gotten by means of the same werre / For where as before he was a powere knight
/ he was become rich by the proyes that he had gotten and taken / The knight
replycketh and says / that he has no thing a do of that that he has
won in pursuynge of his own and that it is nothing of his / and if he had
pugnysshed his neighbors of the sin that they did in forberynge him
wrongfully against him / it was not reason that their goods taken and that
were not his / should turn to him to the abolicyon of that that he owed him /
So ask I of the what of this is to be do / To this I ansuere the / that if
it were so that the knight had done so much that he had had of the goods of
the baron so much that h^e had be restored / then it should suffice by right
without faille / But if in making this werre he had won and taken ought upon
his neighbors by the means aforsaid / the which thing is right of werre /
the said baron is not thereof dyscharged nor excused in no thing / but he is
holden as he was before to such damages and Interesses that he has done unto
him by wrong hand / and well argues the knight of that that he says / For
if that other would say that it apparteyneth not no duete to be paid two
times therefore syn that he was ones paid it should suffyse / all this is no
thing / by cause that it is not to the regard of him / if he has won it
by way of werre / that is for the pugnicyon of them that gaafe aid and
counseyll to the said baron against him

Here shows if a man had be wounded and sore hurt of another / the which is
run away after the stroke was given / and he that is so hurt follow him and
at last should hurt him / Whether Justice should pugnysshe him therefore /

Item and if a man of arms boroweth horses and harnoys and leseth them /
Whether he ought to yield them again Capytulo / xij /
Master I remember me that thou have said here before / that to a man in
deffense is permytted to hurt another / And by cause that all hurtes and
betynges that be done by evil will one upon other / ben and may be called the
members dependynge of werre / I make unto the such a questyon / If a man have
hurt another and as soon that he has light his stroke upon he renneth away as
fast as he can / but he that is hurt follows after till that he overtake him /
and semblabli stryketh and hurts him / So demand I of the whether he that
follows ought to be punysshed / For it should seem by thyn own sayenges Nay /
seeing that he has not goon beyond the ways of Justice / sith that he was
first hurt / though he after wards hurts / and namely if he had slain him
by that that I vndrestande of right in deffensynge of his body / yet should he
be excused / and also he has done hit without taryenge / For if he had tarried
to the morn after I would not say that it were vengence I ansuere to this that
the cas that thou spekest of is dyffered fro Just deffense / the which is
preuyleged / that is to wite after the laws / For sith that the first fled
away after his stroke / the law grants not / that the other should
pursyewe him nor hurt him / and therefore he deserves punycyon / But truth
it is that more great punysshement has deserved he that first stroke and
hurted / And if the second has deserved great or little punycyon / among
the masters be thereof dyuerce oppinions / Nevertheless it is no doubt that the
first moeuynge that is in him to feel him self hurt and the hasty hete that
causes and chaffeth him sore to follow / excuses him much / wherefore more
moderatly he ought to be punysshed for / But and if he had slain that other
suddenly when he first stroke him / Justice should not have had ought to do /
with so that he can prove that he was assaylled and stryken first / by cause
that the law suffers to slay another for saving of his own lyffe / and if
thou tell me that it may be so / that he that assaylleth first has no will
for to slay / I ansuere the / that so does not he that is assaylled / And
also strokes be not stryken after no patron / For such weneth only to stryke
that sleeth / And therefore he that has the first stroke might well tarry so
long are he struck again that he should find him self the first slain / But
thees things not wythstandynge for conscience and for all ought aman to keep
him self as nyghe as he can that he slay not another / For nothing what
soeuere it be is more dyspleasaunte unto god than for to dystroye his like /
and he is the Judge that all the things after right punyssheth / nor nothing
can not be hid nor kept from him Another petycyon / A knight of almayne or of
some other country comes to paris where he fyndeth the king ready for to goo
to bataylle / the said knight that thereof was not aware / had not at that
owre no manner of harneys propyce for him self / but as desyrouse to serve the
king and to encreace his honor / he doethe so much that some gentylman that
knows him well leneth him both horses and harneis such as pleases him well
/ It happeth then that this almayne leseth in the bataille both horses and
harne^s and all that he has and with pain as a naked man he scapeth / After
which thing the said gentyl man that had lent him all this / asks and wol
have hit again of him now is to wite after the right of arms / whether he is
bound to make restytucyon thereof or not / I ansuere the that this questyon is
in the laws all clear enough / And this to show I seek not to show hit by
noon other reason / For I tell you of a truth / that sith the knight is to
the bataylle for which he hadd borrowed the said horses and harneys / and that
he has not begyled that other that is to wite / he has not made him to
vndrestande one thing for a another Certeynly he is not bound to yield them
again / But and if he were goon some where ellis there with all / or that he had
borrowed them for to deceive him thereof / and that he showed feyntly that he had
lost them / and that it might be proved other wise I should say other wise /
Master and if it were so that he had hired all thees things of certain
merchants / that is to wit the harneys of an armurere / and the horses of
one or of two merchants / and had lost them as it is said / should not he be
bound to yield them again and to pay the hyre thereof / I tell the semblably
that nay as a boue / in cas that noon other express couenaunte were made
betwyx him and the merchants / that what so euere it happeth he should yield
the said horses and harneis unto them again /

Whether subtyltees and polycyes of arms are good and Just to be done /
Capytulo / xiij /
ANother questyon dyfferent fro the forsayde purpos / I wol ask of the / Tell
me I pray the Is it of a good reason and after right / that a king or a
prince shall do so much by cawtele and subtyl pollycye / that he shall subdue
and come to his above ouere his enemy thereby / be it in bataille or ellis
where / For it should be aduysed that nay co^syderyng that rightfulnes and
reason ought to be kept / and it can not be no right there as one deceyueth
another / and also every man that has a Just quarelle / ought to have a good
hope in god that well it shall fortune with him thereof if by pain and dylygence
he pursues / Therefore he that has a good and a ryghtewis quarelle ought to
goo as me seems the right way of werre without to use of any wyles / Daughter
and my dear love thou say full well / but natheles I certyfye the that after
the right of arms / and that more is after god and holy scripture / men ought
to vaynquysshe his enemy or may overcome him by barat / cawtelle and engyne
without wrong of arms sith that the werre is Iuged and notyfyed betwyx both
parties / And that truth it is that it may be do / our lord Ihesu christ
gaffe exsample the^of when he ordained and taught to / Iosue how by cawtele he
should surpryse and overcome his enemies / And of such things men are woned
to use and commonly enough they help themself in time of werre / but I
confess and tell the well / that there ben certain maneres of barates which
ben reproved and forboden / as well in fayttes of arms / as in other caas / As
if it were / that I should assure some body for to come to me in a place where
as I should be for to speak with him / and so much I should do that under mine
assurance he comes there where as I should do him to be taken and slain /
Such a thing were a right euylle treason / Or ellis if by feyned trewes or
peace I should a spy my time for to hurt some other body that keeps not him
self there fro and weneth to be sauffe / and all such other manners of ways /
whereof I should do evil and great dyshonoure and repreef should come to me
thereby / and great sin should one do to do so / And therefore the law
says / that sith the faith is youen to his enemy / men ought to keep it to
him / But another thing there is if a valiant man of arms or a wise capytayne
/ can well ordeyne busshementes there as his ennuye must pass and naught is
beware thereof / or all such other maneres of cawteles / so that they be not
against feyth promysse nor against thassuraunce that men had made / And naught is
to be said the reason that thou say sith that men have a good quarelle /
whereto I accord me / But how well that the king of France have good right
against some other king / yet must he give help to sustain and bear out his
good right / And then when by wit and dylygence men do their deuoyre /
they ought to have hope in god that he shall help that the thing shall be
conducted and brought to a good ending and perfection

Whether a man of arms that were dystressed and robbed by the way might ask
by right his domages unto his lord / Item if a lord sends some socours of
men of werre to some other lord in his werre without that he be so required
for to do / whether the lord to whom the said men of werre be thus sent / is
holden to pay them of their wages or not / Item whether men of werre may
lawfully take vytalles upon the country or not / Capytulo / xiiij
Master as to our before said purpos me seems by this that ye have concluded
a fore / that is to wit / if a knight or some other man of arms is sent fro
some lord for a garnyson of some fortres without that any couenaunte of wage be
made nor no promise unto him / and that it happeth this knight or man of
arms to be robbed by the way / may he ask by right restytucyon of his loss
of the lord that so sends him etc^ / I will make another questyon unto the /
I suppose that a capytayne of Lombardye or of some other country / as men some
time have do com in to France had brought with him a hundred or two hundred
good souldyours / and that he and his felawshyp were retained in to wages at
a hundred shelyng by the month / and were sent unto a certain place / and in
his gooynge thither he were assaylled by the way by the enemies where as he
had lost his penoncell his plates and his harneys his pype and his tabret / and
his felawes their curaces / their pau^^ses and all their bagage I ask of
the if they might demand of the king their loss and dommage / Without
faylle I ansuere the / that nay / in caas that noon other covenant were there
but only of their bare wages For the same without any moo / was granted to
them / and the same they may ask and no more / And if thou wylt demand of me
/ for what reason this capytayne has not also great an actyon for to demand
of the maystre that sends him / as it is said here before and cetera / I
tell the that that which the law bears / has a gretter favor to him
that is not bound by no bargayne made and is put to werk / than hit does
to him that is bound / And this thou may see by an exsample of a man that
shall have dwelled with a merchant or with some other man a year and a day
without this that he be not bound by no bargayne made / he may make a much
more gretter demand of the godys and marchaundyses of the house / without
that there be some certain excuse made by the master / than he that has hired
him self by bargayne made / And therefore I tell the that a man is not well
aduysed that in his house takes any servant to continue with him / but if he
make covenant with him / For the law presupposes and takes a man so
duellynge with another as felawe to his master / as well of the getynge / as of
the loss / Another questyon I make unto the / I put caas that some lord had
sent for some souldyours out of a strange country / and had retained them in
his wages for a hole year for to comme and socoure him in his werre which he
thought should last long / And that it should hap then that or euere
this folk with their capytayne might arryve in to the said lordys land / How
well that of al their powere they had hasted them self / he had lost all his
said land / in so much that no socours at all / might help (...) no more /
Whereby he had no more need of no folk / I ask whether the said souldyours so
retained might ask their wages for the hole year / or only fro that day that
the covenant was made / For it should seem ye / for this that an advocate ^f
the King or of some Lord taking a pensyon or Fee of his master by the year
and that has bygonne to do his office / his wages of the hole year are due
unto him For if he deyed within the first monethe of the year after the
Interynacyon of his office his heir might have an actyon for to demand the
hole payement of his wages / Why then might not thees folk enjoy this right
as well as they / And also it may well be that they have lost by mean of the
same as good wages of which they should have be sure for a hole year in some
other place / And many other reasons might be yet al plainly said which I
leave for shorting of the matyere Fair love I aunsuere the shorthy that thees
reasons and all other that thou could say thereto are of no value For I make
the sure that for content they ought to bold hem self to be only paid for
the which that they have served / And here is the reason / They were retained
for souldyours for to keep the land or euere that hit was lost / But sith that
it is lost they can no more serve therefore / and thus they ought not to
deserve the wages of a service which they can not do / that is to wit to
keep a land which is al ready lost / And the law byndeth no man to a thing
that is Impossyble / For if by compulsyon they would be paid men might say
unto them / and ye shall be al so compelled to keep that which is al ready lost
/ how can that be do / And by this concludes that that is said / Now good
master here me a little if thou be so pleased / I ask of the / if when men of
werre are taken in to wages / and that of their payement be no fault made /
Whethere it behooves them with their wages truly paid to take vytailles upon
the country / and to dyspoylle and take diverse other things as they commonly
do this day in the realm of France / I ansuere the certeynly that nay / and
that such a thing is no point of the right of werre / But it is an evylle
extorcyon and a great vyolence made wrongfully and with great sin upon the
people / For thus as thy self haste said here to fore / that a prince that will
make werre ought before hand to advise and see where and how his fynaunce shall
be made and taken / and above all things he ought to ordeyne so that his folk
be well paid whereby they may truly pay that which they take / be it vytaylle
or other things / And then it were a Just thing to punysshe well them that
without money should take any thing what someuere it were / But by
argumentacyon thou myghtest ageyn say to me / and if caas were that the
enemies came in to the land suddenly / wherefore it were need to make a sudden
deffe^se or euere that the prince might have purueyed for so great a fynaunce
as must be had for to pay monthly a great quantyte of men of werre / But if
a tresore be had / I ansuere the / that in all thing that is of need men must
help hem self as they can best after their powere / For when that this caas
were / the prince should be enough excused / if he suffered them to take / that
is to wit al only vytaylles necessaryly as they passed forth for sustenaunce
of their bodies only to the lest hurt upon the pour laborers that might be
do / and not that they should do as the wolves to whom suffyseth (...) one
sheep when they enter in to the fold but stranglen and kylle all the hole flok
/ Semblably many of our men of werre do the same / For there as a hen or a
Lamb might suffyse them / they take and kylle / x / or / xij / of them / And
suc^e waste of goods they make even as they were very wolves rauyshynge
without conscience as though there were no god or that they never should deye
/ Alas well be thoo vttyrly blinded that thus do / For more in parell of death
they goo / than other folk / and less than any other men they take heed thereto

What men ought to do with the proyes that be gotten in werre / Capitulo / xv
Another manner of questyon I will to the make / I ask of the what men ought
for to do with the things that be wonnen upon the enemies in bataylle / Dear
love to this questyon byhoueth to be ansuered by dystynctyon of cases / For
first after the cyuyle law / is to be vndrestande of what astate and condycyon
the person is that has conquested a thing by faytte of werre / And there is
a manner to vndrestand in what cases and in what werres thees laws have place
/ For if a werre be made by mau^dement or calling of the king or prince / that
has power to ordeyne and set up a Just werre / some laws be reserved to
such a lord / and not to other folk / that is to wit that all the getynge
ought to goo at the will of the prince or of the lyeutenaunt or head
capytayne / For sith that the men of (...) are at the wages of the king or
prince what someuere they take be it prisoners or other proye ought be to the
lord after the laws / And auncyently it was woned to be thus done / What that
of grace in time present by longue custom in France and in other lands is
left to the men of arms that which they conquer and get / if the thing
that they conquer be not of so great a poys that it passes the price and
Sum of ten thousaunde frankys / the which thing be it a prisoner or other
good moeuable is yolden unto the king or prince / by all thus / that he is
holden to give to the said man of arms that has gotten hit what so euere he be
/ the said price of / x / thousaund Francs / And such a thing is a good
custom in a land / But the forsayde law affermeth the decree that says
plainly that all the proye ought to be after the princes will / And ought to
depart it justly among them that have helped to get hit every man after his
merit / And that this thing be of a truth / no man might not sustain the
contrary / For the same is approved by the right vriton yt namely assygneth
thereto such a reason that is to wit / that if it were so that the
prysonners or proyes should be to the man of werre / all thus and by the same
reason should be theyrs the castelles and towns that they take / the which
thing were neither good nor Just that they with the money of the king or
prince and had at his expenses should get for their own behoue any ground /
For that which they do is done / as of the kings own werk men that be set
awerke for him and in his name / therefore ought not the proye to be theyrs with
their wages / but only this that the prince / will (...) them of a special
grace the which grace to say truth well and largely hit behooves them / as
to them that setten in adventure so dear a catell / as is the blood the lymes
and the lyffe And the more that a prince is higher in the degree of noblesse so
much more he ought to reward them that well have deserved it / And of the
proyes wonnen in earth the noble and worthy ancient kept nothing ther^of for
their own self / but only hit suffysed them to have the name and the worship
of the deed done by their men which had the proffyt thereof / And by such
away they gate the hertes and love of their men of werre / that they brought
at a good end their great and merueyllouse entrepryse /

Begins to speak of prysonners of werre / and how a mighty man taken in
werre ought to be yolden unto the prince / and how not / Capytulo / xv
ANd by cause I have told the here by fore / That after the foresaid law / is
to be known of what condycyon is the person that has conquested some what
in arms / whereof I have declared to ye one part Now suppose we other wise /
that is to wit that a baron made werre against another baron / were his quarrel
Just or not / or that would deffende his land fro some other / For why as well
to deffende him self and to keep his land what that the caas be / It behooves
him to Judge a just werre / as when he enuahyssheth / And if it hap then that
this baron that so deffendeth him self / takes that other that enuahysheth him
/ should thou say that he were his own prisoner / I certyfye the that nay /
nor noon other right he should have upon him by the law / but only to hold
and keep his person sure unto the time that he should present him to the
lord sovereign of whom he should hold the baronnye which should give upon
him his Judgment / but another inspecte may be herupon / that is to wit / that
if he that takes him be such a man that he have sovereign Justice in his own
hand / or ellis that he have the powere to do Justice upon the mysdooers /
and has custom to do thereof as the very lord / as ben many lordships that
have such auctoryte / I tell the that sith that he fyndeth him rennyng over
the land robbyng and sleeynge his men / that he by his Justice may punysshe
him yet supposed that he were a gretter lord in degree than him self / Not
wythstandynge that men might make an arguement upon this caas / that a man may
not nor ought not to be Judge in his own propre cause / I say that he may do
so / and by two reasons / that one by virtue of his Iurisdycyon which is to
punysshe and do Justice of the mysdooers / and that other that he punyssheth
the delicte of him that makes hit upon the propre place / whereof he has
auctorite of the law to do so / For if a man assaylleth another and thinks
to hurt him / he that is so assailled may do to that other that that he would
had done to him / and I tell the that it is attemperau^ce of a reasonable
deffence / but I confess well that if he that so is assailled and that had no
Iurysdycyon nor auctoryte to do so / should punysshe of his own head / his
aduersarye under the title of Justice / or that should keep him in prison / he
should do wrong to his souerayn lord / and should put him self in parell
to lose that that he holds of him / therefore he ought to yield him soon to
the s^id sovereign lord / Fpr namely it were lawful to a man of the church
in such a caas for to recouere his things again /

Whether men ought to do deye a chyef capytayne of an oste taken in fayttes of
werre / or ellis if he ought to be for the prince / And whether it is a thing
lawful and that concerns the right wryton for to make a man to pay any
raunson for his delyueraunce / Capitulo / xvij
Master sith that we ben entered in to purpos of prisoners taken by by faytte
of werre / I ask the if it hap the head captain to be taken or some high man
that has sore let and done great hurt and yet might do to that party
that has taken him if he escaped / If by the law and right men might put
him to death / For by the law of nature hit should apere that ye where as it
is truth / that al thing awaiteth to distroye his contrary / Certes dear
love I ansuere the that what especyally the law cyuyle says / that he that is
taken in bataylle is in thraldom as a selaue or servant that takes him / he
ought not to be slain / For why the decree affermeth hit saying / that sith
at a man is in prison mercy is due to him / Then thus if myldehede is due to
him / how might he be put to death with out that Iniurye were done to him /
And yet more hard I shall tell the / Another decree there is that says /
that sith that a man has overcome another / he is holden to pardonne him /
specially his lyffe / So say I to the well that it is against all right and
gentylnesse to slay him that yeldeth him / And I tell the that the parents
and friends might pursue therefore as for wrong done / but if it were so that
the prince should keep him towardys him and take him fro the hands of him that
had taken him / and by a good and Just cause if he had well deserved it / and
that he by his counseyll knew that a great evil and hurt might come to him
and to his land if he let him goo free / should make him to deye / For in
other manner of wise it were a thing Inhumayne and to great a cruelnes / And
if thou say to me that auncyently they had a law that they might make their
prisoners to deye if it pleased them / or selle them to whom they would / or
make hem to labor in their seruyse / etc^ / I ansuere the that among
christian folk where the the law is altogyder grounded upon myldefulnes and
pity is not lycyte nor according to use of such terannye which be acursed
and reproved / Now I make the other questyons to know where a prisoner ought
to be or to whom or to the lord / or to him that has taken him / For me
seems that ye have said here before / that one law there is that witnesses
/ that a prisoner is in the will of him that takes him / and sith that he is
at his will / hit seems then that he should be his own / Fair love it
seems that thou have forgoten that that I have told the before / So say I
yet unto the ageine / that verily there ben many opynions of diverse masters /
Pro and contra in this caas here / Nevertheless it is concluded that al pryses
and proyes / as already I have told the ought to be at will of the prince
whom apparteyneth to dystrybute them after dyscrecyon / Well I wndrestande the
master / now tell me / that sith that we christian men at this day have left
the ancient laws to put in thraldom or to slay the prisoners / I ask of
the if Justly men may demand of a prisoner a fynaunce of gold or of silver or
of some other moeuable goodis after this that men vsen commonly in faytte of
werre / For if I remember me well / thou have said here before / that to a
pryso^er is myldefulnes due of right unto him / and me seems that since it is
due to him after right / men do him wrong then to make him pay reanson
where as men do to him no misericorde / I tell the yet and ansuere upon a
new that verily is myldefulnes due unto him in two manners / that is to wit /
that the law ought to be respited to him / and the life saved / and more hard
I tell the that the master is holden of right and bound to help his
prisoner aienst another that would offense him / Item with this is myldefulnes
due to him in such a manner that if it were possible that a man of arms had
all that he is worth upon him at that owre that he is taken altogider may be
to the master that takes him without that he show him favor and do to him
myserycorde / But of right vryton he ought to be myldefull unto him so that in
taking of his prisoner reanson which is permytted in right of arms / by
especyall of one natyon against another when they do werre together as english
men and Frenshe men and other in like wise ought to be taken heed that the
reanson be not so cruel that the man be not undo thereby and his wiffe and
children distroied and brought to pouerte / Other wise it is tirannye / against
conscience and aienst al right of arms / For it apparteyneth not that a
gentylman should beg his bread after the payeme^t made for his reanson but
ought to be left him whereof he may live / keeping his astate / And well ought to
be praised the usage of ytalye / in which werres when a man of arms is taken
/ he commonly leseth but only his horses and harneys / So needs him not to
selle his lyflode nor to desheryte him self for to pay his reanson / Thus
may thou see in what manner is reanson couenable Just and good after the
right o^ ^rmes which is permytted / But for to put a man in an evil prison
and constrayne by tormentynges to pay more then his power may bear it is an
homynable horreur and the deed of a cruel christian tyrant wers than a Jew / And
wot thou for certain that that which he has by such ways of his prisoner
it is right evil gotten / and he is bound to yield it again or ellis it is his
da^pnacyon / So keep him self there fro every man

Whether it is of right that men may take upon the enemies land / the pour
laborers / Capitulo / xviij /
I ask the when a king or a prince has werre against another though that it
be Just / whether he may by right over run the country of his enemy taking
al manner of folk prisoners / that is to wite them of the common pour people as
ben laborers / shepardes and such folk / and it should seem that nay / For
what reason ought they to bear the penance of that that they meddle not hem
self / where as they can not the craft of arms / nor it is not their office
/ nor they be not called for to judge of werres / and also werres comen not by
such pour folk / but they be full sorry for it / as they that full feign
would always live in good peace nor they ask no more / So ought they then as
me seems to be free thereof / lykethat of right ben prestes relygyouse and all
folk of the church / by cause that their a state is not to entremette hem
self of war / And with this what worship may this be nor what price of arms
for to slay and run upon them that neuere bare harneys nor could not help him
self with all / and that have noon other office / but pour Innocents to goo
to ploughe and labor the land and to keep the bestes / To this I ansuere the
supposyng in this manner / We put caas that the people of England would make
no manner of help to their kyn^^ for to grieve the king of France / and that
the Frens^e men went upon them / without faylle by right and reason and aft^r
the law they ought not to hurt nor misdoo another in body nor in goods of the
people nor of them that they should know that had not meddled them self in
nothing to help another by their goods nor by their counseyll their king
/ But and if it be so that the subgectes of the same king or of some other in
semblable a caas be it rich or pour laborers or other give aid comfort and
favor for to may^^ten the werre / the Frenshmen after the right of arms may
over run their land and take all that they find / that is to wit prisoners
of all astates / and al things and be not bound for to yield them again For I
tell the / that such right is determined right of werre / Iuged by both
kings or princes counseyll their men of werre may get the one v^pon the
other / And if some time the pour and simple th^ughe they arm not hem self do
a bid the bargeyne and be s^re hurt thereby / it can not be other wise / For the
evil herbs can not be had out from emonge the good by cause they be so nyghe
each other without that the good herbs have a felyng thereof / But to beh^lde
right well it is true that the valiant and gentylmen of arms ought to keep
hem self as much as they can that they dystroye not the good simple folk nor
to suffer that their folk shall Inhumaynly hurt them / For they ben christian /
and not sarrasyns / And if I have said that myserycorde is due unto the one /
Know thou that not less it is due to the other / So ought they to hurt them
that ledeth the werre / and spare the simple and peasyble of all their
puyssaunce /

Whether a english scoler or of some other enemies land were found studyeng
at the scoles in paris might be taken prisoner or not / Capitulo / xix /
But sith that we ben entered in matere of prisoners of werre I will that thou
Judge they self after thyn advise of such a debat which by an exsample I shall
propose unto the / Now know thou al enough how the king of France and the
king of England have commonly werre one against an other / I put the caas that
a scoler licencyat at Cambryge in England is com to the university of paris
for to be there graduate or enhaunced in the degree of doctor of dyuynyte or
in other facultee / where it happeth that a man of arms of France knows by
other that this scoler is an englisheman borne / and takes him as his prisoner
/ to the which pryse the said scoler says against and thereto opposes him
self / so ferforth is the thing brought that before the Justice comes the
questyon / to the which debat / the Englysheman that in right fownded his
reason says that he has a caas expert of the law that does for him self /
for cause of the great preuyleges that the scolers have there / and hit
deffendeth that no gryef nor dyspleasyre be done to them / but honor and
reuerens / And here is the reason he says that the law assygneth / Who
should be he says the law that should not have scolers for recomaunded which
for to know and acquyre co^nyng have left and laid aside ryhesses /
delicates and al eases of body / their carnal friends and their country /
and have taken the astate of pourete / and as banyshed from al other goods /
have forsaken the world and al other pleasirs for love of science So should he
be well full of all unkindness that should do any evil to them / To thees
reasons the man (...) arms replycqueth thus sayng / Brother I tell the that
emonge us we frenshmen make no force of the emperoures laws to whom we be not
subgect / so owe not we to obey them / The scoler ansuereth / Laws ben noon
other things but very reasons that were ordained after wisdom / and if
thereof ye do make no force / it is not said therefore that the king and
lords of France shall not use of reason and of things that been reasonable and
of that that they him self have ordained For Charlemayne remeued the general
scole of rome by the popis will to paris / they gaffe great and notable
preuyleges to the same scole / And therefore sent the king to fetch masters
out of all parties and scolers of all manner of lang^ges and all them he
comprysed in the said preuylege / And wherefore then shall not they mow come
from all parties when they have license of the king / where as al things at
their first coming do swear that they shall keep the said preuyleges / In
the name of god said the man of arms supposed that that ye say / ye ought to
wite that sethen that a general werre was cried and proclaimed betwyx our
king and yours / noon englyshemen ought to come within the roialme of France
for such a cause nor for noon other what someuere it be / without a good
saufconduyte / and the reason is good / For why ye might under color of the
scole write and do vndrestande in your country how it is here and the astate
of this land / and other diverse secret euylles ye might do here if ye would /
wherefore it is not reason that no manner of preuylege should turn in to
preiudyce of the king nor of his royalme Thees reasons hard / say thou my
love now what thou thereupon think / without fayll master sith that it
pleases the / that my little and sobre advise shall serve in this bihalfe / I
tell the / that if it be so and without frawde / that he of whom thou spekest
be a true scoler / that is to say / that he were not come under fyction to
learn conninge / for to aspye or to do some other evil / I hold his cause for
good and that he ought not to be take prysonner / provided al ways / but if
the king had made to be cried by his maundement especyall that noon englishman
what someuere he were should not come to study in his royalme / Thou have
ryghtwelt Iuged and wisely dystynged / For namely if the bysshopryche of paris
were without a bishop of ellis tharchebysshopryche of roen or of sens or of
other of the said royalme / and that an englysheman were thereunto elected and
chosen / the king by rayson may gaynsaye to the same / For why the rayson is
such / that it is not expedient nor behoful to the king nor to the royalme
for to have there his enemies resydent / But yet ansuere me to this / supposed
that the scoler ought not to be taken there prisoner / what shall thou say to
me of his servants if he bring one or two or more with him out of england /
For the preuylege that scolers have in paris was not given for their
servants In good feith master under thy correction not wistandyng this
reason / me seems that under the preuylege of the master which is a true
scoler as it is said ought to be comprised his servants / right so as in
the sauegarde that the king gives to his offyciers be comprysed their
servants and all their famylle or meyne / But of the master I wol ask one
thing / I put cas that the said scoler were taken with a syknes / might of
right his fader come to vysyte and see him without parell / To this I ansuere
the / that after right wryton / but if he came there for falshed as it is said
/ he might aad ought to come sauffe there / For why ye reason is such / that
more great is the right of nature than is the right of werre / So is the love
of the fader and of the mother to their sone so much preuyleged / that no
right of arms may not surmounte the same / And yet more hard I tell the /
that if the fader went for to see and vysite his child being in good health
studyeng at the scoles within paris or where so euere it were / for to bear
him other vitaylles or syluere / he ought not to be arrested nor taken for the
same of what so ever country friend or foo that he were of And this sentence
is determined in the law like as I say and semblably ought not to be apeched
nor let the brother the kynnesman nor the servant that silver or books
should bri^ge him / but I presuppose al ways reserved the clauses above said
/ For it is all by virtue of the preuyleges that scolers have in general
scoles as is paris and other

Whether a great lord of england that fortunably were found in a forest al
one as mad and out of his wit / might of right be taken and put to
raunson Capitulo / xx /
Another questyon I make to the sweet master / I suppose that a duke or an
earl departs out of england and comes in to France with his folk for to
werre against the king there / which duk or earl happeth by adventure to wex
mad / so that al alone as a fool he gothe renninge by wodes and hedges where
as he is found by Frenshmen of arms / he by a just qurelle may be well put
to raunson

If it happed that some ambassatours came towardys the king of France / and as
they passed by Bordeawx should take and hyre there of englyshmen horses and
carts for to carye their bagage / Whether thees things so hired might be
arrested within France or not / Item whether an englysh priest might be
emprysonned in France or not Capytulo / xxij /
Master I will put to the another questyon / I suppose the king of Scotland
sends his ambassatours into France / the which comen and take land at
Bordewx or at bayo^ne in which place they hyre horses mules carts and other
things that they need / and goo to paris with all and happeth by adventure
that they be met by the way of a capytayne frenshman / the which as he is
well informed that the said horses mules and carts be longing to english men
and not to the said ambassatours / arrested and takes them / and says that
where thees things be of the kings enemies they shall abide as his own / and
that by the right of arms he may wythholde them as that he has truly
conquested and gotten / Now tell me master if of right they ought to abide his
or not / I tell the that of right wryton the ambassatours or legates have a
preuylege al about where they goo that they and their things shall be sure and
sauffe / and since that they goo to the king it apperteyneth not to noon of his
men to let nor trouble them / and who is he that more greatly is preuyleged
than abassatoure / for if he were bound to a merchant of France in a great
some of money / He can not compell^e him to pay him his money for the time
during of his legacyon / For right suffers not to constrayne the Legate of a
prince or if I held then a foo mortal of mine within my powere in what
manner that euere it were / which hapli after he were goon fro me should kylle
me / or at the lest should hurt me right sore if he might and well I wot that
with all his power he should force him self so to do / should then be
wisdom or wit within me to late him goo thus freely from me Fair love to
this I ansuere unto the / that this man of whom I speak unto the supposed that
he be thyn enemy in the foresaid cas thou should not awayte for to keep him
but only for to have silver of him by way of raunson / and when the money
were paid which without reason thou have received how much more should
thou be then assured of him / than thou were by fore certes of nothing / and
this seeks nor wol not the right of arms that men shall do wrong one party
to an other / but all noble men ought to keep in this bihalue the right of
other that durst ask and require to have hit / So tell I to the yet that
the worste that to this man might be done / it is that men should make him to
swear that he neuermore should arm him self aienst the ki^ge of France / and
in cas that men might not bring him to this and that the man of arms / or the
town / or the country that keeps him / should dread lest they should be
reproved if they yet suffered him goo free / by cause he were so great a man
that he might yet grieve or hurt full sore the royalme / ye surest way for them
were so to discharge themself withal / y^ they should yield him to the prince
which should do of him that which were best to be done by thaduyse of his
good counseyll and al ways to the end that thou well shall vndrestande / that I
tell the of the frrenshman to the englishman I mean semblably of the
englishman to the Frenshman /

If it hap that upon the fronteres of Caleys be taken some old man english
bourgeys or other of the said town that neuere meddled with werre wether by
right of the law of arms / ought such a man to pay raunson or not / and in
likewise a little child or of a blind man C / xxj /
I put cas that some frenshe knight O thou master be poynted in arms
towardis the fronteres of caleis or of Bordewx / and it happed that a bourgeys
sore old / a man of the said bordewx or caleis be by adventure come out for to
here his mess or for some other adoo upon the frenshe grownde where soon the
said knight takes him and says that he shall be his prisoner but that other
ansuereth that it is not right / For in the king of englandes werres he neuere
armed him self nor neuere went against the king of France nor never gyrded
sword nor gaff no counseill / but has always be sorry for the werre which
al weyes of all^ his powere has discou^seylled / and that shall be proved for
a truth and with this says he I tell you that an old man as I am that is
not shapen to were nor bear arms nor harneis ought not of right to be kept in
prison / so ye may not nor ought not to take another the goods nor the
prisoners of them yt entremete not with the werre / but if it were that they
gaffe help and favor to maynten ye werre aienst the king of france of
their free and good will / for if by force it were yet should they be
excused after right / but of all this neither by force nor for love I have done
nothing and all this I will preue true / so demand I of the master if a man
may in such a cas be kept in prison after the right of arms / I tell the as
above that verily nay in cas that the said excuse might be suffisau^tly proved
/ but and it were so that he had given or gaffe pertynent cou^seill to the
werre in what soever manner that it were as many an old man does that by his
cou^seill does much more thereto / than other young men do by their arms Now
well master another manner away I will spek tell me then / and a frenshmen
had taken a litell child of an englishman / might he ask by right any rau^son
for him for it should seem ye / seen that he that may well make the more great a
thing / may well make the smallest / as what to say he might well take prisoner
the fader if the cas befell why not the child as well / for he might well take
the faders goods and the child as himself says is comprised for the faders
goodis / I tell the certeynly that after right the litel child may nor ought
not to be kept prisoner / for reason will not accord / that innocencye be a
grieved for it is very truth that a child in such a cas is innocent and not
coulpable of all werre in all manner of thi^gis / wherefore he ought not to bear
the pain of that whereof he is not in fawte nor of counseill nor of goods he
has naught helped thereto for he has as yet noon Ye master / but supposed
that the said child were rich of him self as of his fader and moders gods
that be deed / most he pay / For it might be so that his tutoures or they
that have the rule over his goodis should pay a subsydye of his goods to the
king of England for to maynten his werre in France / Yet y tell the that
nay / for what that his tutoures paid thereof it were not of ye childs will
which is not yet in age of discrecion / without faille master then is not
this day this law well kept / thou say to me truth fair love / nor yet be
no more kept another the noble ryghtes of old time that held and truly did
keep the noble conquerours / Thus abusen with the right of arms they that now
do excersice them by ye great coueytyse that ouercometh them / so ought to
turn them to a great shame for to e^prisone wymen or children and impotent
and old / and this custom that they have brought up ought to be reproved to
their great deshonour and blame / like as otherwhile have done duringe ye
war in ye royalme of France which as long as fortune was for them they
spared another ladies nor dameselles great small nor little when they took the
fortresses but they were all put to raunson asmany as were found there /
which is a great shame to them for to take that which can not revenge hemself
/ and ought well to have suffised them for to have take the saisine of the
fortres and that the ladies had goon quytte / But that that to them is happed
at the last may al enough and ought to be ensample to al other warryours for
to deal other wise / for be ye in certain that no good evil gotten can not be
long possessed nor kept of him that geteth hit nor of his heirs Now late us
see of another debat / if a blind man hap to be taken of a man of arms /
ought he to keep prison / I tell the that if a blind man should put him
self to be a man of arms thrughe his folly / and happeth to be taken / he is
worthy to have worse than another and this I may prove by the holy scripture
where it is spoken how Caym slew Abel his brother and how a blind man that
was called Lameth took a bow / and went shotynge by wodes and hedges hunting
the wyld bestes / and by adventure his arowe light upon caym and slew him /
whereof god said that the sin of Caym should be punysshed seven times / But
the sin of Lameth should be punysshed / lxxvj / times / Whereby it appears
that for to put him self to an office in which he be not suffysant / it is a
sovereign folly But if a simple blind man were taken pity were due unto him /
and if he were such that he before time had seen / And was a man of arms in
the werre / and so gaffe counseyll to the enemies to do bataylle or to stele a
place or that aduysed them of some other cawtele that well know him / I ask
whether he ought to be kept in prison / For it should seem / ye / seeing that
the^tent of his coming was for to werre against the king there and for to hurt
the royalme / To this I ansuere the that we find in the right writon that a
mad man during his fourour may not be reputed nor taken for enemy / for he
has non arbytre of free will where reason cannot work wherefore then if he
slew a / c / men he should not be punysshed therefore by justice nor taken for
homycyde / and such a man can another yield nor give feythe to pay any raunson
/ who shall he then be prisoner / And to put in prison a man that namely is
vexed with such a malady what a valyau^tnes were it certes it were great
sin / and rather every noble man should pain him self after his powere to
administre unto him health of wit and advise / So tell I to the that he can
not nor ought not by right to be kept in prison nor pay no raunson / but
ought to be yolden ageyn to his friends / and more yet I tell the / We put
caas that he being in prison should gwarysshe there of his syknes / yet ought
he not to be kept nor pay no manner of rau^son / ye cause why is because that
when he was taken he had another wit nor powere for to deffe^de him / of the
which for to Judge rightewisly of arms no man ought to be taken prisoner /
but that he first yeldeth him self by word of his own mouth or ellis by some
sign but how should he do this / for as ye law says such a man can not
make no testament nor mary himself nor enter in to religyon / the which
things requyren free will / nor namely he may not receive batesme if he were
not baptized which is never given unto man / but if he requires hit with his
free will and therefore there is no cause why he should be kept prisoner / how
then master you tellest me merueylle some place notable / but of such things
as he had taken by the way / And namely seeing that they neded to take horses
and caryage for to bear them self and their fadellage as that seknes or other
lettynge might come by the way / or as it may well be / for to bring certain
presents to the king / they ought to goo both them self and their things
sauffe But it might well be that some color of debate may be hereof in caas that
without very need they had brought with them some englyshemen for to give hem
sport and that horses or other things were in the company longyng to them /
For of such autoryte they might bring in to france the enemies of the
royalme / so were it not then dyscuted without cause / For to know yet more
I beseech the master that thou will tell me if Frenshemen might by right take
a priest of england prisoner / and as well english men a priest of France / be
it other bishop / or abbot or man of relygyon / Fair love by that that
diverse times I have al enough concluded may thy demand be soylled / that is
to wit that we say after right wryton / that thoffyce of men of the church
separed from al werre / for the seruyse of god in which they be occupied or
ought to be makes them unable to were arms nor what someuer harneis of
temporal bataille / and belongen to them in nothing / for noon office
apparteineth to them but for to absoyle the sins and to bring again in to the
right way they that walk here wrong and to administre ye sacreme^tes nor
namely for to deffe^de them self behooves hem not after ye decree but sweet
words and benygnite / So were it then well a hard thing that they should
bear penance of that that they ought to be Innocent of / and if thou would say
to me / Ye but they help the king of england of their revenues and rentes
for to maynten the werre or namely of their counseyll / I ansuere the that
they ought not to do so / nor they be not holden thereunto / For it
apparteyneth not to no man of the church to give no counseyll that
concerns the werre / but it is their office for to set always peace among
christian people / And if it happed that their king took of their goods by
force for to goo to his werres / I say that they can not do thereto / And that
they ought not therefore to pay no raunson another to be taken nor kept as
enemies of another party But other wise it is / if it hap that some chapellayn
or other of the church goo to werre or that ingereth or puts him self
forth by any manner of way thereto / if he were taken such a man without
fault ought not to be spared but that al rygoure of rudnesse be done to him /
were he a prelat or other as to the fayt of the payement of raunson And should
say that such a man were had to the pope that well should punysshe him / but
other wise to put in prison men of the church / it is to dyscouenable a thing
and out of all right

Whether a prysonner of werre may depart hens after he is shet up and not
mysdoo anempst his master / Capytulo / xxiij /
NOw will I make the another demand that of the precedent as of a prysonner of
werre alynoughe depends I put caas that a knight has taken in werre his
enemy / and has put him in a castle or in to some other prison / I ask the
if the prisoner sees time and place for to escape away by cawtelle or
subtylte / Whether he may do this lawfully after the right of werre / for I
make doubt that he may for many raysons / first / because he has taken him
his feyth / so may not he goo away without he must be forsworn which is a
thing that the law can not grant that a man shall forswere him self / ye
other is / that right will not that men shall not do to other / otherwise than
they would be done unto / and this man would not that his prysonner if he had
any should pay him so / and thus dooyng he does trespass against this Law /
that other is that he is like his servant and in his mercy unto time that he
have acquytted him self of his raunson / Then thus he mysdoeth as me seems
in as much that he takes him self from him as his own pure and propre good /
which can not be do with out mespryse / Now fair love to this I shall
ansuere the for that other party / and much is here to see to / For hereof
behooves to be determined after the cyrcomstances / I tell the that men may
say for that other that he had in this no thing trespassed / For he has
done after the law of nature which gives to al manner of person a right to
be in lybe^tee / Item when he gaaf his feyth it was by force and by compulsyon
done / And the law compelled not to keep a promise made of force / and other
reasons might be said / But as to the right of arms which is permytted by
all law / all that makes but little / For to the right for to goo I tell the
that when a man is taken and gives his feith to keep prison without faylle he
can not depart away but he will trespass both against god and the world with
out he take leave of his master / ye some caas reserved that must be well
understand / That is to wit that the said master do not to him noon other
evyl nor hurt than to put him in a couenable pryso^ / as right has lymyted and
will But I accord with the well / if he were kept so straytly and so evil
dealt with all that his lyff or health were put in Ieopardye thereby / and that
Inhumayne or cruelle a thing it were / I afferme unto the that if he can find
means for to escape away that a right great wit it were / nor for no trespass
it ought not to be taken / or else also if the master were untreatable and
that would not take no reasonable raunson after the powere of his prysonner /
and had proffered hit unto him diverse times / Item also and if the master
were so cruel that he were wont to do deye or tormente or make his
prysonners to langwysshe in prison / or such other crueltees that done against
the law of gentylnesse / he that such a man holds is not bound to keep him
promise nor feyth if by any way he may escape / For such a feyth to give is
to be vndrestande that like as the master is lord of the prysonner by right
of arms / he in like wise ought to entreat and keep him goodly and humaynly
as the said right requires / And not to keep him as a best or worse than a
Jew or sarrasin / the which namely behouen not to be dealed with all so
sharply that men give them cause for to dyspeyre hem self / And therefore I
tell the that he that furst breketh to other and do trespass the right /
deserves also that in like wise be do to him / Ye master / but if it happed
that some gentylman took another in good werre ^ And notwystandynge that the
prysonner have sw^rne to the master for to keep prison / the said master keep
him in a strong toure fast shet up / I ask the if such a prysonner may goo
his way if he can / and not be in no fawte therefore / For some might think ye
/ seeing that the master trusts him not of his oath that he has taken of
him / And sithe that he trusts not in his prysonners feyth / then can the
prysonner break no feythe / for he contenteth him not with the first bond /
But takes him another more strong to which he trusts most / Therefore
breketh not as it seems the prisoner his feyth / sith his master reputeth and
takes hit as for noone / I tell the yet again that after this that the right
has dystyncted of that that concernen the things of arms / if the gentylman
that his prisoner / is sworn to hold and keep his feyth to his master /
wh^yche in like wise after his promysse / gives him mete and drink
suffysauntly and lodgyse not ouere strayte / and is wyllyng to treatte with him
for a reysonable raunson / and that would not / he might be appayred of his
health for cause of the prison that his masters gives him / if such a
prisoner escape out and goo his way / though his master keep him in a sure
hold / that he breketh his oath and does against the right of werre and his
dyshonoure / For if he be a gentylman he ought to do as it apparteyneth / that
is to wit to hold his oath to his master which should have killed him when
he took him if he had would / And supposid that he kept him fast shet up / he
does to him no wrong / For he did promise his master to keep prison well and
truly and not break hit / so can not excuse him self such a fugytyf but that
he has done evil / For sith he did put him self in pareyll of bataylle /
that is to wit to be other ded or taken / he ought to have bethoughte in him
self / that prison was not a place of dysporte nor of feste / So ought he
then sithe that he is fallen in to parell / to bear swetly and pacyently the
penance in hope to come out at last to the best

Whether a gentylman prisoner of good werre ought rather deye than to be false
of his oath Capytulo / xxiiij /
I suppose master that a knight or a man of arms be wythyn the lordys prison
or of some other of the town / but so great a rygoure is made to him / that men
tell and afferme to him for certain / that if he within certain espace of
time have not done his raunson / he shall be slain / wherefore he requires for
goddis love and for pity that men will late him goo in to his country for to
get his rau^son and that without any fawte he will come again within a certain
day / And shortly to say men give him leave to goo upon his oath made and taken
of him upon the holy gospel of our lord / by which he swereth that for to
deye he shall not leave but that he shall come again within the day that he has
promised / and so it happeth that it is Impossyble to him for to get his
raunson / now is to be known whether he ought to turn again for to present
him self to the death which is promised to him / for namely it is wryton in
the romayn histories that the noble romans conquerours did some time so that
rather would expose hem self to the death than to break the oath of prison /
and if they that were paynemys and of evil believe that swered would lever deie
than for to forswere them / It is then to believe that bettre ought the
christian men to keep their oaths made upon the holy gospel of almighty god than
they / fair love thou say well / and yet many moo raisons to thy propos thou
might say / but to ye truth of the deed ben over many that might excuse man
in such a cas what that some doctoures will hold yt a man should rather be
willing for to deye / than for to forswere the name of god the which thus is
true in some cas / but as to the same which is parforced and vyolently made for
to save his own life ^ it is not determined yt it were the best / and wat he
is holden thereto I shall say the reasons / I tell the that after the right
written an oath that against well and vtylyte and namely against good condycyons
made / is not to be kept / And what that it is evyll to forsuere him self / It
is yet worse to keep such an oath / So ought to be chosen of thees two evil
the best / like as a man shall be sworn upon the gospel or upon the holy body of
our lord that he shall slay a man or ellis shall do some other great evil / it
is no dowte but that much more werse he should do for to slay a man or to
set a house on a fyire or some other great evil / than he should do in such
a cas for to forswere himself / what though he deed dedly sin at the first
when he deed swear / for things that be vnraisonable he ought not to be sworn
/ now it is so that noon ought to think the contrary / that no man after the
law is not master of his body for to put hit to be slain or his limes to be
cut asondre no more / than of an another body for if he slew himself / the
justice will punyshe the body and at a gybet shall hang hit shamefully / also
if he deed cut his lymes he should also be punished by the justice as another
had done hit / wherefore I tell yt yet again that it is not in him for to bind
himself by such manner of wise / nor the oath binds him not for it is of no
value / and more I tell the / It is of right writon that if a man may keep
another from death / and he does it not / we say that he has killed him / he
then trespasseth not / if he do keep for him self that right which he ought
to keep for another / that is to wit to eschew his death and this is as for to
excuse the extremytee of the thing / and to supply that which he could not
amend touching the payeme^t of his rau^son / But for all this I tell the not /
but that he is holden to make his raunson as soon as he may / and to put him
self in pain and deuoyre for to acquytte him self /

Here begins the foureth and last part of this book /
In the first chapter demanded Crystyne / if a lord sends a saufconduyt to
another his enemy / and that the saufconduyt speaks but of sauf coming /
whether after right he may arreste him at his gooyng hom again / Capio^ / j /
AT the beginning of this fourth part of this book right dear master I will
enter in to another dyffere^t purpos of werre dependyng of that which is before
said that is to wite in to a manner of assuryng which is given to them that
goo and come from a country to anoth^r that have werre to each other which
assuring men call lettres of saufconduyt / whereof I will first make unto the
such a demand / I put cas that a baron have werre with a knight / of the
which werre / the friends of both parties reyne hem self for to make a good
peace / wherefore the said baron sends his lettres of saufconduyt to the said
knight under which he may com towardis him / and sends to him word with all
that he may com surely / the knight trusting upon the assuryng of the same
lettres comes to the said baron / but when they have spoken both together /
and that the knight will depart / the baron does arreste him / and says and
proposes that he is his prisoner / For he says ye be at werre with me as
every man knows well wherefore I may take you at mine advantage where
someuere I can find you / that other ansuereth that he may not do so For the
strength of his own saufconduit deffendeth ye same the baron says that this
helps him not for because yt the saufconduit speaks only of ye coming
thither and not of there tournyng again wherefore he do him no wrong if he
keep him So demand I of the whether the baron has a good cause For it
should seem ye / seeing that hit suffiseth emonge enemies to take heed to the
tenoure of the lettre upon yt which is wryton / and since that the knight has
be so folyshe that he vndrestode not well that which the said barons wrytinge
contained / it is not without reason if he bear a penance therefore / For it
behooves in fayttes of werre / as thy self have said here before / to use of
cawteles for to deceive each other / late keep him self that may / I tell the
fair love that thou myssest in thy saying in this byhalfe For if it were as
thou say over many Inconuenyentes should follow thereof / and therefore the
law has purueyed thereto / that deffendeth expressly that noone shall
deceive by words of fallace nor cawtelouse / For should thou trow then
that a man should be herd at a Judgment for to say I have sold to another
an hundred pownde worth of land / and fair and well I have delivered hit
unto his hands whereof he is holden unto me in such a some of money that he
most pay me for / and semblably of other such things of the which as well I
tell the / should not be reputed nor taken in Judgment but for a trifle or a
mock / and the man begiler that would use thereof should be punyshed therefore /
And therefore to our propos what that for to take away all scrupulenes a man
ought never to trust in such lettres / without that it be well expressed of
sauff gooyng and sauffe coming again and also of sauf abydyng and of all the
other circomstances that bylongen thereunto / how be it that the law wol not
that the malice of the frawdylouse deceyuer take so straytly the symplenes of
him that gooth thus upon and under the terms of good feythe / So ought to be
vndrestande the saufconduyt thentent of him unto whom it is yeven / By the
which saufconduyt he holds him self sure as well for to abide sauf as for to
goo and return again sauf / otherwise it were no saufconduit / but it should
be treason that over greatly were to be blamed / and such is ye certeintee
thereof / Notwista^ding it may be / ye some in deed without right nor reason have
used or would gladly use thereof / which ought to turn them in to great
vituperye and blame / but every man has not the power for to do all the evil
that he gladly would do /

If a knight or some other gentylman had a saufconduit for his person and for /
ix / men with him / whether he might under color of the same take with him in
to the country of enemies some great lord instead of one of the ix / men / Cij
Sith that we be entered in matere of saufconduytes an suere me now of another
question / A knight of england has a saufconduyt of the king of France for
him and for / ix / other with him on horsbacke for to c^m^n to France for some
adoo he has there / and it happeth that a great lord or baron of england
desires him that he may be one of the / ix / his felawes / by cause that he
would feign goo see France to sport him there / the which thing the knight
grants to him / and thus he goes forth with him wh^rof it happed when they
be lodged nyghe paris that the said lord or baron is known there of a knight
of the kings of France / which well acompanyed comes scone towardys him
there as he is lodged / and tells him that he yield him and that he is his
prisoner / To the which thing thenglis^e knight that brought the baron with
him ansuereth / that he may not do so / For by virtue of his saufconduyt he
may goo he being the tenthe thrughe the royalme of France of which / x / this
baron is one / For such as him pleased he might take with him / Ansuereth the
frenshe knight and says / Ye be but a simple knight / so may ye not bring
with you no gretter man of condycyon than ye be of under your saufconduyt /
For if it were so than might ye in likewise have brought your king with you
or some of his children / the which thing is not raysonable / and namely him
that ye bring with you is bettre in value to bring you with him / than ye him
/ for he is much more great than ye be / That other says / I bring him not
with me under my / saufconduyte / But under the king of Fraunces saufconduyt /
so ask I and beseke that hit may be enter^ned and kept to me after the
tenoure thereof / This questyon comen to judgment I ask the which of both
has the right I say the frenshman For after the right wryton / in such a
generalyte ought not to be vndrestande a gretter man than he is him self / For
if a man gives a procuracyon to another for to do and execute certain things
of his own / it is not therefore to be vndresta^de that he gives him a
general procuracyon / or that he ought to abuse thereof / and in especyall in
fayt of arms / never such a thing should right suffer to pass / For it
might turn to prejudice to the person that gives the saueconduyt / Now I
ask the another thing / I suppose that a chyef captain of an oste of France
which is sent by the king upon the fronteres / says and affermeth that he
has the powere for to give saufconduyte thrughe all Guyenne / Wherefore he do
send word to the Seneshall of Bordewx that he will com unto a certain place
upon the frenshe ground / by cause that gladly he would speak with him / and
for to do so he sends him a saufconduit whereupon the said seneshal
departs upon the suretee of the same saufconduyt for to come to the place
that is said between hem / but it happeth him to be taken of some frenshe men
by the way that put him in to prison / I ask the wether the said chief
captain is holden to get him out of prison at his expenses / For it seems
ye / seeing that by his assewraunce he is fallen in to that Incouenyence and
damage / Fair love the contrary is truth / and know thou why For it is
said commonly that without a cause should a man be called a fool without that
his folly should be causer of his damage And it is clerly certain that the
seneshal ought not to have byleued the captain / but if he wist for certain
that the frenshmen would keep his saufconduyt wherefore then if he has been
simple and folyshe / the hurt and damage must a light and abide upon him / for
with all this he ought well to wite / that a captain has no powere to keep
him sure but fro his own folk / And sith then that other frenshmen that be
not of his retenue have done unto him the same / what can the said captain
do thereof / And also it is no right that one shall give a preuylege to one
that is gretter than him self for to come in to the royalme of his sovereign
lord / nor namely if he were bound to keep him sauffe / all should not
auaylle / For an oblygacyon made against power is of no value / and all other
the which be in the right of arms ought not to be unknown to the seneshall /
otherwise he were unworthy and not all to that effice So then I conclude
for that the captain had given the saufconduyt for true and good which has been of no value / he is not therefore holden to pay the said raunson
Nevertheless if he be a gentylman he is holden to purchasse towardis the king
his delyuerau^ce with all his powere because that thrughe his fawte he is
fallen in to such an inconuenyence /

Here says xprystyne to the master that she has herself great merueylle
seeing the litell feyth that regneth how any body dare trust in saufconduyttes
/ And syn demands that if it hap that some prince or christian king give a
saufconduytte to some sar^asyn / whether it is so that other kings ought suffer
him to pass by them under virtue of the same / Capytulo / iij /
Master without faylle this seems me great merueylle seeing the little truth
and fydelyte that this day renneth thrughe all the world / how a prince or a
lord or some other gentylman / and namely what soeuere man y^ it be dare trust
him self under a saufconduyt for to goo in a place where his enemies be more
mighty and more strong than he / Crystyne if thou thereof have merueylle / it
is not without a cause / how well that a saufconduyt after / thauncyent
constytucyon of the right of arms and also of al law ought for to be after
his nature a sure thing betwyx parties and mortal enemies which we call
capytall enemies in our laws / the which lettres of surete the good and
valiant conqueroures that were in time past / should not have broken ne
enfrayned for to dey / But now in time present for the barates / subtylnes /
and deceyptes that be found by which men have no shame for to make a lie
brekynge their feyth and their oath among christian folk much more than any
Iewes^ nor paynemys would do / wherefore it is counseylled by some of our
masters that men shall not trust of light in saufconduytes where as the time
is now come that where the laws do call frawde and barat it is now called
subtyltee and cawtele / whereof follows oftymes great parell / For in deed if a
man of what astate or condycyon that he be of will do some treason to some other
body when that he has the person in a place where he fyndeth him self ye
more strong / he shall find a noone al enough whereof to color a cause to
strive with him wherefore he shall slay him / or poison him he will / or perhaps
shall brenne his house or shall rob him / or otherwise shall hurt him under
coulourable deceypte / And when this is so done there nys no right that can
com time enough for to reco^pense him thereof by cause it is done under false
color / and for thees doubts says the law with good right that for surete
of a person that puts him self under the power of his enemy can not give
him self to great a preuylege / For after the deed done the restytucyon were
nothing / With out faille master / it is truth / but yet to this propos
tell thou me a questyon after right / I put cas that a crys^en king had
given a saufconduyt to some sarasyn / I ask the what folk christian ought to
keep him his saufconduyt / for to the purpos of that that thou haste said to
fore may some to me al first that the popis nor the em^eroures folk have
nothing a do thereof where as they be belonging to a gretter lord / than is
the king / I know what thou will say / For sothe they be not holden thereto
nor namely noon other king christian after the wytnes of the laws the which
say that a king can not give no mau^dement nor ordinance without his
Iurisdicyon / And thereof I shall tell the the truth / For some of his own
subgettes might also doubt that they be not holden thereunto / the cause why is
by cause that the sarrasyns ben general enemies of al crys^i^nyte / And it is
a thing of truth and also wryton that no christian man ought not to receive
any manner enemy of the law of god / So is a man much more bound to obey
god / than his temporal lord / as the law witnesses that says / that to
every person is permytted for to gaynsaye his lord / if he be such a man
that he will keep / bear / sustain / give favor to the enemies of the law of
god / By what right then should be holden the subgett of the said king for
to keep that same saufconduyt / And also the sarrasyns have not werre only
with one king christian but against all / and with this the law says that that
thing which towcheth all ought to be approved of all / it is other wise
naught / but now another thing is there to be vndrestande / that is to wite /
that if it be so / that for a raisonable cause it is given unto him as for to
purchasse the rau^son of some lord or knight or some other that is in the
sarrasyns hands as a prysonner / or for some other cause Just and raysonable /
dowbte not thereof / that not only the subgectes of the said king that give
the said saufconduyt / but generally all christian men where as he must pass by
/ ought to suffer him goo surely for two pryncypall raysons / that one is / by
cause that they shall not say by us emonge themself that litel feythe and love
we should have together among us that are christian people / when we would not
suffer that they should purchase the delyueraunce of thoos christian that be
prisoners in their hands for the feyth of our god / that other / if rudnes
were done to them of the christian when they come among us / supposed that it
were for vteraunce of their marchaundyses or as ambassatours or for some other
Just enc^hoson / they might selle hit right dear to our christian people that
for semblable causes goo among them full often / So ought we to keep them
such right / as we wol that they shall do to us But if it happed so that a
king or a town had werre against another / and for to aduenge him self or for
some other unreasonable cause should do come to his aid or other wise some
mighty sarrasyn under saufconduyt / In such a cas no christian folk subgette
or other ought not to suffer him / nor the vasselles nor capytaynes should not
be reputed for forsworn nor untrue to their lord for the same / For the
law namely says that if any body be found berynge any lettres against the
common vtylyte men may take hem from him and break hem with out leave of the judge
/ and another like hit says that al man ought to put from a bout him all
heretykes and folk that do against the feyth /

Begins to speak of trewes / and asks if that while they last between two
werreyers / Any town castle or other thing may be taken one upon other / And
whether that one party shall keep the trewes which that other party has
broken or not / Capytulo / iiij /
Master me seems that there is another assewryng of werre betwix enemies that
men call trewes / which is as one manyere of a peace made for a certain season
/ So wol I therefore some what wit of the of such questyons as I shall make to
the concerning the same / by cause that other while I have hard say in some
contreys where namely it has be some time used / that it is no great evil in
time of trewes if men see their advantage for to take or stele by some cawtele
some town or castle or some good prisoner if they may / So demand I of the if
it is truth that men may do so without wrong to do Whereby to this I
ansuere unto the that who someuer do so he enfrayneth the pure right of this
that trewes conteynen / And to the end thou shall know hit best so that thou
may in this party testyfye it the bettre / I shall tell the what our
masters sayen thereof / First of all they say that trewes is a royal
assewrynge that by no right ought never to be broken upon pain capytall like
as the ryghtwis law of a king or prince ought never to be broken / Item that
trewes ^onteynen three pryncypall things / that is to wit suretee youen for
goodys moeuable and other goodis / Item semblably to men / and thirdly hit
draws to a treattee and to hope to have peace / And then sith that trewes
conteynen in hem self such things both in general and in especyall by what
right might the one party take other town or castle or other thing upon that
other party / dear love with out faylle they that done so or that contryuen
that yt may be done without wrong / they set nothing by the right / so find
they diverse maneres of begylyng / And sithe that they wol couere their
falshed with right and with the law which vttyrly is against hem / there as
she says that al thing taken and usurped under trust of trues ought to be
yolden again and restored and all the costys paid / the name of trewes ought
not to be called among such men / But their dooyng ought rather to be cleped
extorcyon and deceyte / And wit thou what a king or a prince ought to do of
his own folk that such a vylany should do to him / as to make him lie and
not saying truth of his promise and affyaunce made / On my feythe to make
their hedes to be smytten of / So should other take ensample / and this is the
sentence of the law and thereof he should get such a good name that he should
be reputed a ryghtewis king / and more doubted he should be therefore / And by
the same he should give to his enemies cause for to yield them the sooner and
gladlyer unto him / the which if they be broken of them / and that he can have
some of them to his a boue / no raunson ought not to spare them / but that they
be pugnyshed as it apparteineth / And I ask the master / if the king of
France and the king of england had sworn a trewes together for a certain
time / and that the said king of england should break hem in deed / should
the king of France be holden to keep for it might seem ye / seeing that
supposed that if one do some evil / another is not holden to do hit semblably
/ but ought every man to keep his truth within him self / I tell that sith
that one of the two kings which that he be and of all other in like cas /
has broken his promise and has for sworn him self / that other is not
helden to keep his oath that he had made unto him / and for the same he for
swereth him not / for after right sith that men have broke first covenant with
him he is not bound to keep the same / but he is assoylled by the right wryton
of the Judgment thereof / And that worse is he should sin dedly if he should
suffer his own folk to be slain for fawte of his own deffense

Here speaks of one manner of werre called mar^ue to wite if it is just /
Capytulo v
Master where yet I am not satysfyed with thy wise and Just conclusyons I wol
make unto the certain questyons and demaundes upon another manner of
dyffe^rence that nyghe draws to werre which I wot not whether it is of right
or not / For the ancient gestes make no mencyon thereof / but the princes and
the lords syn the ancient lordshipes have taken to use thereof which is
called Mark that is when a man of a royalme as it were of France or of some
other land / can not have no right of certain wrong done to him of some
mighty man stranger wherefore the king gives him a manner of a license to
take / arreste or to put in to prison thrughe strength and virtue of
certain lettres opteyned of him marchauntis and all other and in likewise
their goodis that comes out of the land and country of him that has done
the wrong unto time that right and restytucyon were made unto the party
playntyff of his actyon and demand / So would I gladly wite if such a
thing comes of right / For a great merueylle it is to me that a man of the
country of him that has done the mysdede that happily never see him nor is not
coulpable / and yet for this cause he shall be arrested or put in to prison
and his goodys taken if he be found where as he that was wronged has powere
/ and shall must need pay and restore that whereof he owes naught nor has no
gylt thereunto / Daughter dear to say truth thou must know after the
writing of thauncyent right / that this manner of werre that is called mark /
thrughe which one takes and bears damage for another without his desserte is
not just nor the right wryton grants hit not / the which right has
ordained that if a merchant of paris or of whens he be of is bound to a
merchant of Florens which asks justice before his judge / but he can not
have of him his asking / the merchant florentyn may pursue his debytour to
fore the king till that right be admynystred unto him / But for to say that by
cause that a merchant of paris is bound unto him / he might put in prison
another merchant or bourgeys of paris or of some other place of the royalme /
or his goodis to take under arrest / verily for to say this manner of form
is another of right not of rayson grounded / But see here what of right may be
do thereto / which lords have brought up for this cause / I suppose that an
ytalyen were holden to a Frenshe man of a great some of syluere / of the which
bond he will defrawde and begyle him that is his credytoure / wherefore he
forsakes his own country and goes dwell in england by cause that he know
well that the frensheman shall not goo for to pursue nor plete with him there /
Or ellis this (...) fall another manner of cas / A genewey is bound (...) a
goo to a frencheman which shall know well that by cause of the evil will
that now is between the king of France and the duke of Iennes / the
frenshman shall not goo to Iennes for to pursue his dutee / wherefore he shall be
of so evil contynaunce / that he shall do no force for to make restytucyon /
what shall then the frenshman do he shall draw him self towardis the king
/ as a subgcet ought to his lord / for to have his help that he may recouere
his own goodis / The king then well enfourmed that this man said truth /
shall give him mark / And in likewise the king shall give the same if it hap
that a knight or some gentylman complayneth that he has be dystressed and
robbed Iniuried or brought to ashame some where as the king has no
deffyaunce of werre unto the time that restytucion and amend be to him made /
This cawte^e found the counseyllers of the princes for to withstand such
barates and deceytes / This mark conteyneth that every person that should be
found in the land of the prince that gives hi^ that is of the country /
town or place of him that should have do or should do the oultrage or wrong
/ should be take ^ and his goodis in to the courtis hand / till that the
merchant were paid and restored / or that to the injury were made a
suff^sau^t amend / and then when the merchants see themself so evil
handled in strange countries where as mark is given a^enst them / they find
such ways with the justice of their place or town that he or they that be
causers of the wrong that was done / shall be constrained to content and
restore that other and for this cause hit was found and brought up / and to
this propos serves well a common proverb that says / that by an in conuenyent
is chastysed another inconvenient also by the same hurt is another hurt
repaired / for by noon other way can men have no right of many and diverse
wrongys that be done / or that might be do to strangers gooynge by ye way /
But not withstandyng that this thing might have any color of right I tell
the so much thereof that every king or prince of whom this mark is required /
ought not therefore to grant hit lightly / For it is a thing ouere greuouse
and poysaunt / Wherefore it ought to be delibered with pain for two pryncipall
raisons / that one by cause it is a thing that full sore may hurt a mannys
conscience / that other is / that it may be a beginning of awerre / And
therefore what ought a king for to do when he is required for to give hit
against some country / cite or town / he ought first inquire by his president
or chau^celler / or by some other wise legyste or man of law for what rayson he
requires the same and what cause he has thereto / And if the man says that
when he came fro mylaen were taken from him in the town of Ast ten thousand
frankis orthe value thereof or more or less / and that of them he could have
no right but they of the town bare out this thing though that he did his
deuoire to complain before their justice / Then ought ye king to write
unto them / praying that amyably they will receive his lettres and make
restitucyon to be made unto his subget of the oultrage hurt and damage that by
on^ or diverse of hem has be done / and if it so hap then that for his
sendyng and desire they wol do naught and make no force of the kyngis lettres
/ and that it be seen and delibered by dyreccion of good cou^seil then such
a mark longs thereto / the king then after the costume of the lords
temporal may give hit of his auctorite especyall /

Yet of the same / and whether al lordis may give mark whether the king ought
to give hit for a stranger that will be made his cytezeyne / and whether scolers
might be troubled by virtue of the same or not / Capitulo / vj /
Then master if it happed that the people of florence or of ellis where had
taken in like caas the goodis of a merchant of paris / how should mark be
given against that same cite / for if men goo to the right there most justice be
asked thereof to the sovereign judge of the same place that is the emperor /
but how be it that they ben of right his subgetis it is not to be doubted but
that they wol do litell or naught for him / and to say that the merchant
should goo to plee before their potestate of that year y^ happily shall be a
cordewane^ or a tailler and yet shall he bear his gylt gyrdell as a knight
shapyng and sowyng his ^ho^e after their custom / So believe I that litel
right he should find there / I say not only more of florence than of another
cite where as the people governs / what then shall hereof be made / Aa fair
love tha^ that I told the before shall be do / the king shall send thy^ther
his lettres and if they make of them no force / he shall then mow give his
mark aienst them lawfulli / since yt they say hemself that they have no
sovereign / but call hemself lords of florence / master I ask the if all
lords may give mark / My love I ansuere the nay / For as thy self have said
and repliked before / no lord may Judge werre / but if (...) be sovereign of
Jurisdiction / And where then this deed of mark after his own kind and
condition is like unto werre noon may give the same / but if he be a lord
without me ane / as the king of france and other ben of their royalmes / Now
tell me yet / I suppose that a merchant borne of the cite of mylan has been
dwelling of long time in paris / and has there housyng herytages and lands
Wherefore he shall be reputed and taken after the custom as a burgeys of the cite
there I ask the if for this man the king shall give mark if the cas as a love
is said happeth to fall / seeing that he is not of the nation of france /
but is borne under the iurysdiction imperyal / I ansuere the that after the
rule of right he that is partener of the hurt and charge / he ought in likewise
to be partener of the well and comfort / wherefore if it be so that this
merchant have of long time paid the subsidies and imposicyons of his
marchau^dise and goodis unto the king and is a burgeys / without faylle ye
king is holden to bear and supporte him in all things as his subgett and
citezeyne / and semblably I tell the of a knight or some other ge^tylman
stranger dwelling of long time in France and seruyng the king in his werres /
so that he have lyuelode there of his own / yet I ask the if for cause of
this mark thus given / might a clerk studieng at the sooles within paris be
let or troubled or his godis arrested / I ansuere / as above / that nay nor
namely his fader that were come for to see him there / Nor namely the king may
not give mark though the cas so besell against what someuere folk of the
church / where as he has naught to know oner them / but this longs to the
pope if they ben prelates / and of other it lies in their prelat that ought to
compelle them for to do right and reason / nor the king by right can give
thereto no remedy / but if it be at thynstaunce of his prayer / and yet I
tell the that al pelgrimes of what land or nacyon so euere they be / be it in
time of werre / of trewes or of mark / ben in ye sauegarde of god and of the
saint where as they propose to goo to / and therefore ye country takes hem in
her especyall sauuegarde whereby they be preuileged above all other folk that
be reputed as folk of holy church / and he is acursed of our holy fader the
pope y^ hurts or troubles them by any manner of wise /

Here begins to speak of champ of bataill / and asks if it is inste and
good that a man shall prove by his own body fightyng against another that
thing which is secret and unknown / Capitulo / vij /
After thees things where as I am right content of the solucyons above said /
right dear master co^tinuyng ye matere of werre I wol make to the other
questions / by cause that in my time I have sometime seen used infrau^ce of this
whereof I will now speak / and namely before my time hit has be used all
enough in other places as for faites of arms / that is to wite werre yt is
only made between two cha^pions or otherwhyle many of one quarelle in a closed
field / the which werre is called cha^p of bataille which one ge^tylman
vndretaketh for to do against another for to prove by might of his own body
some crime or trayson that is occulted or hydd / so demand I of the if such
a bataille is just and permytted by right / daughter and dear love of this
matere among all other / because yt the noble men that be not clerkis that
this bok shall mow here or read / know best what in this is to be done it
pleases me right well to ansuere y^ thereof / wherefore to the^de that they y^
love the deeds of knyghthode shall vndrestande hem self in this matere / and
that thy self that after me shall writ it may show y^ truth thereof I tell
the / that emonge the other thingis of arms after divine right and also after
right humayne both canon and ciuyll / to give a gage of cha^p of bataille / or
to receive hit for to fight / is thing repreued and conde^pned / and among the
other decrees that forbedeth ye same / is acursed by the right canon as well he
that gives hit / as he y^ receives hit / and much more they y^ suffren and
byholden them / now may thou see whether it is a thing that ought to be done
or not / and that this be true well did show pope vrbain the / v / of that
name / when that a cha^p of bataille should have be made at villenoue by
auynon of two knights yt had arrested themself for to fight one against that
other before king Johan of france the which cha^p or clos field our said
holy fader the pope as thing prohibit and deffe^ded / comau^ded expressly upon
pain of cursyng / ye noon should goo there for to see the same / and if thou
or other would tell me / that to do such a thing / it is vsau^ce of arms /
I ansuere the / that much more great is the right of god / and more ought men
to obey thereunto / than to the usage of arms and that it is true / that folk
ought not to suffer nor do the same there is many good raisons that dyuine
right assigns thereto the which right divine is ye right of holy church /
whereunto we ought to obey upon pain of dedly sin / which right deuyne
condempneth all thing by which folk will tempte god / For men will know if
god shall help the right / and also as by their temptyng yt god should do
miracle / the which thing is undue as for to experimente the will of god and
it apiereth / for we say that for to ask a thing against nature or above
nature is presu^pcyon and it displeases god / and for to trow that the feeble
shall overcome ye strong / and the old the young or the sike the hole / by
strength of good right / to have / as have had and have confidence they that
thereto put hemself / such a thing is but ate^ptyng of god and I say for
certain yt if it hap them to win / it is but an adventure / and not for the
good right that they thereto have / and yt this be true / I shall by reason show
it to the / has not our lord suffered many a good man to be put to death
wrongfully and without a cause of whom the sowles ben blysfully in paradise
and not this miracle he deed for them / should then trow a pour sinner /
that god should do more for him / than he did for them / Truth it is also
that oftymes it has be seen that he that had good right lost / wherefore a
decretall remembers such an history / how upon a time in the cite of poulent
were two brethren accused of theft / wherefore after the usage of the same
cite behooved to deffe^de hemself in cha^p of bataylle where as they were
overcome / whereof soon after hit happed that within the said cite was found
the thief that had done the deed whereby manifestly was known that the two
brethren that al ready were dystroyed were nothing gylty thereof / And thus by
cause that semblably it has be known to hap so diverse times in diverse
lands and also that it is a thing vnraysonable to be done / the ryghtes
canonall have reproved this manner of fyghtyng / and as the law says if by
such a manner men would prove and make good their ryghtwis quarelle / the
iuges that be stablished and ordained for to do justice were as vain / and it
is an evil ra^son for to say / if I can not prone nor make good that that I
say / I shall fight therefore and shall prove hit by my body for noon but god
and I and he that I appelle thereof knows it not / and if some man would say
to me troth but the euyll^s y^ secretly be done can not be punished by justice
since that they can not be proved / I tell the that verily they can not be
pu^nyshed / but he that awayteth that the sin which is hid and secretly kept
be punyshed by him / such a man will usurp the divine puissau^ce and the
sapie^ce of almighty god which only apparteyneth to the punycyon thereof / and
affermeth a decree that says / that if all sins were punyshed in this world
the Iuges of god should have no place / and another rayson there is that this
thing conde^pneth / that is that the law cyuyl has ordained iuges and
judgment for to do as raison requires in place and that noone be taken for a
witness in his own cause / but a man that thus will make a prove by his body
forces him self for to break this law / It by right canon it is yet more
reproved / for it comau^deth expressly that men shall obey the pope and his
comau^dementes / and he by a good rayson has comau^ded expressly that men shall
never fight by such a manner of wise / Fair love thus may thou see that
such a bataylle is proved / to the which thing god gra mercy the king of
france and his good counsel / has well aduysed wherefore hit should be no
more in ewre within his royalme / the blessid god give joy peace and honor and
paradyse to them that thrughe virtue of good wit have entremytted and peined
hem self that such a thing were put a done out of that right christian
royalme of france / And that all such other folishe deeds of arms that
thrughe yougthe without cause / but only for a manner of pride of one for to
overcome that other without any quarrel which is dysplaysaunt to god / be
left / and where this said royalme which is the super latyf above all other
christian royalmes has bygonne thesa me al other if it please god shall take
ensample so to do that their noble men dysobey not the church puttyng the
body in parell of death to their great dysworship without a cause and their
sowles dampened and lost for evermore / O lord god what folyshe enterprise /

For what causes the law Imperyal did ordeyne champ of bataylle Capitulo /
viij /
But by cause that the deffe^ses above said of the right writon have not be
alweies observed nor kept nor yet be not obeyed in all royalmes as touching for
to fight in cha^p of bataylle as it is said I shall tell the causes for the
which they that deed set hit up have iuged it to be do yt is to wite
the emperor federik that so much contraried holy church that he chassed ye
pope out of his place ye time when he came to his refuige and secoure toward ye
ki^ge of france / and also another scripture that men call the lo^bardishe
law / deuyseth thereof in diverse cases / the which herafter shall be declared
by me unto the / first the said e^perours law says / if a man be accused of
traison that he have machined purchassed procured or conspired against his
prince or aienst his cite or ellis to ye prejudice of the common well what
soever the cas be of whithe the truth can not be by no proves known / and
yt this man so accused offreth to deffe^de and purge himself by champ of
bataylle against al men that wol say aienst him / shall be received to do the
said champ of bataylle / It that if a prisoner of werre be kept in prison by
the party adverse / and yt it happeth during the said prisoneme^t / that peace
be made betwry the two parties under condicyon that al manner of prisoners
shall be delivered sauf ageyn without pa^eng of any rau^son wherefore it may hapli
fall that the master sleeth his prisoner for which mysdede by right he may
lose his head / and he be reproved and atteinted thereof / whereupon he says yt
he slew him in his deffe^se / and that first of all the prisoner had other
trait^usly or by some otherwise assaylled when they were but them two together
and this he wol make good by good prove of his own body in a champ of bataille
if any man were that would say contrary aienst him / he ought to be received /
Item also it says as by such a fall / we putt cas that the king of france
and the king of England had trewes togider / and that it should hap a
Frensheman during this time to wound and hurt full sore an Englysshema^ or an
englisma^ a frensshe^^ of y^ which thing y^ law says / yt in such a cas
behooves of right and Justice a gretter punicyon to him that has hurted y^
other than if he hadd done the same to one of his own country / if he yt this
wrong has done would bear hy^ out by the prove of his own body that this was
done of him in his defense against that other that first had assailled him / his
wordis by the said law imperial ought to be herd / It if a man accuses
another yt he would have had slain the king or the prince by poisons or
otherwise / and that other says that he lies falsely and for the same called
him to cha^p of bataylle / he is holden by the said law imperial to ansuere
him and keep him the day yt he shall set for to fight with him

For what causes did ordeyne the lombardyshe law champ of bataylle / Capitulo
/ ix /
So is there another law that is called the law of lo^bardye where in be
co^prysed many diverse things / and in the same by especyal the maistres that
stablyshed it have thereupon writon many causes to which men may give gage for
to fight in champ of bataylle / and out of the same laws are come almost all the iugementis of gyuing of gage that is to say a token of deffyau^ce for to
befight his enemy within a clos field which men call cha^p of bataylle / so
shall I tell the some of thoo causes / that is to wite if a man accuses his wife
that she has traytted or bespoken for to make him dey other by poison or by
some other secret death whereof by some color he has her in suspetyon / but
she can not be to the truth truly attainted / or ellis when thehusba^d is ded
/ and his kynnesmen puts upon his wif that she has made him to be brought
to death if this woman can find a kynnesman of hers orsom other friend that
will fight for her beryng out y^ that which is laid upon her / is falsely said
/ the lo^bardishe law will that he shall be received for to fight for her against
who someuer will blame her / It if a man were accused that hehad slain another
And that this could not be proved against him / If he casts his gage against
him that accuses him the law will that he be received / It semblab^^ that if
he hadd beat a man under assewrans / Item also if a man have slain another man
both al alone and that he wol make a proffe by gage of his body that it was in
his deffe^syng and that the other assaylled him first / the said law will that
he shall be herd / It if a man after the decesse of some kinnesman of his of whom
he ought to have the goodis by succession as next heir / were accused to have
slain him forto have his lifbode and his goods / he may deffe^de him self
thereof by his body after the form aforsaide / It if a man were put upon and
accused to have layen with a mannys wyffe the which cas after this law if her
husband or kynnesman complain to the justice is capital death that is to say
/ were thy to lose his head for the same the said law will that this man shall
mow deffende him self by gage of bataylle It in likewise it is of a mannys
daughter being yet under (...) rule of her parents if they do complain of
some man that has had feleship with her / though it was with her good will
this law will that he deye but if he deffende himself thereof by champ of
bataylle in cas that the thing were so secretly kept that it might not be
proved against him for if manyfeste or openly known it were / if the kynnesmen
will there were no remedy / and therefore this law should seem well strange in
France and in other place that a man should deie for such a cas seeing that it
was by the goodwille of the woman wedded or not wedded and this law is upon
such a raison fownded where it is truth that a man takes death by sentence
of the law or of justice for to have committed a small theefte of gold or of
silver a jewel or other thing / of which cas what soeuere necessite has
brought him thereto shall not mow excuse him but that justice shall keep upon him
her ^ygoure / if grace for respect of some piteouse cas / be not to him imparted
and made / why then shall be spared he that has dyspoylled and taken away
the honor and worship not only of a woman alone but of her husband and of
both their lygnages / and because that where this folk that first made and
stablyshed thees laws praise and set much more by worship than they deed of
gold nor of silver / they concluded that yet much more ought to have deserved
death he that robbed another of the forsaid honor wherbi all a holl kynrede
is reproved / than if he had taken from them what someuere other thing / and
therefore some deed say that the law was yet well gracious and pytouse to them
/ when such folk were not more cruelly punyshed / then other that were worthy
of death / that is to wite / that hit made hem not to deye of a more cruel
death / than for another cas / Another cas puts the said law that should
seem al enough against rayson / that is to wite that if a man had holden and
possessed certain lyflode house or land or namely moeuable goods the space
of xxx year or more / and that another should accuse him that thrughe evil and
deceyuable means he had hit and falsely had possessed hit / that if this
accusar offered to prove the same only by his body in cha^p of bataille / he
shall be received thereunto / But without faille not withstanding this law / I
tell the well / that folysshe is he that such law accepts or such gage /
and he that is thereunto called / and that al ready has the possessyon in hand
/ might ansuere thus to that other / Fair friend / I have naught a do with
thy gage / fight thy self al alone if you seem it good / for I shall never fight
for this cause / so is there no law that may gai^saye him in this cas / for
prescripcion is aproued of al right / It says the said law yt if it happed
two men tofall a debate togider and that their question were brought to
judgment where both of hem should produce or bring forth their proves / to
this entencyon that if the one party would gaynsaie ye other and that they
cowde not accord / if he will make it good by proffe of his body / he shall be
received / It if a man takes an action upon another for certain some of
silver or some jewel or of some other moeuable good which as he said he lent
to his fader or mother / and that other denies him the same he shall also be
received against ye other to do cha^p of bataylle / if he proffreth to make it
good by the same mean It if a man has be brought to loss and damage by
fortune of fire in his house or in his grange or other thing / if he will prove
against another in manner a forsayde that he has put the fire theryn / he
shall be herd / It if a man complayneth over his wyffe that she is no good
woman / though he do this for a wyle for to close her within awalle or for to
be quytte of her or that she should be banyshed from her dowarye / she may
deffende hereof herself / if she can find a cha^pyon that will fight against her
husband for her / and if the husband refuses him he shall not be byleued / Item
if a man hau^teth in the house of awedded man / if the husband will say that
this man has hau^ted and hau^teth for to have a do with his wyff for to shame
her and him / this other man that so haunteth there may deffende him against the
husband by gage of bataylle / whereof I do lawghe consyderyng such a folly /
that if the felawe that so is accused were great and strong it were well
bestowed if he feel him self Innocent that he should beat well and thryftly in
the champ that Ialous and folishe husband / It if a man accuses another yt he
has pariured himself in judgment he yt is so accused may gainsaie hit as it
is said / many other things conteyneth ye said law that concernen champ of
bataille which I leave for shortness of the matiere / as a thing not needful
more for to say / but so much it is to be vndrestande that thees batailles are
some time done by the pri^cipall persons when a raysonable cas of some lettyng
falls there / As it were if a man to young were accused / or a man that were
to old / or a man that had some siknes or that were impotent and could not help
himself and some time a woman and all such other persons / the which things
are all enough expressed and named in the said laws / And namely if a
bondeman said that his lord had made him free of his bond and seruytude and
this he will make good by his body / the lord is not holden to receive
bataille therefore / but ought to deliuere him a champion / and more hit says
that two clerks of like degree may have leave to be fight each other in champ
of bataylle of the which thing sauffe her grace I say that she has wrong
to entremette her self in such a cas of any man of the church for the canon
yt ought more to be obeyed deffendeth them expressly al manner of bataylle and
violent hurt / and I ask the if a man impotent as it is said may set for
him self sache a cha^pion as shall please him / I ansuere the / that the
champions that be comytted for another are in this deed of bataille fygured or
in figure of procurours and advocates of plee / which office every man may do
for another if he will / if right expressly gaynsayeth it not / right even so it
is of the champyo^s / for who soeuere will he may be one so that right gaynsaie
him not for some cause / For a theeff or some other that tofore had committed some
great evil or crime should not be received thereto nor no man that is known
of evil fame / And the rayson is good / That is to wite that if such a man
entered a champ of bataylle for another and were vainquished there / men should
wene that it had been for his own sins / and that therefore he had lost the
bataylle /

How champ of bataille represents somewhat process of pleetyng / And whether it
is of right that the champyons shall swear by fore they enter the field /
Capitulo x /
But how be it that gage of batayll^e as I have said before be of our
doctors reproved Nevertheless because it is a thing which is in usage in the
deeds of noble men and in thexcercyce of arms and of knyghthode that such
bataylle have been and are by the kings / princes and lords iuged after the
right that hit can have whereof the custom shall not yet faylle in all places
it is good for to speak yet thereof to the learning of thoos that shall most
judge thereof / and semblably of them that shall vndretake hem / For I hold
that the most part of the noble men / what that many one speaks of know not
very well that which is or ought to be contained in such a bataylle
touching thentrepryse / the doing ^ the judgment upon the same / so shall I
tell the thereof first thou ought to know / and it is very certain yt thees
particul^^ batailles shown by figure nature of judgment for right so as to a
judgment is the judge and he that claymeth action ^lso the defendau^t present /
also is there the forespeker and the proves and after the same follows the
sentence / semblabli so is the judge and lord in a clos field tofore whom the
bataille is made the party playntyf and ye deffendau^t be the two cha^pions
that fight there together / the witness and proves ben their armures and the
strokes yt they give to each other by the which strokes and armures either of
them forces him self for to prove best their ente^cion / and thereafter
follows ye victory which falls to one of them yt represe^teth ye
diffinitiue sentence / master I beseech the yt thou take not now in anger if I
put interrupcyon in thy words / for a questyon that I will ask of the / by
cause that I have herd the say that the champyons do swear when they enter
the field etc^ / whether it is a thing right wys that they make any oath there
/ For it should seem nay and it needs not by cause that in a general
batayill^e where two kings were and their folk should noon oath be made /
and why then shall two persons swear / Dear love I ansuere the / that for to
make there their oath / it is but the right of such a bataylle / and it is
no good that that thou say that in great batailles is noon oath made /
Know thou the cause / it is by cause that such great bataylles are
entreprysed by delyberacyon of a great counseyl and Iuged of the lords / so
behooves there noon oath / But to such a partyculer werre / the prince can not
know so well the certeynte of the quarelle / and therefore he will take of them
their oath upon that which they vndretake to prove by their bodies / So
calls hit the lombardyshe law / the head oath / and this oath that thou know
/ is of the nature of ye oath of calengyng which ought to be taken at the
beginning of al manner of plee / where as the party playntyff swereth that his
action is rightwys and good / and after that swereth the party deffendau^t
that his deffenses be true / and even thus it ought to be done in a champ of
bataylle / But to the end that thou shalt vndrestande / there is a craft for
to take such an oath / For if he that called that other / swereth absolutely
against the other of that thing whereof he is not well certain / as though I
suere upon the holy gospel that thou have mordred or made to be murdered my
fadre or my brother and al weyes he is not thereof well certain / For he has
not hit well seen / but it may be that he shall have herd say the same / or
for some color he shall have a suspectyon thereof such an oath is folisshly
made / For noon ought to swear absolutely for a thing / but that by his own
eyes he be sure and certain that it is so / and for this cause may be his
quarrel naught / For he forsuereth him self if it be not as he says / But it
is otherwise of the party deffendau^t ^ for he can not be ygnoraunt of the
quarelle / for well he does know if he be coulpable of the deed or not / and
therefore his quarrel is bettre / in cas that he feel him self pure and cleue
thereof / but if he wilfully do for swear him self / much more is worse his
cause than of him that weneth to say truth / wherefore for to be more certain
and in surete to have a good quarelle the party playntyf / that is to say he
that calls that other which is party deffendaunt / ought to swear only
without m^re that he holds steadfastly and bileueth that that other has
kylde his fader / or has done to him thyniurye wherefore he calls him to
bataylle / and by the same shall his quarrel be the bettre / So ought he for to
say before the prince the cause why he his so moeuyd and the manner of the cas
and the prince thereupon ought to be wise for to see and advise by the (...)
constances / if this that he says may be true or not for if the crime or
mysdede had be done the day before nyghe the park of vycenes / and that he that
of the same is accused cowde bring true proves that all that day he was far
thens he ought not to give no feyth to such calling upon that wh^che were
impossible / so ought the prince therefore well to adu^se that the quarelle be
just or ever that he iugeth hit acceptable and not to here all them that call
other through folys^ moeuynges and dotyng opynyons / For many there be so litell
wise that they would folyshly expose hem self to the same for no cause at all
/ or for litel occasion / and they should wene that it were a fair deed done
of hem because of their lytyl consyderacyon / And it is no pity when it
falls evil to them / but of that other party is compassion for they must
deffende hem self / and if they do it not after the use of arms men should
give hem blame and dysworshyp therefore / ye after thopynyon of the young folk
not wise in this caas / And I ask of the / if yt happed that both the parties
would be fight each other in a plain field / or ellis without the presence of
the prince / should he suffer it I tell the / nay / For it is a thing whereof
the knowledge longs unto him for to give his Judgment upon the same / and
against the prince in this caas / may not their own will make no prouydence
/ but that the said lord or he that is committed and ordained and also they
that must keep hem / must be there present by cause they shall be there sure of
all other persons nor no man in the world ought not to say there nothing
upon pain to be greatly shent without it be by the king or princes maundement
that ought to judge at latter end which of both is overcome or vyctoryouse /

Asks xprystyne / if it hap that one of the two champyons lose some of his
arms be it sword or other thing / whether men ought of right to see hit
restored again to him Item which of both / ought to enuahyshe first / Item if
the king pardonne him that is overcome / Whether the vyctoryouse may ask him
the costs that he has done etc^ Capitulo / xj /
Master I ask / if it fall so between two champyons that befyght each other
within a clos field / that the one of hem breketh the sword or the axe of that
other / or casts hit ouere the pale / For I hold well with all that they do
the worste that they can one till other / supposed that this man had none another
axe / dagger nor mayle nor no wepen to deffende him with all / Whether by
rayson men should delyuere to him other harneyse deffensable / For syn it is in
the manner that thou have said / that is to wit that the armures Inuasyble
and also deffensable are fygured and taken for wyttnes and proves where with all
men may help him self in plee etc^ / It should seem that men ought to delyuere
and yield hem new harneys again / if they require to have hit / For if it were
so that for to prove good mine intencyon I had produced and brought some
witnesses which I suppose should faille me by death or otherwise I may yet
bring forth many moo / why then / if this champion has not mow prove his
inte^cyon by the same sword or other wepen of his / may not he have another /
Fair love soothe for say / after the rayson of such right as he awayteth
there to / a great consyderacyon ought to be had here for to judge of the same /
For a great dyfference is there if the sword is by adventure fall from his
hand / or if that other has taken hit fro him or broken or cast out of the
clos / or if by folyshnes he should lose hit / and like wise of his other
harneyse But if the sword by adventure brake by the strokes that he him self
should give with all / and not by the effort or strength of his aduersarye and
that he had no more weren for to deffende him self / and that by such manner he
had lost it all / Without faylle some maystres sayen that men should do him
wrong but yt they should give him other harneyse but seldom it happeth a man to
enter in to a clos field without that he be garnysshed with moo wepens than one
/ so may he help him self with that one when that other is lost or faylleth:
Now sire: and if it hap that the judge can not know the first day which of
both is overcome are they holden to return the morrow after / I tell the
certeynly that ye if it be in their powere / so that they have enterprised to
be fight each other at their vttermoost hynderau^ce in cas that noon other
condycyon were not set before / So can they not be assoylled nor quyte unto the
time that the one of them be overcome though that it tarry never so long /
reserved al ways the commandment of the prince contrary to the same / or that
they should accord hem self together by maundement of the king / For other
wise they may not do it after that they be ones entered within the field / But
the prince ought to be piteouse upon the same having mercy of thees two men that
be not only in parell of bodyly life and worship but also in Ieopardye of
their sowles / Tell me yet master and teache me which of both ought first to
smite the first strok when they both two be within the field / For I have not
forgoten that thou saidest here before / that this manner of bataylle holds
in party the nature of a plee / whereby it seems that he that calls that
other ought to begin first to smite / For so much I wot well of the manner
of a plee where as I have often assayed hit and has cost me / that he that is
actoure / that is to wit / party playntyf gives and shows first his actyon
and demand and after the party deffendaunt ansuereth thereupon / and because
that in this doing here if he that is accused should smite first / then
should he seem to be party playntyf and not party deffendaunt / For it is no
deffense that comes before the stroke / but it is offense / dear love how well
that thy raysons ben consonaunte / Nevertheless it behooves to be done here in
this caas by another manner of way / than as a plee is rewled where as it is
there exploytted by words and here by way of deed / And therefore / where as a
man is in parell of death he ought not to abide after the first strok For such
a stroke might be so heavy and so great / that to late he should come for to
deffende himself / And also all enough has begin first of all he that
calls the other when he first deed cast his gage for to be fight that other
in a champ of bataylle / And if at a judgment the playntyf shewyth first his
actyon it is but by words whereof is good chep enough / or by a little writing
/ So is it not so parellouse a lybelle or a roll as is a strok of an axe or of
a (...) And after that they be ones closed in both together / and that men have
escryed them that either of them do his deuoyre and his best / another of them
cares not how great hurt that he does to his foo / And therefore I tell the
that in this cas after all rayson be it by wylynesse / cawtele / barate wit
appertyse or strength or by any other manner of wise sin that they be so
cowpled together / he that is appeled may be the first that stryketh if he can
have leyser so to do for his case and in all points to take his advantage if
he can or may do so / But truth it is that he must tarry till that other be
marched against him fro his place one paas or two / or ellis that he have made
semblaunt for to come towardys him It yet again another questyon I ask of the
/ I take that the king that thus byholdeth and sees two champyons fyghtyng
togider / have pitee upon him which is to the point brought that he must be
overcome and dyscomfyted so commands the king to call and cry ^ ho ho ^
which as much is for to say / no more / no more / by his connestable / and that
not withstandyng the same / he that has the bettre of the field requires ye
king for to do admynystracyon of justice and that he will Judge the right for
him / the king ansuereth and says / I adiuge unto the honor and the
victory of the bataylle / and I pardone to that other / for so is my pleasyr
for to be do / this man asks his costs and expenses / ought he to have hem
or not / for it might seem / that nay / because that the king has not
conde^pned that other in the same which also has not confessed the deed as a
man that is overcome / I ansuere ye / that if he were vttirly overcome / though
that the king should pardone him the debate the which thing lies in his
puyssau^ce / he may not do therefore no wrong to the party that rightewisly
required him for justice / but if it be so that men call / ho / before that he
be all atteynted and in all points overcome / he is not holden thereunto / for
how be it he has the worse of the bataylle / yet has he not confessed ye
thing wherynne lies the very victory that longs to the vyctoryouse / that
is to wite when he makes that other for to confess himself gylti of the deed
/ and also he might yet have a hope that some strok might be yet given / that
should hapli slay him that troweth to have the bettre of the bataille / as it
has be seen diverse times / that he that was under / smote that other that so
held him / so strongly with a dagger or some knyf that he slew him sterk ded /
for a fayt of batayll^e what that it seems yerof can not be godly iuged unto
time yt it be brought at an end / and fair sweet master / if hit happed
that it were found ones that some body in such a cas had accused a another
wrongfully of murdre or of some other crime / what should be done of the accusar
/ Without faylle our masters determynen / that men shall do that punicion upon
him as the cas gaffe for to be do upon that other if he had be truly atteynted
thereof

She asks if when a man is punyshed by champ of bataylle of some mysdede /
whether the Justice has nya more to do with him or not in this byhalfe /
Capitulo / xij /
YEt again I ask / a man calls another to champ of bataylle for to make good
upon his body / that he is falsely forsworn / and so it happeth that he
ouercometh him And gives to him the punicion according the cas / It happeth
aftreward / that for the same cas / he his troubled and attached by the justice
/ ought this man to be iuged and punyshed more than ones of one self cas / for
it should not seem that it were right / nor god will not of it nor holy
scripture accords not to the same that a body should be twys conde^pned for
one sin / Fair love herto I shall ansuere the what that the excusasions that
thou make be good and namely many other for the party that is accused /
that other party might ansuere / We are now in court of right wryton / by the
which ought to be iuged of the cases that requyren punycion but where gage of
bataylle is not aproued by no right writ^n it suffiseth not / For supposed
that by such away he has been corrected / it is therefore no punytyon / For
justice has naught seen thereof and noon other thing it is as to
consyderacyon of right / but as if it were so / that the fader had beat his
child for cause of some trespace that he had done which correctyon should not
suffyse / nor justice should not leave him therefore to punusshe him other wise /
So shall I tell the after thees two altercacyons the truth thereof / We^e
thou for very certain / that if it had be so that the day had be deferred so
long betwyx thaccusar / and he that was accused / and that in this mean wyle
the cas had come to the knowlage of the justice / I do the well to wit / that
not withstandyng the^terpryse of the said bataylle justice may punysshe him /
if it be a thing that can be proved / But if thou ask me whether after the
punicion he had be holden to keep the day of the field / I should ansuere the
nay / For what right could he have for to deffende him self of the deed whereof
he is al ready conuyct and attaynted / But if it be so that the prince / or he
that keeper was of the field / had punysshed him of this mysdede / or that he
had remytted hit to him or pardoned what soeuere it were / without faylle
thauctoryte of the prince is so great that this custom aproued to prove by
cha^p of bataylle and to punysshe by such manner of way they that be
attaynted / that it ought well to suffice / that he be punyshed ones and no
more / Nor the princes and lords should not suffer to reuoque nor call again
their sentences / master if thou be not to weary that so much I do inquire
of this matyere / tell me yet aworde to this prop^s / A knight accuses
another and calls him to bataylle / and syn repents him that he has done
so / may this knight repent him or not at his own will if he will and that
no more be spoken nor nothing made of that that he has said / for verily it
should seem / that he might well call again his word fro the same seeing that if
a man accuses another or says evil by him by hastynesse or wrath he may
well repent him thereof if he will without more making a do as me seems / nor
he shall not be by the Justice imposed nor set therefore to that pain that he
should bear for the same if he proceeded forth / ferthermore / and why then
should it not be so in this cas / To this I ansuere that if a gentylman
calls another by castyng to him his gage For what someuere that it be in
thabsence of his lord or of the conestable or marshall or of some other Judge
all and competent / and that after this he do repent him self therefore
because / as it may well be / that he was evil informed / or ellis chaffed for
anger or malenco^e / or happily for taking of ouere much wine / this thing by
good means may lightly enough be remytted in a manner that to that other
ought to suffyse and not to make sewte upon him for the said calling / For noon
ought to be over sharp nor to hot upon the same where it is a thing
dau^gerouse whereby great perell may fall whatsoever good right that a man has
/ seeing also that that other receives shame / all enough for to repent him
self of the casting of his gage and to be so koled of the bataylle / by the
which his folyshe moeuynge he has showed well that he was not wise / For an
over great shame it is and a token of a little wit for to cast him self so
far in words / that he must needs afterward to gaynesaye his own word /
Nevertheless it is more bettre for to repent of a folly before that it be
executed or made / than for to enter with an evil quarelle in to a champ of
bataylle / nor it is no vice for to repent him se^f of the evyll / but it is
a great sin and folly for to vndretake and make yt in deed / But in caas that
the words were goon so far forth / that by fore the prince or his
connestabse or Maresschall or some other able for to receive him / That had
cast his gage of bataylle / he should not mow repent him self thereof without
the will of the prince and assentyng of the party / the which by reas^n
might ask amend / For to the purpos that I t^lde the before that champ of
bataylle follows the ways of plee / so doethe represente this gage the
bataylle that men give at the iugyng of a cause / after the which / he that
gives hit / must pursewe his quarelle if the parties accorden not together /
But well it is truth / that the prince / syn that he that calls repents
him self / ought to be a large forgyuer to thoos that repent themself / as
god and holy scripture requires /

Here deuyseth of the things / that a prince ought to see unto before that he
shall judge a champ of bataylle / And how men ought to give cou^seyl to them
that must befight each other / Capitulo / xiij /
THe bataylles of a clos field whereof thou haste devised that now ben in usage
in many lands / and have be long time past / as for to say in all the world
so that the custom has suffered them / notwithstanding the deffense of the
decree and of the right canonall / as thou say / is turned as to a law / me
seems that a strong thing it is to the princes for to judge and determyne
well of the causes that such bataylles requyren / For it is no doubt / but
that the lords desire and will / that right be do to every man / and therefore
they suffer such a bataylle to be do / to the end that the causes that been
obscure and hidd may be thereby attainted and known Dear love thy words ben of
truth with out faylle / And therefore affermyng that* that thou say / that
the Judgment of such a bataylle is right paryllouse and subtle: it playseth
me. for the doctrine and techynge of the noble men to the which end thou
do labor in this bok to put here and declare some rules that must be kept
upon this matyere: the first rule is this: that no prince seculer to the^de he
do not amiss: al be he never so prudent nor so wise what soever good cou^seyl
of wise knights and other seculer men yt he have ought not judge no champ of
bataylle / without the regard and counseyl of the sage men of law / by cause
that of al causes that may hap to fall / they can determyne much bettre than
other folk / For their connyng shows and techeth them the same / so
apparteyneth to them for to declare of the causes what thereof is to be do /
and whether it is ^ thing reprouable / forboden / conde^pned or aproued and
comendabl^e / Or whether one cause be preuyleged before another / and that this
be true / that such folk when they ben expert / can determyne thereof bettre /
than other do / the law civil do grant the same / the which says that
the advocates are protectours and rulers of al humayne folk / yet is there
another raison whereby it behooves unto them for to determine of the same before
all other men / It is by cause that knights and other gentylmen are sooner
moeued for to swear a fayt of armee / than clerks be / and this comes to them
of a statute that they ^aue among hem that they shall repute and take a man for
deshonoured and ashamed / without that he soon accepts thegage of him that
casts hit unto him / which is an opiny^n y^ is moeued as to this be halue
sauf their reverence without any regard of rayson / for less worship should
be after right to him that should give or accept a gage of bataylle for a (...)
cause or ocasyon or for folishe and nyce moeuynge / than to him that should
refuse yt / For without faylle it is no dyssworship / but rather the contrary
/ For to refuse and not consent to any folyshe enterprise / spe^yally where as
so dear a catell hangs in parell / as is both the soul and the body And
might say he that is assaylled and called / My friend If thou list for to
fight / So fight thou then by thy self al one / For as for me I will not be
partener of thy folly / The second rule that the prince ought to keep in this
byhalfe it is / that though a gentyl man should accept the gage of another /
that happily were moeued against him for some malice or for favor or for some
prydefull will caused with envy / trowyng to overcome and put him under and
he to be the bettre enhaunsed for the same / or for what someuere other moeuyng
without rayson / the prince or his lieutenau^t ought to advise demewrely
herupon for to here and vndrestande well the words and the manner of him that
calls that other / For some there be that will color right under a falasse by
their great words and are so folyshe that they trow for to begyle god / but
this al to gider falls upon hem self / with the same the prince ought also to
consydere well what the cause is that moeuyth him thereunto / and what manner of
thing it is / that he puts upon the other / And if it be so that he says
that it is for debt / the prince or some other for him / ought to ask for what
a cause is the dewtee due unto him / in what land and in what place it was
made whether he has writynge or witness thereof or not / and if it hap that it
be perceived that aparence of some proffe be there or some couloure whereby
ryghtewyse judgment can be had / he ought to comytte the cause in arbytrage /
for in such a cas a man might not by right sustain nor say yt / therefore
should champ of bataylle be made / It the / iij / rule is / that the prince
ought to make him that calls that other / for to propose by fore his person
/ the cause of thaction yt he has against that other / and also in like wise /
to see that the party deffendaunt be there examyned in presence of his
cou^seyl where as shall be as it is said the best men of law / and there it
ought to be seen and full well dyscuted and duly serched whether the party
plaintyf has just cause or not / and there shall every man say hereupon his
opinion / After which thing if it be found so that the cause be moeuyd by
pride presu^pcion or folly / as who should say / I wol prove my body against
his to the death in a champ of bataylle for to get worship / or for the love
of mine own lady / or that she is fayrer / than his is / and such other diverse
manners of folly / Soon ought to be put abacke this thing and not to be herd
/ and to forbede that thereof be not spoken more / And yet more I say / that
for whatsomeuer words of injury yt it be / if they ben said in an anger / or
in hete by suspecyon or malencolye and that he against whom such words have been / will fight for hit / there ought not to be iuged no bataylle / without
that he that has said them would maynten still the same and would fight in
this quarelle / To the which thing / if it so happed / yet should me^ pain
he^self for to modere and pease each of hem without bataylle / which by no
wise / as it is said ought not to be enterprised nor suffered to be made nor
iuged without an over great fawte / cause the same to be do / but ought to be
forboden and let as much as men can ^ But if it be so that the matere be
great and peysaunt / as it were for trayson / for murdre or for some great
vyolence done / and that the party playntyf can not prove ne show the same
but by prove of his own body / and yt the party deffendyng can not
suffisauntly excuse himself / but that he is gylty thereof / then thus as it
is said / by thynspectyon and consentyng of all the counseyl / ought the prince
to judge the bataylle after that the law in such a cas requires the which is
such / that as soon as it is iuged / though that many one ben so proud of
hemself / that they trust in noone other thing / but oneli in their bodyly
strength / and care another of god nor of his help yet ought to be there
committed some wise men / that shall show to them the great parell both of the
soul and of the body wherynne they do put hem self / And that they advise
and see well and that they will call unto them some wise confessors for to be
shryuen and that they advise and see well to them self and that they of them /
that they may be in good astate / and that they call unto god to help their
part / For great need they shall have thereof at last / and thus ought the
said wysemen to exorte and admoneste them / eythre of hem by him self /
showing unto them how this thing is full heavy and great in which they must
dey / or ellis suffer great dysworshyp and shame so advise he and see well to
for him self / that he come not to late for to repent thereof / and all such
things that been go ode both for the soul and for the body ought the
confessor to see that he can well tell and show unto him that he shall shryue
/ and to admoneste him truly / not leuynge him at the end of the thing
where he mystreth most to be well cou^seylled / specially in tournoys of arms
that in such a cas ben couenable / as well to assaylle / as to deffende / and
this for to do / that is to wite for to give counseyl there to both the
parties as well to the one / as to the other / certain knights ought to be
assigned unto them / that shall be expert and wise in such art and conning

Asks Crystyne whether a bataylle may be done upon a holy day after right /
and whether it is taken in right that a man of arms may save his soul / And
if clerks may goo to werre or not / Capitulo / xiiij
Master now tell me if a bataylle be it general or specyal / may be done
after right writon upon a holy day For to me should seem that nay / seeing that
the festyual days be ordained for to serve god only / and it is no service
applicked nor done to god for to fight in a field one against another / without
faille my love / of this propos / you shalt fi^de in the au^cyent testament.
how it was permytted of god unto ye children of israel that upon what soever
day ye men should com upon them / that they should deffende hem self / and that
they should issue out for to give bataylle / Therefore I tell the that for
cause of necessyte men may well some time make a field upon a holy day / that
is to wit in caas that men were assaylled / But without faylle for to
vndretake a day of bataylle upon a holy day / it is not well d^on / nor it
apperteyneth not / though that at this day ben the christian people of so febl^e
and so little feyth / and of so little reverence towardys god and to his
saints / that men of of arms maken no force so that they see their
advantage / for to ride / scarmysshe / steel / and to goo forth to the
pyllage and robberye / as well upon an Estirday / or the good Friday or upon some
other great and solemn day / as upon other days / the which thing ought
not by no manner to be done / without that great need constrayneth thereto / or
(...) this be done for a great good to the common vtylyte I demand of the
master if we ought to keep and hold / that a man of arms may save his
sowl^e in excercytyng thoffy^e of arms / For a great doubt might be cast
herto / s^eyng the great euylles that necessaryly behooves hem for to do and
also he that deyeth in will and desire for to grieve or hurt (...) neighbor /
gooth not a good away / So seems to me that such is the desire of men of
werre that goo in arms against their enemies / Which would god that men
sh^lde leave / How then might he be saved that deyeth so (...) Daughter I
shall ansuere the shortly ^ three conclusyons The first / that without doubt /
after that the decree decla^reth / the knight or the man of arms / that deyeth
in the werre against them of evil believe / for thenhau^sing of the feyth of Ih^u
Criste / so that he be repentyng and sorry for his sins he goes strayghte as
a martyr unto heaven: The second* that if a man of werre deyeth in a bataylle
grownded upon a just and good quarelle / for to help the right / or that hit
be for the true deffense of the land / or for the comonwele / or for to keep
the fraunches and good customs of the place or country / but if some other
sin lets him / his soul is not a grieved but a right great merit he has
thereby / and such may the cas and the quarelle be that he goes right forth
in to paradyse by and by / And it is determined that he that exposes his lyffe
for to deffende justice / deyeth well a good death as it is for to fight in a
just quarelle for his king or prince / for the country and for the people /
which his a merytoryouse deed / But the third conclusyon is contrary to the
same that is to wite / that if a man deye in a bataille which were against his
conscience / that is to wite / that he should think / that the quarelle were
not good / and that it were done but for to usurp and take the right from
another / and that should care for noone other / but that he may rob and take
and get his wages / without faylle if such a man has no leyser to have
repentance at his last endyng we could not presume that he were in way of
salvation / Late therefore keep hem well that thereto putten hem self / For both
the body and the soul they put in great pareyll / if they do give hem self
for to sustain a false quarelle / And to this ought strange souldyours to
take good head / But many there be that make no force of the quarelle / so
that they be well paid of their wages / and that they may well rob / But
such folk done much worse / and are less to be excused / than be thoo whom
it behooves / be it right or wrong / upon pain of losyng of their lands /
to be with their naturell and sovereign lord / how be it / that they ought
with all their power / if they did feel that their lord had wrong to put
hem self in pain and in her deuoyre for to let and dysmoeue the werre thou
have spoken right well good master / but I pray the tell me / if clerks or
men of holy church / oughten or may go goo to a bataylle without that they
shall mysprise hemself / I tell the that our doctors maken hereof many
questyons / and after the opinion of some / they may goo with deffensable arms
and not inuasible / that is to wite / as to a cas of deffense / and not for to
enuayshe / And other sayen / that they ought not to come out of their place
for no manner a cas / but only is permytted to them the deffense of the cite
/ fortres or manoyre where they be in upon the walls or at some wyndowes for to
deffende hem self with good sto^nes and with such staves as they have without
shot of iron and other sayen that they may use of al manner of arms as well
without forth / as within and not tarry till they hem self be enuahished / for a
man must sometime offend another if he will save him self / and not abide that
he be offended for such might be the taryenge that men should come to late for
to put remedy thereunto / another oppynyon is holden that at the maundement
of the pope which is souerayn above all clerks / they may do both the one
and the other And other seyen that the bysshopes and other clerks that
iurydsyctyons of lands and of justice do keep and hold of the princes / as
of the king of France holden many prelates the^r temporaltees / are holden
for to goo to the werre with their lord / if he will / and by especyall such
prelates as be of the peers of France / the which may well say to the men of
werre / that they take folk and put hem in prison but not that they shall
slay noone / For then irreguler they were / And by no manner it apperteyneth
hem not for to smite nor fight with any man: but if men would smite upon hem
For there nys bishop nor prelat / but that he may deffende a just and good
quarelle / for to help the right / or that hit be for the true deffense of the
land / or for the comonwele / or for to keep the fraunches and good customs
of the place or country / but if some other sin lets him / his soul is
not a grieved but a right great merit he has thereby / and such may the cas
and the quarelle be that he goes right forth in to paradyse by and by / And
it is determined that he that exposes his lyffe for to deffende justice /

Begins to speak of the manner of armorye / whether every man may take arms
at his will / Capio^ / xv /
Master without faylle I see and know that more great is thy wit in
concludyng and soyllyng proprely to the truth all questyons / than might be
the Importunytee of mine ignorance in reformyng of diverse arguments / and
where al enough may suffyse / without I trauaylle the any more / that which
thou have declared to me of the right of arms / yet a word if it please the /
for to make me wise of some things that al enough do depend of the
precedentes that is to wit of the ryghtes of arms after the which demaundes
/ because it shall not think to the over long I shall take an end in
concludyng my book upon the same / It is that thou tell me of the faytte of the
badges / arms / baners and penoncelles that lords and gentylmen have and be
acustomed for to were and to do them to be painted and set upon their
garementes whether every man may take and bear them at his own will / Dear
love / of thees arms that by noblesse were first found by cause that the
lord in a bataylle might be known by his arms and entresygnes / I shall
ansuere to the / thou ought then to know that in thees arms as for to
say in general ben there three dyfferences / whether the sum were made and
ordained of old time for thestate of the dygnytees / and not for the persons
nor for their lygnage / as is the sign of the Egle the which is deputed for
the dygnyte Imperyal / wherefore who someuere is emperor ought to bear the
same / Item another manner of arms there be of office / like as we say
Capytelers of Tholowse / the which during their offices do bear arms the
which ben of old deputed and ordained for the same office / Se^blably the
Consules of Mountpellyer / where namely if any assemble were there made of
arms / noone other arms they might not bear but such as ben deputed to
their office of consulate / without that they would be rebuked for / and they
should not be suffered / Semblably in diverse places ben appropred one manner of
arms / It the second dyfference of arms / Is of such as come purely by
sucessyon of lynage unto kings / dukes / marquyses / earls anb other lordis /
like as the Flourdelyse for the house of France / the Lupardes for the house
of England / and of al other kings / and in likewise of other lords lesser /
as is the Ermyne for the duk of bretayne / the white cross of siluere for the
Earl of Sauoye / and thus of other lords be it Dukes / marqueses / Earls / or
other of whens that they be and of thoos specially ought noon to take their
arms / and yet may thou see / that men know al weyes the head of the
lordship by cause he bears the plain arms of the same with out difference /
and thoo that are of his lineage they put theunto diverse dyfferences / And
se^blably it is of the other barons / and of al gentylmen in likewise / so
tell I to y^ well that of right and rayson / noone ought to presume himself
for to take any thing of the arms of gentylmen another forto bear any thing
semblable / nor namely one ge^tylman of an other gentylmans arms / without
that it be so / that he can show that of old time they be or have been longyng
to his predecessors or that some lord had given some be^de or quarter or some
other part of his arms to him or to his predecessors for thus might he well
bear hem without that the kynrede or other might challenge him for the same / for
to diverse barons knights and gentylmen have been given the arms that they
bear or such differences as be there of old time past by some princes or great
lordis / wherefore they ought not to be taken by noon other / as it is said /
But it is well truth / that if it happed a stranger to come in place which
bare the same arms and even like of some ge^tylman of france / or of some other
parties / that semblably had borne of old time his predecessors / he should
not do wrong to no body in this byhalfe nor no thing might not be said
unto him for the same / It the / iij / difference is of the arms that dayli be
found new at will / as when it falls hapli oftentimes / that fortune
enhaunceth men at her own plaisire / that they that be of right low degree
comen to high astate which thing some time happeth: by the suffisau^ce of the
persons / other in fayt of arms / or in science / wysedom / or counsel / or
by some other virtue that they have / So it is not evil employed to them that
be worthy thereof by noblesse of virtue / the which when they see hem self
brought to high astate / they take arms at their own will and such a
deuyse as them plaiseth whereof some grownde and founded the same upon their name
/ as one that is called petir hamer / he shall take one / two or three hamers
for his arms / And as another called Ioh^n pie / he shall in likewise set the
figure of certain pies upon a sheld for his arms / and thus dyuersli of other
devises / as it plaiseth hemself best / and the heirs that afterward shall
descend and come of him / shall bear evermore the same / and by this manner of
way ben arms first found and taken /

In what manner may a gentylman challenge another for arms / Capitulo / xvj
NOw tell me that I may vndresta^de I put cas that my fader have take for
his pleasir in his arms a be^de of goules with three sterres of gold above
the same / or so^me otherthinge / and that another man which is of n^o sibbe to
my fader had tak semblable arms / might this man then bear hem by right
without gainsayng of any challenge I a^suere the that the maistrs of the laws
maken upon the same such a questyon / that if a man or a lynage had taken new
arms since that openly he had borne hem / and that it happed so that another
man of the town or namely of the country of whens that other man or lynage
were of w^ld take or had taken hem / it were no rayson / but they ought to
abide still to him or them that first set hem up nor the lord of the place /
if any complaynte be made thereof unto him / ought not to suffer the same / For
such arms ben and were found for to know a dyfference among the folk and
other wise there were no dyfference / but rather a confusion (...)
apperteyneth not to the prince nor to his justice for to suffer that his
subgettes shall wrong nor do shame to each other And to do such a thing /
that is to wite to take the arms that another has taken a fore / hit should
seem as a despysing done for a despyt for a ryote or noise to begin one upon
another / now master yet would I be ansuered of another manner of debate that
might well com / a gentylman of almayne comes to paris for to vysyte the king
and see the manner of his court / where he do find another gentylman that
bears the same propre arms that he and they of his kynrede bear / the which
thing the said almayn will challenge but the fre^shman ansuereth that he has not
fou^den them of late but that his antecessours of old time had and yet did
bear them / The almayn says that his lynage is more au^cyent than the
frenshmannis kynred / and therefore ought the said arms to be his own and not
the Frenshmans / And that more is by cause that the frenshman says against
the same and denies hit / the almayn ansuereth / that he wol upon this quarrel
fight with him / and casts in deed his gage to him therefore in presence of
the king / so ask I of the if this almayn has a good quarrel / and whether
the king by the right of arms ought to judge herupon the champ of bataille /
In good feyth my love if / for this cause should a battle be iuged / no right
accords not thereunto / and enough euydent is the rayson wherefore / for what
damage nor dysworship can come to the almayn / if a frenshman that his not of
the country borne y^ he is of and that are not both under one lord / bear
such arms as he does / syn that they be namely of old time his own
wherefore then nor by what rayson ought he to challenge the same / Certes herto
bilongeth no bataylle to be iuged nor no manner of right another / but that
either of them two shall keep still that that he has / I say not that if it
happed to a knight or man of arms of France or of some other land thrughe
fall dyssymulacyon that that were a man living an evil lyffe a great thief or
man sleer / to take the arms of a knight of almayne / with the which he
should goo in to bourgoyne or in lorrayne for to take his proye and to set
houses on a fire there / and robbyng folk by the way / without faylle the
almayn should have no evil cause for to challenge his arms from such a man /
but schold his quarrel be just and good / But noone other bataylle were not for
to be Iuged against this evil man / but only the hangyng of his body on a
gybet / For it were not right that a good man should put him self in parel /
against another that euydently were known crymynal and living an ill lyffe / and
for this ba^at to take the arms of another as his own men might be punysshed
by right in diverse wise / For if a souldyour of simple lygnage of almayne or
of some other land / should come in to france for to take the kings wages in
hs werres that should bear the arms of some ancient knight of his country /
of whose predecessors after the renommee / were acustomed to com right good men
of arms / and forto be the more worshipped and more set by and for to have
bettre astate / had taken the said arms / It is no doubt / that if such a
thing came to knowledge / and that the kynrede should reclame of wrong done to
them / he were or ^ught to be by right punyshed therefore likewise as he that
should co^trefet the sign of a tabellyon or notarye / or as a merchant that
should countrefete the mark of another merchant / and lykwise of such other
things / for if such athynge were suffered infynyt barates and deceytes might
be do under color of the same /

Deuyseth here of the arms and penoncelles and of the armo^rie Capitulo / xvij
/
By cause that we be entered in this matyere / and that thou have remembered me
of the baners and arms of the great lords I shall tell the of thoo colors
that men reputen and taken for the most high most rich and most noble / For
among hem is a difference of noblesse / for cause of the representacyon that
either of hem done after his nature / So hold the masters of the law of
arms / that the color of gold is the most rich / And the rayson is /
because that the gold of his nature is very clear and resplendishyng virtuous
and comfortyng / so that the master of phisique do give hit for a soueryne
recomfort to a man debylyted and nyghe deed and with this the gold
represents the son which is a right noble lumynarye / And the law says
that there is nothi^ge more noble / than is clarete and light / and for this
excellence says the scripture that the just and holy person is like the gold
and the son / and by cause that the gold of his propriete is likned to the
son / the ancient laws did ordeyne that noman should bear gold / but that
he were a prince So is then the color of gold most noble / It the second
color is purpre that we call red which represents the fire / so is the
fire most shynyng in his naturell course after ye son and the most noble of
all / iiij / elements for the which noblenes se^blably did ordeyne the laws
yt noone should were red that betokneth highness / but only ye princes / It
the / in / noble color is azure / which by his figure represents the air
the which after the fire is the most noble of other elements / for hit is in
his course penetring subtyl and able to receive the lumynose influences / It the
/ iiij / coboure is white that men call in armoyrye silver / the which
color of white is the most noble of all them that follow after for hit is
more next to the shynyng course / and with this hit signifies innocence and
clenlines / and the scripture sath that the vestementes of Ih^u Crist did seem
to his apostles white as snow / and this color of white reprepresenteth ye
watre which after the air is most noble / It that other color is blak that
men call in armoyrie sable / that represents the other and betokneth sorrow
for it is ferder from the light more than any of the other be / and therefore
was found / that in token of sorrow blak raymentes should apperteyne to the
sorrowful and heavy / so is hit the most low and most humble color that is /
and therefore it was ordained ye religiouse should reueste and clothe hemself of
the same / It that other color of armoyrie is grene that men calse sinople or
verte which betokneth wodes feldes and meadows / and because it is not
represented to noon of the four elements it should be taken for the less
noble / and of thees seven colors are dyfferenced all manner of arms
penoncelles and baners by diverse deuyses taken by haultnesse fro the time
right ancient /

Thus ends this book which xp^yne of pyse made and drew out of the book
named vegecius de re militari and out of tharbre of bataylles with many other

redoubted prince my naturel and souerayn lord king henry the / vij / king of
england and of france in his pala^s of westmestre the / xxiij / day of
Ianyuere the / iiij / year of his regne and desired and wylled me to translate
this said book and reduce it in to our english and natural tongue / and to put
it in enprynte to the end that every gentylman born to arms and all manner men
of werre captayns / soldiers / vytayllers and all other should have knowledge
how they ought to behave them in the fayttes of war and of bataylles / and
so delivered me the said book then my lord therle of Oxenford away^i^g on his
said grace / which volume conteynyng four books / I received of his said grace
and according to his desire which to me I repute a comandeme^t / and verili
glad to obey / and after the lityl co^nyng that god has lent me I have
endeuoyrd me to the vtterest of my power to fulfylle and acco^plisshe his
desire and commandment / as well to reduce it in to english / as to put it in
enpri^te / to the end that it may come to the sight and knowledge of every
gentylman and man of war / and for certain in mine oppinyon it is as necessary
a book and as requysite / as any may be for every estate hye and low that
entende to the fayttes of werre whether it be in bataylles sieges / re^cowse /
and all other fayttes subtyltees and remedies for meschieues / Which
translacyon was finysshed the / viij / day of Iuyll the said year and enprynted

no curyous ne gaye terms of rethoryk / but I hope to almighti god that it shall
be entendyble and understood to every man / and also that it shall not much
varye in sentence fro the copye received of my said souerayn lord / And where
as I have erryd or made defaulte I beseech them that find such to correct it
and so dooyng I shall pray for them / and if there be any thing there in to his

of this land / In which hye enterprises I byseche almighty god that he may
remain alleway vyctoryous / And daily encreace fro virtue to virtue and fro
