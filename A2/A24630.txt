Whitehall, April 24. 1696.
THIS Evening came in an Express from Sir George Rooke, Dated on Board His
Majesty's Ship the Queen, the 22th of this Instant April at Six in the Morning,
being then Nine Leagues South South East off the Lizard; He left Cadiz the 30th
of March, with about 190 Sail of Men of War and Merchant Ships, which are all
safely arrived in the Chanel; and when he writ these Letters he was making the
best of his way toward Spithead. He had received no account of the French
Fleet's having yet passed the Streights.

The Letters from Plymouth of the 21. give an Account, That His Majesty's Ship
the Anglesea, Captain Callwell Commander, had brought in a French Privateer of
18 Guns and 120 Men, belonging to St. Malo, which he took the 18th Instant,
about 45 Leagues S. W. from Scilly; and that 11 Sail of Merchant Ships passed
by Plymouth that Morning for the Downs, who came from Kinsale under Convoy of
the Weymouth and the Ruby; Four of these Ships belonging to London, and being
bound home from the West Indies.
