A Proclamation for avoiding the consumption of Coin and Bullion.
WHereas the Kings Majesty, by sundry Proclamations, did heretofore restrain
and forbid the unlawful melting and fining of Gold and Silver, and the making
of Gold and Silver Thread, Gold and Silver Foliat, and other like Manufactures,
and not finding the effect, which his Highness aimed at, did grant a Charter of
incorporation to the Governor, Assistants, and Comminalty of Gold-Wyerdrawers
of the city of London, hoping, by reducing those Trades under order and
government, to avoid the unnecessary wast and consumption of Coin and Bullion
within this Realm: But his Majesty having fully understood, as well by the
complaint of his Commons in the late Session of Parliament, as upon diligent
trial, and examination of that business by the Lords of his Privy Counsel,
that not only the said Corporation (which is thereupon revoked and declared to
be void) but also the manufacture of Gold and Silver Thread, Gold and Silver
Foliat, Purles, Oes, Spangles, and other like, are unfit to be continued within
this Realm; his Majesty is resolved to abolish the said Manufactures, and to
put in execution the good and wholesome Laws of this Realm, against those,
and other like means, of the consumption of Coin and Bullion in this
Kingdom; And therefore his Majesty does hereby straightly charge and command,
that no Finer of Gold or Silver, nor Parter of the same by fire or water, from
henceforth allay no fine Silver, nor Gold, nor none sell in any other wise, ne
to any person or persons, but only to the Officers of his Majesty's Mints,
Changes and Goldsmithes, within this Realm, only for the augmentation, and
amending of Coin and Plate; And that no Finer nor Finers, Parter nor Parters,
sell to no person any manner of Silver, in Mass, molten and allaied; And that
no Goldsmith within this Realm, melt or allay any fine Silver, but only for
making of Amelles, and for amending of Plate, to make it as good as Sterling,
as by the Statute in that case is provided; nor that they sell no fine Silver,
nor other Silver allaied, molten into Mass, to any person or persons
whatsoever, nor one Goldsmith to another, but that the Statute in this bahalfe,
made in the fourth year of the Reign of his Majesty's most noble progenitor,
King Henry the seventh, be in all points duly observed and kept, upon pain,
that every person offending to the contrary shall incur his Majesty's high
indignation, and such punishment, as by the Laws, or his Majesty's Prerogative
Royal, may be inflicted for such misdemeanour and contempt.

Given at our Court at Wansteede, the tenth day of July, in the two and
twentieth yeereof Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.

Excellent Majesty. 1624.
