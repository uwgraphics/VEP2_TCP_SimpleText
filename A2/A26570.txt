Turn heavenly Nymph those Eyes of thine,
Upon a tender Swain,
Angellich Creature most divine,

With wandering thoughts my heart's oppressed,
No ease at all I have,
Day brings no comfort Night no rest,

Assist me then ye powr's above,
Whose works are all divine,
Grant me the bliss that She I Love,
May be may be for ever mine.
For the FLUTE^
