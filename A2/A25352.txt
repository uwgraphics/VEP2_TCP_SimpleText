A Visitation in Love To those of the People called BAPTISTS, with whom the
Lords Spirit yet cease not to strive, that have not slain the Witness, by
making War, and contending against the Light, who although they may think
themselves Rich, and increased with much goods, yet are found to be Wretched
and Miserable, Poor, and Blind, and Naked.

With Council from the Lord, that they without delay (before a farther day of
Misery and Calamity overtake them) come away from all blind Leaders, and
unprofitable Teachers (who keep them always learning, but never bring them to
the knowledge of the Truth) unto the spirit of the living God, the everlasting
Teacher of his People, that so they may cease from all their own works and
labors, and stand still, and wait to know and feel the Lords work wrought in
them, by the Arm of Gods Salvation, Christ Jesus the Light of the world, the
only way to the Father.

That they may no longer feed on words, and seek after that food that
perishes, But that they may all come to feed on the Word of Life, on that
Bread which came down from God out of Heaven; That they may know the fountain
of Life set open in themselves, that out of their bellies may flow forth rivers
of living Waters, to the refreshment of their immortal Souls, and the Heritage
of God.

By one who travels in Spirit for their Souls good, and by the everlasting
Light of the Son of God is come to see and know, that though John's Ministration
once committed to him in its time was Excellent and Glorious, and he the
greatest born of a woman, yet a greater than John is come; and that the least
in the Kingdom is greater than John, J. A.

IN LOVE.
A Visitation to those of the People called Baptists, with whom the Lords
Spirit yet cease not to strive, that have not slain the Witness by making
War, and Contending against the Light, etc.
Truly Friends,
HAving wandered in times past from Mountain to Hill to find pasture and
refreshment for my soul which is immortal, and will not be satisfied but with
that Food which Perishes not, when it was the earnest desire of my very heart
to be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and to be brought into the
Liberty of the Sons of God, (for which the whole Creation groans) daily panting
and breathing after the waters of life, that in the living Truth of God I might
be set free to serve the living God: And in this, though my desires were pure,
yet I laboring for the accomplishment thereof in my own strength and way in
all my performances and duties (as I judged) in imitation of what others has
done and performed in days of old, and months past in the Power of Gods
Spirit: But I being not in, and guided by the same spirit, all my labor was in
vain, it being not in the Lord, though in never so like imitation from the
Letter of Scriptures, wherein I strove long to overcome, but in vain is
salvation expected from the Hills, or from the Mountains, but from him who is
mighty to save, the Arm of Gods Salvation, the Word of God which is nigh in
the heart and in the mouth, In him alone I found everlasting strength, which
gives Victory and Dominion over sin and corruption, which lodges in the heart
of every man by nature, wherein he is a child of wrath: Out of which estate, I
verily believe, it is the desire of many souls amongst you to know Gods
Salvation and Redemption, and that you might yet at length, after a cloudy and
dark day which has been over you, come forth to the new and living way, to the
glorious Light of the Gospel, which is the Power of God unto Salvation, that
you henceforth might serve him no longer in the oldnesse of the Letter, but in
the newness of the Spirit, which is only accepted by the Lord, In whom my soul
has often traveled, and seriously weighed your condition of Bondage, under
such Elements as must pass away, and be consumed with the Spirit of burning,
which must pass upon all flesh that shall be saved.

Verily, touching you, I have had often thoughts of heart, who sometime were a
people, that in a measure, and in some things did run well; but who has
bewitched you (I may say) that begun in the Spirit, that now ye should think to
be made perfect in the flesh, in which ye will certainly end, unless you come
in every particular to be witnesses in your selves of the new Birth, in the new
and living way, Christ i^ you the hope of Glory? And all your Ordinances, as
you call them, and performances, shall not cover you, nor stand you in stead in
the day of the Lord, when nothing but the covering of the Lords Spirit shall
hide you from the wrath of the Lamb; Truly Friends, my bowels yearn toward
you, knowing that there is a right Seed in some of you that groans to come
forth out of the prison, from under the bonds of the cruel Oppressor, the enemy
of your immortal souls, Oh! that you would yet at length learn to be wise unto
Salvation, and no longer lay out your money for that which is no bread, but
that you might all come to him, who is the way, the truth, and the life, Christ
Jesus, the light of the world, through the Cross to the Crown, from things that
fade and perish even with the use thereof, unto that which is everlasting, and
never shall fade away.

Verily I have felt, and born the burden of your Apostasy, which has grieved
the good Spirit of our God, that on the 14th day of the tenth month, 1659. in
the time of the late revolutions, as I was passing on my way toward London,
this was the Lords complaint touching you, in these words, They have betrayed
me into the hands of Sinners, when you had a day, time and opportunity put in
your hands to do service for the Lord, but you like fools had not hearts to
make use of it; And I know that you are not in the way that shall prosper,
neither are your Sacrifices or services accepted by the Lord, you being gone
back from that pure principle that sometime called you to repentance, and to
come out of the world; and are gone after your own inventions, and Imaginations
from the Letter, which kills, and come not to the Spirit which gives life:
You cannot choose but confess, that, that savor that sometimes you might be
sensible to be in your services, is gone from you, and what means your stay
any longer in that place or thing where God is not to be found? And of this be
assured, the more you strive in your vain minds to build up that which God
pluck down and disownes, the farther you go from the way of rest and peace, and
unless you repent, and return, you shall lie down in sorrow; yea, the highest
and tallest Cedar amongst you shall know that the Lord God is confounding the
wisdom of the wise, and all the likenesses and Images set up, or practiced by
men in their inventions, and fallen wisdom is but abomination in the sight of
the Lord, though in your services you could speak even with the Tongue of men
and Angels, yet you being not in the right Spirit, you find not acceptance
with God, but are barren and unfruitful unto God in all that you do; And if you
stand still, me thinks you cannot choose but see from whence ye are fallen, how
low, weak and carnal all your performances are, imagining to your selves a
life in things that are dead, and will not come to him who has the words of
eternal life, who was before Abraham, was to that word which was in the
beginning, Christ Jesus the Light of the world, the same yesterday, to day, and
for ever; He that was dead is a live, and behold he lives for evermore, unto
whom you must all come for Salvation, as he is come a Light into the world,
there being Salvation in no other name under Heaven, and this is the mighty
Power of God unto Salvation; and whosoever believes in him shall not perish,
but have Eternal Life: And unless ye come unto the Light, and follow it, you
shall for ever abide in darkness; and though it seem never so small and
contemptible a thing in your eyes (but as a grain of mustard seed) by reason of
your high profession, which sometimes has had esteem amongst men; yet unto it
you must all bow and yield obedience, if ever you expect Salvation to your
immortal Souls, there being not another way but this which will bring you down,
and teach you to become fools, and deny your selves, and to take up the daily
Cross to the carnal mind, that by it, which is the power of God, you may
witness a death unto sin, even in the root and ground from whence all the
works of darkness do proceed.

This Light is the mavellous Light which will show you all things that you have
done, and will lead you in the path of life. And truly Friends, to me it is a
thing to be Lamented, that you, a professing people, that have seemed so
zealous for the way of the Lord, as that you should now be so blind as to hate
the Light, and not to come to it, to try the power and strength thereof, what
it will do for you at length, after all your own Labors, from which you must
cease, and in the silence of all flesh (which is a hard work) wait to hear the
voice of the true Shepherd, which will teach you to do the will of God. Surely
this I conclude, that if you come not to the Light, it is because your deeds
are evil; for it makes all things manifest, even the hidden things of the
heart, and brings the sinner to judgment, through which Sions redemption is to
be known; what think ye friends, that its dangerous to come to that Principle
of God, which teaches to deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and to walk
righteously, soberly, and godly, in this present evil world? which is the
grace of God, that brings salvation, which has appeared unto all men, that
light which enlightneth every man that comes into world, that Spirit which
convinces the world of sin, and leads us into all truth, is he that we
testify of, and persuade all men every where to take heed unto, and follow. And
are you afraid of him, and do you look for another, because his Visage is
marred more than any? and do you fly the cross, because of the shame? onelse
what is it, that makes you stand at such a distance from the way of life? know
ye not that the Kingdom is for the poor and hungry, and that the fat and
strong are for judgment, and the rich are sent empty away? Truly friends, if
that pure principle of God that sometimes breathed in you after Gods
righteousness, be so choked and stifled in you, through the deceitfulness of
sin, and the cares of this life, with things that are carnal, which feeds not
the birth immortal, that it cease to strive and stir in you, your case is
lamentable, you are but clouds without water, carried about of winds, trees
whose fruit withe^eth; yea without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots,
the end whereof is for the fire of Gods wrath in the day of the revelation of
his righteous judgments upon the workers of iniquity, in which you are found
without the Spirit of life and power, under the deepest coverings of
Antichrist, wherein the mystery of iniquity lodges in those days of his
reign in the hearts of the children of disobedience, even in the highest
likenesses of words, and conformity to the letter, that he is even transformed
into an Angel of Light to deceive many, who comes not to the light of life and
power of God, which discovers and destroys his Kingdom, root and branch.

What aileth you? is blindness happened unto you, that you cannot see where
you are? and that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorah in the day
of judgment than for these that are called Jews, but are not, that have a name
that they live, but are dead in sins and trespasses; see you not, how through
your deceit, hypocrisy, and unfaithfulness to Gods witness in you, you have
brought up your enemies on top of you, that misery threatens your persons, and
barrenness and leanness is entered into your very souls? so that fear, the pit,
and the snare, daily attends you, that you are become weak and unstable as
water, that element that you have so much builded upon, and are become a shame
unto Religion by your abominable Apostasy from the ways of truth, and the
paths of righteousness, unto which you have sometimes had a Call, and a Day to
make it manifest, but you would not come down to the foolishness of the Cross
of Christ, that so in him ye might have been more than conquerors over all
your enemies, within and without; but have chosen your own ways, and set up
the abomination which makes desolate, and stands in the place where it ought
not, and have made that which should be the Temple of the living God, a Cage of
unclean Birds; the enemy having found the house as it were swept and garnished,
is returned again with seven worse Spirits than himself, opposing the living
truth of our God, and that under a profession of God, and of Christ, of the
Scriptures, of Ordinances, of the Words of the Prophets and Apostles, yet
hating, envying, reproaching, and persecuting them that live the life of the
Prophets and Apostles, that in sincerity and godly simplicity serve the Lord
God in the measure of his eternal Spirit, which to you may seem a low thing
that can pray when you will, and preach when you will, that have made such a
great show in the flesh, in that wisdom which comprehends not the things of
God whereby ye have gained (it may be) praise of men, the which you would fain
keep up above the Cross of Christ. But down you must bring all your glory and
excellency under the feet of the Lamb, if ever you expect to be crowned with
him in glory everlasting in that Kingdom, which is not of this world, that
consists not in meats and drinks, not in words, but in power, in
Righteousness, Peace, and Joy in the holy Ghost, unto which the Light will
show you the only way, which shines in the darkness which is in the heart of
man, and gi^eth us the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
Christ. What think you of your Arguments, Disputations, and literal knowledge
of the way of truth, and the way of life? what sins does it give you victory
over? and what stands it you instead in the day of trial? is not all the
excellency and glory thereof but a barren empty thing that refreshes not, nor
comfort your immortal souls, which only with that bread of life which came
down out of heaven are satisfied? Try your selves; have you that Life in you,
which is to be felt and handled in the presence of the Lord? or else it is but
a thing in notion that you feed upon, which starves your souls? I know you
cannot but be sensible that you have lost that in your selves which sometime in
a measure, gave you the sense and savor of the things of God in the days of
your infancy, when the Lord was plucking down the lostinesse of man, before you
went about to set up a building after your own inventions and imaginations
which will come to nothing. It being not upon the Rock of Ages, the foundation
of many Generations, as moved and directed thereunto by his eternal Spirit:
And now I believe, as you deal faithfully, and honestly with your own hearts,
you cannot but see and confess, that by all your hard labor, study, and
performances of duties (as you may call them) from the letter of Scriptures,
and use of your ordinances, you cannot again recover that which you have lost
of the savor of life, but grow dead, yea wax worse and worse, though it may be
more frequent in your ordinances than ever; you cry, but God hears you not,
neither does he regard the work of your hands which are abominable in his
sight, your sacrifices being not offered up in Abels nature, from the new
birth, find not acceptance with God; but are wholly adulterated from the
present teachings of his Spirit, as if the Scriptures were given forth to stop
his mouth for ever; so that you have lost your judgments and understanding in
the things of God, and know not the voice of the true Shepherd from a
Hireling, a Wolf that comes to you in sheeps clothing; and shall never come
again to find that which you have lost, nor to the knowledge of God and of
Christ, whom to know is eternall-life; but as you come out of all your own
ways, wills, and worships unto the everlasting Light of the Son of God in your
selves, which will show you the way to the Father, and let you see how far wide
you are of the straight and narrow way that leads unto the Kingdom of God,
unto that pure principle of God that will show you all that ever ye have done
must you be reduced, which will bring you to the beginning of Gods Creation,
that the state of a little child you may come to know, waiting in the filence
of flesh to hear the Fathers voice, which will lead you to do his will in every
particular, that no longer, your own wills, but the will of God, may be done in
earth as it is in heaven, that righteousness and truth may be made manifest in
your mortal bodies, which is Christ in us, the hope of glory, who is come to
do the will of the Father in us: And this is he that we have waited for, and we
know him to be our Savior, because he saves us from our sins, and not because
he told the woman of Samaria all that ever she had done, do we believe; but
because his wonderful works done in us declare him to be the Son of God, whose
manifestation is to destroy the work of the Devil in the Creature, and so set
him free in Soul, Body and Spirit to serve the Lord God of the Spirits of all
flesh.

Come down from selfe-conceitednesse, and all the Mountains that you have set
up, and account it not much to be ashamed of all your hope, which is but dead,
and to account all as dung and dross that you may yet at length win Christ,
whose love is better than wine, and though the world hates and scorns him, yet
he is the fairest of ten thousands, and unto his Light in you must ye be
turned from the darkness, if ever you expect to see his appearance, and behold
his glory to the comfort of your souls, who is now appearing the second time
without sin unto salvation? what will it profit you to talk of his Reign and
come not to the Kingdom wherein his power, and glory is revealed, that in the
heart where Satan's seat has been, you may witness all his and your souls
enemies subdued and destroyed, that you may know the Kingdoms come whereof
Christ Jesus is the King, and Lawgiver, unto whom the Father has given all
Power and Authority in heaven and earth, unto whom all principalities and
powers must how: Stand no longer about needles questions, but come to know Gods
work wrought in your selves, that the heir of life may be brought forth, that
your souls may inherit substance, that you may eat his flesh and drink his
blood, and be guided by his Spirit, who is the Son of God for ever, that your
souls may be satisfied that this is the man Christ Jesus, whom ye have waited
for, and that you may see his salvation, and say that this is he, and that you
look not for another, of whose Power, Kingdom and glory there shall be no end.

And now friends, to you that yet retain some integrity, and have longing
desires after the way of Gods salvation, its the Lords Council that you delay
not but come away from all your blind guides and leaders which cause you to
err, and wait upon the Lord to know the teachings of his pure Spirit, which
will bring you to the endless Fountain of life, and to feed on that bread
which will nourish your souls up unto everlasting life, and dwell no longer in
the tents of the wicked, though never so fairly covered, least your Talents be
also taken from you, and given to others: And believe it, it is far better to
suffer persecution with the people of the Lord for righteousness sake, than to
enjoy the pleasures of sin in this world for a season, which will end in
sorrow; and do not reject the light, and make war against Gods witness, as
some have done, and perished in their gainsaying, least you be also cut off
from the Land of the living, and the day of your visitation pass over your
heads; But come to the light that you may see to work out your salvation with
fear and trembling while it is called to day, for the night comes wherein none
can work. Therefore prize your time, for the Lord will cut short the work in
Righteousness for the Elects sake, and be ye separate, and come out from
amongst the unfruitful workers of darkness, that you may learn to walk in the
way to ever lasting life, in which it is the very desire of my soul to meet
you, even in the way of Gods salvation, which is but one, through the Baptism
of one Spirit into one Body, whereof Christ is the head; and strive no longer
about words and forms, but come to him, who is the word of life, that you may
be brought from under Satan's power into the power of God, and in him live,
dwell, and abide for ever, that you may no more go down again into Sodom and
Egypt to feed on the fleshpots thereof, which will but make lean your souls,
and fatten you for the day of slaughter which is hastening upon the wicked. And
let not the fair and feigned words of some (that even make merchandise of your
souls) any longer deceive you with the enticing words of man's wisdom to keep
you in bondage, but come to the Light in your own particulars, that you may
feel the Life, without which you are dead, and all your services are but
abomination in the sight of the Lord, who is the living God, and the dead
praise him not: Seek no longer for the living amongst the dead; but to the
Light, to the Law written in the heart, to the Testimony of Jesus, the Spirit
of prophecy, that you may witness the true anointing in your selves, which
will teach you all things, that you may not be foolish Virgins without oil in
your Lamps, and so shut out of Gods Kingdom, in which state the highest
professors of the letter are, that witness not the Life and Power in
themselves. Therefore redeem the time because the days are evil, and cleave
no longer to lying vanities, and forsake your own mercies, but repent, and
return to the Lord God, withal your hearts, withal your minds, and withal
your souls, that you may live for ever in the Lambs Light of life, in which
the Nations of them that are saved shall walk.

And sit down and consider whereunto have your teachers brought you in so many
years, but even into trouble and dissatisfaction, not knowing whether to go
for rest to your precious souls, which are even languishing under deaths
power, and shall not find refreshment but in the presence of the Lord, unto
which the Light only will bring you. See you not how dead and dull your
teachers are become, striving to keep you in that which profits you not, but
starves your souls? and how nigh they are come to be one with the hirelings,
who form weapons from the Scriptures to fight against the Lord of life,
pleading against perfection in this life, because they cannot attain thereunto
in their way; laying hold on the sins of others, that they themselves may
continue sinners: Crying out the word of the Lord, and the Lord says, when the
Lord has not sent them, nor spoken by them, they knowing not his voice,
neither have they seen his shape at any time, who is full of grace and truth;
but feed people with imaginations in worshipping a God a far off ignorantly,
when indeed our God is (not only a God a far off, but) nigh at hand, and that
which may be known of him, is manifest in man. But here is the transgression
from the beginning, that man is not content with his Lot, and gift that God
has given him, but through lust covets after, and eats of the forbidden fruit,
which brings death upon his soul, and misery and disorder upon the Creation,
and from thence comes wars and fightings, rents and divisions, even because men
abide not in the measure of Gods Spirit, given to every man to profit withal,
but run out in their vain minds to follow their own hearts lusts, and so
strengthen the hands of the wicked against the just; And many are ashamed
through the Cross to return, by which the enmity comes to be destroyed, but go
on until their hearts are hardened unto destruction; that they themselves
standing not in that wherein God makes people free to serve and worship him,
but having lost the way, and their wisdoms confounded, they strive also to keep
others with themselves still in bondage, and even envy others in whom the power
and Spirit of the Lord God is made manifest, which comes not in their way,
nor by observations, but works in us freely both to will, and to do,
according to the good pleasure of our Heavenly Father, which is contrary to the
will and wisdom of the flesh, which pleases not God; And let not the Spirit of
bondage so prevail in you any longer, to envy the Spirit of prophesy in Gods
people, but come up to the help of the Lord against the mighty enemy of your
Souls, and give up all the materials of your own buildings unto the fire of
the Lord, that your work may be tried, that your hearts may be purified, and
that you may be saved, so as by fire, for the Spirit of Judgment and burning
must pass upon you, before ever your bodies become the Temples of the holy
Spirit, and you become vessels of honor, fit for the Masters use.

I say again, and lay it upon you, that you expect not Salvation from the
Hills, nor from the Moutains, But wait in the Light, for the coming of the Holy
One in Gods own-way, and the Resurrection of the Just out of the grave, where
he lies buried in Sodom and Egypt spiritually (so called) under your lusts and
corruptions which war against your Souls, that you may know him, the word nigh
in the heart, and in the mouth, who is ready to help, and mighty to save; and
that you may come to feel the Seed of Gods Kingdom in your own hearts, working
out the seed of corruption, and all that works abomination, and whatsoever
loves and makes a lie, which is for the lake of fire, into which the Beast
and false prophet is to be taken and cast a live; That you may know the
children of the Kingdom begotten of the seed of the bondwoman cast out, that
the right Heir and Seed may take his Possession, and Inherit the Kingdom, whose
right it is to reign in the kingdoms of men; and blessed are they that are
become joint heirs with him of that Inheritance which is everlasting, and never
shall fade away. And thus Friends, as from the Lord, well knowing that you are
not, as you stand in the way of Gods Salvation, have I written in the
uprightness of my heart, and in tender love to your souls, and to that pure
seed which yet breaths in some of you after the living God, that you may yet at
length be turned from darkness to the Light, that so you may be brought from
under Satan's power into the power of God, that you may no longer lie under that
Yoke and spirit of Bondage, which by your leaders is begotten amongst you, and
laid upon your Consciences to keep you from the Covenant of Light and Life, but
that you might come forth in the freedom of the Lords Spirit, out of the house
of Bondage, into the liberty of the Sons of God, in newness of spirit, to
worship and serve him all the days of your life.

It Is a strange doctrine, that you must believe as your Teachers believe, and
do what they do, as infallible; whilst they themselves know not, but deny the
immediate or present teachings of Gods infallible Spirit amongst them, and come
not to feel and know in your selves the true Teachers the living Hope, and the
true Faith of Gods Elect which purifyeth the heart, which God requires, even
truth in the inwards parts; what are your Teachers more than others of the
world, that you should be so in bondage to them, as to fear their threats of
death and destruction, or the like of that (whilst they themselves are under
the power thereof) to whomsoever shall separate from them, and turn from their
pernicious ways? That many poor souls that have entered themselves in Covenant,
as it were with death, under their beggarly and unprofitable Rudiments, are
afraid of their big-swelling words and excommunications to come our from
amongst them, and because of the Flood that proceeds out of the Dragons mouth
against the woman that travells to bring forth the man Child that shall Rule
the Nations, you come not up to the war of the Lamb: Though you may see and
believe in your Consciences that there is a more excellent and living way known
and set before you, and are not satisfied with that food which perishes, but
groan in your spirits for the bread of life: And were it not for fear of
persecution which follows the righteous Seed, and the shame of the Cross on the
one hand, and the fear of your Teachers on the other hand, would you not come
out from amongst them? Deal faithfully with your own souls, and Gods witness
in you, and confess the truth to Gods Glory, and come away out of all that is
dead and carnal, unto the living truth of our God.

For truly Friends, this I verily believe, as Gods witness comes again to be
raised in you, in whom he is not yet slain, (as some have done by warring
against him) that there will not be a time of disputing and halting left you,
but you must either come away to follow the Lamb, the Light of the world, or
take your portion in that lake that burns with fire and brimstone, where you
shall know that worm that never dies, and that fire that never shall be
quenched; and there shall not be peace again (says my God) to the wicked, but
torment day and night, distraction, horror and confusion, shall be their
portion that comes not out of Babylon at Gods Call, which has reached unto
you: therefore hasten to come away, and follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes,
that with him you may reign in glory on Mount Sion, for ever and ever. And
whether you hear, or forbear; whether ye believe, or not; this again I truly
say and testify, that in bowels of tender love to your pret^ous souls and the
seed of God, in discharge of my Conscience toward God and you, that I may
stand clear of your blood, have I written; knowing that the day of the Lord
hastens, wherein he will render to every man according to his deeds done in the
body, whether they be good or evil, when many shall cry and call to the Rocks
and to the Mountains to fall upon them and cover them; But in that day none of
your Coverings, but the Covering of the Lords Spirit shall hide you from the
wrath of the Lamb. And you shall certainly know, that I speak the truth in
Christ Jesus, and lie not.
