An abstract of some branches of his Majesty's late Charter, granted to the
Tobacco-Pipe makers of Westminster; declaring his Majesty's pleasure touching.
that Manufacture, and also all persons whom it may concern.
JAMES by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Jreland, etc.
Whereas We have been informed by the complaint of diverse of Our poor
Subjects, the ancient Makers of Tobacco-Pipes within this Our Realm* That for
want of power and privilege to retain their Apprentises and Servants during
their Apprentiship (who commonly depart from them before they have served their
terms, or attained to the knowledge of their Art) they are much prejudiced
both in their Trades and means of living, by their excessive making and
uttering of ill Ware, And Our Subjects who have use of that Manufacture, are
thereby greatly abused and deceived: And not only so, but to their Masters
farther impouerishment, these loose and idle persons do instruct and teach
others of as bad quality as themselves, to make and sell like ill and
deceitful Ware. Besides, for that the said Art of making Tobacco Pipes is
easily learned, sundry of our Subjects trained up in other Trades more useful
for the Realm, do forsake the same and take up this of making Tobacco-Pipes:
And others who have other good Trades to live upon, intrude themselves into
this also, and use both, to the hinderance and overthrow of those who anciently
practiced the same. And whereas for the better reforming of all those
disorders, to cut off the superfluous straglers and late intruders, to reduce
them to a competent number, and to settle good government amongst them (this
Trade being a new Trade, never yet ordered by any Law or Policy, and which
concerns not any Commodity of necessity for our Commonweal, but a
superfluous pleasure, necessary to be regulated by Our Royal power and
authority) We have therefore thought fit by Letters Patents under Our Great
Seal, to Incorporate a certain number of choice and selected persons, who
have either served as Apprentises, or have otherwise practiced that Art by the
space of seven years, to whom and whose Servants, Apprentices, and such others
as shall be by them admitted into that Society for their skill and honest
conversation, We intend to appropriat the said Art, and to restrain all
others from taking that benefit which in no right belongs unto them.

And to the end that all our loving Subjects may take knowledge of Our pleasure
expressed in our Charter, that it may be duly observed without pretext of
ignorance, We do hereby declare Our express will and pleasure to be, and
do straightly charge and command, That no person or persons whatsoever, other
then such as are members of the said Society of Tobacco-pipe makers of
Westminster, or which have by the space of seven years at the least been
bound to (or exercised) that Art, or such others as shall be chosen into the
Society by the said Society, shall not presume (from the date of these
presents) directly nor indirectly to make any manner of Tobacco-pipes within
this Our Realm of England or Dominion of Wa^es, nor shall bring in or import
any manner of Tobacco-pipes from beyond the Seas, or from Our Realm of
Scotland; Nor shall utter, sell, or put to sale any Tobacco-pipes so made or
brought into this Our Realm of England and Dominion of Wales, contrary to Our
pleasure herein declared Upon pain not only of forfeiture of all such
Manufacture, but of incurring such penalties, imprisonments and punishments, as
by the Laws and Statutes of this Our Realm, or by Our prerogative Royal may
be inflicted upon the offenders in this kind for their contempt or neglect of
Our Royal Will and Commandment. And further, for the better discovering and
suppressing of all secret and underhand making or uttering of the said
Manufacture by such as are not members of this Society or otherwise enabled as
aforesaid, We do require, charge, and straightly command all Our loving
Subjects (especially such Retaylers as shall buy Tobacco-pipes to sell again)
that they, nor any of them directly, nor indirectly, shall buy, acquire, get or
obtain any Tobacco-pipes whatsoever of or from the hands of any person or
persons, not being known members of the said Society, And to that end it is
provided, that all Tobacco-pipes made by the said Company, shall be brought to
the Common Hall of the said Society there to be proved whether the same be
good and marchantable ware, before they shall be uttered or put to sale; (where
they may be bought of all Our loving Subjects) Upon pain of undergoing of Our
displeasure, and such pains and penalties as shall or may ensue thereupon for
such contempt against Our will and Our prerogative Royal. And for the full
effectuating of Our pleasure herein, These are to command and straightly
charge, That all the said Tobacco-pipe Makers aforesaid, shall forthwith take
knowledge of our Charter by these presents, and by resorting to the said
Society in London, where they shall receive such Orders and Ordinances as
shall be constituted and made by the Master, Wardens, and Assistances of the
said Society for the benefit of the said Society. And lastly, We will and do
hereby require all Majors, Sherifes, Justices of Peace, Bailifes, Constables,
and all other Officers and Ministers whatsoever, That they and every of them in
their several Offices and Places be from time to time ayding and assisting to
the said Master, Wardens, and Society in the due execution and accomplishment
of this Our Royal Will and Commandment, as they tender Our pleasure, and will
avoid the contrary*

Witness Our self at Westminster the sixth day of October, in the seventeenth
year of Our Reign of England, France, and Ireland* and of Scotland, the three
and Fiftieth.
