By the King.
A Proclamation touching Passengers.
WHereas in the first Session of our Parliament holden at Westminster the
nineteenth day of March in the year of our reign of England, France and
Ireland the first, and of Scotland the seven and thirtieth; It was amongst
other things Enacted, That no woman nor any child under the age of one and
twenty years (Except Sailors or Shipboyes or Apprentice, or Factor of some
Merchant in trade of Merchandise) should be permitted to pass over the Seas,
except the same should be by license of us, our Heirs or Successors, or some
fix or more of our privy Council, thereunto first had under their hands,
upon pain that the Officers of the Port that should willingly or negligently
suffer any such to pass, or should not enter the names of such Passengers
licenced, should forfeit his Office, and all his goods and Chattels, And upon
pain tha the owner of any Ship or Vessel, that should wittingly or willingly
carry and such over the Seas, without license as is aforesaid, should forfeit
his Ship or Vessel, and all the Tackle, And every Master or Mariner, of or in
any such Ship or Vessel, offending as is aforesaid, should forfeit all their
goods, and suffer imprisonment by the space of twelve months without Bail, or
Maineprise, As by the said Act of Parliament amongst other things may more at
large appear:

And whereas many such our Subjects, That is to say, women and persons under
the age of twenty and one years, have from time to time just and necessary
causes and occasions to go and pass over the Seas, In which cases for every
such women and persons under the age of twenty and one years to obtain such
license, either from our selves, or from six of our said Privy Counsel
according to the said Law, is very inconvenient, and almost impossible; We
have therefore thought convenient, for the case as well of our self and our
said Counsel, as of such of our Subjects as are of the condition mentioned in
the said Act of Parliament, to grant our Commission to persons of trust in
certain Ports of our Realm, lying most apt and convenient for passage, That
is to say, London, the Cinque Ports, Harwich, Yarmouth, Hull, and Waymouth, to
license such women and persons under the age of twenty and one years, as shall
have just cause to pass out of our Realm, upon due examination had of them,
to pass without peril to themselves, or the Officers of our said Ports,
Notwithstanding the said Statute or any thing therein contained. And we have
thought it fit to give public knowledge hereof to alour Subjects, and to all
our Officers whom it may concern, to the end they may know what shall be
lawful for them to do in those cases.

Given at the Castle of Farneham the xxiij. day of August, in the fourth year
of of our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
