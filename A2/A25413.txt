A SUMMARIE VIEW OF THE GOVERNMENT BOTH OF THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENT: WHEREBY
The Episcopal Government of Christ's Church is vindicated: Out Of the rude
Draughts of LANCELOT ANDREWS, late Bishop of Winchester. Whereunto is prefixed
(as a Preamble to the whole) a Discovery of the Causes of the continuance of
these Contentions touching Church Government: out of the fragments of RICHARD
HOOKER,

OXFORD, Printed by LEON LICHFIELD, Anno Dom, 1641.

The causes of the continuance of these Contentions concerning
Church Government.
COntention arises, either through error in men's judgments, or else disorder
in their affections.

1. When contention does grow by error in judgment; it cease not till men
by instruction come to see wherein they err, and what it is that did deceive
them. Without this, there is neither policy nor punishment that can establish
peace in the Church.

The Moscovian Emperor, being weary of the infinite strifes and contentions
amongst Preachers, and by their occasion amongst others, forbad preaching
utterly throughout all his Dominions; and in stead thereof commanded certain
Sermons of the Greek and Latin Fathers to be translated, and them to be read
in public assemblies, without adding a word of their own thereunto upon
pain of death. He thought by this politic devise to bring them to
agreement, or at least to cover their disagreement. But so bad a policy was no
fit salve for so great a soar.

We may think perhaps, that punishment would have been more effectual to that
purpose. For neither did Solomon speak without book in saying, that when folly
is bound up in the heart of a child, the Prove. 32. 15.
rod of correction must drive it out; and experience does show that when error
has once disquieted the minds of men and made them restless, if they do not
fear they will terrify. Neither has it repented the Church at any time to
have used the rod in moderate severity for the speedier reclaiming of men from
error, and the reuni^ing such as by schism have sundred themselves. But we
find by trial, that as being taught and not terrified, they shut their ears
against the word of truth and sooth themselves in that wherewith custom or
sinister persuasion has inured them: so contrariwise, if they be terrifyed and
not taught, their punishment does not commonly work their amendment.

As Moses therefore, so likewise Aaron; as Zerubabel, so Iehoshua; as the
Prince which has labored by the Scepter of righteousness and sword of
justice to end strife, so the Prophets which with the book and doctrine of
salvation have soundly and wisely endeavored to instruct the ignorant in those
litigious points wherewith the Church is now troubled: whether by preaching, as
Apolloes among the Jews; or by disputing, as Paul at Athens; or by writing, as
the learned in their several times and ages heretofore; or by conferring in
Synods and Counsels, as Peter, James, and others at Jerusalem; or by any the
like allowable and laudable means; their praise is 2. Cor. 8.18.
worthily in the Gospel, and their portion in that promise which God has made
by his Prophets, They Dan. 12.3.
that turn many unto righteousness shall shine as the stars for ever and
ever. I say, whosoever have soundly and wisely endeavored by those means to
reclaim the ignorant from their error, and to make peace.

Want of sound proceeding in Church controversies has made many more stiff in
error now then before.

Want of wise and discreet dealing, has much hindered the peace of the Church.
It may be thought, and is, that Arius had never raised those tempestuous
storms which we read he did; if Alexander, the first that withstood the
Arrians heresy, had born himself with greater moderation, and been less eager
in so good a cause. Sulpitius Severus does note as much in the dealings of
Idacius against the favorers of Priscillian, when that heresy was but green
and new sprung up. For by overmuch vehemence against Iactantius and his mates,
a spark was made a f^ame: insomuch that thereby the seditious waxed rather
more fierce then less troublesome. In matters of so great moment, whereupon
the peace or disturbance of the Church is known to depend, if there were in us
that reverend care which should be; it is not possible we should either speak
at any time without fear, or ever write but with a trembling hand. Do they
consider whereabout they go, or what it is they have in hand; who taking upon
them the causes of God, deal only or chiefly against the persons of men?

We cannot altogether excuse our selves in this respect, whose home
controversies and debates at this day, although I trust they be as the strife
of Paul with Barnabas and not with Elymas; yet because there is a truth, which
on the one side being unknown has caused contention, I do wish it had pleased
Almighty God, that in sifting it out, those offenses had not grown, which I had
rather bewail with secret tears then public speech.

Nevertheless as some sort of people is reported to have bred a detestation of
drunkenness in their children by presenting the deformity thereof in servants:
so it may come to pass (I wish it might) that we beholding more foul
deformity in the face and countenance of a common adversary, shall be induced
to correct some smaller blemishes in our own. Ye are not ignorant of the
Demands, Motives, Censures, Apologies, Defenses, and other writings which our
great enemies have published under color of seeking peace; promising to bring
nothing but reason and evident remonstrance of truth. But who sees not how
full gorged they are with virulent, sl^nderous and immodest speeches, tending
much to the disgrace, to the disproofe nothing of that cause which they
endeavor to overthrow? Will you speak Job. 13 7.
wickedly for Gods defense? says Job. Will you dipp your tongues in gall and
your pens in blood, when ye write and speak in his cause? Is the truth
confirmed, are men convicted of their error when they are upbrayded with the
miseries of their condition and estate? When their understanding, wit and
knowledge is depressed? When suspicions and rumors, without respect how true
or how false, are objected to diminish their credit and estimation in the
world? Is it likely that Invectives, Epigrammes, Dialogues, Epistles, Libells,
laden with contumelies and criminations, should be the means to procure
peace? Surely they which do take this course, the way of Rom 3.17.
peace they have not known. If they did but once enter into a stayed
consideration with themselves what they do; no doubt they would give over and
resolve with Job. Behold I am vile, what shall I answer? I will Job. 40.4, 5.
lay my hand upon my mouth. If I have spoken once amiss, I will speak no more;
or if twice, I will proceed no further.

II. But how sober and how sound soever our proceedings be in these causes; all
is in vain which we do to abate the errors of men, except their unruly
affections be bridled. Self-love, vainglory, impatience, pride, pertinacy,
these are the bane of our peace. And these are not conquered or cast out, but
by prayer. Pray for Jerusalem; and your prayer shall cause the hills to bring
forth peace: peace shall distill Psalm. 72.3, 6.
and come down like the rain upon the mowen grass, and as the showers that
water the earth. We have used all other means, and behold we are frustrate,
we have labored in vain. In disputations; whether it be because men are
ashamed to acknowledge their errors before many witnesses, or because
extemporality does exclude mature and ripe advise without which the truth
cannot soundly and thoroughly be demonstrated, or because the fervor of
contention does so disturb men's understanding, that they cannot sincerely and
effectually judge: in Books and Sermons; whether it be because we do speak and
write with too little advise, or because you do hear and read with too much
prejudice: in all humane means which have hitherto been used to procure peace;
whether it be because our dealings have been too feeble, or the minds of men
with whom we have dealt too too implacable, or whatsoever the cause or causes
have been: for as much as we see that as yet we fail in our desires, yea the
ways which we take to be most likely to make peace, do but move strife; O
that we would now hold our tongues, leave contending with men, and have our
talk and treaty of peace with God. We have spoken and written enough of peace:
there is no way left but this one; Pray for the Psalm. 122.6.
peace of Jerusalem.

THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT IN THE OLD TESTAMENT: And first, under MOSES.
THE Commonwealth of ISRAEL was considered, either as Personal, containing
all the whole people, not a man left:

or Representative; in the Estate, Tribes, Cities; whose daughters the Towns
adjacent are called.

I. The Estate had ever one Governor, 1. Moses. 2. Joshua. 3. Judges. 4. Kings.
5. Tirshathaes, [or, Vice-royes, Ezra. 2. 63.] with whom were joined the LXX.
Elders.


II. The Tribes had every one their Prince, (...) Phylarcha. (Number. 2.) with
whom were joined the chief of the families, (...) Patriarchae. (Number. 1.4.)

III. The Cities had each likewise their Ruler. (Iud. 9.30.1. King. 22.26. 2.
King. 23.8.) with whom were joined the Elders or Ancients. (Ruth. 4.2. Ezr.
10.14.)

These last, not before they came into Canaan, [and were settled in their
Cities.]

It appears, that Moses sometime consulted only with (...) ( the heads of the
Tribes;) and then one Trumpet only sounded: (Number. 10.4.) in some other causes
with the (...) ( the Congregation;) and then both Trumpets called. (Number. 10.3.)

The highest BENCH or Judgment, for causes of greatest difficulty, was that
of the LXX. who at the first, were the Fathers of each family that came down
to Egypt. (Genesis 46.) which number did after that remain; (Exodus 24.1, 9.) and
was at last by God himself so appointed. (Number. 11.16.) See 2. Chron. 19.8.

The inferior BENCHES, for matters of less importance, were erected by
Iethroes advice of Rulers of Thousands, Hundreds, Fifties, Tithings. Exodus 18.
21, 26. and after established by Gods approbation. (Deuteronomy. 16.18.)

In every City (as Antiquit. l. 4. c. 8.
Josephus says) were seven Judges; and for each Judge, two Levites: which made
together the Bench of each City.

The form of the Ecclesiastical government under MOSES.
THe Priesthood was settled in the Tribe of Levi by God.

Levi had three sons: Cohath, Gershon, and Merari.

Of these, the line of Cohath was preferred before the rest.

From him descended four Families: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Vzziel.

Of these the stock of Amram was made chief.

He had two sons: Aaron and Moses.

Aaron was by God appointed High Priest.

So that there came to be four distinctions of Levits: 1. Aaron, as chief. 2.
Cohath. 3. Gershon. 4. Merari.


The Commonwealth of Israel was at the beginning in the desert a Camp. In the
midst whereof the Arc and Tabernacle were pitched: and according to the four
Coasts whereof, they quartered themselves; on every side three Tribes.

On the East side:Judah. Issachar Zabulon, On the South side:Reuben. Simeon.
Gad. On the West side:Ephraim. Manasses. Benjamin. On the North side:Dan. Aser.
Napthali.
Number. 2. v. 3. 10. 18. 25.

These four Quarters were committted to those four Divisions of Levits: The
East quarter, toAaron, and his family. The South quarter, toThe Cohathites. The
West quarter, toThe Gershonits. The North quarter, toThe Merarits.
Number. 3. verse. 38. 29. 23. 35.

Who lodged among them, and took charge of them, as of their several Wards.

But there was not a parity in these four: for 1. Aarons family, which bare
the Ark it self, was chief. 2. Cohaths, which bare the Tabernacle and
vessels, next. 3. Gershons, which bare the veil and hangings of the Court,
third. 4. Meraries, which bare the Pillars and Posts, last.


Neither were all the Levits of each of these several houses equal; but God
ordained a superiority among them: Over the Priests,Eleazar. Over the
Cohathits,Elizaphan. Over the Gershonits,Eliasaph. Over the Merarits, Zuriel.
Number. 3. v. 30. 24. 35.

Whom he terms Nesiim, that is, Prelates or Superiors.

No more did he permit these four to be equals among themselves: but appointed
Ithamar (Exodus 38.21.) to command over Eliasaph, with his Gershonits. (Number.
4.28.) Zuriel, with his Merarits. (Number. 4.33.) Eleazar (Number. 4.16.) to have
jurisdictio over His own Family. Elizaphan, with his Cohathites.


Yea he makes not Eleazar and Ithamar to be absolute equals: but gives
Eleazar preeminence over Ithamar; and therefore terms him Nasi Nesiim,
Princeps Principum or Praelatus Praelatorum. (Number. 3.32.)

And all these under Aaron the High Priest.

So that, 1. Aaron was the High Priest. 2. Under him Eleazar: who, as he had
his peculiar charge to look unto, so was he generally to rule both Ithamars
jurisdiction and his own. 3. Under him Ithamar, over two families. 4. Under
him the three Prelates. 5. Under each of them, their several chief Fathers
((...) as they are termed Exodus 6.25.) under Elizaphan four, under Eliasaph
two, under Zuriel two. ( Number. 3.18, etc.) 6. Under these, the several persons
of their kindreds.


This is here worth the noting, that albeit it be granted that Aaron was the
type of Christ, and so we forbear to take any argument from him: yet Eleazar
(who was no type, nor ever so deemed by any writer) will serve sufficiently to
show such superiority as is pleaded for; that is, a personal jurisdiction in
one man resiant over the heads or rulers of diverse charges.

The form of government under JOSHUA.
THe Commonwealth being changed from the ambulatory form into a settled estate
in the Cities of Canaan: as before, the Levits were divided according to the
several Quarters of the Camp; so now were they sorted into the several
territories of the Tribes. So God commanded; Number. 35.2, 8.

The lot fell so, that the four partitions of the XII. Tribes were not the
same, as when they camped before together; but after another sort. For the
Tribes of 1. Judah, Simeon and Benjamin made the first Quarter. 2. Ephraim, Dan,
and half of Manasses the second. 3. Issachar, Asher, Napthali, and the other
half of Manasses the third. 4. Zebulun, Reuben, and Gad the fourth.
Now in these four;
1. The charge or oversight of the first was committed to Aaron and his family:
and they had therein assigned to them XIII. Cities. in Judah and Simeon, IX.
and in Benjamin, IV. ( Ios. 21.9, 10, etc.) 2. Of the second, the care was
committed to the family of the Cohathits: and they had assigned to them X.
Cities. in Ephraim, IV. in Dan, IV. and in the half of Manasses, II. (Ios.
21.20.) 3. The third was committed to the family of Gershon: and they had
therein assigned to them XIII. Cities. in Issachar, IV. in Asher, IV. in
Naphtali, III. in the other half of Manasses, II. (Ios. 21.27.) 4. The
oversight of the fourth partition was committed to the Merarits: and they had
therein assigned to them XII. Cities. in Zebulun, IV. in Reuben, IV. in Gad,
IV. (Ios. 21.34.)


These were in all, XLVIII. Cities: whereof the chief (as may appear) were
Cities set on Hills; and all so situate, in such proportion and distance, as
that they most equally parted their Tribe among them, to perform unto them
their duties of attendance and instruction.

Further, there were in Ioshuahs time added, by the decree of the Princes, the
Nethinims of the people of Gibeon; for the lowest ministeries, and for the
service of the Levits. (Ios. 9.27.)

So that now the order was thus: 1. Eleazar. 2. Phineas. 3. Abisua. 4. The
three Nesiims. 5. The Raze Aboth, [ or, Heads of the Families.] 6. The Levits.
7. The Nethinims.


If this power and superiority was necessary, when all the People and Priests
were within one Trench, even within the view of Aarons eye: much more in
Canaan, when they were scattered abroad in diverse Cities far distant, was the
retaining of it more then necessary.

The form of Government under DAVID.
ALbeit in Saul's government small regard was had to the Church: yet David found
at his coming a superiority amongst them.

For besides the Priests, he found six Princes or Rulers over six families of
the Levits. (1. Chron. 15.5, 6, etc.)

Vrielover Cohath. Asajahover Merari. Ioelover Gershon. Shemajahover Elizaphan.
Elielover Hebron. Amminadabover Vzziel.
Likewise between the two Priests an inequality: one Abiathar, attending the
Ark at Jerusalem, the higher function; the other, Zadok, the Tabernacle at
Gibeon. (2. Sam. 20.25.1. Chron, 16.37, 39.)

But after the Ark was brought back; he set a most exquisite order among the
Levits: and that by Samuels direction; 1. Chron. 9.22. So that he is there
reckoned as a new Founder.

Of them he made six orders: 1. Chron. 23.

1. Priests, (...) 24000. verse. 4. 2. Ministers of Priests 3. Judges, (...)
6000. verse. 4. 4. Officers, (...) 5. Singers, (...) 4000. verse. 5. 6. Porters,
(...) 4000.

1. Of Priests, Zadok was the chief of the family of Eleazar; and Ahimelech
the second, of the family of Ithamar. (1. Chron-24.3.)

Under these were XXIIII. other Courses.

Of the posterity of Eleazar, XVI. Ithamar, VIII.
1. Chr. 24.4.

Which XXIIII. are called (in the 5. verse) Rulers of the Sanctuary and Rulers
of the House of God: and to whom the learned Interpreters think the XXIIII.
Elders, Apocal. 4.4. have relation.

II. Of Levits that ministered to the Priests in their function, likewise
XXIIII. Courses; out of the IX.
VIII. families, the Heads of whom are set down in 1. Chron. 23.6. and 24.20.

Over all which, Jehdeiah was chief.

III. Of Judges, that sat for causes as well of God as the King, there were
appointed:

1. On this side Jordan, upwards toward the River; Ashhabiah the Hebronite. (1.
Chr. 26.30.) 2. On this side Jordan, downwards toward the Sea; Chenaniah the
Isharite. (1. Chr. 26.29.) 3. Beyond Jordan, over the two Tribes and the half;
Ierijah the chief of the Hebronites. (1. Chron. 26.31.)
IIII. Of Officers.

Scribes. Shemaiah. (1. Chron. 24.6.) Seraiaeh. (2. Sam. 8.17.) Shevah. (2.
Sam. 20.25.)
Scribes of the Levits. (1. Chron. 24.6.) Temple. (2. King. 22.3. Ier. 36.10)
People. (Mat. 2.4.) King. (2. King. 12.10.)

V. Of the Singers likewise he set XXIV courses: over which he placed three
chief, out of the three families. (1. Chron. 15.17. and 25.2, 3, 4.)

Out of Cohath; Heman Samuels nephew. (1. Chr. 6.33) Gershon; Asaph. (1. Chron.
6.39.) Merari; Ethan or Ieduthun. 1. Chron. 6.44.


Of these, Heman was the Chief. (1. Chapter 25.5) Under these were diverse others.
(1. Chr. 15.18.

VI. Of Porters, who were divided into the

Keepers of the watch of the Temple: (Mat. 27.65. Psalm. 134.1.) who were placed
on each quarter of the Tabernacle. (1. Chr. 26.13, 14, etc.) On the East side
VI. over whom was Shelemiah. South IIII. (for the Tabernacle II. and II. for
Asuppim) over who^ was Obed. West IIII. over whom was Hosa. North IIII. over
whom was Zechariah.
Over all these it seems Benajah, the son of Iehoiada the Priest, was the
chief. (1. Chron, 27.5.) Treasurers: for the Revenues of the house of God (1.
Chapter 26.20.) for Things dedicated by vow; Shelomith. 1. Chron. 26.26.) Cohath;
Shebuel of Moses offspring. Gershon; Iehiel. Merari; Ahiah.
Over all the Porters was Chenaniah. (1. Chr. 26.29. and 15.22, 27.)

It is to be remembered that, beside Zadok the High Priest and Ahimelech (the
second) we find mention of Hashabiah the son of Kemuel chief of the whole
Tribe of Levi. (1. Chron. 27.17.) So that there was One over the Ark; Zadok.
The second over the Tabernacle; Ahimelech. The third over the Tribe; Hashabiah.


As over the Levits Ministers; Iehdeiah. Judges; Chasabiah. Officers; Shemaiah.
Singers; Heman. Porters; Chenaniah, or Benaiah.


Agreeable to this form we read that under Josias there were three: that is,
Hilkiah, Zachariah, and Iehiel: (2. Chron. 35.8.) and that the Levits had six
over them. (2. Chron. 35.9.)

Again under Zedekiah; that there were carried into Captivity Seraiah [the
chief Priest] and Zephaniah [the second Priest.] 2. King. 25.18.

Likewise under Ezekiah, at the provision for the Levits portions, there were
ten of the Levits; over whom was Cononiah and Shimei: and so Kore over the
voluntary offerings; and six Levits under him. (2. Chron. 31.12, 13. etc.)

The form of government under NEHEMIAH:
OF whom and Esdras it is recorded, that they did all according to Moses
institution. (Ezr. 6.18. Nehem. 10.34, 36.)

There was then Eliashib. Nehem. 3.1. Seraiah. 11.11. Zabdiel. 11.14.


The Courses were then but XXII. (Neh. 12.12.)

There was then Vzzi. (Neh. 11.22.) Iezrahiah. (Neh. 12.42.) Shallum. (1.
Chron. 9.17.)


Under Zabdiel, at his hand Adaiah. Nehem. 11. ver. 12, 13. Amasai. Nehem. 11.
ver. 12, 13.


Under Vzzi Shemaiah. Neh. 11.15, 16. Shabbethai. Neh. 11.15, 16. Iozabad. Neh.
11.15, 16.


Under Iezrahiah Mattaniah. Neh. 11.17. Bakbukiah. Neh. 11.17. Abda. Neh. 11.17.


Under Shallum Akkub. 1. Chron. 9.17. Nehem. 11.19. Talmon. 1. Chron. 9.17.
Nehem. 11.19.


So that there was

1. The High Priest. 2. The second and third, Overseers of the Priests. 3. The
Princes of the Priests. 4. The Priests. 5. The Overseer of the Levits. 6. The
Princes of the Levits. 7. The Levits. 8. The Heads of the Nethinims. 9. The
Nethinims: of the Gibeonits. 9. The Nethinims: of Salomons servants.
[A brief Recapitulation of the degrees observed under the government of the
Old Testament: with an accommodation thereof unto the New.]
Out of these we gather this Form to have been.

I. Moses: [in whom was] the supreme jurisdiction, to visit Aaron. (Number. 3.10.)
II. Aaron: the High Priest. (Levit. 21.20. Number. 35.28. Nehem. 3.1.) Head. (2.
Chron. 19.11.)

Prince of the house of God. (1. Chron. 9.11)

III. Eleazar: the second. (2. King. 25.18.) Prelate of Prelates. (Number. 3.22.)

Chief Overseer, or Bishop (Ier. 20.1.)

At his hand, Ithamar.

IV. Prince of the Tribe. (1. Chron. 27.17.) V. Elizaphan. Eliasaph. Zuriel.
Prelates. (Number. 3.24, etc.)

Overseers or Bishops. (Neh. 11.14, 22.)

VI. [In] the XXIV. Courses set by David; The Princes of the Priests. (Ezr.
8.29.) The Princes of God. 1. Chr. 24.5. The Princes of the Sanctuary. 1. Chr.
24.5.
Elders of the Priests. (Ierem. 19.1. 2. King. 19.1.) Heads of the Families.
(...) (Nehem. 12.12.) Chief Priests. (Act. 19.14.)
VII. The Priests themselves: Whether at Jerusalem; or in the Country towns.
(2. Chron. 31.19.)

VIII. The Overseer of the Levits. (Nehem. 11.22.) IX. The Princes of the
Levits. (1. Chron. 15.5. 2. Chron. 35.9. Nehem. 12.22.) X. The Head of the
Levits Officers. The Scribe. The Singers. (1. Chro. 16.5. Neh. 12.42.)

The Porters. (1. Chron. 9.17. and 15.22.)

The Treasurers. (1. Chron. 26.24, 2. Chr. 31.12.)

[XI. The Levits themselves.] XII. The Chief of the Nethinims. (Nehem. 11.21.)
XIII. The Nethinims: of the Gibeonits. (Ios. 9.21.) Salomons servants. (1.
King. 9. 21. Nehem. 7.60.)

It is not only requisite that things be done, and that they be diligently done
(against sloth;) but that they be done continually, and constantly.

To this end it is, that God appoints Overseers: 1. To urge others, if they be
slack. (2. Chron. 24.5. and 34.13.) 2 To keep them in course, if they be well.
(2. Chr. 29.5. and 31.12. and 34.12, 13.) 3. To punish, if any be defective.
(Ierem. 29.26.) For which,


A power of Commanding was in the High Priest. (1. Chron. 23.8, 18. and 24.6.
and 31.13.)

A power Judicial, if they transgressed: (Deuteronomy: 17. 9. Zach: 3.7. Ezech: 44.24.

Under pain of death. (Deuteronomy: 17.12.)

Punishment in Prison, and in the Stocks: (Ier: 29.26.) in the Gate of
Benjamin. (Ier: 20.2.)

Officers to Cite and Arrest: (Ioh. 7.32. Act: 5.18.) This Corporal.

To suspend from the Function: (Ezr: 2.62.)

To excommunicate. (Ezr: 10.8. Ioh. 9.22. and 12.) 42. and 16.2.)

[This Spiritual.]

Why may not the like be, [for the government of the Church:]

There is alleged one only stop. That the High Priest was a figure of Christ:
who being now come in the flesh, the figure cease, and no argument thence to
be drawn.

[For Answer whereunto, we are to consider; that]

I. This is the Anabaptists only shift. That we are to have no Wars: for the
wars of the Jews were but figures of our spiritual Battle. No Magistrate:
for their Magistrates were but figures of our Ministers, Pastors, and Doctors.
and, all by Christ's coming abolished.

II. Christ, being as well King as Priest, was as well fore-resembled by the
Kings then, as by the High Priest. So that if his coming take away the one
Type, it must also the other. If it be said, there was in the King somewhat
else beside the representation: the like is and may be truly said of the High
Priest. And that some such thing there was, it is plain by S. Paul, who
yielded his obedience to the High Priest; appearing before him, and
acknowledging him a Governor of the People (Act. 23.5.) and that, after the
Type was expired. Which had been merely unlawful; if there had not remained
in him somewhat besides the Figure.

III. There is no necessity we should press Aaron. For Eleazar being Princeps
Principum, that is, having a superior authority over the Superiors of the
Levits [in Aarons life time] was never by any [in this point] reputed a Type of
Christ. So that though Aaron be accounted such; yet Eleazar will serve our
purpose. As also, 2. Chron. 35.8. we read of three at once: one only of which
was the High Priest, and a Type of Christ; the rest were not. Let them answer
then to the other twain, who were Rulers or Chief over the House of God.

Why it may be.
I. Out of Dic Ecclesiae, [the New Reformers] ^ell us, we are to fetch our
pattern from the Jews: and therefore it seems they are of opinion, that one
form may serve both us and them.

II. Except there should be such a fashion of Government, consisting of
inequality: I see not in the New Testament, how any could perish in that
contradiction of Core, which S. Jude affirms. For his plea was for equality;
and against the preferring of Aaron above the rest.

III. The Ancient Fathers seem to be of mind, that the same Form should serve
both.

So thinks S. Cyprian, l. 3. ep. 9. ad Rogatianum.

So S. Hierom, ep. 85. ad Evagrium. Traditiones Apostolicae sumptae sunt de
Veteri Testamento. and ad Nepotianum, de vita Clericorum.

So St Leo. It a veteris Testamenti sacramenta distinxit; ut quaedam ex iis,
sicut erant condita, Evangelicae eruditioni profutura decerperet: ut quae dudum
fuerant consuetudines Iudaicae, fierent observantiae Christianae.

So Rabanus, de Institutione Clericorum, l. 1. c. 6.

They ground this their opinion upon that they see,

1. That the Synagogue is called a Type or shadow, and the Church the very
image of the thing. (Heb. 10.1.)

2. That God himself says of the Christian Church under the Gentiles; that he
will take of the Gentiles, and make them Priests and Levits to himself. (Esai.
66.21.) there calling our Presbyters and Deacons by those Legal names.

3. That there is an agreement, in the

Numbers: XII. Number. 1.16. and Luke 9.1. LXX. Number. 11.16. and Luk: 10.1.
Names: Angel. Malach. 2.7. and Revel. 1.10.
And their often enterchange and indifferent using of Priest or Presbyter,
Levite or Deacon, shows they presumed a correspence and agreement between
them.

[Thus then] Aaron [should be answerable unto] Christ. Eleazar [should be
answerable unto] Archbishop. Princes of Priests [should be answerable unto]
Bishops. Priests [should be answerable unto] Presbyters. Princes of Levits
[should be answerable unto] Archdeacons. Levits [should be answerable unto]
Deacons. Nethinims [should be answerable unto] Clerks and Sextons.


THE FORM OF CHURCH GOVERNMENT in the New Testament: and first in the days of
our Savior CHRIST.
I. THe whole ministry of the New Testament was at the first invested in
Christalone.

He is termed our Apostle. (Hebr. 3.1.)

Prophet. (Deuteronomy. 18.15. Act. 3. 22.)

Evangelist. (Esai. 41.27.)

Bishop. (1. Pet. 2.25.)

Doctor. (Mat. 23.10.)

Diaconus. (Romans 15.8.)

II. When the Harvest was great, ( Matthew. 9.38.) that his personal presence
could not attend all; he took unto him XII. Apostles: as the XII. Patriarchs,
or XII. Exodus 15.27. Number. 33.9.
Fountains (as S. Ierom) or the XII. Princes of the Tribes. ( Number. 1.)

Gathering his Disciples, ( Matthew. 10.1.)

Choosing out of them ( Luke 6.13.)

Whom he would; ( Mark. 3.13.)

Called them to him, ( Luke 6.13.)

Made them, ( Mark. 3.13.)

Named them Apostles. ( Luke 6.13.)

These he began to send: ( Mark. 6.7.)

Gave them in charge, ( Mat. 10.1. and 11.1.)

To preach the Gospel. ( Luke 9.2.)

To Heal. ( Matthew. 10.1. Luke 9.2.)

To cast out Devils. ( Matthew. 10.1.)

Gave them power, ( Mat. 10.1. Luke 9.2.)

To take maintenance, ( Matthew. 10.10.)

To shake of the dust for a witness. ( Matthew. 10.14.)

So he sent them. ( Matthew. 10.5. Luke 9.1.)

They went and preached. ( Luke 9.6.)

They returned, and made relation what they had done. taught.
Mark. 6.30.

III. After this, when the Harvest grew so great as that the XII. sufficed not
all; ( Luke 10.1, 2.) he took unto him other LXX. (as the 70. Palme-trees,
Number. 33.9. the Fathers of Families, Genesis 46. the Elders. Number. 11)

These he Declared: ( Luke 10.1.) Sent by two and two into every City and
place, whither he himself would come. lb. Gave them power, as to the Apostles,
to Take maintenance. ( Luke 10.7.) Shake off the dust. ( Luke 10.11.) Heal the
sick. Luke 10.9. Preach. Luke 10.9. Tread upon Serpents and Scorpions, and over
all the power of the Enemy. ( Luke 10.19)



These two Orders (as me thinks) S. Paul, Ephesians. 3.5. does comprehend under
the name of Apostles and Prophets; by the LXX. understanding Prophets: as
usually next to the Apostles he places Prophets ever. (1. Cor. 12.28. Ephesians.
4.11.)

None ofthe Fathers ever doubted, that these two were two several Orders or
Sorts: nor that the Apostles were superior to the LXX.

It appears also, that [the Apostles] had in them power to forbid to preach:
(Luke 9.49.) and that Matthias was exalted from the other Order to the
Apostleship.

This was then the Order, while Christ was upon the Earth.

I. Christ himself.

II. The XII. (whose successors were Bishops.)

III. The LXX. (whose successors were Priests.)

IV. The faithful people or Disciples: of whom 500. and more are mentioned, in
1. Corinthians. 15. 6. and CXX. in Act. 1.15.

[The form of government, used in the time of the APOSTLES.]
Albeit Christ says, the people were as Sheep without a Shepherd: (Matthew. 9.
38.) yet he terms his Apostles Harvest men, not Shepherds. For while he was
in person on Earth; himself only was the Shepherd, and they but Arietes
gregis. But at his departure he makes them Shepherds: (John 21.15.) as they
likewise at theirs. (1. Pet. 5.2. Act. 20.28)

Of the APOSTLES themselves: and first, of their Name.

Shelicha, which is the Syrian name, was the title of certain Legates or
Commissioners sent from the High Priest, to visit the Jews and their
Synagogues which were dispersed in other Countries; with authority to redress
things amiss.

(...), among the Greeks, were Officers of great credit: as by Herodotus and
Demosthenes appears.

Secondly, of their Form; what it is.

Not to have been with Christ all his time. ( Acts 1.21.) So were others more.

Not to be sent immediately of Christ. ( Gal. 1.1.) So were the LXX. ( Luke 10.)

Not to be limited to no one place. ( Matthew. 28. 19.) So were others ( Luke
24.33, 50.)

And S. James went no whither.

Not to be inspired of God; so that they did not err. So were Mark and Luke.

Not to plant Churches. So did Philip the Evangelist. ( Act. 8.5.)

Not to work signs and miracles. So did Stephen (Acts 6.8.) and Philip. (Acts
8.6.)

But over and above these, and with these, that eminent Authority or
Jurisdiction which they had over all; not only jointly together, but every one
by himself: I. Of imposing hands in Ordination. ( Acts 6.6.) Confirmation. (
Act 8.17, 18.)
II. Of Commanding. (the word of the Bench. Acts 4.18. and 5.28.) 1 Thessalonians.
4.11.2. These. 3.6, 12. Philem. 8. Coloss. 4.10.1. Cor. 14.37.2. Peter 3.2.
Titus 1.5.1. Cor. 7.6, 17. and 11.34. and 16.1. III. Of Countermanding. ( Luke
9.49. Acts 15.24.1. Tim. 2.12.) IV. Of Censuring. (1. Cor. 4.21.2. Cor. 13.10.
Gal. 5.12.1. Tim. 1.20.1. Cor. 5.5, 11.2. These. 3.14. Matthew. 16.19. with
18.18. and John 20.23.)


In this power it is, that the Bishops succeed the Apostles. Irenae. lib. 3.
cap. 3. Tertull. de Praescript. Cyprian. ad Florent. 3.9. Epiphan. Haeres. 27.
( Romae fuerunt primi Petrus and Paulus, Apostoli ijdem ac Episcopi.) Chrysostom.
in Act. 3. (Iacobus Episcop us Hierosolymitanus.) Hieronym. epist. 85. and 54.
ad Marcellam: and de scriptorih. Ecclesiast. in Petro and Iacobo. Ambros: in 1. Corinthians: 11. (de Angelis:) and in Ephesians. 4. (Apostoli. Angeli sunt.)

OF DEACONS.
AT the beginning, the whole weight of the Churches affairs lay upon the
Apostles.

The distribution as well of the Sacrament. (Act. 2. 42.) as of the Oblations.
(Act. 4.35.)

The Ordination. ( Acts 6.6.)

The Government. ( Acts 5.3.)

[But] upon occasion of the Greeks complaint, whose widows were not duly
regarded in the daily ministration (which was as well of the Sacrament, as of
the Oblations: otherwise the Apostles would not have left out [the mention of]
the Sacrament, in Acts 6.4.) they transferred that part upon the VII. [
Deacons.] whom they had ordained for distribution [of the Sacrament,] not for
Consecration. Act. 6.1. Tim. 3.12, 13. Justin. Apolog. 2. Ignatius ad Heronem.
Tertull: de Baptismo. Cyprian de lapsis: and lib. 3. epist. 9. Chrysostom. hom.
83. in Matthew. Hieron. ep: 48. ad Sabinianum: and contra Lucifer. Ambros. Offic.
lib. 1. cap. 41. Gregor. 4.88. Council. Nicaen. 1. can. 14.

OF EVANGELISTS.
THey grew upon occasion of the scattering of the Disciples by means of the
persecution after the death of S. Stephen. ( Acts 11.19.) Of which number S.
Philip is reckoned: ( Acts 21.8.) and diverse others. ( Acts 11.19.) of whom
Eusebius makes mention, lib. 3. cap. 37. and lib. 5. cap. 10.

Upon these was transferred that part of the Apostles function, which consisted
in preaching from place to place.

OF PRIESTS.
When the Churches were in some sort planted by the preaching of the Apostles,
Prophets, and Evangelists: that they might be continually watered, and have a
standing attendance; the Apostles ordained Priests by imposition of hands in
every Church. ( Acts 14.23. and 11.30. and 21.18.)

And they made choice of the word (...), rather then of the word (...) (more in
use with the Greeks:) because it includes an Embassy, and that chiefly of
Reconciliation. which is the (...), expressed by S. Paul, in 2. Corinthians. 5.20.
(with Luke 14.32.)

OF BISHOPS.
LAst of all, that the Churches thus planted and watered, might so continue,
the Apostles ordained Overseers, to have a general care over the Churches, in
stead of themselves who first had the same, which is called (...), Acts 15.36.
and contains in it, as a strengthening or establishing that which is already
well; ( Acts 14.22. and 15.41. Revel: 3. 2.) so a rectifying or redressing, if
ought be defective or amiss. ( Tit: 1.5.)

These are called, Acts 20.28. (...) in the Syrian, that is, Episcopi. by S.
John, Revel. 1.20. the Angels of the Churches.

[These were set over others, both to rule and teach.] 1. Tim: 5.17. 1. Pet:
5.2.

Upon these was transferred the chief part of the Apostolic function:

The Oversight of the Church.

Power of Commanding, Correcting, Ordaining.


The occasion which caused the Apostles to appoint Bishops, [besides the
pattern in the time of the Law,] seems to have been schisms. Such as were
in the Churches of Rome. Romans 16.17. Corinth. 1. Cor. 1.11. [and 3.3, 4.]
Galatia. Gal. 5.12. Ephesus. Ephesians. 4.2, 3. Philippi. Phil. 4.2. Colossi.
Coloss. 3. 13. Thessalonica. 2 Thessalonians. 3.11. The Hebrews. Hebr. 13.9. Iam. 3.1.


For which S. Cyprian, S. Hierome and all the Fathers, take the respect to one
Governor to be an especial remedy. [for which also see] Calvin. Instit. lib.
4. cap. 4.. 2.

This power even in the Apostles time was necessary. Act. 5.5, 15. 13. 11. 2.
11. 10. 46. 14. 11. 8. 13. 5.11, 13.
For God charge not his Church with superfluous burdens. Yet had they such
graces (as power of healing, doing signs, sundry languages, etc.) that they of
all other might seem best able to want it. For by these graces they purchased
both admiration and terror sufficient for crediting their bare word in the
whole Church.

If necessary then in their times, that were so furnished: much more in the
ages ensuing, when all those graces ceased, and no means but it to keep things
in order. So that, were it not apparent to have been in the Apostles: yet the
necessity of the times following, destitute of these helps, might enforce it.

Seeing then God has no less care for the propagation and continuance of his
Church, then for the first settling or planting of it: ( Ephesians. 4. 13.) it must
needs follow, that this power was not personal in the Apostles, as tied to
them only, but a power given to the Church; and in them for their times
resident (but not ending with them, as temporary) but common to the ages after
and continuing (to whom it was more needful then to them) to repress schism
and to remedy other abuses.

So that the very same power at this day remains in the Church; and shall to
the Worlds end.

Of the PERSONS,[that executed these Offices.]
I. ALbeit the Commission were general over all Nations, which was given to
the XII. yet was that generality only by permission, not express mandatory.
Else should they have sinned that went not through all Nations.

Therefore howsoever the Commission was to all Nations: yet was it left to
their discretion, how and in what sort they would dispose themselves, as the
Holy Ghost should direct them.

So that the partition, Gal. 2. 9. betwixt S. Peter and S. Paul, was lawful
and good, and no ways derogatory to Ite, praedicate. [ Go, teach all nations.]

Further, the Ecclesiastical History does testify, that they parted the Coasts
and Countries of the world among them by common advise: and so severed
themselves;

Peter, to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia.

John, to Asia, Parthia.

Andrew, to Scythia, [Pontus] Euxinus and Byzantium.

Philip, to upper Asia, and to Hierapolis.

Thomas, to India, Persia and the Magi.

Bartholmew, to Armenia, Lycaonia, India ^iterior.

Matthew, to Aethiopia.

Simeon, to Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Afrique, Britany.

Thaddaeus, to Arabia, Idumaea, Mesopotamia.

Matthias, to Aethiopia.

II. Again, albeit their preaching was for the most ambulatory: yet do the
same Histories witness, that having settled Religion, and brought the Church to
some stay; toward their end they betook themselves to residence in some one
place, diverse of them. as,

S. James at Jerusalem. (Eusebius. lib. 2. cap. 1. Epiphan. haer. 66. Hierome.)

S. John at Ephesus. (Eusebius. lib. 3. cap. 26. Tertullian. lib. 4. contra
Marcion. Hierome.)

S. Peter, first at Antioch; and after at Rome.

Which places were more especially accounted their Sees: and the Churches
themselves, after a more especial manner, were called Apostolic.

Seeds Apostolorum. Augustine. epist. 42. Ecclesiae Apostolicae, Tertullian.
III. Thirdly, it is also plain, that the Apostles chose unto them as Helpers
((...)) diverse, who were companions with them in their journies, ministered unto
them, and supplied their absence in diverse Churches, when they themselves were
occasioned to depart.

Such were:

Apollos. (Act. 19.1. 1. Cor. 3.6.) Aquila. (Romans 16.3.) Archippus. (Philem. 2.
Colos. 4. 17.) Aristarchus. (Act. 20.4.) Clemens. (Phil. 4.3.) Crescens. (2.
Tim. 4.10.) Demetrius. (3. John. 12.) Epaphras. (Colos. 4.12. and 1.7. and
Philem. 24.) Epaphroditus. (Ph. 2.23.) Epaenetus. (Romans 16.5.) Erastus. (Act.
19.22.) Gaius. (Act. 20.4.) Jesus Iustus. (Col. 4.11.) John Mark. (Act. 13.5.
and 15.37. and Philem. 24.) Lucas. (Philem. 24. Col. 4.14.) Secundus. (Act.
20.4.) Silvanus. (1. Pet. 5. 12. 1 Thessalonians. 1. 1. 2 Thessalonians. 1.1.) Sopater. (Act.
20.4.) Sosthenes. (1. Cor. 1.1.) Stephanas. (1. Cor. 16. 15.) Timotheus. (Act.
19.22. and 20.4.) Titus. (2. Cor. 8.23.) Trophimus. (Act. 20.4.) Tychicus.
(Act. 20.4.) Vrbanus. (Romans 16.9.)
Of whom, Eusebius, lib. 3. Hist. cap. 4. Euthymius, in tertium Iohannis;
Isidorus, de Patrib. and Dorothei Synopsis.

To two of these, Timothy and Titus, the one at Ephesus the other at Crete,
(Eusebius. lib. 3. cap. 4.) the Apostles imparted their own Commission, while
they yet lived, even the chief authority they had.

To appoint Priests. (Tit. 1.5. and Hieron. in eum locu^.

To ordain them by imposition of hands. (1. Tim. 5.22. 2. Tim. 2.2.)

To keep safe and preserve the Depositum. (1. Tim. 6.14, 20.2. Tim. 1.14.)

To command not to teach other things. (1. Tim. 1.3. Tit. 3.9.2. Tim. 2.16.)

To receive Accusations. (1. Tim. 5.19, 21.)

To redress or correct things amiss. (Tit. 1.5.)

To reject young Widows. (1. Tim. 5.11.)

[To censure Heretics and disordered persons, Tit: 1.11. and] 3.10.1. Tim:
6.5.2. Tim. 3.5.

And these, after the Apostles deceased, succeeded them in their charge of
Government, which was ordinary, successive and perpetual: their extraordinary
gifts of miracles and tongues ceasing with them. [So] Irenaeus, lib. 3. cap.
3. Quos and successores relinquebant; suum ipsorum locum Magisterii tradentes.

[Of the promiscuous use of their NAMES.]
These were they whom posterity called Bishops. But in the beginning, regard
was not had to distinction of Names. The authority and power was ever distinct:
the name not restrained, either in This, or Other.

The Apostles were called Priests or Seniors. (1. Pet. 5.1.) Deacons or
Ministers. (1. Cor. 3.5.) Teachers or Doctors. (1. Tim. 2.7.) Bishops or
Overseers. (Acts 1.20.) Prophets. (Acts 13.1. Revel. 22.9.) Evangelists. (1.
Cor. 9.16.)


The name of Apostle was enlarged, and made common to more then the XII.

To Barnabas. (Act. 14.4, 14..)

Andronicus. (Romans 16.7.)

Epaphroditus. (Phil. 2. 25.)

Titus and others. (2. Cor. 8.23.)

Timothy. (Hieron in Cant. Chr. Eusebius.)

The Priests were called

Prophets. (1. Cor. 14.32.)

Bishops. (Philip. 1.1. Tit. 1.7.)

So Chrysostom, in Philip. 1. [Quid hoc? an unius civitatis multi erant
episcopi? Nequaquam: sed Presbyteros isto nomine appellavit. Tune enim nomina
adhuc erant communia.]

Hierome: Hic episcopos Presbyteros intelligimus; non enim in una urbe plures
Episcopi esse potuissent.

Theodoret: Non fieri quidem poterat, ut multi Episcopi essent unius civitat is
pastores; quo fit, ut essent soli Presbyteri, quos vocavit Episcopos.

and in 1. Tim. 3. Eosdem olim vocabant Episcopos and Presbyteros: eos autem
qui nunc vocantur Episcopi, nominabant Apostolos.

Oecum^nius: Non quod in una civitate multi essent Episcopi, etc.

For in the Apostles absence in Churches new planted, the oversight was in
them; till the Apostles ordained and sent them a Bishop, either by reason of
some schism or for other causes.

The Bishops (as the Ecclesiastical History recounteth them) were called

Apostles. (Philip. 2.25.)

E vangelists. (2. Tim. 4.5.)

Diaconi. (1. Tim. 4.6.)

Priests. (1. Tim. 5.17.)

[For it is plain by the epistle of Irenaeus to Victor, in] Eusebius, lib. 5.
cap. 26. that they at the beginning were called Priests, that in very truth and
propriety of speech were Bishops. And by Theodoret [in 1. Tim. 3.] that they
which were Bishops, were at the first called Apostles.

The name (...), says Suidas, was given [by the Athenians to them which were
sent to oversee the Cities that were under their jurisdiction. (...). Suid. in
(...).]

The name Episcopus was given among the Romans to him, qui praeerat pani and
vaenalibus ad victum quotidianum. ff. de munerib. and honorib.

Cicero, ad Atticum lib. 7. epist. 10. Vult me Pompeius esse, quem tota haec
Campania and maritima ora habeat Episcopum.

The name in Hebrew (...) Genesis 41.34. seems to have relation to the second
use. for they were such as had charge of the grain laying up, and selling
under Joseph.

[The necessary use of the BISHOPS office, and the charge committed to him.]
The party, who in the New Testament is called Episcopus, is in the Old called
(...) (Psalm. 109.8. with Act. 1.20.)

In a house or family, it is first affirmed of Joseph, Genesis 39.4, who had the
oversight and government of the rest of the servants.

In a house there may be many servants, which have places of charge: but there
is one that has the charge of all; that is, Oeconomus, the Steward.

So do the Apostles term themselves. (1. Cor. 4.1.) and their office. (1.
Cor. 9.17.) and their successors the Bishops. (Tit. 1.7.) Vid. Hilar. in
Matthew. 24.45.

In a flock, the Pastor. (Ioh. 21.15. Act. 20.28. Mat. Vid. ^ieronym. epist.
4. ad Rusticum (cap. 6.) and epist. 8^. ad Evagrium.
25.32.1. Pet. 5.2. Ephesians. 4.11.)

In a Camp, the Captain. (Matthew. 2.6. Hebr. 13.7, 17, 24.)

In a ship, the Governor: (1. Cor. 12.28.) under whom others. (Act. 13.5.)

In the Commonwealth, they be such as are set over Officers, to hasten them
forward, and see they do their duties. as in 2. Chron. 34.12. and 31. 13.
Nehem. 11.22. and 12.42.

So that, what a Steward is in a house,

a Pastor in a flock, a Captain in a Camp, a Master in a ship, a Surveiour in
an office: That is a Bishop in the Ministry.

Upon him lies, [to take care of the Churches under him.] 2. Cor. 11.28.
Philip. 2.20.1. Pet. 5.2. Council. Antiochen. can. 9. [and for that end to visit
them.] Act. 9.32. and 15.36. [and to be observant] Of that which is Well and
orderly; [to confirm it.] Act. 15.41. Revel. 3.2. Otherwise; [to redress it.]
Tit. 1.5.

To him was committed;

1. Authority of ordeyning: (Tit. 1.5.) and so of begetting Fathers. (Epiph.
haeres. 75.) See Ambrose, Theodoret and Oecumenius, in 1. Timoth. 3. Damasus,
epist. 3. Hierome, epist. 85. ad Evagr. Leo, epist. 88. Council. Ancyran. can.
12. al. 13.

For though S. Paul should mention a Companic with him at the ordeyning of
Timothy: (1. Tim. 4.14.) yet it follows not, but that he only was the
Ordeyner. No more, then that Christ is the only Judge: although the XII. shall
sit with him on Thrones. (Luc. 22.30.)

II. Authority of enjoining or forbidding. (1. Tim. 1.3. Ignat. ad Magnesian.
Cyprian. epist. 39.)

III. Authority of holding Courts, and receiving accusations. (1. Tim. 5.19.1.
Cor. 5.12. Revel. 2.2. Augustine. de opere monachor. cap. 29.)

IV. Authority of correcting. (1. Tim. 1.3. Tit. 1.5. Hieron. contra Lucifer.
cap. 4. and epist. 53. ad Riparium. Cyprian. ep. 38. ad Rogatianum.)

V. Authority of appointing Fa^^s. (Tertullian advers. Psychicos.)

FINIS.
