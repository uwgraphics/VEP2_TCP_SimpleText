Seen and allowed, according to the order appointed.

A newyeres gift to the Rebellious persons in the North.
Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.
THe happy wight, who happy still
Would live in happy state,
Ought take advise, and teach his will
By fall of others fate.
For he by right may happy hight,
Who happy can eschew
By others pain the care that would
Through want of care ensue.
And none so dead I deem, but demes
That caytyffe cursed thryse,
Whom no experience can persuade
Nor reason to be wise.
Since only cause of quiet case
Depends on the care,
Which does forecast the much mishappes,
The diverse fond misfare
And ill success that does pursue
Thunwyse conceate of those
Who rashly bent, distemper peace,
And quiet state depose.
Unhappy men, for so by right
You do deserve your name,
What has provoked your wilful hearts
To work your proper shame?
What has compeld you to disdain
The long preserved peace
Your natyue country has inioyde?
What makes your service cease
Unto your Prince, and to resign
The same to Princes for?
What moves your stomachs to procure
Your Native soil such woe?
You wot your selves the ill success
That rebels still obtain, The success of Rebels.

You know the proof was always found
To work their proper pain.
Whereby experience does infourme
The perils of your case,
And warnes you, not to trackt the st^ppes
Of former traitors trace.
And why accursed, be not you
By their deserved spoil
Aduysde to leave your rash devise
And shun your shameful foil?
You further know that no attempt
Can prosprously proceed
Except that reason bear the sway
And do conduct the deed.
And you deuoyde of reason have
Assaulted such a fact,
As reason scorns to be comprysde
In such a senseless act.
Whereby you plainly prove your selves
Uphappy cursed wyghtes,
And thralled slaves to shameless will
And clokt before your syghtes:
Because you neither will be warnde
By others perils past, The conclusion prouyng their folly.

Nor yet by present reason taught
Nor nature made a gast.
I muse no less what matter should
Compel you to conspire,
Then I do marvel what conceate
Did flatter your desire.
A gracious Lady is your Queen,
A Princes loving right,
In mind as meke as pitiful,
And never wrought you spyght.
You know your selves in words discrete, Objections.

And in her deeds so just,
That void of each suspicious thought
She minded least mistrust.
In quiet state you also lyude
And wrong has nere suppressed,
Your wyshed wealth, in careless ease
You might have took your rest.
And what has moude your grateles hearts
Such recompense to make,
As for her mercies, her dispoyle
And wrack to undertake?
Oh feendes vnnaturaller far
Then Polyphemos was,
Whose teeth deuourde the tender flesh
Of men, you Tigers pass.
It had been good you cursed impes A just exclamatio^

That death had been your hyre
In mothers wombes, or that your byrthes
Had been in broylyng fire:
Then should your pride not have presumde
Upon so lofty pray The cause thereof.

Nor you have purchased to your selves
Your further worse decay.
Oh senseless, think what hye abuse
Has blinded your conceate,
And ponder well the whose discourse
Of your pretended feate. A persuasion to respect

And you shall then perceive and see
No doubt if you surmise
What evil quarrel has prouokt
Your doings to despise. The disobediens to the Prince, is a disdain of the
common wealth.

The common wealth of natyue land
In disobedience shown
Unto your sovereign Princes grace
Your duties not yknowne.
And think that if it ambition is
That has deceaude your wits,
How you are moylde in Plutoes lake
Amongst a thousand fyttes. A disswasion from ambition in discrybyng the
passions thereof.

Now through vain rebellious hope
To elevated pride
Araysde, and straight through pondred fear
Your cause of hope denyde:
And then with spur of conscience pryckt
And with disquiete mind
Again distempered and ytost
In sundry passions kind:
Supposyng now of hautie wealth,
And thynkyng then of shame,
Now lusty life, now purchased death,
Then fed in hope of fame:
And sometime moude through blind conceat
In corrage to prevail,
When as again the same perceaude
You fear, you faint, and fail.
And then your thoughts consyderyng of
Your travel and your pain,
Comparyng both in your attempt
Your damage, and your gain:
You loathe to think what yrksome toil,
What turmoyle, carke, and care
Does burden you, and what disease
You daily must forbear.
And then you see, or at the least
May see what vain accountes
You make, ambitiously to gape
For gain, when there amountes
Unto your pay the loss of goods
And hazard of your life, The fruits of rebellion.

And great effusion of your blooddes,
The only fruits of strife.
Oh blinded then, and may you know
Your quarrels to be ill? A disswasion by exclamation against their wilfulnes

And may you see the deuyllyshe proof
Of your ambitious will?
And may you understand the shame
Of your rebellious deeds?
And may you view the great offense
That from the same proceeds?
And may you live in quiet state,
In favor of your God,
And grace of Queen and countrymen,
And yet will coin a rod,
Wherewith to scurge and whip your selves?
Oh foolyshe, much to blame,
Who may in wealth deserve renow^^e,
And yet incur defame.
You know full well, that many by
Ambition have decade,
Who might in hautie plyght have lyud^
And rich estate have stayde.
As eke you can not but confess
Your selves at wyshed ease
To spend your days if you have list: Persuasion by presidentes.

And could not this appease
Your lofty stomachs to have thought
Upon the shameful fall
And ruynous dispoyle of such
Ambitious wicked all
(As have through their presumptuous pride
Possessed worse degree)
But that you likewise will presume
Like wicked impes to be?
Oh ponder of the vain abuse,
Consider of the case,
And see how such your rash pretense
Naught tendes but to deface
Your selves, and waying you shall deem
No less then I suppose,
That to your selves, your selves remain
N^ less then deadly foes.
And whylst your pride prouides to mount
A loft unto the skies, Persuasion by presumption.

Your persons shall be forced to couche
Whereas the lowest lies.
Can not you wisely bear in mind
That rich is the content?
And why should not suffisaunce serve
Your hungers to prevent? (...) ^onfu^^tion to ambition

The golden mean is free from thrall,
Because that no excess
Nor needy want may once extend
His measure to oppress.
And who that highest sekes to clyme,
Attaynes the greatest fall:
The greedy likewise who does snatche,
Full e^tsoones leeseth all.
Let therefore measure rule your minds,
And if ambition move
Your hungry hearts to greedy thoughts,
Restrain your wylles to prove:
And feed not fancy with the bayte
Of fables, rather fear
Lest that the burden be more bygge
Then you can bide to bear.
Thus think on this, and if the same
Has causde you to rebel,
You shall perceive how blind conceate
Your reason does expel. Ambition the lykeliest to b^ the caus^ of their
rebellion

Of which presumption chiefly does
You traytorously detect
Esteemyng such your greedy pride
Of your abuse theffect:
Because that no occasion has
Given cause whereby you should
Against your sovereign prince presume The reason thereof.

To bear your selves so bold:
Or seek revenge on natyue soil
As though as such offense
Your country had committed late
As you by your pretense
Would now correct, Oh traitors you
Amend your selves in time,
And rather seek for to avoid
The horror of your crime,
Then for to cauell with the clause
That does condemn by right
Your selves for traitors to your Queen
And country, An accu^ation of their ex^u^e.
as you hight:
You say for order good you seek
To have at settled stay
The common wealth, that wise advise
May only bear the sway.
And yet your own endeavors all,
Do interrupt the peace,
The very means and ready ways
Misorder to increase.
And chiefly you disordred do
Disquiete orders square,
Which is mayntayned by the peace
That voydes unquiet care.
Do tyrauntes teach their peoples hearts
To follow pities trade?
Or is it seen that wyttie laws
Of foolyshe men be made?
Or can a drunkarde gravely yield
An answer to the wise?
Or may a fool in wayghtie things
Declare a good deuyse?
As they, even so like power have you
Good order for to plant
In common wealth: when as your wits
And works all order want.
You also earnestly pretend
As with religious face
To root out scismes, and error void,
And set the truth in place.
Yet venomous deceauers, least
You mind the same intent:
But make religion for a cloak
To cover that is meant.
And under subtle clause contain
A venomous deuyse,
As each may see who marketh how
Your cauels do arise.
For though you stood in mayntenaunce
Of truth, as you not so,
But in such false opinion err,
As is to truth a foe:
Yet ought you not against your prince
A weapon for to bear,
Since that the perfect love of God
Consysteth in the fear
Of him, and in the duty done
Unto the rulyng throne
Of earthly magistrates, whereto
The scriptures bind each one.
But you rebellious void of grace,
As not in your defense
Through any cause compellyng you
Devise a vain pretense:
But make a quarrel, and arise
Against your Princes might,
Whose state you seem for to disdain,
And dealings to dispyght.
Oh blinded you, and do you deem
That of a godly son,
Who sees ^is father do amys,
It were a thing well done
That he his father should correct
Or punyshe? no you know,
Much less likewise should you presume
Like rygour for to show
Against your Princess, who would guide
Your footsteppes to the light:
But wylfull subjects you despise
The day, and love the night.
And further, though the wicked syer
Should seem for to provoke
His well disposed son to ill
Through force of strype or stroke:
Think you the child in his defense
May offer strype again?
No, no, his bounden duty is
For to forbear the pain.
And in like case the subjects ought
Their sovereign to obey,
As to forbear, and not revenge,
Though in their power they may.
For as the child by nature is
Unto the father bound,
And as it is the fathers right
Of son to be renownde:
So likewise are the subjects thrall
Unto their Princes will,
By perfect duty to obey,
Forbear, and honor still.
And therefore how much you to blame
As traitors to rebel
Against your Princes (who never sought
Your conscience to compel:
Except you troublously discryde
the same) you may perceive,
As also see what blind abuse
Your senses does deceive:
When having such a Matrone meke,
who justly does conduct,
And mercyfully teach the right,
And wisely truth instruct:
You will not (as your duty does
compel you) once attend:
But traytorously with weapons seek
Your fondnes to defend.
Oh wytlesse blind how dare you thus
To deal? can neither love
Of country cause you to relent,
Nor duty make remove
Your stubberne wylles, nor fear compel
you, madness to forsake,
Nor yet remorse of conscience cause
You leave to undertake
Such ill attempt, nor lykelyhod
Of your deserved fall,
Provoke you to be terrifide
Therein no whyt at all:
But that you wylfully withstand
The force of Princes power,
And naught regard the common wealth,
But seek for to devour
The gyltlesse blood, and to dispoyle
The mayntenaunce of truth?
Oh careless men, what heart so hard
But this your lewdenes rueth?
Respect how through your perverse acts
For want of quiet stay,
What great misorder will arise
Unto the realms decay.
As likewise view what madness seems
Your travels to possess,
For to pretend, who subjects be,
Your Princes to suppress,
Or to correct, as though if that
She error should maintain,
It were your duty with the rod
To work your Princes pain. Persuasion by description of the discommodities
of rebellion.

As likewise think how you disturb
The cause of common wealth,
When as you ought employ your pain
For to devise the health
Thereof, as also how you seem
Your country for to hate,
With such contention which disdaynes
Your countries quiet state.
And further, way the great reproach
You reap to English soil,
And what an entrance you have made
For foes to work our spoil.
As also ponder what defame
Unto your selves you breed
Through your abuse, and to your stocks
What shame there will proceed.
And lastly think upon thaccompt
The which you shall restore
For your offense to myghtie God,
And how that still the more
You do offend, the greater is
The reckenyng to be made:
These if you way, no doubt the thought
Thereof will soon dissuade
Your stubberne hearts from such abuse,
As long through foggye mystes
Have blearde your eyes, and now the cause
Remaynes of your resistes.
Which now I wish you to respect,
Although somewhat to late
It is: and to avoid your harms,
And eanestly to hate
Your former acts: and with your hearts
Repentaunt, for to sue
Of God for pardon, that as time
Has made the year a new:
So likewise may you be renewde
In sprite, that you may think
Your last years acts so unsavory, as
For stalenes they do stynke:
And so become retained impes
To God, with patience bear
Such justice as by your deserts
Your sovereign shall refer,
For better it is to yield your lives
Unto your Princes will,
Since wickedly you have deserude
Your deaths, in doing ill:
Then for to dye in quarrel such
As enemy to good,
Would also purchase to your selves
The answer of much blood.
And sure I am that in our Queen
Remaynes such mercies store,
As unto you, then you deserve
Imparted shall be more.
This wrote your friend, a wyshyng friend
Unto his natyue soil:
Who craves your frendships to befrende
Your selves, and fear your foil.
Edmond Eluiden.
