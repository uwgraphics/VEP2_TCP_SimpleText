A short Answer to the book called: Beware the Cat,
To the ientil reder: harti salutacions,
Desiring thee to knoe: Baldewins strange faschions
And if in aunsering: I appear sum what quick,
Think it not with out cause. his taunts be rive and thick
Where as there is a book, called: beware the cat,
The very truith is so, that Stremer made not that,
Nor no such false fabels: fell ever from his pen,
Nor from his heart or mouth: as knoe mani honest men
But will ye gladli knoe, who made that book in deed,
One Wylliam Baldewine. God grant him well to speed
God grant him mani new years, prosperity and health
As he has in this thing: farderd the Common wealth
With large lesure, brown studi: he musing all alone
Devised by what means: he might win the whetstone
Every thing almost: in that book is as true,
As that at Midsomer: in London it does snu.
Every thing almost: in that book is as true,
As that his nose to my dock: is joined fast with glu,
Put up your pipes Baldewine: if you can make no better,
Many talk more wittili: that knoe not one letter,
Put on your cap Baldewine: and keep your brayn pan warm
Least ye go to Bedlem: if such toys in you swarm
Read this litel short Rhyme: Baldewinken, til more cum:
And with Stremers excrements: be bold to anoint your gum
Instead of Diaglum, instead of Coloquintida,
Instead of ru barbarum, or casia fistula.
If the maker hereof: had bin at more lesure.
Ye had had from his hand: a more precious tresure
But in the mean season: content your self with this,
For your Bagagical book, a warm a. r. s. you may kys.
O r else a pair of stocks: if officers do well,
You hurt a harmeles man: which no such tales did tell,
As ye were disposed: loud lies on him to make,
Which many witti things: writes for his countries sake.
Alas I would to God: your book were half so good,
I wysh you no more harm: nor to your sweet heart blood
The pith of this paper, (if any man in it look)
Is to deni utterli, that Stremer made that book
The book (of ten leaves) was printed every word
Er Stremer saw any piece, to wipe a way a t. o. r. d.
Tergendis natibus, some thought his book was good
Or to cari spiceti, to cherische a sick man's blood.
Therefore ientyl reder: beware what credence thou ghive
The truth here contained: thou may boldly belive
Baldwins toys do belong: to thee or any other
As well as they do touch Stremer, his pore brother.
And now Judge good hirers: whether he be a good man
Of whom I write these things: as truli as I can.
If that be not a great fault, so to hurt a man's name,
Without sufficient cause: what crime should a man blame?
Omnia si perdas: famam servare memento: Qua semel amissa postea nullus eris,
If thou lose all (says he) yet reserve honest fame
If that be ones clean gone: go home and suck thy dame.
I am loath for to rail, as Baldwin has begun
For so betwine us both: a fair threde should be spun
This miche I have written: that the truith should be known
And that the falsite: should quite be ouerthro wen.
Finis.
