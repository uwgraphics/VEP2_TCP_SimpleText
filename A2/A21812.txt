A Proclamation for adiournment of part of Michaelmas Term. 1582.
FOrasmuch as the Queens Majesty our sovereign Lady is credibly informed,
that the infection of the plague is at this present in sundry places, in and
about the City of London, and in other places necre adjoining to ye same:
Whereas by the continuance thereof, through the greater repair and resort of
her loving subjects, great peril and danger might not only ensue unto her most
royal person, but also to her most loving subjects repairing thither for their
suits and causes, and thereby also give occasion of dispersing of the same into
other parts of the Realm, her Majesty for the said necessary
considerations, and hoping that the same will by the goodness of Almighty God,
with the coldness of the year, and such wholesome orders as are taken in her
said (...) the rather cease by the adiournme^t of part of this next term of
Saint Michael now at hand from the vtas of the same until the fourth return of
the said Term, called Mensis Michaelis next coming: Her Majesty therefore
(...) especial favor and clemency, is pleased and contented to adiorne the
said Term of Saint Michael, That is to say from the vtas thereof unto the
said fourth return of ye said Term, called Mensis Michaelis next coming,
which ^er Majesty signifies to al and singular her loving subjects of this
her Realm, to the intent that they and every of them, which has cause or
commandment to appear in any of her Highness Courts at Westminster, in or at
any day or time from and after the said vtas of Saint Michael, may tarry at
their dwellinges, or where their business otherwise ^^^^^e without resorting to
any of the said Courts for that cause before Mensis Michaelis next coming,
and that without danger of forfeiture, penalty, or contempt to incur
toward her Highness in that behalf. And neuerthe^^^ her Majesty's pleasure is,
that two of her Justices, that is to say, of either Benche one, shall the first
day of Mi^^^elmas Term, called Octabis Michaelis, according to the ancient
order of her Laws, keep the Essoynes of the said ^^^^bis Michaelis, at which
vtas of Saint Michael, Writtes of Adiornement shall be directed to the said
Justices, giving them authority to adiorne the said Term of Saint Michael,
That is to say, from the vtas thereof until Mensis Michaelis, as before is
said: And the said adiournement shall be made in the first day of the said vtas,
commonly called the day of the Essoynes. And further her Majesty's pleasure is,
that all matters, causes and suites, depending in any of her other Courts,
between party and party, as in her Highness Courts of Chauncerie, Star
Chamber and Exchequer, Courts of Wards and Liveries, Duchy of Lancaster and
Courts of Bequestes shall have continuance, and the parties shall have day
from the date of these presents until Mensis Michaelis, as before is said.

Provided always, and her Majesty's pleasure and commandment is, that all
Collectors, Receivers, Sheriffs and other Accomptants, and all other persons
that should or ought to account or pay any sum or sommes of money, in any of
her Majesty's Court of Exchequer, Court of Wards and Liveries, or of her Duchy
of Lancaster, or in any of them, o^ to enter into any account in any of the
said Courts, shall repair into the accustomed places at Westminster, where in
Highness has appointed such Officers and Ministers, as for that purpose her
Majesty has thought expedient, and there to pay and do in every behalf, as
though no such Proclamation of Adiournment had been had or made. And her
Highness further pleasure and commandment is, that all Sheriffs shall
return their Writtes and process against all such Accomptants and detters at
ye days therein appointed. And if any person or persons, who ought to acompt
or pay any sum or sommes of money to her Majesty in any ye Courts and
places aforesaid, do make default therein, That then her Highness Writtes and
process shall be awarded, and sent forth against every such person and persons,
and the same to be duly and orderly served and returned by the Sheriffs and
Officers thereunto appointed, in such like manner and form as the same should
have been, if this present Proclamation had not been made. And if any Sheriff
or other Officer shall make default or be negligent in serving, executing and
returning of any the writtes and process aforesaid: That then every such
Sheriff and other Officer shall incur such pains and penalties, as by the
said Courts, or any of them shall be taxed and assessed: Willing and commanding
all and every her Majesty's Sheriffs, Officers. Ministers and subjects, to
whom it does or shall appertain, to observe and keep their assemblies and
apparantes, with all their Retornes and certificates, in her Highness said
Courts at Westminster, in Mensis Michaelis next coming, then and there to be
holden and kept, and there to do their offices and duties in every behalf, in
like manner and form as they should or ought to have done, if this present
Proclamation had not been had or made, as they will answer to the contrary at
their perils.

twentieth year of our reign.
