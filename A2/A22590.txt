A WARNING TO THE DRAGON AND ALL HIS ANGELS.

Mark ye this wicked persons, and ye friends of the unrighteous MAMMON.

LVKE, XXI. Take heed to your selves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with Surfeiting and Drunkenness, and the Cares of this life, and
so that day come upon you unawares. For as a SNARE shall it come on all them,
that dwell on the face of the whole Earth. A SNARE O DEVIL.

Printed. M.DC.XXV.

A GENERAL EPISTLE, TO The fold and Flock of CHRIST, and to them that are
gone astray, that say they are Apostles and Catholics and are not, etc.
GRace be to you and Peace from God the Father, and from our Lord JESUS CHRIST,
who gave himself for our Sins; and in the absence of his Body for a
remmbrance the Blessed Supper, till his second appearing. As often as we taste
thereof, he takes it as a token we are not unmindful of his tender mercy that
tasted Death it self for us; so many melting trials and torments, the innocent
Lamb for a brood of Vipers, whose damme is Death whose sting is Sin, he that
washed us in his own Blood unto whom there is no access but by Faith; Behold
he comes, and every eye shall see him. To him be glory and dominion for ever
and ever. Amen.

It seemed good unto me, having a perfect understanding given me in these
things, and the dispensation of them, an office not a trade; to root out, to
pull down, to build, and to plant, by the grace and bounty of JESUS our Lord
God. To present this Visitation to your view, joining you together of the first
Arc, and universal great House, vessels of Honor and dishonor, some clean
and purified, others having need of purging.

Former things are come to pass, and new things I declare unto you; no age so
weak, nor sex excusing; when the Lord shall send and will put his words in
their Mouth. He powers out his Spirit upon his hand-maidens; the rich are sent
empty away, even so Father for it seemed good in thy sight.

Pressed and constrained with obedience to him, and Duty toward you; saying no
other things then the Prophets and Apostles did say should come to pass, that
ye might know the certainty of those things, wherein ye have been
instructed, whether you will hear or whether you will forbear.

It is a salve to anoint and open the eyes of the blind, to bring them that
sit in darkness a light, to lead them out of the Prisonhouse; others by
means of remembrance, (whose annoynting long since teaches them all things)
to stir them up; It is a true looking-glass, a large houre-glasse,
Physic for the sick, wholesome for the whole, milk for the young, and meat
for the strong. It is upon Record due, an old debt One and Twenty hun-yeares
since; Unto me is given this stone to polish, unto me this grace is given.

It is as it were a new Song to be sung before the everlasting Throne, a
salutation for Strangers and the Brethren; if we love them that love us, if we
salute the Brethren only, what do we more then others; yea but they come at
the last hour, others having borne the heat and burden of the Day.

Shall not the lost Son be found again, the Father of these that Blaspheme and
are found liars; But in the eye of our weakness their prosperity will weaue
the web of envy; murmr not at the good man of the House; Is it not
lawful; is it no wrong (as he will) to dispose the riches of his own
goodness; nay, rather may we not all say, we are unprofitable, we have both
gone out of the way, there is none that does good, no not one; nay, are not his
Judgments according to truth; O man grudge not his grace, dispute not his
justice.

But they have bin, and will be to the worlds end, our persecutors and
slaunderers, need they not so much the more our Prayers; recompense no man
evil for evil; Therefore let the Congregations of the faithful Pray for
them, poor, blind, distracted, naked, wretched people, and give glory to God,
who has done away the veil from these hidden mysteries, that hindered our
steadfast sight, Though to blind minds and deaf hearts, this veil remains
still untaken away.

Wherein for mine own part, J challenge little, not so much as those that
brought to the Tabernacle gifts of their own spinning of Blew and other
colors; But rather to be in the number of those servants, that drew out the
wonderful Wine for the Bridegroomes Feast, to bear it to the Governor and the
Guests; though to cast in my myte with others J was never unwilling.

Finally, to those that require a Sign, or think this Confidence; Boasting
that high styles are not steps for the declining age of this weak world to
climb, my age of this weak world to climb, my defense is no shorter then
free.

Least any should think of me above or better then he sees me to be, as
others to suspect a forged pass; To present you with Pearls of that sort or
holy things, I forbear at this time.

If the debt be paid the secret of the multiplied oil is to my self; Though J
shut the Door or shadow my name, I fear no faces, smiles nor frowns, for,
the hope of Israel, to me no chains are heavy, it is no bought nor stolen
fire, my ability nor boldness extending so high; yet a Candle too high mounted
for Satan, and all his attempts to blow it out, thriued the Gospel the
less, rejected of the Jews.

But all alike hit not the mark, they press forward, wranglers started aside
like a broken Bow, the match is won, one Foord is not known to all
Passengers; eleven strikes the clock says he, twelve says she; do these
contradict those that are not against us or with us; Antichristians those that
are not against us, are with us; Even so, glory be to him alone (the Set is
ours) the hour and set time of whose Judgment is at hand; and O Lord remember
thy servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and look not to the stubbornnes, nor
to the wickedness of this People, turn their hearts, preserve thy Church, and
his victorious Matie. to tread down the power of his enemies, our Sovereign
gracious Lord and the Queen, anoint them with thy holy Spirit, Crown them
with Grace; and foreign Princes, especially the Kings excellent Sister, with a
happy life here, and eternal life hereafter. Be gracious to the remnant of
JOSEPH, hear J beseech thee the Prayer of thy servant.

The Servant of Jesus Christ: O A SVRE DANIEL. DANIEL, -- I END AL.
Postscript
TO mask my name with boldness to unmask Error J crave no Pardon, the manner
let none despise; Dreams in times past have been interpreted, our Fathers in
diverse manners have been spoken unto, the wind blows where it lists.



ELEANOR AVDELEY Great BRITAIN, FRANCE, and IRELAND, Defender of the Faith.
THE INTERPRETATION OF THE VISIONS OF THE PROPHET DANIEL, revealing the Man of
Sin; And the Morning Star, before the coming of the Day.
IN the Visions of this Prophet are revealed the same things contained in the
Revelatio^, which GOD gave to Jesus Christ, to show unto his Servants things
which must shortly come to pass; things that are not, to bring to naught
things that are: And as he signified to his beloved Servant JOHN, the Contents
of the secret Book by his Angel; Even so the Lamb slain by the eternal
Decree purposed from the foundation of the world; Declared the same things to
the man greatly beloved, his servant DANIEL, unfolded in this present
exposition; drawing the juice of many sorts wanting room and leisure, to lay
things in order, wherein the Scripture will repair the want of method. Being
not willing for the lighting of a Match to make a fire, when the stroke of a
Flint is of more facility; Speaking not to a People of a strange Speech and of
a hard Language, but to the House of Israel; Avoiding man's enticing words;
things without life, give no life, that reveals not the testimony of JESUS;
at whose Name, a name above every name, Let every knee bow. Hear all ye
Children of my people, harken O Earth!

The first vision of this holy Prophet, was in the I. year of the reign of
BELSHAZZER, King of Babylon; from which spiritual Babylon takes the
denomination. One and Twenty hundred years since.

Wherein he saw the four Winds of Heaven, or the losed Angels bound in the
great River Euphrates the ancient bounds of the great Roman Empire, that
strove upon the great Sea, and the four great Beasts, that came up from the
Sea diverse one from another. These blowing Winds had no power to hurt, till
the servants of God were Sealed in the foreheads, at what time that
Commonwealth became a Monarchy, persecuting the Church of God being then with
Child, Travailing in birth, crying and pained to be delivered of the man
Child, roaring like a Lion, the whole Forest ringing, ruling all Nations with
a Rod of Iron; that breaks in pieces and subdueth all things: He is Alpha and
Omega, so have the servants of God a Twofold sense. Besides man including some
other of his Creatures, bearing the names of men, yet being neither Man nor
Beast; Praise ye him Sun and Moon, etc.

I heard the number of them: And here ended the Sealing of the first Covenant,
a yoke which our Fathers were not able to bear, to establish the second,
which is Spiritual, to put his Laws in their minds, with the Pensell of his
Grace to write them in their hard hearts, a light Burden, for the letter of the
Law, graven in stone is the sentence of death; But the Spirit gives life to
stony hearts, that were dead in trespasses and sins; yea, the whole valley of
dead Bodies, turned into Stones and Earth, from ABELL the first Borne, to the
last man taken up in the Field, they are all holy unto the Lord, their
iniquity is forgiven and forgotten, as a Father, he remembers their sin no
more.

Of these were Sealed to be of the seed of ABRAHAM, one hundred forty and
four Thousand, twelve times twelve Thousand: Of which faithful Number JESUS
CHRIST the Savior of the world, the only begotten Son of the living GOD, in
the likeness of sinful Flesh without Sin, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah,
was sealed on the Eight day of his Nativitie; The Lioness bringing but one,
and but once in her life.

That with the sprinckling and shedding of his Blood, both Covenants might be
sealed; These were the first Fruits unto God, and to the Lamb, having the
Token of the everlasting Covenant, of the great mystery in those times,
concerning CHRIST and his Church, put in the Flesh a Figure of the Heart.

Which first Covenant remains to us a Pattern of tenderness, not made with
hands, the Heart by a mutual respect being now the Closet or secret part,
whereby we Gentiles are made the tender Spouse, the habitation of God, fellow
heirs of the unsearchable Riches, joined to Christ the head, that in times
past were the Children of disobedience and wrath, Aliens from the commonwealth
of Israel, Strangers from the Covenants of promise, having no hope (without
God) in the world, are now, who were sometimes far off; of all Nations,
Kindreds and Tongues; uncircumcised Philistines, not of his Brethren; not of
the House of his Father, By the blood of JESUS CHRIST made nigh members, of his
Body, of his Flesh, and of his Bones; greater love and felicity can none
express.

Of which great mystery, Hipocrites, next Harlots, whose counterfeit beauty
deceiues not him, whose praise is of men, and not of God; false Gods, are no
partakers; the outward Token, being common to both. To assure us of which,
receiving the earnest of his Spirit, that abides, not crying Master; Carest
thou not, that we perish; but Abba, Father.

Thus our tackling lost without Anchor, to repair the ruins and weakness of
these decayed, sunk weather-tempest driven bottomes, such Treasures of
Millions expended and bestowed, what burden, what prizes, what things God has
prepared to be the lading of these vessels of honor; Eye has not seen, ear
has not heard, neither has entered into the heart of man: To which, all the
Transported affections felt or fained, enjoyed without pains or fear, may
seem but light dotage, as Light and Darkness compared, compared with the
Crown and weight of that Eternal bliss.

The Four winds prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year;
are the powers of these four great Beasts; showing their degrees of residence;
also the final Blast is included; The Sea are the Nations of the Earth.

The beginning and the ending, thus says he to the Sea: Waves drowning one
another, swelling into Mountains, for glory foaming out your own shame.
Saying, hail to the Wood awake, according to your own understanding, you have
made Idols and Images, not by my direction, but after the invention of the
Craftsman, and have exalted your hearts and forgotten me, giving my Praise to
graven Images, and my glory to another for your God, (not setting me before
your eyes) you have gotten a Devil, a false Prophet, whom I sent to prove you;
that takes my laws in his mouth, not of love, but for strife and envy:
Thinks he to say; Lord, Lord, in thy Name we have cast out Devils, Preached,
and Baptized; my answer is not unknown to you both, though you think to plead
ignorance, persecuting and dispising the number of my little ones.

You only have I known, of all the Families of the Earth, whose
transgressions do hasten your Judgment; Therefore I will punish you for your
iniquities, you shall be like the Morning Cloud, and the early dew that
passes away as the Chafe that is driven with a scattering whirle-winde out of
the Flower, as smoke out of a Chimney vanishing away; And I will be like a
Lion, as a Leopard by the way I will wait and observe you, and as a Bear that
is bereaved of her Whelps, I will tear the Kall from your hearts and devour
you; But to the faithful I will be a King, a Savior; as an Eagle stirring up
her Nest, fluttering over her young, bearing them upon the wing; So I will
preserve mine inheritance, my Portion as the Apple of mine eye.

These are the words of the First, that was like a Lion, his strength shall
overcome the rest, and take their Dominion away, having no number or finite
parts expressed; the time of whose undivided Kingdom is infinite and always;
As his years have no end, his Crowns are many; This is the Lion of the Tribe
of Judah, having of Flesh a tender heart; a man's heart was given unto it; The
Prince of the Kings of the Earth, the first and the last; And because he is the
root, and made of the seed of DAVID; He is here accounted amongst these
Beasts; This is he that sat upon the white Horse, the Circle of the Earth, to
judge and make War; beholding the Inhabitants like Grasshoppers; and a Bow and
a Crown was given unto him; He is the Lord of Lords, the King of Kings, and
of his Kingdom there is no end.

The second Beast like a Bear, the Seventh head, that had Three ribs in the
Mouth between the Teeth of it, signifying, Three hundred years; this is the
devouring Reign of the Heathen Roman Emperors, which lasted so long, licked
by the Devil; In the infancy of which Empire, the Son of God was Crucified,
and the City of Jerusalem destroyed, wherein the yearly Sacrifice or feast of
the Passover was solemnized, that in her might be found the Blood of Prophets
and Saints, and of all that were slain upon the Earth, in which first seventy
years, the Apostles and seventy finished their testimony what they had seen
and heard, after which followed the ouer-spreading of abomination spoken of by
our Savior, making the Sanctuary desolate, defiled with Carcasses which can
neither see, hear, nor walk, abominable carrion, the house of Prayer, made
the Gallery of the Devil, for his devices to stand in.

And this is he that sat upon the Red Horse, Having a great Sword given unto
him, to make War with the Church of God, devouring much Flesh, Burning,
Scorching it with fire, Hail mingled with Blood, destroying Trees, and all
green grass, smote every Herb, and brake every Tree; and here ended the
first Woe with this second Beast, all fire and horrible Cruelty, such as there
was none like it in all the Land of spiritual Egypt since it became a Nation,
and shortly after began the next Woe, where the fire is not mentioned, because
the smoke is so great, thick darkness or heresy, false doctrine
extinguishing the Light of truth, which shall continue until the third Woe,
Hell fire, and Brimstone or Blasphemy, issuing out of their Mouths, a great
cry from him that sits upon the Throne, when Redness shall be turned into
Palenesse to the Maid behind the Mill, the Captain in the Dongeon, free and
bond, because of the last Plague the second Death.

The third Beast that was like a Leopard, or half a Lion, an Ape between Man
and beast, whose feet or first footing, were as the feet of a Bear, that had
upon the back of it four Wings, like a Foul or painted Bird: Two of the
Eagle, and two of the Dragon; signifying his time, Four hundred years before
the coming in of Antichrist, then came the King of Babylon to Jerusalem, and
besieged it, taking the advantage of the Night, what Linkes or Torches brought
him thither I read not, but Moonlight there was little, though he were on his
way or Wing, but let Two hundred years before.

Bearing also four heads, four standing up for it, showing the division of
the Empire into so many parts, being then too large and great for the
government of one man. This is the Dragon of Egypt; that Monarchy that began
with the Christian Emperors, whose deadly wound (Death to the Soul) was
washed in the Blood, and healed by the Stripes of the heavenly Samaritan; There
is now no healing of the Bruise, it is putrified, the Wound is grievous; the
Leopard cannot change his spots; bind thy Tire upon thy head, forbear to cry:
O Virgin daughter of Egypt, in vain shall thou go up into Gillead and take
Balm, or use Medicines, thou do run in vain. And this is he that sat
upon the black Horse; the Ethiopian cannot change his skin, less man then
the Minataure; more Monster then a Centaure, engendered of black Clouds,
carried about of every Wind, to whom is reserved the Blackness of Darkness
for ever: Black will take no other hew; having a pair of Balances given into
his hand, without respect of persons, to measure to all men, rich and poor,
free and bond, a measure of Wheat for a penny, and three measures of Barley
for a penny; Hoe! every one that thirsts, and he that has no money, Come
buy and eat, give not your money for stones in stead of Bread, say not
Ignorance is better then Knowledge, Neither hurt the Oil and the Wine; Touch
not a Lords anointed, and do his Prophets no harm, that Nourish you with
truth and understanding.

The last Beast the fourth, that is the Eight, and was Seven heads and is not,
and is of the Seven, and goes into perdition, that had great Iron Teeth, that
devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet thereof,
and was diverse from all the Beasts that were before it; having a Miter of Ten
horns, signifying also, though the Crowns be not here expressed, so many
hundred years his Limited time, the Ten days of tribulation in the
Apocalips, wherein the Devil shall have power to cast the faithful into
Prison; (After the Tribulation imediately of those days; Two shall be in the
field, etc.) Nine of which number are expired, and some part of the last
hundred, but how many are to come; by these horns precisely cannot be aimed at
without the Art or Science of Chronology; This is Judas the Devil, the King
of Babylon and Egypt, the reign of Antichrist Pope of Rome, count the Letters
of his name for it is the number of his time, whose name is Death; hated
mortally of his time, whose name is Death; hated mortally the King of Rome and
Italy: This is he that sat upon the Pale Horse, the son of Perdition, of
all Complexions the darkest, nearest to corruption, threatening alone, a heart
charged with so much wickedness and malice as the Red Horse, all the sanguines
in the Rayne-bow, and the Sword cannot set out more of Brutish cruelty; had
he wings to his will, and of time length to the height and bigness of his
insatiable mind; NERO, TITUS, DOMITIANVS, these beasts of the Earth, their
hearts and policies parraleld would seem but a Curre coupled or compared with
this greedy Woolfe. A Bull as bloody as the Bear.

Whose land is covered with Locusts and Darkness; even darkness that may be felt
rising out of the depth of the bottomless pit of Satan's malice very grievous;
yet had all the faithful light in their dwellings that they might not loose
the way; for it was Commanded these Armies of Scorpions besieging the holy
City, having pernicious stings, both ways voluptuous and malicious, The power
of the Enemy that they should not hurt the grass of the Earth, neither any
green thing, by any means nothing should hurt them, but only dry Trees or
boughs, bearing no fruit of repentance, those men that have not the Seal of
God in their graceless foreheads, that they should not kill these wretched
blind miserable People, but that they should be tormented five Months, as in
those days the most part, most Lamentable in the siege of Jerusalem by Famine
were tormented so long compassed with a Trench, kept in on every side, Seeking
death, and desiring to dye, etc.

This did the Lord because the Princes of Egypt, harkened not to mild MOSES;
but hardened their hearts, and did evil in the sight of the Lord, after the
Abominations of the Heathen; Therefore says the Lord, I am against thee o
Dragon, which lie in the Heart (the midst of the Rivers) which said my
Rivers are mine own, I have made it for my self; I will put hooks in thy
Claws, and leave the Throne into the Wilderness, where there is no water; and
all the Inhabitants shall know that I am the Lord, because they have been a
staff of Reed to the house of Israel, when they took hold of thee by the
hand, thou did break and Rent all their shoulder, and when they learned on
thee, thou brakest, and made all their loins to be at a stand, with the
Burdens of Brick and Rubbish thy Officers did lay upon them.

Thou have given them Stubble for Straw, vapor of smoke for Victual; thou
have made their lives bitter unto them; Therefore the Lord is against thee
whose healed Wound is festred, turned wild again, become Antichristian and
incureable, thou that had the Balances in thine own hand; Thou that art
like a Leopard or a young Lion of the Nations, as a Dragon; or a Whale in the
Seas, with thy Diadem of Ten horns, crowned with Ten Crowns, so many
Antichristian hundred years, Nine of which account are cast, past, and expired.

Troubling the waters with thy feet, and fowlest their Rivers; the whole Sea
of Rome, the third part of the maine Sea is become Blood; Behold the Lord is
against thee and against thy Rivers, which are turned into Wormwood (woe due O
Rome) and Hemlocke; Even the Third part of the waters, the streams of Justice
and Mercy are become poison and Bitterness; I hate and despise your Images,
Feast days, Processions, Solemn assemblies, says the Lord; who required
those things: I commanded, Judgment should run down free as water, and
Righteousness as a mighty stream; Woe the Bloody City.

You are impudent and disobedient Children, as the day of your Visitation, so
are your sins hidden from you, when you shall say for shame to the Mountains
Cover us, and to the Rocks and Hills fall upon us; you will know your
transgression, the long Wings of the morning, the Caves of MAKADAH shall not
preserve you, Lightening, Thundering Cannons, the whole Globe at a shot,
shiuering your Bodies, sinking your Souls, and making your hearts to hop: Ear
never heard, neither has entered into the heart of man such horror, forsaken of
all, but the Devil and his Angels, burned and buried alive, of all the
Creatures not a drop of water remaining, of Light not a spark, Rebels these
terrors as Shot or Hailestones from Heaven Pell-mell, shall drive you into a
Bottomless gulf headlong; the great day of his wrath is come, saying to the
fiery Lake; Hide us from the face of him that sits upon the Throne.

When the faithful scattered People shod with the everlasting Gospel of
Peace, after all their labors and travail in this Wilderness, shall enter
into the Land of Rest: Here is the Body of the Beast destroyed; PHARAOH and all
his Multitude of unbelieving Lowzie orders; even all his Host of furious
Horsemen as Locusts, eating every herb, and all the fruit of the Trees the
hail had left, drowned in Hell Fire the bottomless red Sea, that may boast
rather of their Blaines and Boyles, then Vermin, which their own Magitians
deny not to be the manifest finger of God; vaunting they win by their
Cosening game termed Chastity, the Joys of heaven, and Secret bosom Alms in
breeding Lice: Such unclean Rags past mending, I did mean to cast away, but
since you will not hear MOSES and the Prophets, I will bestow some labor to
air them for you, and your patched Coats waxen old and bad to make bags for
heavenly Treasure, well may they stop Bottles when your Reward is weeping and
gnashing of Teech; in those days, all the Water I find the Saints will supply
you with, to cool your blistered Tongues.

Masters though to simple Peoples you seem to make strait steps, it is no
news to say you incline too much on the left hand. Think ye the Crowns like
Gold can deceive us; or hair as the hair of Women; The veil of
shamefastness, showing sobriety and subjection: Think ye those long locks
like separited Nazarites, can cover your notted crowns from the Raizer, or
hide your pined Bodies pinched of Provender like neighing Horses prepared to
the Battle, It is not unknown to us, the golden Cup, and these gilden
counterfeit Crowns like false Hair to cover Baldness; Both came out of one
Furnace: they are yet unpaid for.

Though ESAU should lend you Tears, yet shall ye come and worship before the
feet of them, you now despise and persecute; There is no blessing reserved, the
Mourning day is at hand, the Armor you bear shines with the Brotherly
affection you bear us, we fear not your fury; Go ye Cursed, here is your
farewell, receive the Portion of Hipocrites, and eat the fruit of Lies
rejoicing and trusting in your own counterfeit Righteousness, painted flames,
such false Coin will not pass. Eternal life is free gift purchased by
Grace; receive the wages of Sin; venomous Armies, the power of the Enemy led
by the Star called Wormwood, To those that have not drunk or smoked out
their eyes, as visible as Lightning of a Lamp fallen from Heaven, threatening
War, Famine, with Pestilent Mortality; the fourth part, the whole Christian
world infected by that strumpet Hagge Rome and Italy. Lastly, the name of his
Palenesse was Death, because he is the last, and Hell followed with them with
deadly malice, Reigning till the day of Judgment, after which he shall swim
with his fellows, and bathe in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimstone.

These three Beast signified by the great City divided into Three parts, so
many several persecutions of the Church under great Babylon, With a bold
stroke, the last is not drawn in colors least to the life; the fourth Beast
(the false Prophet, their Popes falls,) the bitter Star turning Judgment
into Gaul of Aspes fallen from Heaven, Signifying the losing of his Keys,
(pride will have a fall) for which he was cast out of the presence of God: God
and Mammon cannot be served together; here has he the command of the
bottomless Pit, smoking with Heresy and ignorance; The Keys of the Kingdom
of Hell, which trust so much he boasts of, given him by the Dragon the
Devil, to deceive them that dwell upon the Earth; saying in the sight and
opinion of men; Let it be known this day, that I have done all these things at
thy word; that these are thy Keys; I am thy Apostle; and if I be the man of
God, let fire come down from Heaven and consume all those, that obey not my
orders, and Laws; and at what time ye hear the sound of my Instruments; fall
down and worship the Image, that I NABVCHANDNEZAR have set up, whose breath is
in my hand, and whole are all my ways to glorisie me; and who so falls not
down, etc,

This Baals Prophet the last Beast, having devoured and broken in pieces the
Roman Empire, exercising all the power of him whose Rome he usurps; the Lord
saying, I that form the Light, and create Darkness; I that make Peace, and
create evil, I will strengthen the Armies of the King of Babylon, and put my
Sword into his hand. But I will break PHAROAHS Arm, and and he shall groan
before him, with the groaning of a deadly wounded man; Moreover, thus says the
Lord of Hosts that keeps back no man's pay.

The King of Babylon caused his Army to serve a great service against CHILDRIC
King of Tirus, every head was made Bald of his Race, and every shoulder peeled,
yet had he no wages for his Army; Therefore the Land of Egypt shall be his
for his labor, because they wrought for me says the Lord; for there shall be
no more a Prince in Egypt whose brightness was Excellent, and the form
thereof terrible to all the world; But rather a painted Image, a Vassoll, that
the working of the poisoned Potion in the golden Cup, the mystery of iniquity
be not hindered, A base Kingdom the basest of all Kingdoms, neither shall it
exalt it self any more above the Nations; for I will diminish them, it shall
be no more the confidence of the house Israel.

Having now the spoil of the Land for his Army and the Sword and Balances in
his own hand to make a prey of mercy and truth, with his Horns and heels as
weapons to war and wear out the Saints given into his hand until a time and
times; and the deviding of times, Three days and a half Two and forty
Months Three years and a half, half the mystical week, until the Day of
sudgement; to make Merchandise of every thing, that no man may buy or sell
without his Mark, marked with his fiends foot; which is his Seal, the signet
of the Fisherman that bears the name of the Beast.

The number of his name is then the number of a man, which is the number of his
Age or Days, but this is the number of his Months; Natural Beasts not living
so long, the years being not so many as the days are to few. As one says,
the number of his Months are with the Lord; Also half the mystical Week is
delivered by the same measure. The latter Six Months added to the former Six
hundred, making as complete Fifty, as Threescore make Five years; Here is
Wisdom the counsel of times and seasons revealed, according to the eternal
purpose, which the wisdom of the Father put in his own power, God has
numbered thy Kingdom and finished it, thou art weighed in the balances, thou
tyrant, that boastest of thy wit, and art found wanting grains innumberable,
thy Kingdom is divided, and given to the people of the Saints of the most
Highest, whose Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom etc. Therefore let him that
reads count this number well, and well mark, the mark of the Beast, is the
Signet of the Fisherman, which men take in their right hand, wherewith his Band
are branded in the foreheads, and this is the Caractor and colors that
distinguishes his Traine-Souldiers from the followers of the Truth.

Therefore thus says the Lord to the King of Babylon, Antichrist thy days be
few, The great day of my wrath is at hand, even for the Elects sake, and the
Souls that rest under the Altar, crying for Execution and Vengeance upon thee,
whose Bodies thou have beheaded, burned and buried alive, slain for the
Testimony they held, the time is shortened, thy Bishoppricke shall be void,
and become a habitation for Devils; and because thou remembrest not to show
mercy, by swift destruction thy memory shall be cut off from the Earth, thy
Damnation slumbreth not, as a thief in the night, and as a snare it shall come
shortly upon thee; Thou have loved cursing, in blessing thou have not
delighted, but as a cloak for Covetousness, selling to thy Merchants for
money, those foul ointments to fill thy Bag, calling and crying from thy
Exchange and dark shop; if any man Thirst to commit Whoredom, spiritual or
carnal, Treason, or Murder, let him come to me and drink of my Golden
Cup, Incest or Parricide; Hoc misterium firmiter profitemur; what do ye
lack; we can sell you for Gold, Silver, and precious stones, thin Wood,
Brass, Iron, and Marble, all manner of Vessels, in Nunneries or Stews, what
will ye give; These execrable odors, and thy Brazen browed Bulls, casting
flakes of Fire and fulminations in the sight of men from their noisome
Nostrills and Thundering throats, as with a Garment thou have clothed thy
self, thou have robbed me even of this whole Nation, therefore prepare thy
self thou cursed for everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his
Angels, which shall enter into thy Bowels like water, and soake with thine
ointments, as oil into thy Bones, and mingle with thy marrow; thus let the
Enemies of the Lord be rewarded, yea, in the mean time let them be their own
executioners; let one IVDAS with Poison burst out the Bowels of another; let
their hope be as the giving up of the Ghost, and their righteousness wherein
they trust, in thy remembrance as water that passes away; Let them curse, but
Bless thou o Lord to whom vengeance belongs, show thy self, lift up thy
self thou Judge of the Earth, and to this proud man of Sin render a reward;
let him not have the upper hand, sitting upon the Throne of Iniquity in thy
Temple, showing himself that he is God, Consume him o Lord with the Breath of
thy mouth, and destroy him quickly with the Brightness of thy coming.

Lastly, this Beast his habitation is compared to a woman for Sorceries,
shamelessness and gorgious trimming, arrayed in Purple and Scarlet, the Virgin
daughter of the King of Egypt, is become the Whore of the King of Babylon, the
faithful City is become a Harlot, having in her hand a Cup full of
abominations, Witchraft and Blasphemy, viz. worshipping Idols of Gold and and
Silver, Brass, Wood, and Stone, mixing holy things with filthy excrements,
remission, the forgiveness of sins, and calling the foul Sinagogue of
Satan, the Church of God, and these are the spices and spirits wherewith her
Cup is brewed; and this is the Golden Cup wherewith the Kings of the Earth
have been made so drunken with, a Cup of Sodom, Wine mixed with the Blood of
Dragons, and stirred with the stings of Aspes; Is this meat indeed, and drink
indeed, the sauce comes after; Is this the true Mother; is this the Woman
she is taken for, with Eagles wings; her child caught up unto God and to his
Throne, and having a crown of Twelve Stars; in no wise in her there is no
Bowels of a Mother, though they strive to the end of the world.

Her Judgment follows; And a name was written upon her forehead BABYLON, The
Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth, the Print is not small, yet
not so large as the mystery is deep; It was written, and therefore to be
read: Thus, the hidden mystery of this Enigmaticall writing is here, the secret
of numbers to teach us to number her days; The numbers are these, and I heard
the number of them, Two hundred thousand thousand horsemen, having breast
plates of fire and Gunpowder or hyacinth, force and fury in stead of faith and
love, alluding to the double number of NINVS Horsemen, wherewith he subdued so
many Nations in Seventeene years: The double confirmation of this mystery
seventeene hundred years also, being the limited time fixed to finish her
war, which began with the Lamb, and ended in subduing his Saints and
Servants; And as the fiery Army needing no fuel, were to the Army of NINVS,
consisting of Twenty hundred Thousand, amounting a hundred to one, so is the
account of the time, when the spreading Vine of the Earth, the clusters of her
Grapes being ripe, she shall be cast into the great winepresse of the wrath of
God. These Tyrants, (here is wisdom to look into these accounts) shall make
her desolate and naked, and eat her flesh, and burn her with fire; for God
has put it in their hearts to fulfill his will, when Babylon the glory of
Kingdoms, shall be as Sodom and Gomorah, the time is near, the days shall
not be prolonged.

The Father of this goodly Baby, (yet ancient, no novice in her whoredom) for
so he names himself, there is no need to name him (at whose entrance the
Fourth Angel or Wind was loosed) as he is sufficiently notorious, so is he
mistaken Satan that old Serpent, begetting the Impe of Fornication, before
ever the Beast and his false spouse came together, deceivers as seldom wanting
cloakes of craft to hide their shame, as their offspring fail in Lyneaments
and likeness too their Parents, seven heads no less marks then Mountains,
seeing as incredible as superfluous and monstrous, were it not the Evidence and
demonstration of that Sinagogue to prove her title and visibilitie, drunken
with the Blood of Saints and Martyrs, In steed of her Mothers milk and breast
she sucks her hart-Blood, whose Father was a Liar and a Murderer from the
beginning.

To Administer the rites of their unrighteous mystery; This City Bab, has
City Gossips, NINEVY is not invited; she repented at the Preaching of the
poor Prophet, she is none of them; But Babylon for her Pride and impudency at
this Antichristian solemnity or show of Christianity; The Mother of Harlots;
for her stiff neck is preferred before her, whose name this shameless place,
never to be outworne or blotten out, bears in her fatal brazen forehead.

Besides, this Lady sitting upon her Beast, seventeene Kings to bear up her
Train, decked with Gold and precious Stones, and Pearl, whose name is also
Semiramis or Iesabell, for magnificence millions of men, viz. a hundred times
Twenty hundred Thousand; Her Altars, Images, Sorceries, and Blood of Prophets
and Saints, Saying in her heart, I sit a Queen and am no Widow; a Lady for
ever, I am, and none else besides me; there are Seven Kingdoms.

Five are fallen down dead drunk, upon whom the Lord has poured out the
spirit of deep sleep, and closed their eyes, they shall revert nor rise no
more; After slumbering the other Two, (though they have fallen from the truth,)
shall stagger and come to themselves again; and that Must now grown sower and
stale, their lust shall be little to taste thereof again; The first Kingdom
or ONE IS, are the British Islands, the right Inheritance of King JAMES the
first of that Name of Great Britain and Ireland; for the Isles feared the
Judgment of the Lord and saw it; Even the ends of the Earth were afraid and
drew near. The other is not yet come, and when it comes, it can continue no
long space, the end of the world is so near.

O senseless poor Beasts who has bewitched you; why lie ye still, who has
bitten you; arise, choose not Death rather then life; how are ye swollen, why
should your Carcasses be dung, and meat for the fowls of Heaven? Why will ye
dye, stand up; why go ye backward; what astonishment is this that has taken
you; be recovered, understand, halt not, yet hear the word of the Lord; cursed
cattle, backsliding Heifers he delights in Mercy; provoke not him with your
strange vanities and Brutish abominations; The day of the Lord is at hand.

Therefore awake ye Drunkards, weep and howl all ye drinkers of Wine,
because of the new Wine the Deep Cup, the day of the wrath of the Lord is at
hand; ye Kings of the Earth and Rulers of Sodom, who have committed
fornication, and lived delitiously with this indulgent Witch, the mother of
Harlots; when ye see her brought to the stake and utterly burnt with fire; how
will ye stand, for strong is the Lord who Judges her; what will ye say; ye
shall stand a far off, or wish in vain the Mountains to cover you, howling
and gnashing your Teethes for fear of her Torment, whosoever sins as the smoke
of her Burning have reached up unto Heaven; saying alas, alas, Sodom,
alas, Babylon, Rome the great City, the head of the Monarchy; for in the
twinkling of an eye, an hour unlooked for, thy Judgment is come, is that a
time to cast dust on your heads?

Never more shall we hear in thee the voice of Harpers and Pipers, awaking and
calling for rewards to Saints and our Lady; and Trumpeters when we do our
Alms; Never more shall we see in thee Idols or Images so ancient, the
curious device of the Crafts-man, nor the sound of the grinding Millstone; our
Altars decked as a shop, shining with the light of so many Tapers and Candles.
Nor the voice of the Bridegroom, called the head, and the Bride by Prelates
and so many Kings our holy Mother; The Net is spread, she is taken in the
Snare, in grinding the face of the Poor, she that so much glorified her
self, in a day and an hour her Plague is come.

The Thrones of these Earthly Kingdoms cast down the ancient of days shall
appear; his long Train, and the great white Throne whereon he sat, from
whose Face the Earth and the Heavens unclean in his sight fled away, in whose
presence ministered Thousand thousands, and Ten thousand times Ten Thousands;
also the Two Witnesses are brought forth, the Books of the Law and the
Prophets, to Judge every man by his works, or according to his faith, for if
they believe not the writings of MOSES; how can they believe his words of whom
MOSES wrote, These Books shall accuse them, the witnesses which God the Father
bears of his Son; The other Book is the Book of Life, written with the
names of Saints that shall live for ever; To whom the just Judge shall deliver
the possession of that Kingdom that shall never pass away to be destroyed,
but remains for ever, even for ever and ever.

The foul Beast, some of his purtenances will be wanting, if his horns be not
farther Considered; four came up out of the North part of his head, the French
Emperors; of the South side six Spanish; before whom, there were Three of the
first, their Race plucked up by the Roots; amongst these came up an other
little Horn about the midst of the time: in this Horn were eyes, like the
eyes of a man, in workmanship striving to set Nature a pattern; curious in all
Arts, and doing honor to virtue, but wanting the gift of grace, opened a
fearful Mouth; the King of the East, whose look is more stout then the
highest of his fellow Horns.

Hitherto is the end of the matter of these earthly Monarchies, and the day of
Judgment has been also declared the matter of the end: The Story is yet but
chalked out, Therefore in these following Visions is contained more at large,
the occurrence of theose days before mentioned, even to the end of the world;
Wherein my desire is, not as he that rowleth a stone to return upon himself,
but to make it a twisted Threefold Cord, to draw up the weight that presses so
hard of infidelity.

The Prophet beheld till the ancient of days did sit to Judge the quick and
the dead, and the Beast cast alive into the Lake Fire, his Body destroyed and
given to the Burning flame, to be tormented day and night, for ever and ever.

DANIEL. CHAP. VIII.
IN the third year of BELSHAZZER a Vision appeared unto DANIEL alone, even to
himself, and he heard a man's voice that called, saying; GABRIEL, make the man
understand the Vision; so he came near unto him, and said; O Son of man, the
time of this Vision extends to the end of all things; behold therefore I will
make thee know what shall come to pass, even to the last day, the great day of
Wrath and Indignation, for at the time appointed the end shall be.

MEDES AND PERSIANS THE ROVGHE GOAT. SEND ME SPANIARDS THE GOTHE ROAGVE.
The first matter given him to vanderstand, is the breaking in pieces of the
Roman Empire, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt; where also the
members of our Lords Body are Crucified, signified by the Ram, the He Goat is
the Turk; The Roman Emperors the Two horns in the East and West, are also
signified by the Kings of Media and Persia. The four Kingdoms standing up out
of that Nation, are the Isles of Great Britain, France, Spain, and Turkey.

Lastly, the Goat himself shall be hunted by a King of a fierce Countenance,
not regarding the person of the old, nor showing favor to the young, casting
down some of the host of PHARAOH, and of the Stars to the ground: For the
transgression against the daily Sacrifice was the Host given over: A King
understanding dark sentences which are some part of the holy Scriptures,
through policy and supposed wisdom, he shall cause the craft of the Devil to
prosper, for by Peace and affected pity, and satisfying the ambitious minds
of some Christians, he shall not only draw them to deny the faith, but many
others following their example: Not by his own power, but by the Devils
policy he shall be mighty, whose look is more stout then his fellows, But by
the great day of the Lord, he shall be broken without hand.

Now in those days, when the Goat was come close unto the Ram, and had cast
him down and stamped upon him; The Prophet that beheld as by a perspectiue
these remote things, heard also one Saint speaking, and an other Saint said
unto that certain Saint that spoke, how long is the time for this Vision to
the end of the world, that the holy City of God, and his chosen People be no
longer trodden under foot; And he said unto me unto Two Thousand Three
hundred days; Then shall the Sanctuary be cleansed, and the holy People
Justified.

The days be so many years to the end of the world, beginning at the Vision,
which was about the year of the world, 342.5.

Of the certain Saints speaking, or the number of wonderful secrets, I omit
to speak, that to the most part might appear (being in this Land, and these
late days) but some tale of a Phoenix, though to be testified of more then
five hundred men and women besides my self.

DANIEL. CHAP. IX.
AFter these Visions in the first year of DARIUS the Son of AHASHVERVS, the
Prophet understood by Books and Computations, the number of years whereof the
world of the Lord came to JEREMIAH the Prophet, concerning the desolation of
Jerusalem, that seventie years should be accomplished; And whilst he was
speaking in Prayer, and presenting his supplication before the Lord for the
holy Mountain the People of God, even for the holy City the Church, that to
the end of the world must be trodden under foot, whereof that ruinons place
the City of Jerusalem, is a figure trodden down at this day. Yet was this
Hebron built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.

The man GABRIEL which was caused to fly swiftly, touched him and said
(alluding to the former matter of his study and meditations, as of troublous,
appetites, and Cogitations sometimes Dreams are derived) O DANIEL I am come
unto thee again to give thee more skill and understanding; Seventy weeks are
determined upon the holy City, signifying the time, not only when the Son
of God by his suffering should make reconciliation for sin, but a time and
times and part of time, three days and a half, half the mystical Week, to
make an end of Sins to finish transgression, and to make a new Heaven and a
new Earth, wherein dwells everlasting righteousness to seal up the Visions
and Prophecies with the Seal of assurance, that all these things are past and
true, and to anoint the most holy King and Kings, and Lord and Lords, the
first and the last.

And here again the Angel GABRIEL wills him to know and understand the
things of which he shall inform him; The first is this, that from the going
forth of the Commandment, which is the beginning of the Creation to the
building of the new Jerusalem, the second coming of Messiah the Prince the
Son of God, it shall be Seven Weeks or Seven Months, as it is spoken by
EZEKIEL the Prophet; Then the desolate City the Sanctuary shall be walled in,
in a troublous time, to make a separation between the Sanctuary and the
Profane place.

And in the midst of this Prophetical week, after Threescore and Two
weeks, Messiah shall be cut off, the Son of God salbe Crucified and be delivered
unto the Gentiles, and they shall scourge him and put him to death, the People
of the Prince (for it was not lawful for the Jews to put any man to Death)
these People the Roman Nation shall destroy the City of Jerusalem and the
Sanctuary; at the end of which War there shall begin a flood of Fire (kindled
in our Saviors days) during the Reign of those Ethnic Bears; and the
abomination of desolation standing where it ought not; then let him that is in
Judea fly to the wild Mountains for safety; for in those times Judgment did
begin at the house of God; and if first Justice did begin at his Children and
Servants in this life, what shall the end be of his Enemies, whom he hates in
the world to come, that have not obeyed the Gospel of God.

These Floods the Serpent will cast out of his Mouth, a time and times and
half a Time, to try them of the holy Covenant, their boldness, what
confidence they have concerning the Lords oath, and whether they will persevere
in this holiness and righteousness all their days to their lives end, and
not rather fear his power, who is Satan the Prince of this world, or at least
the furious cruel hands of his torturing Instruments.

Whose lives cannot satisfy their malice; for had not the senseless earth
showed more pity then they, opening her Mouth to help these poor outcasts,
their torments had been endless; Sooner they may swim, and sink in their
Blood, then daunt or foil their courage, not abashed for their Boasts,
threats, nor fiery Bands they fear them not at all; their Triumphs are graven
upon the Palms of the Lords hands, he forgets them no more, then a Mother
forgets her newborn Son, her sucking child, when the Tongue cleaues to the
roof of the Mouth for Thirst, to have compassion on him; be of good cheer,
you have peace in Christ, though tribulation in this world; persecutions are
but like the Travel of a Woman, who has sorrow because her hour is come, but
as soon as she is delivered of the Child, she remembers no more the
anguish, for joy a man-child is borne into the world.

The Lamb, the Bread of life shall feed them, they shall hunger nor thirst no
more; he shall wipe all Tears from the eyes of his Children; these vilde
Bodies, subject to all infirmities, shall then be made like his own glorified
Body, of more perfection then our first Parents, a living Soul that shall not
dye to Sin; neither shall the heat of the Sun smite them; for he shall
have mercy upon them, and lead them to living Fountains of truth, clear as
Crystal; these that come to him, or overcome the world, hunger no more, they
have rest and peace for pain, and by their white Robes and Palms in their
hands, the Ensigns of peace and victory; they shall be known, neither to be
Heretics or Schismatiques, but his servants that have fought for his Kingdom
that it should not be delivered up unto Antichrist.

The followers of him, who shall shortly tread these Traitors in the great
Wine Press of the wrath of God, who have turned away their Ears from the
wholesome Scriptures, the Leaves of which are for the healing of the Nations,
that they might be rubbed with the Profane fables of Drunken doting old wives.

But with all the faithful the Lord shall confirm his truth and Covenant for
a Week from the beginning of the world until the last end thereof; This week
is Seven thousand years, consisting of years, Months and weeks; finished
when the Kingdoms of this world, are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of
his Christ, and he shall Reign for ever and ever: When the Tenth part of the
City fell, the Ten days of Tribulation are ended; Seven thousand names of
men slain in the great Earthquake, Dies Solis, Dies Lunae, Dies Martis, Dies
Mercurij, Dies Iovis, Dies Veneris, Dies Saturni; the remnant were affrighted,
and gave glory unto the God of Heaven.

For we must not be ignorant of this one thing, that one day with the Lord is
as a Thousand year, and a Thousand year as one day; In the midst of which
Week, the Lord shall cause the oblation and Sacrifice to cease, saying,
Sacrifice and Offering thou would not, but a Body have thou prepared me
without spot, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the
first Testament. The Blood of which first Testament of Beasts, God enjoined to
purify the patterns of heavenly things, the Vessels of the Ministry, but the
heavenly things themselves with better Sacrifices (which are the Consciences to
purge them from dead works, that they may be clean vessels to serve the
living God.)

Thus he once suffered, the uncreated in likeness of a Creature like feeble
sinful flesh, sown in weakness and dishonor in the Dust, but raised in
Power and the Brightness of his Fathers. Glory, the express Image of his
person, over whose excellent Nature, void of violence and deceit, the Grave
could get no victory, no more then the womb can keep back a son at the
time of perfection, redeemed from the Bowels of the Earth, and ransomed by the
riches of his own unsearchable Treasure and quickening Spirit.

This seeming ugly Serpent, rather some shadow or his skin, at whose approach
men turn pale and quake more terrified then hurt; But rocking Babes the
faithful a sleep, others run raving with staring frenzy for fear, as if
this once appointed so were fits to be chased away, not calling to mind the
Resurrection of JESUS CHRIST, has opened his Jaws, his Sting cut out and
nailed to the Cross, that bold Champion scorning to be his executioner,
setting his victorious foot upon the Traitors head, by spiritual alliance
kin to the Devil, proud of advantage, bites the Heel of our Savior with
his rotten Teeth, for want of his Poisoned sting.

But hear o Death unstop thine Adders ears from whose Mole-sighted eyes, the
light of Repentance is hid, behold thy time and Plague is at hand; thy pined
crying Prisoners, thou shall restrain their liberty no longer, that say our
Bones are dried and our hope is lost, when shall we dwell in the Land of the
living; behold, thy Caves and Castles shall be destroyed and broken down, and
the Earth that opened her Mouth and swallowed up the Flood shall cast it up
again in the twinkling of an Eye, thou shall give up thy accounts, for of the
Sons and Daughters of the Lord, thou shall not keep back so much as the
least, whose names are written in the Book of life.

And lastly, Viper, seed of the old Serpent, thy sentence is for that bold
attempt; Fuller of malice then hurt, thy house shall be burned with
unquenchable Fire, the Place sown with unsavory poisoned Salt, and thy
Carrion-carkasse swallowed up of thine own Brood the second Death.

All which mystical Week or Seven Months formerly mentioned, as it is
spoken by the Prophet EZECHIEL; The Land of Israel shall be burying of Gog that
Satan, that the Land may be cleansed.

Hitherto are the matters talked of between the man GABRIEL and the Prophet.

DANIEL. CHAP. X.
IN the third year of CYRUS King of Persia, a thing was revealed to DANIEL
(whose name was called BELTESHAZZER) and the thing was true but the time
appointed was long. These are the things not only come to pass, in this latter
age of the world, but at this time and in this day; signified by the Son of God
to the Prophet.

PRINCE OF PERSIA. -- I CAN POPE FRIARS.

Devil.
I can Pope Friars. Man hold up my Train?
Pope.
Kings I Depose, and all their Race, to Reign.
Devil.
And Popes to Friars I can turn again.
The Prince of the Kingdom of Persia, (that Lord by whom the Lord of Lords was
withstood,) is Satan the Devil, MICHAEL one of the first Princes that came
then to help him; This is JAMES King of Great Britain, and the man who is
raised on high: The one and Twenty days; the Lord making no forfeiture, are so
many Hundred years, beginning at the Vision, and ending this present, 1600.
And so long the words of this Vision have been closed and sealed up; Even till
now the time of the end.

This most Blessed person the Savior of the world, remained with the Kings of
Persia, the Roman Emperors (signified so unto DANIEL being the present
Monarchy) till there arose up a new King in Egypt which knew not JOSEPH, and
said unto his People; Behold, the People of the Children of Israel are more,
and mightier then we; Therefore set over the^ Taskmasters to afflict them with
Burdens, but the more they did afflict them, the more they multiplied and
grew. These Kings placed in the highest Thrones, to walk in his Statutes to
execute his Judgments, but because they gave more Ear, and harkened rather to
false Prophets then to ELIAS and MOSES, for severitie and meekness;
Representing the Law and the Gospel, suffering their Bodies to lie dead in the
streets in an unknown Tongue, even he the Lord departed from them; and with
the sword of his Mouth will fight with their Prince Satan, renewing always
his old quarrel against the Church of God.

And here these Kings forsaken of JESUS CHRIST, for one secret friend which is
the Devil, they have two open Enemies, the Turk and the Pope, making their
Crowns his footstool, this did not CAESAR, by these Three the Empire being
divided, what can remain but the bare Image; or the Image of the Picture of
him, whose deadly wound was healed: Bearing at this day, as Thunder goes before
Lightning, for their fatal device, the sad Foul blazoned with the ominous
Colors of the black Horse; for fear, but half displaying her wings, in
stead of her beak she casts her heads, the Eagle has Mued her Feathers;
Though thou exalt thy self as the Eagle, and though thou set thy neast amongst
the Stars, thence will I bring thee down says the Lord.

These things hitherto mentioned concerning the last Vision is the preamble for
this that follows, for here the Son of God whose eyes were like a flame of
fire; and his feet like fine brass, says he will show unto the man greatly
beloved, that which is noted in the Scripture of truth, which is the
Revelation, the sayings of which are faithful and true, that there is none, or
but one, that holds with him in these things, which is the true
Interpretation of the Scripture, but MICHAEL our Prince of Great Britain and
Ireland, that fights and contends with the Enemies of the Lord, about his Body,
disputing with them, have transubstantiated and changed the truth of God into a
lie, worshipping and serving the Creature more then the Creator, for which
cause God gave them up, etc.

Now follows that that is noted in the Scripture of that Prince. After the
Temple of God was opened in Heaven, wherein was seen the Arc of his
Testament, overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden Pot that had
Manna, and ARONS Rod that budded, and the Tables of the Covenant, And over it
the Cherubins of glory, covering the Mercy-Seate, and Lightnings and voices,
and Thunders, etc. This is the Millitant Church that brought forth the
Man-child, the word of God, caught up unto God, and to his Throne, after which
the Woman fled into the Wilderness, where she was fed A thousand two hundred
and threescore days, which are so many years.

The first account begins from the destruction of Jerusalem, when the
abomination of desolation, did stand in the Holy place, the years being the
same spoken in the last Vision of the Prophet DANIEL, though thirty years be
taken away, because the Court without the Temple was left out, given unto the
Gentiles, for the Reign of the first Christian Emperor.

These years do reach to the days of those blessed Men, when the light of
the Gospel did first begin to shine, after the great Mist, lasting a Thousand
two hundred and ninety years, days of darkness and gloominesse of Clouds,
and thick Mists, when the third part of the Sun was smitten, and the third
part of the Moon, and the third part of the Stars, which are innumerable;
After these days were past, there was war in Heaven, MICHAEL and his
Angels, fought against the Dragon, and the Dragon fought, and his Angels the
Jesuits, and prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in Heaven.

Heaven is here taken in this place for the Church of God, the fray is fought
by seconds, by MICHAEL is meant King JAMES; The Dragon needs little exposition,
It is the Pope, for MICHAEL overcame by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
testimony of so many Bishops, and other faithful, crowned with the Glory of
Martyrdom; Therefore rejoice ye Church of God, ye Congregations of the
faithful, and ye Professors that dwell amongst them, and woe to the Earth and
to the Sea, the Congregation of that Sinagogue the Sea of Rome, Satan's seat,
where Satan dwells, for the Pope, the Dragon, the Devil is amongst you,
having great wrath, because he knows he has but a short time, two woes are
past, and behold the third woe comes shortly.

Blessed are the Dead that dye in the Lord, for they rest from their labors,
and their works follow them, and this is the truth noted in the Scripture of
Truth, of MICHAEL, And God make the name and Throne, of the King his Son,
better, and greater then his.

Though I owe no defense for the name of an Angel given to a Mortal man (in
this Prophecy) yet to satisfy as well the Envious as the Ignorant, they shall
find the Son of God sometimes called by the name of the first ADAM, DAVID
who shall feed his Flock like a Shepherd, and gather his Lambs with his
arm, and carry them in his bosom, styled a man after Gods own Heart; and in
another place from his own Mouth, holding it no derogation to his Divine
Nature, to apply to himself by Parables the properties of an austere Master, a
Cruel usurer, or the unjust Judge, May by the same Authority give the name of
MICHAEL, or like unto God in some respects unto this Prince who fought the
battle of the Lord, more like an Angel then a Mortal Man; as to the other
the name of Dragon, because he spoke as a Dragon.

As this young Dragon has acted his part, his Syer or Damme the old Dragon,
his marks may not be forgotten, whose Horns have been formerly mentioned in
a Miter and Diadem, his seven Heads are so many Rulers, as it were Husbands or
several sorts of Magistracy, governing that Commonwealth, and the seven
Crowns are seven Hundredth years, being the time from Romes foundation to
the first Emperor. Equaeua polo, Eterna, Antiqua, Caput Mundi, Celsa. Deum

DANIEL. CHAP. XI. DARIUS THE MED. -- I DREAMED THVS.
BEsides this Prince of victorious and blessed memory, who came to help the
King of Kings, that sat upon the white Horse, whose name is the word of God,
to fight the Battle in Heaven against the Prince of the Kingdom of Persia,
here is an other of like happy memory, that has the Honor to have his name
Recorded in this holy ancient Prophecy, CONSTANTINE the Great, named, DARIUS
the Mede, reigning thirty years. In the first times of which renowned
Monarchy the Lord stood to confirm and strengthen him After whose time three
Kings stood up together in Persia, dividing the Empire, which breach, made way
for the fourth, the fourth Beast, corrupted with Riches and liberty; Far
richer then they all, By whose strength through his riches, Christian Princes
were stirred up against MAHOMET, growing not a little great by their ruins.

And a mighty King shall stand up, the great King of Tire, the absolute Monarch
thereof, and all the dependences Northward, that shall rule with great
dominion, and do according to his own will, and when he shall stand up the
fundamental Laws of his Kingdom shall be broken and infringed; And the
Kingdom shall be divided toward the four winds of Heaven, and not to his
posterity, nor according to his Dominion which he ruled, for this Kingdom
shall be plucked up, even for others, besides those that were planted therein;
his natural subjects by a dispensation being freed from their oath of
obedience.

Caroli Magni Christianissimi Romanorum Imperatoris Corpus hoc conditum est
sepulchro.

After this the King of the South was strong, and he was strong above the King
of the North, and he had dominion, and his Dominion is a great dominion.

These two Kings, the King of the North, and the King of the South parting the
ten Horns, the Princes of Tire and Ethiopia; In the end of years they shall
join themselves together, for the Kings Daughter of the South shall come to
the King of the North to make an agreement, but she shall not retain the
power of the Arm, neither shall he stand nor his Arm, or they shall be
Childlesse, and she shall be given up, And they that brought her sent away
destitute of a Father, and for saken of her Brother.

But out of a branch of her roots, which are her Father and her Mother,
signifying their Incestuous Marriages, One shall stand up in his Estate very
hardy, and shall come with an Army, and shall enter into the fortress of the
King of the North, or the King of Tire, and deal against them and prevail;
And shall carry Captives into Egypt, their Gods and their Prnices, and with
their Precious Vessels of Silver and Gold, and he shall continue more years
then the King of the North in the Monarchy; So the King of the South, or the
King of Ethiopia shall return into his own Land, the Land of Dust and Ashes,
where his worst Enemies do not envy his quiet possession: But his Sons who
succeeded each other in the Monarchy, shall be stirred up against the King of
the North, and shall assemble a great multitude of Forces, and one of them
shall certainly come and overflow with a flood of Fury, and shall pass
through, and prevail against them of the Holy Covenant; but after that he
shall return and be stirred up, even to his Fortress or best Fenced place by
them.

And the King of the South, or one of these Brothers shall be provoked with
Choler, and shall come forth and fight with the King of the North, who shall
set forth a great multitude, but the multitude shall be given into the hands
of his Enemies, and himself shall be his Prisoner carried a Captive into
Ethiopia.

And when the King of the South, or this Persian King has taken away the
multitude, his heart shall be lifted up against God; and he shall cast down
many of his servants Ten Thousands; but neither he nor those that come after
shall be strengthened thereby.

(For at the end of Years, which are now expired, there shall certainly come
a King of the North, and he shall set forth a multitude greater then the
former, a great Army and with much riches, and he shall do according to his
own will, etc.)

And in those former days there shall many stand up against the King of the
South; also the Robbers of the Christians, these Extortioners shall exalt
themselves, to establish the Vision of the Prophets, and the Figures of the
Law, which Prophesied until JOHN; for the first things that are but shadows,
are now vanished away, to establish the second, but they shall fall, So the
King of the North shall come and cast up a Mount, and take the most fenced
Cities; and the Arms of the South shall not withstand, neither his chosen
People, neither shall there be any strength to withstand, But he that comes
against him, shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before
him; and he shall stand in the glorious Land which by him shall be consumed;
He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole Kingdom,
and upright ones with him; thus shall he do.

And he shall give him the Daughter of Women, or a Queen by decent, whose
Royal blood was corrupted, and stained by the usurping authority of a Tyranous
Husband, but she shall not stand on his side, neither before him, for he dying
she was brought home, and shortly after Married to another,

After which agreement dissolved, and the League broken, his Successor shall
turn his face unto the British Isles, and shall take many Prisoners, but a
Prince for his own behalf, rather then the honor of God of a happy daring
shall cause the reproach offered to cease without his own reproach, he caused
the shame to turn upon him that opposes and exalts himself above all that
is called God. The Lord sometimes providing the remedy before the sore, as
careful Physicians have Drugs in store for all diseases, preparing the
disobedience of VASTHI, and the unlawful divorce, for the preservation of the
Jews, to hang proud HAMMON and all his wicked Sons, so this Prince throwing
under foot his Cappe of Maintenance (whose visage was unmasked, by a Munke not
long before) those Babel Monasteries, unmeet Cages for such Craignes,
Ostriges, and chanting Owls, digesting not only all the thorney. Choking
Heresy of false Prophets, but the rusty Purgatory fictions of Heathen Poets,
The doings of these unclean and hateful birds, Though as the eating of doung
I loathe them in my Mouth, yet since our Savior and Lord himself vouchsafed
to cast his Eye toward those secret privy places, bidding us take heed of
their Deserts, I may not stop my Nose or Mouth for niceness, but rather think
it my part to empty such houses of office, it weakness did not prevent and
hinder my willingness.

Yet with mine own hand according to my might (God willing) I will throw one
stone at this Thracian Witch, the wicked Prophet; If I cannot break his head,
I will break his Harp if I can, before he pass headlong down to Hell the
stream: Neither will omit her Holiness (though her native Soil and Sex may
challenge some favor) how they shall walk then, Inseparably hand in hand
together; And as certain of their own Poets mention, her untimely Death,
stung by the false Scorpion, that lurked so close in the grass, of his
gamesome villainy.

This Beast (or rather Devil) for so he seems by his description, by the
stamping of his Ox feet. Long teeth of Iron, nails of Brass, and ten
Horns, or at least some horrible Monster in his likeness, takes upon him to
give, by his Mark to all the world most cursed Dispensations: To please HEROD
it shall be lawful to Marry his Daughter to her Husbands own Brother, the
Uncle to his Niece: Thus unnatural he is not satisfied in most prodigious
manner to abuse himself, but others must do Incestuously by his Example.
These vomited things, are now savory meat, neither can Satan, cast out
Satan: Then it is granted they can Err, which Cunning lesson had he not
learned of his lying Father, his Kingdom long since, had been divided and
broken in pieces. Be it never so unlawful, like the Law of the Medes and
Persians, the Decree may not be changed.

Thus out of the sentences of the holy Scripture, this Spider sucks sometimes
his poison, saying in his Heart, All the Kingdoms of the Earth are mine, My
Father the Devil has given them unto me, and rather of my Estate then abate a
button; I will teach men as many lies to damn them, as we can both invent,
that with the breath of my Mouth I blow in and out the fire of Purgatory, where
People believe some Souls are blood-raw, others roasted to death, that I make
the Creator, sacrifice and sell their Savior, which puts me in mind of Judas
my Brother, whose hanging I could heartily lament, had he not like a
passionate fool, so ill played his last part.

Admit of his weakness he did repent, is a wise man the Trumpet of his own
shame? to say he had Erred to be his own accuser, what did he gain by this;
some say forsooth, This Confession of friends and foes, might be, to leave the
subtle Elders, and their generation the Jews, without excuse, though we eat
both of one Sop, I like not the Example, I mean the manner; It is old and
weak, and lame Arguments will follow fast enough; Idle Confessions, are no
secrets to me, I like not his tragical speech, it was timorous, had it been
by boasting, scoffing, or to advance his service, as it proved carnest, more
might be said in his defense. I do the same my self: but let it pass, my
plot was no pen to blot his name, and had it prevailed, the fire is witness,
his frailty had never flowne so far.

When I call to mind my predecessors, no small puff can blow my pride down,
shall I degenerate, or not follow their steps, JUDAS the Apostle, and IULIANUS
the Emperor, no Ringleaders of that Nazaren poor Sect, that leave the
certain Bliss of this world, to believe 0253 200 Scripture promises made to
the Fathers had I been in their days, though they were courageous, both
faithless, and false enough, I can lift my heel as high as theirs, I had gone
before them in their own craft.

Yet since it was not remorce of Conscience, but the ungrateful answer of the
chief Priests, and all his hopes frustrate, this cast the Man away, my Pardon
as beneficial to him as to others, shall cost him nothing, this accident upon
that ill advised answer: WHAT IS THAT TO us LOOK THOU TO THAT, was the first
motive that made me coin Absolution, which passes now for current Silver,
being all the Fees the desperate Traitors get of me toward their hanging,
this ditch-water I give the poor souls for Aqua-vitae, when they go to the
Gallows.

If some will say this stone is cast too far, I say but a Dream of like, or
less horror, would have started, or as thoroughly awakened themselves to behold
so great a Tyrant, a Prince so gracious and good, his Kingdom with so much
pride, and spitefully invaded; All his natural Subjects become disobedient
Rebels, except a Remnant of some few, forsaking their lives, that loved not
their lives to the Second Death, suffering for their loyalty and love
inexpressible, fiery exquisite bloody torments, his Citizens amongst whom he
Inhabited, with one voice Crying out all at once. Away with this Man, saying,
we will not have this Man to reign over us, himself (o gentle Dove) dumb as
a Sheep before the sheerer, hanged by the hands as an offscouring, set up
like a Mark for an Arrow, reviled, made a derision, as their Music, to his
People, sweating drops of blood down to the ground, the bars of sorrow
preventing the passage of Tears, (all in vain) in so strong and Agony, more
for grief and anguish of them and their Children? then his own fear, of
those unspeakable pains and torments, Crying with a loud voice, unable to
conceal that passion, MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE THOU FORSAKEN ME, my tongue
cleaves to my jaws, thou have brought me into the dust of death through his
tender Mercy, shedding from his pierced side, blood from the wound, for a
sensible Testimony of a true Sacrifice, and water to Baptize and wash them,
whose hard hearts could not weep for themselves. He wiste the Spirit of the
Lord, was departed from him.

Stones rent, the Earth quaking, not Ghosts walking, but Graves opening, and
dead Bodies amazed, and awaking, The whole Globe Mourning in Sable blackness,
except Man, at the dreadful Funeral of this most mighty Prince; The Son as
Chief, covering and hiding his astonished face, with hideous Clouds, as
black as Sackcloth of hair, to utter the height and depth of silent speaking
sorrow, by whose dark veil and train the shadow of Death, turning the Day to
Night, wherein all Creatures are a Corpse, and the world but a Tomb, detesting
and abhorring his Beams of light should bear witness, the true light of Men,
by mankind was so ungratefully and unkindly extinguished, the express Pure
Image of the Maker, the Prince of life, The Person of God, (not made) turned to
a lump of Clay, by a shameless accusation, an unjust sentence, and a cursed
Executoner. To Slay these Lords that have dominion over us, he pulled the
house down upon his own head, the mighty deliverer of Israel.

His God head and death being Incompatible, choosing rather to forgo, and
forsake the one, then forget his promise, leave the will of his Father undone,
or his work unfinished; His sufferings being by a vacancy of Power, as
sometimes cold, may abate and abolish the sense of feeling, yet retained by the
vital parts, the loss is not irrecoverable.

Whose Heart would not melt, Hair stare, and Hands become faint, to write or
hear such a story.

Yet here is not an end, what shall he do, now chased as a Bird between
Heaven and Earth since his resurrection, pulled by Bitts to pieces, thrown to
hungry Hell hounds, the Devils Dogs, Caniballs; did not his power to deliver
his Darling, surmount the greedy arrogant policy of these Barbarians; spoken
without aggravation both one Spaune, acting (in their Copes, I might say, party
colored fools Coats) like painted Peacocks, the part of HECUBA, the
frantic Troyan Wives and POLLIXINA; Such pomp and gaudinesse of Masking
garments, being fitter for the Theator then the Temple, the state thereof
requiring rather Mourners with all their BACCUS Savage Ceremonies, apish and
affected Fashions, No Vice on a Stage, with senseless jests to move the
vulgars laughter, good folks ashamed; So rediculous, without understanding
babbling like Parrots or Children, a Tongue they know not; yet no Babes or
Children in Malice, Pyping without distinction; Pricketh not this the hearts
of the hearers, twanging upon a Harp, Instead of an Egg, asking a Scorpion;
and saying Amen to any Paternoster.

Is there any sorrow like this, whose Mirth is so great; whose heart so hard,
as not to be greeved for this affliction; can we forbear to bow our selves,
and not to Travel for these pains; To hear the Arc not only is taken, but
help Lord alas, to see the Heir apparent of the living God so dishonored and
mangled amongst his Enemies! O the wonder of wonders, a lying Wonder, to see
creatures endued with sense and reason, believe a senseless Miracle; here is
the Doctrine or spirits of Devils, three unclean spirits, Three Frogs forged
one like another, or a false lie spit up by the Devil, the Beast, and the
false Prophet from their unclean slimy Mouths, Into the Ovens and kneading
Troughs of the Kings of the Earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to
the Battle of the great Day of God Almighty; Also to decide the question) with
full consent) when this doctrine working miracles was coniured up. When
Transgressors are come to the full; the water dried up, that the way of the
Kings of the East might be prepared; The Tartars whose look is more stout
then his fellows. Righteous art thou o Lord, which art, which wast, and shall
be, because thou have judged thus; for they have shed the Blood of Saints and
Prophets; and thou have given them up to blaspheme the God of Heaven, to
believe a lie, false teachers that teach, thou have given them Blood to drink;
the Blood of the living God, as it were the Blood of a Dead man; here is a sore
lie, a grievous Soar, well may such mad Dogs gnaw their Blistered Tongues.

Then shall stand up in his estate, a raiser of Taxes in the glory of the
Kingdom; but in few days he shall be destroyed in the strength of his Age,
neither in anger, nor in Battle, but in a sport of Tilting by a splinter in
his Eye.

And in his estate shall stand up a vilde person, or a Luxurious, to whom they
shall not give the honor of the Kingdom, but he shall come in peaceably and
obtain the Kingdom by Flattery; and with the Arms of a Flood, or as the
sudden inundation of Nilus; so shall the Faithful people be overflowne from
before him, they shall be broken by a cruel Massacre, yea, also the Prince of
the Covenant, and after the league made with him, even the Great King of the
North, he shall work deceitfully with the holy people; for he shall come up
and shall become strong with a small people, he shall enter peaceably even upon
the fattest places of the Province, for he shall do that which his Fathers
have not done, nor his Fathers Fathers, he shall scatter among them the prey,
spoil and riches of the wicked; yea, and he shall forecast his devices
against the strong Holds of Satan for a time, not to the End; And he shall
stir up his Power and his great Courage against the King of the South with a
great Army, and the King of the South shall be stirred up to Battle with a
very great and mighty Army, but he shall not stand for they shall forecast
devices against him; yea, his own Dogs (styled Gods) that feed of the Portion
of his meat shall destroy him.

After whose decease his Army shall overflow, and many of the righteous shall
fall down slain, and both these Kings hearts shall be to do mischief, and
they shall speak lies against the known truth, both at one Table, but it
shall not prosper; for yet the end of all things shall be at the time
appointed, Then shall he return into his own Land with great riches, and
little profit; and his heart shall be against the holy Covenant; therefore the
next blow was at the heart. And he shall do exploits, and return to his own
Land.

At the time appointed, he shall return even the King of the North spoken of
before, that should certainly come after certain years with a great Army, and
a multitude greater then the former with much riches, and shall come toward
the South, but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter; for he shall
wound as it were his own sides. The Ships of Shittim shall come against him;
therefore he shall be grieved and return against his own strength, and have
indignation against the holy Covenants; So he shall do; he shall return, and
have intelligence with them that forsake the holy Covenant; these Ships built
with precious Wood, whose Anchor is the Lord, tossed too and fro with floods of
ungodly men in the Sea of Babylon, and compassed with the Waves of death; but
when they cry unto the Lord, and are at their wits end. He who walks upon
the Sea, draws nigh unto them, and brings them out of their distress; he
makes the storm a calm, as a Child, even so suddenly he stilleth the
roaring Waves of this Tempestious Sea, lifted up with the stormy winds of
Satan's malice.

Therefore thus says the Lord unto Tyrus, O thou that art Situate at the
entry of the Sea; which art a Merchant for the People for many Isles. Thus
says the Lord God; O Tyrus thou have said, I am a perfect beauty. Thy Borders
are in the midst of the Seas, thy buildings have perfected thy beauty; they
have made all thy Ship Boords all of Fur Trees of Senir; they have taken
Cedars from Libanan, to make Masts for thee; of the Oaks of Bashan have they
made thine Oars; the Company of the Ashurites have made thy Benches of Ivorie,
brought out of the Isles of Chittim; Fine Linen with broydered work from
Egypt, was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy Sail, Blew and Purple
from the Isles of ELISHAH, was that which covered thee, etc.

And Armies of the ungodly shall stand on his part; they shall pollute the
Sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily Sacrifice, and shall place
therein the abomination, that makes the house of God desolate, turning it into
a Den of Thieves (the daily Sacrifice, or the Lords Supper shall be taken away
to place the Devils Idol, the Supper of the Lord, instituted in remembrance
of our Redemption; as the Passover was a Commemoration that the Lord passed
over the houses of the Children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the
Egiptians and delivered them. DAVID a man after Gods own heart, poured out unto
the Lord, the Water of Bethelem, that he so sore longed to drink, the blood of
Mortal men, that went in jeopardy of their lives, yet damned people are told
they drink of God our Lord JESUS CHRIST his heart-blood. Showing themselves
more thirsty after it, then the greedy Jews, these blood-suckers will have it
before his side be pierced.

And such as do wickedly against the Covenant, to break the Commandments of
God, the vow, vowed in their Baptism, by which they forsake the Devil; with
all the Covetous and Carnal desires of the flesh; these unclean vilde persons
shall be corrupted by flatteries, and easily drawn from the truth, to believe
a lie, that they may be damned, that has pleasure in unrighteousness, but
the People that know God and fear him, shall be strong, he shall cover their
heads in the day of Battle, and they shall do exploits, yet they that
understand among the People, and their Teachers that instruct them; these shall
fall by the sword, and by flame and imprisonment, and by spoil of their goods
many days; yet fear none of these things, for he that neither slumbers nor
sleeps, will arise and take his own quarrel into his hand, and you shall be
helped with a little help; Therefore trust not in multitude of Forces, neither
them that will cleave to you with flatteries, for they will work deceitfully,
as they have done in former times, nor expect a final end of these
persecutions, Satan will sift, the tail corn is his own. If they call the
Master of the house BEELZEBUB, what respect can ye look for that are of the
household. And in the King shall do according to his will, and he shall exalt
himself and magnify himself above every God, and shall speak mavelous
things against the God of Gods, great words against the most High, and shall
wear out the Saints of the Most high, and think to change times and Laws,
and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished, for that, that is
determined shall be done, Neither shall he regard the God of his Fathers, nor
desire of Women, neither shall she retain the power of the Arm, being a
branch of vngrafted Roots; nor regard any God, but shall magnify himself
above all; In his estate he shall honor the God of Forces and Battle, being
terrible to the servants of God and his Enemies; a God that his fore fathers
knew not; or an Altar shall he honor with Gold and Silver, and with Precious
stones, and pleasant things; thus shall he do in the most strong holds with
this God, a stranger for many years to the Apostles and their followers, whom
he shall acknowledge and increase with glory; and he shall cause in stead of
Shepherds, Dogs and Wolves, in sheepskins, to rule over many, as Lords over
Gods heritage, and they shall not only devide the Land for filthy lucre, but
make Merchandises of men's Consciences. But if GOD spared not the Angels, what
shall become of these cursed Children, that have not only lost the Flock, but
gone astray and run away themselves, following the way of BALAM the Son of
BOZER, who loved the wages of unrighteousness, having eyes full of Adultery;
even when they speak their great swelling words of Vanity and Absolution; at
that time they allure to the Lusts of the Flesh, and much Wantonness, leading
simple women into Captivity, promising liberty, that are themselves the
servants of Corruption, wallowing in the Mire like filthy Swine to cleanse
themselves by wresting the Scriptures to their own destruction, licking up
again the unsavory meat themselves could ill digest not long ago, and
running down headlong into the deep Lake of Fire and Brimstone, whose latter
end is worse then their beginning; it had been better for these men to have
continued Heathens as they were at first in the pollutions of the world, then
after they have known the way of righteousness, to turn from it, crucifying
the Son of God afresh, and putting him to open shame.

And at the time of the End shall the King of the South push at him, with all
his Spanish Pikes, and the King of the North shall come against him like a
whirlewinde, with Chariots and with Horsemen, and with many Ships, The Lord of
Hosts send them Victory; and he shall enter into the Countries, and shall
overflow and pass over; he shall enter also into the glorious Land Domina
gentium, and many Countries shall be overthrown; but these shall escape out of
his hand, even Edom and Moab, and the chief of the Children of AMMON his
Confederates, he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the Countries, and the
Land of Egypt shall not escape; But he shall have powers over the Treasures of
Gold and of Silver, and over all the Precious things of Egypt, and the Libians
and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps. But tidings out of the East and out
of the North shall trouble him, therefore he shall go forth with a great fury
to destroy and utterly to make away many; And he shall plant the Tabernacles
of his Cedars Palace between the Seas in the glorious holy Mountain; yet he
shall come to his end, and none shall help him.

Therefore take up a lamentation for the King of Tyrus, whose Cedars are for
the building of both Houses; and say thou have been in EDEN the Garden of GOD;
every precious Stone to garnish the foundation was thy Covering, the Ruby, the
Topaz, and the Diamond, the Berill, the Onix, the Jasper and the Sapphire, these
things were prepared for thee. Thou art anointed the Cherube that Covers,
thou wast upon the holy Mountain of GOD, and thou have walked up and down in
the midst of the Stones of Fire: but because thou have lifted up thy heart,
and said; I am GOD, I have subdued three Kings. I sit in the midst of the
Seas, and have defiled thy sacred Houses, I will bring thee to Ashes, and none
shall help thee. As I live, says the Lord, I will even do according to thine
anger, and according to thine Envy, which thou have used out of thy hatred
against them, and I will make my self known amongst them, when I have judged
thee, and thou shall know that I am the Lord, and that I have heard all thy
Blasphemy, which thou have spoken against the Mountain of Israel, Saying,
they are laid desolate by Massacre, they are given us to consume by the sword;
thus with thy mouth thou have Boasted against Me, therefore shortly when the
whole Land of Israel rejoices, I will make thee desolate, then thou shall
know that I the LORD do Sanctify Israel, when my Sanctuary shall be in the
midst of them for ever.

Therefore, o King of the North, arise from thy Throne, lay thy Royal Robe
aside, and cause a Decree through Tyrus to be published; saying, Let them turn
every one from his evil way, and from the violence or unnatural shedding of
Blood, that is in their hands, etc. Who can tell if GOD will turn and repent,
and turn away from his fierce anger, that we go not into Perdition.

DANIEL. CHAP. XII. JAMES, CHARLES -- ARE MICHAELSS.
AND at that time shall MICHAEL stand up, the great Prince that defends the
Faith, CHARLES King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, which stands for
the faithful Children of our Nation, the Saints of the most Highest. As the
Angel of God, so is my Lord the King, to discern good and bad; therefore the
Lord thy God will be with thee for ever.

And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a
Nation, even to that same time, blessings and great felicities, being for the
most part accompanied with Corrections, and extraordinary Calamities; Devotion
and Religion of happiness, in this life the Highest, not exempt from
superstition and heresy; And at that time thy People shall be delivered;
Every one whose name is found written in the Book, etc.

AL TRVTHS CAESAR.

Behold the Lord is at the Door, as a man come from a far journey; All that
sleep in the Dust of the Earth, shall hear his voice and awake, and come
forth, those that have done good to the Resurrection of life; These have their
part in the first Resurrection, and those that have done evil unto the
Resurrection of Damnation. Then the Angel came down from Heaven, having taken
from the false Prophet the Key of the Bottomless pit, having in his hand a
great Chain, he shall next lay hold on the Dragon the Devil; and he shall
be bound a Thousand years, or one day, which is all one with the Lord; he
shall shut him up, and set a Seal upon him, for the wrath of the Lord that
day, shall be a sufficient mark that the Nations be deceived no more.

This Thousand years is the great day of the Lord, to pour out his wrath and
just indignation upon his Enemies; But the wise Virgins with Palms in their
hands, that have not been deceived by the subtilty or force of flatterers,
shall shine in their Robes, as the brightness of the Firmament; Kings
Daughters attended by honorable Matrons, as Stars for ever and ever,
prepared for the Bridegroomes Marriage, whose Wife the Bride and Queen, has
made her self ready clothed in fine Linen clean and white, arrayed in a
Garment of Needleworke wrought with Gold of Ophier, the Daughter of Tire shall
be there with a Gift; she shall be brought to the King, with gladness and
rejoicing, they shall enter into his Palace, saying, O King, thy Throne is for
ever and ever, thou love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God
thy God annoint thee with gladness above thy fellows.

After this Thousand years the great Day of the solemnity finished, the Bride
being safe in her closset and Marriage chamber, Satan the old Serpent shall
be loosed a little season, as Prisoners are set at liberty when they go to
the place of Execution to receive his final sentence of everlasting Damnation;
yet hoping in his vain imagination and heart that cannot repent to deceive the
Nations that are at rest, to take a prey, to go up to the City that is in
safety that needs no Wall, neither the light of the Sun or the Moon, etc.

Unto whom the just Judge from his Throne of Glory with a terrible look, for
fury, jealousy shall come up into his face, shall say unto him; Art thou he
whom I have spoken of in old time by my servants the Prophets to give the
Nations warning of thee, how thou did not only like a fool deceive thy
self, when thou said, I will ascend up and be like the most highest, but
like a cursed creature did deceive their innocent Parents, be prepared
therefore, and prepare thy self and all thy Company, and see whether thou
can be a guard unto them; or what defense they can make for themselves who
could not be ignorant, and ought not to be careless, because by mine own
Mouth I gave them warning, that after many days thou should be visited and
brought a Prisoner into the Land which is now brought back from the Sword and
cleansed, though it lay waste a time, and the Villages thereof unwalled. For
these I commanded them straightly to watch both concerning the things I
foretold them should come to pass; as also of this hour, lest like a Thief,
or as the Flood came upon their forefathers the Ungodly, they should be
surprised unawares, because I told you of these things before depart, I know
ye not, nor that Captain your false Prophet, are ye those that eat my flesh
and drink my blood, whence are ye, I never knew you more, then you knew mine,
or Me; cursed and deformed crew, with stiff necks, double crooked hearts,
deaf Adders, and blind People with eyes, go ye cursed into everlasting fire.

We have eaten and Drunk in thy presence, all the world was taxed by the
Prince of our Nation; and thou have taught in our streets; Their iniquity is
the greater, thrust them out. Lord, Lord, come out Dogs and Swine, Apes and
Satiers, hence here all Liars, Scoffers at the truth, unclean persons, for
here shall enter in no wise any thing that defiles, neither whatsoever works
Abomination, or makes a Lie, but they which are written in the Lambs Book of
Life.

But thou o DANIEL, shut up the words, and seal up this Book to the time of
the end; Now that the whole world might take notice, and discern when this
Sealed Prophecy shall be opened, the time is more then once repeated, even at
the time is more then once repeated, even at the time of the end, when the King
of the South shall push at the King of the North, and the King of the North
shall come against him like a Whirle-winde, for till then, though many shall
run too and fro by the Art of Navigation, discovering an other Hemisphere,
Sailing by the Compass and the Needle, found out by expert men, and knowledge
increased, furnishing Magnificent Libraries with printed Books, By which two
Arts, chiefly the Gospel shall be published to all Nations; yet the Character
of this Book shall not be read, till the time of the end; which time is easy
to be known, even without the Notice of the years closed up in this Book;
where Eagles are gathered together, you suppose some Carcass to be there: The
Figtree, when her Branch is yet tender, and puts forth her leaves, ye know
that Summer is near; Jerusalem when it was compassed with Armies, the
Desolation was nigh. In like manner, when ye see these things come to pass
foretold you, know the end is nie, even at the door; But of the day and hour
knows no man, no not the Angels that are in Heaven; neither the Son but
the Father; the account in this Book of note, being by Centuries of years.

Then I DANIEL looked, and behold there stood other Two; the two Olive Trees,
the Tree of Life, either of them bearing Twelve manner of Fruits, the Two
Witnesses into whom, after Three days and a half, the Spirit of Life from God
entered; and they stood upon their feet. The one on this side of the bank of
the River; and the other on that side of the bank of the River; The fou^dations
of the wall of the City, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone.

And one said to the man clothed in Linen, that was upon the waters of the
Rivers, that cried with a loud voice, as when a Lion Roareth; Lord will thou
at this time restore again the Kingdom of Israel, how long shall it be to
the end of these wonders, or tell us when these things shall be, and what
shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world.

And he held up his right hand and his left hand to Heaven, showing his
Resurrection and Ascension, and swear by him that Lives for ever and ever,
Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but my Word shall not pass, neither this
froward generation; this Nation till all these things be done spoken of by my
Mouth and the Prophets; there be some standing here, which shall not taste of
Death, till they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom, his servants
will fight for him. So shall even all my words be fulfilled.

It is not for you to know the times and seasons which the Father has put in
his own power; But go thou thy way and rest, and stand in the Lot. Seal up
those things which the Seven thunders uttered, and write them not, it shall be
for a time and times and half, then all these things shall be finished, as a
Hen gathers her Chickens, or as a scattered Army in that day the Holy
People shall be gathered together, in the mean time many shall be purified
and made white by the fiery Trial; The wicked shall do wickedly, and shall
not understand, but the wise, it is given unto them to understand the mysteries
of the Kingdom of Heaven.

And from the time that the daily Sacrifice shall be taken away, or the
yearly Passover by the destruction of Jerusalem, to place the Abomination
that makes desolate; there shall be a Thousand Two hundred and Ninety days;
Here is the Measure of the Temple, and the Altar, and them that worship
therein; And here is also the breach of the first Commandments, spoken of by
our Lord; the abomination that makes desolate not only the Sanctuary but the
City; the first ripe Apples that hang so high against the Sun; The Devil
thought if he could reach these, the rest were his own; therefore to pluck
them down in the primitive times, he began to rear his Ladder in the holy
Places to set up his plurality, adding the Images of living Mortal men to be
worshipped with Divine honor, and vain supplications, as if themselves were
present, making no doubt, having no egresse and regresse in time to bring his
own amongst them into the number, in which expectation he failed not much;
for who is this here, that sits in the Temple of God, as if there were Two
Gods, besides his PIGMALION-like Image; the parts of which are seldom cold,
if there be heat in the Kisses of such holy People.

The swiftness of time is such, I cannot gather all the Spices and dropping
Myrrh of this Tree, I can fix no longer speaking what manner God will sit
alone in his holy Temple, abhorring not only the people but the place where a
Coleague is joined with him in office; therefore of the next branch.

Suppose a man after his Marriage to a young Virgin, should say, my experience
is more then yours. I cannot always walk hand in hand with you, neither may I
keep you in a Cloister that will not be for your health or my profit, neither
must you forget your Covenant to be subject to my desires not tending to the
harm of either of us; I love you as mine own Body, if I should not love you,
I should not love my self; you are tender and fair without blemish or blot,
so I would have your mind also without spot or wrinckle like your face, many
strangers will strive to be your Servants; not all for your beauty but some
for malice and envy to me: Though your intent be good in all things, yet
because I am very jealous of mine honor, entertain none in that manner; though
they be silent for a time, and conceal themselves, in the end they will draw
your affection from me; Besides, much resort though she be never so chaste, is
dalliance the mark of a known Harlot, which sort of women I would have you
differ from, and no mark I know more fit to put a difference between you then
this; For much entertainment will not only waste our substance, better employed
upon more necessary occasions, but consume time in unprofitable idleness.

Is there no consequent, yes doubtless, I am the Lord thy God, thou shall have
no other Gods but me; thou shall not make Images of any likeness to bow or
humble thy self before them; for of my honor I am a jealous God, you are mine,
I bought you to enjoy the liberty of my service; I brought ye out of the
house of bondage, which no other God could do; thou shall love the Lord thy
God, and keep his charge and his Statutes.

When ye go forth to show the way of truth to other Nations, this spiritual
dalliance, which in the end turns to whoredom, beware of it for it shall be
a mark between them that hate me and you that keep my Comandements; and
though I will not at any time be far from you, yet you shall fall by
Captivity and persecution to spread my name, or for the Trial of your Faith,
when you see their Idolatry pull down their high Places, Preach against them;
say, Little Children, ignorant people that understand not the slights of
Satan; Beware of Idols, tender natures encounter strongest motions; Top-sayles
are first assaulted; No man so well knows his own frailty, as the Lord your
God knows how prone Devotion is to Superstition.

Also when ye go in and out amongst the Heathen folk, or if the Lord give
them into your hands, as the Amalikites were given into the hand of the
Children of Israel, when the Prophet said; what means this bleating in mine
ears; SAUL'S excuse shall not avail you; to say, we set them up for Saints
before the Lord, the Images of JUPITER for Jesus Christ; the Statue of HERCULES
for CHRISTOPHER; VENUS and the little Lad, for the blessed Virgin, as holy as
Scarcrowes in a Garden of Cowcumbers.

You that cannot make one hair white or black, will ye go a Whoring after
your own inventions, to humble your selves before Pageants, Pictures, Images
with eyes that see not, Ears without hearing, etc. More senseless then a
Beast; yet these rare Mamets, the light of the Sun is too dark for them
without Candles; when the Members of Christ go naked, these must be clothed,
not for warmness but for wantonness; and these are the Babyes made and
dressed by the Devil, and decked to please his Children, abhorred, and
abominable in the sight of the Lord.

Lastly, with these lines the Temple of God is Measured, and them that worship
therein. Measuring is for Numbering; place is put for time, and sometimes space
a thousand six hundred furlongs; Signifying the persecution of the Church so
many years, reward her even as she rewarded you. To rise therefore and Measure
the time, begin from the taking away of the daily Sacrifice or the Destruction
of Jerusalem, and count a thousand two hundred and threescore years, wherein
for the absence of the Church in the Wilderness, the two Witnesses did
Prophecy clothed in Sackcloth, so many years of Mists and darkness, to these
must be added some days of fair weather, a hundred forty and four thousand,
amounting to four hundred years and odd, having their fathers name written
in their foreheads, these sing as it were a new song; These are Virgins not
(defiled with women) Chaste conversation, not commanding laciviousnesse, by
forbidding Marriage, waxing worse and worse.

The Temple was not built in a day, it is three Stories; the four hundred
years are to be divided into three several parts, Seventy years and odd,
until the destruction of Jerusalem, when the Apostles finished their
testimony, thirty years are restored for the reign of CONSTANTINE the great,
the remains remain for these last times, being the same eighteen thousand
Measures spoken by EZEKIEL the Prophet, the Measure of the Temple within are
not summed up, I presume not to look into the account, the Measure of it round
about without, I heard the number of them cast up, Eighteen thousand Measures,
every Measure six Cubits, according to the Measure of a man. That is, of the
Angel, three hundred years and odd; and the name of the City from that day
shall be God is there, that said Son of Man, the place of my Throne, and the
place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the
Children of Israel for ever, and my holy Name shall the house of Israel no
more defile, etc.

Blessed is he that waits and comes to the thousand three hundred and five
and thirty years, these are the blessed times of JOHN WICKLIFFE and IOHH Hus,
both famous Martyrs, and burning Lights, set up to show forth the state and
beauty of the truth, one burnt alive, the other after he was dead, being hard
to judge in which of these, the Devil the Father of lies, Antichrist his
crucifying Son, and the Dragon, expressed most malice; from which cursed
triplicitie, three Monsters of the bottomless Pit, God deliver us, who will
give us a Crown of life; Come Lord JESUS, the grace of our Lord JESUS CHRIST
be with you all.

Amen.

Last of all, the whole world is numbered and those that work abomination
therein, and the delights thereof, weighed in the balances, are found lighter
then vanity it self. There is nineteen years and a half to the day of
Judgment, July the 28. M.DC.XXV. Six hundred and threescore Months are
excluded, from this last Age of seventeene hundred years. And I think that I
have also the Spirit of God.

DANIEL.

He that is unjust and filthy let him be so still, and he that is righteous
and holy, let him be so still; for behold he will come quickly, and his
reward is with him. Blessed are they that do his Commandments.
FINIS.
