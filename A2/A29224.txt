To Sir I. P. Baronet.
SIR,
I Send you here an Assize Book, or rather a Treatise of Poisons; to peruse
which, I had not given you the trouble, had not your own commands obliged me
to it: for what my memory faild me of in our last discourse upon this subject
of Heretics, I have, to comply with your desires, turned over those few
Treasuries of Common places wherewith my reading has furnished me. And now
you may behold (...) creeping out of the (...) pit in their o^ders, and hear
all their several tones; for I have according to the o^der of time (...) the
names of all the chief (...) with their positions th^oughout all the
Centuries. Here are none but ^uch as were condemned (...) Gene^all or
Oe^onomicall Councils: No^ is there any Au^hor quoted (...) is not of a
venerable name.

I might have inserted more of (...), but when one (...) another already
condemned, and lick't but up his vomit, I have ^mitt^d him, for ^the^e is a
(...) of tra^^^^gration of Her^sie, which needs no proof to such as live in
this Age, wherein her womb is more fruitful of monsters then Afric.

This Bedroll I submit to your judgment, which is abundantly able to supply
any defect you may find therein.


Capital Heretics in the several Centuries.

5. He denied the R^s^rrection.

II.
CORINTHUs about the year 69.
He is said to be a Jew by birth: he lived at the same time with Saint John the
Ev^ngelist, Irenaeus lib. 3. cap. 3. He taught,

1. That Jesus our Savior had for his P^rents Joseph and Mary, and that at his
Baptism Christ descended on him, who (says he) is called the holy Ghost, by
who^ he did all his Miracles; when Jesus was to be crucified of the Ieues,
then Christ left him, and went up again into H^av^n. Ep^pha^tus Heres^. 28.
H^st. Magdeburge^s. Cent. 1 lib. 2. cap. 5.

Niceph. hist. Eccl. lib. 3. cap. 13.

(...) with her. ^lemens Alex^^dr. lib. 3. (...)

Others taking occasion of this fact of his, thought it Lawful for any man to
have the company of any woman, w^^m they themselves w^u^d like. Against these

we^k, o^ Fridaye could not be saved. Epiph. lib. 2, Tom. 2. her^s. 25. Of
these N (...) S. August. (...) do speak, lib. de H^e^esibus. S. from in

2. He taught with other Heretics that there were two Gods, a good and a bad

3. He said that the Prophets did contradict one another in their Prophesies,
because some of them had the spirit of the good God, and some of the bad,
Eusebius. lib. 5. hist. Eccl. cap 12.

with the Ebionites, and said that it was no sin to deny Christ in the time of
Persecution, if then they did resolve in their Hearts that they would be
constant in the faith of Christ, for God say they, does regard more the Heart
then the tongue. Eusebius. Hist. Eccl. lib. 6. cap. 18.

XVII
MELCHISEDECHIANI Ann. 240.
They thought that Melchisedech was not a mere man, but a Power of God greater
then Christ; because that Christ was of the order of Melchisedech, Psa, 110,
ver, 4: Aug, lib, de haeresi^us et Epiph, Haeres, 55.

XIX.
SABELIUS An. 260. vel. circ.
He was the scholar of Nce^us, these two and Peraxeas, and Hermogenes with
them, did confound both the number and difference of the Persons in the blessed
Trinity: for they defended that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, were but one
Person, who had three names, and who was sometimes called the Father, sometimes
the Son, and sometimes the Holy Ghost. He in the Old Testament as God the
Father did give the Law. He in the new Testament as God the Son was made man,
and died. He in the time of Pen^ecost as God the Holy Ghost came down on the
Apostles. Nic^ph. lib. 6, cap. 26, These Heretics were also called
Patropassiani, because they say that God the Father died for us. Aug. Sermon. 2,
Dominicae post festam Trinitatis.

XX.
SAMOSATENUS, Ann. 273.
He was borne in Syria and followed the Hersies of Cerinthus and Ebion.

beginning in the Womb of the Virgin. Aug. in Catalogo Hereticorum.

2. That the Son of God is not a Person, neither is he eternal as his father
is, nor the substantial word of his father. But is as a word that is uttered
by the mouth, and so passes away with the breath thereof, Philast. de
haeresibus.

Yet this Son of God (says he) was a just man, and by reason of his good life
might be thought rather to have deserved the name of God then any other man.
Niceph. lib. 6, cap. 27.

XXI.
MANES from whom came the Manichies.
He was borne in Persia, he lived at the same time with S^mosatenus.

He said that himself was borne of a Virgin, and that he was both Christ and
the Holy Ghost. The which that he might the better persuade others, he made
choice of 12 of his Disciples and sent them to preach the opinion he
maintained. Eusebius. seb. l. 7, c. 28. The Doctrine of the Manichies was
compounded of many old haeresies. As

1. That the soul of man is either the substance of God, or of the substance
of God.

2. That war is altogether unlawful, and this their opinion made them to
blame Moses for waging war. Aug. lib. 22. contra Faustum. cap. 74.

3. That beasts have not only sense, but reason and understanding as well as
men.

4. That there were two beginnings which are eternal, viz God and Mat^er. the
one (^ay they) is good, the other bad, the one is light the other darkness,
and the Prince of darkness the Devil they call Materiae Principem, i. e. the
Prince of matter.

5. That the body is evil by nature, for it came from the evil beginning, and
so did flesh, and therefore flesh must not be eaten.

6. That the Devil is evil by nature, and so are all other creatures, for
they were made of the bad God, and so bread is the Devils creature, wherefore
it can be no sacrament of the Body of Christ.

7. That Christ was not a true man, nor came out of the Virgins womb, but he
had a fantastical body; for (say they) it is not fit that so great a Majesty,
should pass through the filth that is in a woman's body. Vincentius Lirinensis.

8. That there is no day of Judgment to come.

9. That the old Law is evil.

10. That marriages are unlawful.

11^ That sins come from an evil mind, and therefore cannot be avoided, for
there are two minds in every man, a good and a bad mind.

The good mind they call a reasonable soul, and this they would have to come
from the good God; the bad mind they called the concupisence of the flesh, and
this (say they) came from the bad God, because when sins come from the bad mind
we have not free will to hinder the^.

12. They did not admit of the Old Testament, nor receive the Apostles writings
in the new Testament, but did call their own opinions the Gospel of Christ.
They did also boast of their own particular illuminations from heaven, and
that they could give the Holy Ghost.

Lastly they rejected all civil jurisdiction, affirming that marriage and the
governments of Kingdoms, and of Common wealths were ordained by the evil God.

1. That the Son of God was like unto God in name only, but not in substance.
Philast. de h^^resibus.

2. That the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, are not of the same nature, power,
and Majesty. For the father alone is the invisible God, and he alone is to be
worshipped. The Son may be called God, but he is a created God. He may be called
the Son of God, but he is the Son of God by adoption, and not by nature, for
there was a time when he had no being at all.

2, That the Son of God was the first creature that ever God made, and was made
of those things which have no existence, and is the most excellent, of all
creatures.

3, That the Son of God is the Instrument of God his father, by whom he made
all other creatures, but yet he does not know his fathers Secrets, nor
comprehend his nature and essence.

4, That the Son is not infinite as his father is, for when he conversed in the
world with men he was not then in Heaven with his Father, and that the Kingdom
of the Son of God shall end with the world.

5, That the Holy Ghost is a creature created of the Son of God, and does know
neither the nature or secrets either of the Father or of the Son, but is much
inferior in nature and dignity unto them both, and is their Servant and
subject. August. Amb. Athanasius* Basil, Hilar. Hierom. Socrates. Theod.
Niceph. lib. 8, c, 5, 6. Cassiodorus, Tripartit^ hist. lib, 1 c, 12, 13, 14, 15.

XXIII
AERIVS, and the Aerians, anno 342. or near it.
1. They would have no set days of fasting, but they thought it fit that every
one should be left to his own liberty to fast when he himself would, left
they might be said to be under the law and not under grace.

2. They affirmed that Bishops and Priests were not distinguished the one from
the other, but were equal both in degree and authority.

continent and had renounced the world. Epiph. Aug. and Philast. de haeresibus.

XXV
MACEDONIUS, and the Macedonians, Anno. 359, or therabout.
They said that the Son of G^d was like the Father in Substance and in all
things, but that the Holy Ghost was unlike unto the father and Son, and a mere
Creature, yet they preferrd him before the Angels. Russinus lib. 1 hist, Eccl,
cap, 25, Aug, lib, de Haeresibus. cap, 5, 2,

XXVI.
APOLLINARIUS and his followers Anno. 377. or there abouts.
1. That Christ in his Incarnation did a^^ume a body without a Soul, or if he
had a soul, yet it was no reasonable soul, but that God the word was instead
of it.

2. He brought that body wit^ him from Heav^n, and made it of the same
substance with his divine nature, and that this body when it came on the earth
was passible, visible and mortal.

3. That sin is a part of man's essence, and that therefore if Christ had been
a perfect man he must needs have (...) a sinner* Gregor. Nazianz in Epist. ad.
Nectarium. Basil. Epist. 7^. Hi^ron. in Catalogo. Socrates* So^omenus. Ruffinus.

XXVII
PRISCILLIANUS and his followers, Anno 388. or there abouts.
Was a Spaniard, he gathered many Heresies out of the writings of those
Heretics who were before his time.

1. He and they were of opinion (with O^igen) that the souls sinned before
their infusion into the bodies.

2. They thought (with Tatianus and the Encratitae) that the eating of flesh
was an unclean thing.

3. With the Gnostics and the Manichies they made two Gods, one good and
another bad. ut supra.

4. They confounded the Persons of the B. Trinity, with Sabellinus.

5. They were of opinion (with Bardesanes) that every man had his fatal Star,
and that our bodies were compounded according to the operation of the twelve
signs in the Z^diack.

6. They thought it no sin to swear and forswear rather then to reveal the
things they taught. Aug. de Hae^esibus. and Hieron* in Chronico.

He was a Monk at Rome contemporary with S. Ierom, he and his tribe defended.

glory in the life to come, but that all should be rewarded alike in Heaven.

3. That they who have a full and perfect faith when they are regenerate by
Baptism cannot sin any more after Baptis^e.

4. That the B. Virgin was carnally known of her husband Joseph, after the
birth of Christ, Hieron. libris duobus contra Iovinianum. Aug* ut supra*
Aquinas in tractatu contra detrahent. Religion* cap. 6. Sabellicus lib. 9.
Septim* Eneadis.

XXIX
ANTHROPOMORPHITAE.
They lived and set abroach their Heresies at the same time with Iovinian.

1. They thought that Go^ had the form and members of a man, because that God
is said to have made man after his own image and likeness, Gen* 1. 26.

2. They separated themsel^es from the Church because Userers and wicked men
were su^fered therein, ^^eodoretus. lib. 4. Cap 10, Aug. ad quod valt deum
Epiph. Niceph.

HELVIDIUS, and the Helvidians, Anno. 395. or near abouts.
These were at the same time with the Anthropomcrphites, and were called
Antid^comari^ae, because they opposed the perpetual Virginity of the B.
Virgin. Mary the Mother of God; for they affirmed that she had children by
Joseph her Husband after the birth of Christ: and this they would prove Mat, ^,
ver, vSlt where Christ is called the first born Son of the B. Virgin. and John

Heretics in the fifth Century.
PELAGIUS, and the Pelagians. Anno. Dom. 405.
He was borne in Great Britany. He with his Scholars hel^ these Assertions.

1. That the nature of Man after the fall of our first Parents was Good, and
not corrupted, Especially the soul of Man, and therefore Infants were born
without Si^, and needed no Baptism, but yet it was fit that they should be
baptized, that they might be honored with the Sacrament of Adoption.

2. That the lust of the flesh was no Sin, but a Natural good, and that sin was
not propagated unto mankind by generation, but by innitiation only; neither
could Infants Sin, for all Sin, is voluntary.

3. That Sin, is not the Death, but the condition of Nature; Adam then should
have died if he had never sinned.

4. That all men have free will by nature, not only in all natural and
moral, but in all spiritual things.

5. That the beginning of our salvation is in our selves, and we may attain
grace of regeneration in Christ by our natural faculties, if we ask, seek,
and knock for the same.

6. That Faith is a General work of nature, and no special work of Grace,
and perseverance in Faith is in our selves.

7. That the love of God and of our neighbor, and all our Christian Virtues
are of our selves, and not of God.

8. That the prayers of the Church are not necessary, seeing whatsoever we pray
for, we may obtain without Prayer; for God does give his grace unto every one
according to his own (...).

Lastly, that men need ^ot commit any sin except they will themselves.

Aug. lib. de (...) Prosp. de Ingratis. Hilarious Arelatensis. Maxentius cont.
Hormisdam.

XXII.
PREDESTINATI, Ann. 414. or thereabouts.
They had this name given them because in their disputations upon
predestination this was their assertion, viz. good works will do men no good
at all, if by God they be predestined unto death and damnation; neither will
bad works hurt wicked men if by God they be predestined unto eternal life
and Salvation. By which this their assertion they did hinder many men from
doing good works, and did stir up wicked men to heap sin upon sin. Sigibertus
in his Chronicles. Vincentius lib. 19, cap. 5, and Luceburgensis.

XXXIII.
NESTORIUS, and (...) Disciples, about the year 427.
NESTORIUs, Archbishop of Constantinople, and Anastatius his Priest, Theodorus
Mopsuetanus and the rest of that most wicked sect did teach (with Cerinthus)
that the B. V^rgin bare in her womb a mere man, who had only the nature of a
man, and was a man in his person, and that therefore the said Virgin was not
the mother of God, but the Mother of Christ. Neither was the Nativity, Passion,
Resurrection, or Assension of Christ, more then humane, yet (say they) the Son
of God was united unto the Son of man, not substantially, by communicating unto
him his hypostasis or substance, but accidentally, by Habitation, Union,
Operation and Participation. By Habitation, for the Eternal word or Son of God
dwelt in the man Christ as in his Temple, we find himself saying, Dissolve
this Temple, and in three days I will raise it. Ioh. 2, ^9, we have it
p^ophesied of him Esa. 7, 14, They shall call his name Emmanuel. i. e. God with
us, or God dwelling in us. And his best beloved Historiographer records of him.
The word was made flesh and dwelt in us. Ioh. 1. 14. By Union not only of his
will but of his love also; for the Son of Man was united both in his will and
in his love unto the Son of God, they did will and love always the same
things, even as man and wife do, who do love one another.

By Operation, for the Man Christ was always the instrument which the Word or
Son of God did use in the doing of all his great Miracles.

By Participation, because the Son of God did give unto the Son of Man both his
name and dignity, for he would have him to be called both God and the Son of
God, and to be adored of all his creatures, not for his own sake, as he was
the Son of Man, but for his sake who was the Son of God, and who did
communicate unto him both his name and dignity. Socrates. lib. 7, cap. 32.

EUTICHES, and the Eutychiani, An. 443.
He was Abbot of Constantinopl^^ he with his ass^ciates maintained these
Heresies.

1. That in Christ after his incarnation, there was and is but one Nature, and
this one Nature was made of his Divinity and his flesh, by the turning of the
Divinity into the flesh, and this Divinity of Christ was borne, suffered, and
was dead and buried.

2. That the flesh of Christ is not of the same nature with our flesh, neither
was the word or Son of God turned into true flesh, but into flesh in show and
appearance only, so that the word did rather faigne himself a Man, who was
borne and died, then that he was borne and died indeed. For (say they) it stood
not with the Majesty and excellency of God to become true flesh, or to be
borne, to suffer, and to die ind^ed and truth.

THEOPASCHITE, An. 476.
Petrus Gnaphaeus Bishop of Antioch was the author of this heresy. He and his
sect taught that God was crucified, and by God they understood the whole
Trinity. Evagrius lib. 3, cap. 8, and 16, and Theodoret in Collecta^eis.

XX.
MONOPHISITAE.
There were another sect of the Theopaschites, called Monophisitae, because
they affirmed that there was but one Nature of the Word and his flesh, after
the ineffable V^ion thereof, which made them also say (with the first sort) that
God suffered and was crucified. Niceph. lib. 18. cap. 52. and 53.

Heretics in the sixth Century.
XXXVII
APTHORDOCITAE, Ann Do. 5^6 or thereabouts.
They were of opinion that the flesh of Christ took of the Blessed Virgin was
incorruptible before his passion; We (say they) carry about us by necessity of
nature the affections of nature, as Hunger, Thirst, Weariness, Anguish, and
the like, but Christ who suffered of his own acord was not subject to the same
Laws of Nature with us. Niceph. lib. 17. cap. 29. Greg. lib. 10, Epist. 55.

XXXVIII.
SERGIUS, the Author of the Monothelites. Anno 604. vel circ.
The author of the Monothelites, he was Patriarch of Constantinople, and taught
that there were two wills in Christ, a divine and an humane will before the
Union of his natures, but after the Union he had but one will and one nature,
whence it came to pass that the Divinity suffered those things which did
belong unto the humanity, and the humanity did appropriate unto it those things
which did belong unto the Divinity. Niceph. Lib. 18, cap. 54.

XXXIX.
SERGIUS, the Master of Mahomet. An. 630. vel circ.
Some contend that he was the same with the former, but whether he were or
not he was author of two Heresies, the Minothelites and the Mahumetans,
wherefore let him (a^ least his name) shall stand i^ the front of them both. He
was a monk, he embraced, the Heresy of Arius and Nestorius, for which he was
banished. He coming into Arabia fell acquainted with Mahomet the false
Prophet, him he taught to misinterpret many places both in the old and new
Testament, out of which false interpretations of theirs, they did coin a new
Religion, which was neither wholly Christian, nor wholly Jewish, but was
compounded of them both, rejecting in both Religions those things which they
disliked: and this newest Religion is called Mahumetisme. Pomponius Laetus.
Johan. Baptista Egnatius.

He in Arabia among the Hagarenes and Saracens was both a King and a Prophet.

He denied the Trinity with Sabellinus: he said it was ridiculous to think
that Christ was God, and therefore with Arrius and Eunomius he taught him to
be a creature, and with Carpocrates to be an holy Prophet.

He maintained with Cedron that it was impossible that God should have a son
because he had no wife. He denied with the Manichies that Christ was crucified,
but says he, one was cified in his place who was very like him. With the
Originists he will have the Devils to be saved at the end of the world, and with
the Anthropomorphites he will have God to have the form and members of a man,
with Cerinthus he places the chiefest felicity of man in bodily pleasures, and
with Ebion he does admit of Circumcision, and with the Encratitae he forbids
the use of wine. First he says that the Alcoran was made of the Holy Ghost,
and their sins shall never be forgiven who believe it not, as also that
Christians and Jews who contradict it, cannot be saved.

2, In his Alcoran he makes Friday his Sabbath day, permits a man to have
2. 3. or 4. wives, forbids the eating of swines flesh; teaches that beasts
shall rise again at the last day as well as men, and that Baptism is not
necessary. Circumciseth none before they be seven or eight years old.

3. He denies that the Eucharist is to be kept in remembrance of the death of
Christ, for Christ (says He) was not put to Death, but he affirms that this
Eucharist is of God, and that it has great force to confirm those who receive
it reverently in ^aith and good works, as also that they are damned who commit
any great sin after the receiving of it.

He has his religious men, who preach, and expound the Alcoran, who are
called Muphtii, Cadii, and Telemeani.

Mahomets Heaven.
The blessed Mahumetanes he says) shall live under the shadow of the best
trees: they shall be clothed in silk apparel, and adorned with goodly
Rings, Chains, and Bracelets of Gold and precious stones. They shall eat the
sweetest fruits, and the daintiest fowls, and their drink shall be the best
wine, the which shall neither cause drunkenn^sse nor headache, they shall lie on
soft bedds and pillowes, and their bedds shall be covered with the fairest
Tapestry. They shall have to their wives most beautiful Virgins, which shall
cast their eyes on none but their husbands, whom they shall love alone. In these
pleasures shall they live for ever.

Mahomets Hell.
They who believe not the Alcoran shall be punished in Hell, and be there
tormented for ever with Pitch, fire, and Brimstone: they shall eat such meats
as shall put them to great pain, and the drink that they shall drink shall be
made of diverse kinds of fire.

ALBANENSES, An. 796.
He taught,

1. That the old Testament came from an evil God, and the new Testament from a
good God.

2. That God did not create new souls, nor infuse them into men's bodies, but
they went from body to body, viz. so soon as a man dies, his soul goes into
another body, and gives life, sense, and motion unto it.

3. That there is no Resurrection of the Body, and that the general Judgment
is already past.

4. That before the Incarnation of Christ, there was no good man, no not Adam,
Moses, or any of the Prophets.

5. That there are no Hell Torments, but only those that we suffer in this
world.

6. That the world ever was and ever shall be in the same estate that now it is.

7. That God has no prescience of any evil, but comes to the knowledge of it
by the Devil.

P^TRUS de Bruis and HENRICUS, An. 1124. or thereabouts.
Their Scholars were called Petrobusians and Henricia^s.

They taught,

1. That infants can have no good by Baptism because they want reason and
faith to believe the word of God, which is preached unto them.

2. That those infants which are baptized must be baptized again, when they
come to years of discretion.

3. Thirdly that the supper of the Lord is not to be given to men in these
days, for it was once given by Christ himself unto the Apostles only Bernard.

PETRUS ABELARDUS, Ann. 1143. or thereabouts.
He was a French man, in a French Synod convicted of these Heresies.

1. That the whole nature and essence of God may be comprehended by the Reas^n
of man, and whatsoever God does, he does it by a Natural Necessity.

2. God is not the Author of all Good, neither can the Saints in Heaven see his
Essence.

3. There is som^hing else besides the Creator and the Creature, and that is
eternal.

4. The holy Ghost is not of the same Substance with the father, but he is the
Soul of the world.

Heretics in the thirteenth Century
ALBIGENSIs, Anno 1200.
Their heresies began to spread first in the City of T^louse, in N^rbon, in
France.

1. That there are two beginnings, God and the Devil: God cr^ated the Souls of
Men, and the Devil the bodies.

2. To go to Church and to pray there, will do us no good.

3. The souls of the dead do g^e into the bodies of beasts and Serpents, if
men do Live ill; but if they live well, then they go to the ^odies of Princes
and great men.

4. That the Church ought not to possess any thing in proper but in common
only:

ALMARICUS, XLVI.

He was a French Man, and commenced Doctor at Paris, he held.

1. That God spoke as well in Ovid, as in Austen.

2. There is no Resurrection of the body, no heaven, no hell, but he who has
the knowledge of God within him, he has Heaven within him, and he who has
great sins within him, has hell within him.

3. Adam and Eve should never have been married, If they h^d continued in the
state of (...), neither should there have been any difference of Sex between
them, but mankind should have increased as Angels do.

4. God cannot be seen in himself, but in his Creaturs, as light is seen in
the air.

BEGARDI and Beguinae, Anno. 1314.
Begardi, were Monks which kept in Low Germany, and Beguinae were women that
lived here in a Nunnery, as long as they themselves would, for they made no
expr^sse vow to forsake the world.

1. They held, that men may in this life be as happy as they may be in
Heaven, i. e. they may come to such perfection, that they may be in this world
without sin, and attain that measure of Grace, that they cannot increase in
grace.

2. That the soul of man is blessed in its self by nature, without the grace
of God; and therefore it needs no light of glory to enlighten it to see God,
that in the sight and fruition of him it may be blessed.

3. ^o kiss a woman when nature does not incline unto it, is a great sin; but
to lie with a woman when nature and the lust of the flesh provokes, is no sin.

4. A man having attained unto the State of perfection, is not subject to any
law of man, neither is he tied any more to fast, and pray to God. Alphar^^

ADAMITAE.
There were two sorts of Ad^mitae; one had their name given them of one Adam,
who lived in the second Century. Whenever (says Epiphanius) these met
together at prayers, or on any other public occasion, they were naked. Their
Churches were hot houses, under the ground: before they went into their
Churches, every one of them did put off their clothes in a room by the Church
door. If any had committed any sin, they would not admit him any more into
their congregations; ^or they said, that he was Adam, who had eaten of the
forbidden fruit; and therefore deserved to be thrust out of Paradise, i. e. to
be put out of their Church; for they thought their Church to be Paradise, and
themselves to be Adam, and Eve. Epiph. Haeres. 52.

ADAMITAE, An. 1414.
The second sort of Adimites had their name of one Picka^d, who going out of
Gallobelgia into Bohemia, became an Adamite, and renewed the form^r Heresy of
the Adamites; he at his first coming into Bohemia, did draw great multitudes
of men and women after him, whom he commanded to go naked, and these he
called Adamites, th^se he persuaded that he was the son of God, and willed to
call him Adam.

This Adam was content that his Adamites should have the company of what men
and women they would, so that first his consent was obtained. If a man were in
love with any woman, he came with her hand in hand unto Adam, and said I am in
love with this woman; then said Adam, take her unto thee, go together,
increase, and multiply.

And because Adam and Eve were naked before they sinned, therefore they go
naked; and for that Adam did not know Eve until he had sinned; th^rfore they
account it a sin to marry, and are persuaded that Marriage had never been, if
Adam had never sinned. They celebrate their Sacraments naked, and man and Woman
accompany together naked, and they think as the old Adamites did, that their
Church is Paradise.

ANABAPTISTS, An. 1522.
About this time (says Sleiden speaking of these Anabaptists) there was a sect
of certain men, who said that they had talked with God, and that he had
commanded them to kill all wicked men, that only good and godly men might live
and govern the world.

Of these Anabaptists there were many kinds, and all of them pr^f^sse such
Doctrine, as is neither to be endur^d in the Church, or Commonwealth, or in
the government of the household.

First Anabaptisticall Articles not to be suffer^d in the Church, are,

^. That Christ did not assume the flesh of the Virgin Mary, but brought it
with him from Heaven.

^. That Christ is not true God; but that he is the b^st of all Saints,
because he received more gift of the Holy Ghost then they.

4. That (...) unbaptis^d, are no sinners in the sight of God, but are just and
innocent, and by this their innocence, they are saved without Baptism.

5. That infants are not to be ^aptis^d until they have reason and di^creti^n,
for the childr^n of Chr^stians are holy wit^out B^ptisme, and the children of
God.

6. That that is no true Chr^stian Church, in which any sinners are to be found.

Lastly, that no s^rmons are to b^e heard in those Churches, wherein Pop^sh
Mass has been.

Secondly, Anabaptisticall Articles ^ot to be (...) in the Common w^alth, are.

1. That the Office of the Magistrate pleases not God, neither can any
Christian with a safe conscience be a Mag^strate, neither ought any subject to
implore the aid of the Magistrate for his defense.

2. That a Christian may not safely use any oath at all, neither ought any
subject to ta^e any oath of all^ag^a^ce unto his Prince, nor swear or promise
any ^ealty or obedience.

3. That the Magistrates living in the time of the New Testament, may not with
a safe conscience put to death or punish any Malefactors*

Lastly, Anabaptisticall articles not to be suffered in the Economy o^
household government.

1. That a God^y man may not with a saf^ Conscience have any goods of his own
but whatsoev^r goods he has, he must make them common.

2. That a Chr^stian man may not be a victualler, nor a M^rchant, n^r make any
w^apons.

3. That it is lawful to divorce the hus^and and the wi^e if they be not of
the same Religion, and to mary them unto any other Persons that do not descent
from them in Religion.

GASPER (...), and his disciples. Anno. 1527
He came of a Noble family in (...), and was a man of good (...) before he
fe^l i^t^ these H^resies.

1. That the outward Ministry of the word is not nec^ssary, neither does
outward Baptism further regeneration; neither in the Lords Supp^r are the body
and blood of Christ exhibited in the bread and wine.

2. That the human nature of Christ is no cr^ature, but after his resurrection
was every way (...) unto his divine nature.

3 That the Ministry of a vicious Pri^st or Minist^r is not ^ff^ctuall unto the
salvation of his Auditory, all^^it h^e preaches never so w^ll, ^r administreth
the Sacraments according to the institution of Christ. Lib. Concordiae,

The new SAMOSATENIANS. An. 1532.
The Author of this sect was Michael (...), his followers were Georgius
Bla^drata, Fransiscus David, and many others in Transylvania; their opinion is
compounded of many ancient (...)

1. In God there is no distinction of persons. Serve^. lib. 5, Trin. p^g. 189,
and ministri Transilvani. lib. 2. cap. 4. and this was the (...) Sabellius,
Samosatenus, and many others, ut supra.

2. Christ before his incarnation, was nothing but an idea in the mind of God.
Serve^. lib. 3, (...). page 92, and this was likewise taught by Cerinthus and
E^ion, Irenaeus. lib. 1, cap. 2^. and 26, as also by Samosa^enus. (...). Here Is.
44, and 45.

3. The Divinity that Christ has, was communicated unto him by God, not by
eternal generation, but by the u^ction of Grace, and by inhabitation: and thus
Christ may be called God, but he is a made God, and he is a temporal, but no
eternal God. Blandrata disput. 6. Alba. and ministri Hungarici. lib. 2. cap.
7, and this was part of the Heresy of Nestorius as we may see in Theodoret.
lib. 4, here. fabula^um, and in other Heretics, ut supra.

L.
The new ARRIANS, Ann. 1534. or thereabouts.
These came from Valentius Gentilis, who was one of the scholars of Servetus,
they taught.

1. That there are three eternal spirits, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
which differ in number and essence, Val G^ntilis P^othesi, 20, and 23, and this
is also recorded by Aretius in his history of the punishment of Val. Gentilis.
This was the opinion of the Heretics called Peratae, in Theodoret. lib. 1,
cap. 18. haereticarum fabularum, and of Iohan^s Philoponus the Heretic Niceph,
lib. 18. cap. 48.

2. They taught that these three Persons were not equal, but that the father
was far above the other two, so that he might be called Essentiator, and the
other two Essentiati. i. e. he that had his essence of himself alone, and the
other their ^ssence from him. Gen^ilis lib. Antido^o 3. f^l. 26. where he says,
that it is the property of the Father to be called the one and only God; And so
the new Triheites went from (...) A^rius, for Arrius was the first that Taught
that the father was l^sse then the son. Epip^. haeres. 69.

3. They say that the Son of God was not of nothing, neither that he was
begotten in time, but from all eternity of the substance of his father, Gent.
Prothes 11 12. And this was the opinion of the New Arians in Austins time. The
later Arrians granted that the Son was eternal with the father, albeit Arius
was of another mind. Aug^ lib. 6. Trin. cap. 1. and lib. 1. T^init. Maximus
does conf^sse as Aug: there says, that the son was not of nothing, but was
begotten of the substance of his father. And this was the judgment of the
Council held at Ariminum^ etc.

Postscript.
AND now, Sir, I could wish that these Heretics survived only in Paper, but
alas they are all lived over again, though they seem not at this
res^ssitation to have so bright ^scendants as ^t their birth, for then many
approved Wits, and persons of r^verend name ^ere given over to believe these
lies, now few besides narr^ow indigested souls ^un after them: a providence
that promises they will the sooner find their graves, for the vulgar are still
as covetous of novelty, as of your com^^ands is.
