By the King. A Proclamation declaring his Majesty's pleasure concerning
Captain Roger North, and those who are gone forth as adventurers with him.
WHereas Roger North Esquier, with diverse others of Our Subjects, as
Adventurers for the intended Plantation and settling of Trade and Commerce in
those parts of the Continent of America near and about the River of Amazones
(which were presupposed not to be under the obedience and government of any
other Christian Prince or State) has secretly conveyed himself away, and has
disloyally precipitated and imbarqued himself, and his fellows, and suddenly
set to Sea with a pretended purpose to prosecute that design, contrary to Our
Royal pleasure and Commandment expressly signified unto him by one of Our
principal Secretaries, Our Admiral of England having also refused him leave
to go: We then having out of weighty considerations, and reason of State, and
upon the deliberate advise of Our Priuy-Councell resolved to suspend and
restrain the said Plantation and voyage for a time, and having thereupon
straightly charged and commanded him the said North upon his duty and
aleageance, that he and his Associates should for a while surcease their
Provisions, and should stay themselves and their Shipping, which they had
already prepared, until Our further pleasure should be made known unto them.

We have therefore held it fit hereby to make a public Declaration of Our
utter mislike and disauowement of this their rash, undutiful and insolent
attempt; and do hereby revoke, annihilate and disanull all Power, Authority,
jurisdiction, or Commission whatsoever, which he the said North, or any of his
Accomplices may pretend in any sort to derive and hold from or under Us; and do
hereby charge as well him the said North, as all his Companions and followers,
immediately upon the first notice that shall be given him or them of this Our
pleasure, that they shall make their speedy return directly home, with all
their shipping and munitions into this Our Kingdom of England, as soon as the
winds and weather shall permit them; and being here arrived shall forthwith
present themselves in person unto some of Our Privy Council, under pain of
being hereby declared guilty of high contempt and rebellion, in case they
shall disobey this Our express commandment.

And We do further hereby straightly require and charge as well the Governors,
as all other the Partenors and Adventurers, any ways concerned, or interested
as members of the Company and Incorporation intended for that Plantation, as
all other Merchants, Captains, Masters, and Officers, of Ships, Saylors,
Marrinors, and all other our loving subjects whatsoever, that they shall in no
sort aid or abette, nor comfort him the said North, nor any of his Accomplices
with any supply of shipping, men, money, munition, victuals, merchandise, or
other commodities or necessaries whatsoever: but that as well all and every Our
Admirals, Vice-Admirals, and other Our Officers and Commanders of Our Ships, or
Pinnaces, as all other Captains and Masters of any of Our subjects ships and
vessels whatsoever, that shall happen to meet with him the said North, or any
of his Company at sea, or in any Harbor, Port, or Creek wheresoever, shall in
Our Name attach, seize, and summon him, or them, and their shipping, to return
immediately home, and shall forthwith bring them back to some of Our Ports of
this Our Kingdom, and there commit them and their Ships to the charge of such
Our Officers, as it shall respectively appertain unto, until We (having
received information of their such return, which We will expect from Our said
Officers, who shall so stand incharged with them) shall give further order
concerning them, as well their persons as their shipping and munitions. Wherein
We do expressly charge and command as well him the said North, and all his
Company, Abettors, and Adherents, and all the rest of that Company and
Incorporation intended, as all and every other Our Officers by Land or Sea, and
all other Captains, Masters, and Mariners in any of Our subjects ships, and
all other Our loving subjects whatsoever, faithfully, diligently, and carefully
to observe, do, and perform in their several qualities and places, that
which We have hereby required of them, according to every of their duties,
charges, and employments, upon pain of Our high displeasure and indignation,
and as they will answer the contrary at their uttermost peril.

Given at Our Manor of Greenwich this fifteenth day of May, in the eighteenth
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
