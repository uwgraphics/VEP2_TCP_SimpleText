But indeed

No News this New-Year dare I sing,
Lest News foretold should Dangers bring:
Old Sinners, New Saints, GOD grant we be,
And that will work Felicity.
ENter the following Table, with the 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30. day of your
Month, finding your days aforesaid on the Top, and Months on the Margent; and
in the common angle you will find (by inspection) the exact time that the Sun
rises the said days: and by the rule of proportion for any intermediate days.

Example. I desire to know the time of the Suns rising the 15 day of April: I
look in the Table, and I find that the Sun rises the said day, 36 min. past 4
in the morning. In like manner, the 15 day of May, the Sun rises 39 min. past
3. The 15 of June, 18 min. past 3. The 15 of July, 50 min. past 3. in the
morning, etc.

A table showing the exact time of the Suns rising every fifth day, exactly
calculated for the Latitude of 56 degrees, 20 minutes.
Names of the Months The days of each Month. 5 day 10 day 15 day 20 day 25
day 30 day January 8 21 8 12 8 3 7 53 7 42 7 29 February 7 18 7 6 6 55 6 43 6
31 March 6 12 6 0 5 48 5 36 5 24 5 10 April 4 58 4 48 4 36 4 26 4 15 4 5 May 3
55 3 47 3 39 3 32 3 26 3 21 June 3 18 3 17 3 18 3 23 3 23 3 28 July 3 35 3 42 3

34 8 39 December. 8 42 8 43 8 42 8 40 8 36 8 31 Time of the Suns rising in
hours and minutes.

But if ye would know the time of the Suns rising from any other immediate
days, take difference and work by the Golden rule, and you shall find the
proportional part to be added if the days be increasing: and to be
subtracted if the days be decreasing in length. The day increases in length
from the time that the Sun passes the Tropic of Capricorn, until he come to
the Tropic of Cancer: But decreaseth in length from Cancer to Capricorn, etc.

If you desire to know the time of the time of the Sun-letting, Substract the
time of his rising from 12 hours, the remainder is the time of the Sunsetting,
which having so found, double the same and you have the whole length of the
day, whose complement to 24 hours is the length of the night.

Those that desire to see practical examples upon these things, will see it
amply performed in the 22 Chapter of Mr. Corss his Uranoscopia, lately emitted,
to which I refer you.

Strange Prophesies.
In the beginning of this new year,
Strange wonders in Britain shall appear:
Four Crowned Kings into a place,
Shall make great melody for a space:
The dead bones shall tumbled be,
From place to place which men will see.
The Bowels of the dead shall cry,
Unto quick men for melody:
A Herald shall lift on hie his back,
Whose voice shall make wild Lions quake:
His Beard's of Flesh, his mouth's of Horn,
The like of him was never born.
This Herauld's taken, his Garment's riven,
All shall be done against Fasterns-Even.
FINIS.
