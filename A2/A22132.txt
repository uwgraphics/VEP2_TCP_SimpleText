to repair indifferently at all times: Therefore his Majesty does declare and
forbid, That hereafter no such person make their repair up for healing,
between the Feasts of Easter and Michaelmas, for the which although it had
been enough for His Majesty to have signified His pleasure for recontinuing
the said order unto the Clearke of His Closet, or His Chirurgions in that
behalf; Yet His Majesty doubting that some such weak and infirm persons may
come up from remote parts, and thereby leese their travail, is pleased out of
His goodness, to publish this Order by His Highness Proclamation.

Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland, And of Scotland the nine and
fourtieth.
God save the King.
