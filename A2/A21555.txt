By the King and the Queen,
WHere as many good and profitable laws, statutes, and ordynaunces, have been
heretofore made and devised, for ^he good government, order, and common weal
of this realm, and for the better execution of the said laws, and statutes,
it has pleased our most dread sovereign Lord, and Lady, the King and the
Queen's majesty's, to address of late their several lettres with certain
articles and instructions, to the Justices of peace, sheriffs and other their
minysters in every shire, City, and Borough, of this their realm, for ye
bettre order of the same, expecting and hoping, that by force thereof, such
dilligent care and vigilant eye, should have been had and used by the said
Justices and other ministers in every of the said shieres, that the offenders
of the said laws, and statutes, should not for want of due execution of the
same, ben permytted and encoraged to use and continue as they do their
unlawful mysdemenors, and disorders in contempt of the said laws, and
statutes, and to the present peril and danger of the commonwealth, and to the
great disquietnes. and grief of their majesty's, whose only desire, pleasure,
and good contentment is to have their laws, truly executed, and the
trangressours thereof to be punyshed, according to the qualities of their
offenses, and their good and natural subjects to be preserved in quietness, And
to the intent, the same may the better, take effect, their highness have thought
it good eftsoon by this their proclamation, strayghtlye to charge and
command, all and singular Justices of prace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bailiffes,
constables, and al other their mynysters and subjects, to whom the charge of
due execution of the same laws, and statutes apperteyneth, that they with all
their dyligence and dexterity, shall endeavor themselves to the uttermost of
their powers to the due and effectual execution of the said laws and statutes.

And in especial to see all the articles and commandments contained in the
said Letters and instructions, lately sent unto them by there said majesty's,
to be diligently observed and kept.

And also to see the laws, statutes, ordynaunces, and prouysions, hereafter
specefied specially, to be put in due execucion, and thoffendours in the same
to be condignely punyshed. That is to say, the laws, and statutes heretofore,
made and provided, concerning, or in any wise, touching the punishment of
heresy, and lolardye, false rumors, and tales, excess of apparel,
counterfeyting of Coigne, unlawful assembles and conuenticles: Reading and
expounding of scriptures, and matters of religion, in secret corners, by
persons not aucthorised, And also al other statutes, and laws, made touching
ye duties of Sheriffs and their deputies in the execucion of writtes and
processes, and of sturdy vacaboundes and idle persons, of journey men, and of
alehouses and suspect hostries, And not to fail hereof as they tender their
duties to the King, and Queen's most excellent majesty's, and mind to be
noted and taken worthy to deserve their most gracious favors.

And if it may appear to their highness that the said Justices of peace,
Mynysters, and subjects shall hereafter neglecte to do their duties in this
behalf, their majesty's entend to proceed against such of them as shall herein
so neglect, or offend, with such severe Justice and sharp correction as the
same shall be to the example of all others like offenders. Given under our Signs
Manuell, at our honor of Hampton court. the.xxvi. day of May, the first and
second years of our reygnes.

God save the King and the Queen.
