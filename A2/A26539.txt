AESOP'S Last Will and Testament.
POOR Aesop lately being taken ill,
But yet of perfect mind, thus makes his Will:
First, I bequeath my Soul, when I forsake it,
To him that has the chiefest Right to take it.
(...) Body next, let me consider well,
To him, that will convey it out of smell;
My Worldly Goods, although they are but few,
My scribbling Friends, those I bequeath to you.
And were I sure that he would accept of it,
My Friend of Quality should have my Wit:
Next to the Squire, that with his Horse and Hounds
Leap't over his Tenants Hedge and broke his Mounds.
To him and to his Heirs, my whip and clogs,
I give to discipline his Headstrong Dogs;
And to the Farmer, who was in such care
To call this Squire, to kill the foolish Hare,
Among my lumber he a Rope will find,
Even let him take 't, and use it as designed:
And next, I give, but let me recollect,
I would do something fain for every Sect.
First to our Grave Divines, well let me see!
I Will give them what they want, my Charity;
Let the Non-Jurants take my head and eyes,
And learn Poor modest Fools to be more wise,
Then still to be deceived with Idle tales and lies.
And sure the Papist cannot take it ill,
If dying Aesop puts them in his Will;
To them I leave my truth and moderation,
The'yll do them good against the next Invasion.
The Presbyterians I should something leave,
But they are so Rich I know not what to give:
The Quakers too expect their Legacy,
We'll set them down in haste, my modesty.
Let all the other Sects, for I wont wrong 'em,
Take my Religion and divide among 'em.
And now at last, it is my will and mind,
Some honest wealthy Cit, would be so kind
To see all this performed, and for his pains,
To take for him, and for his Heirs my Brains.
Signed and Sealed in the presence of, T. B. T. D. and E. S.
