A Brief DISCOVRSE UPON TYRANTS AND TYRANNY.
Tyranny may justly be esteemed the greatest calamity, because it is in
opposition to the chiefest felicity which ^es in liberty, and the free
disposition of that which God and our own industry has made ours; Nor can it
keep company with goodness, since it destroys the first true principle of
justice, by which all are enjoined to do by others as they desire others
should deal by them.

Tyranny is most commonly taken for the irregularity of him that governs in
chief, who only rules according to will; for in subordinate instruments it is
called oppression: And under this title it caused the ruin of the first world,
as it does now of all corporations where it is suffered too much to abound.

If it be asked, whether this extravagant or a legal jurisdiction be most
natural and convenient for a King. It may most truly be answered, the later:
For if it be certain that the strength of a King lies in the riches and love
of his people: I am sure, he they are least afraid of, has the greatest share;
for who can heartily affect him they doubt.

Where laws are observed, the wicked only tremble, but Tyranny is equally
formidable both to good and bad, yet it cannot be so safe in the Army it must
have to guard it; as a good Prince is between mercy and justice.

It may appear by Lucian, that a reward was anciently assigned to him that
should kill a Tyrant, out of the common treasury; which proves them enemies to
the State; And he that renders himself worthy of this title, can have no hope
to satisfy his conscience, nor safety to assure his fears, being as deep in
the hatred of God as he is in the detestation of men.

When a power is raised against him, he is lost with the first battle, not
being able to appear again in the Field, because his strength only consists
in such soldiers as are used to pay and rapine; (which at this time fail
them, the one being exhausted by his former profusion, and the later prevented
by his enemies care) and not in his subjects, who have (in a well governed
Commonwealth) the strong engines of private interests to move them; Whereas
these mercenaries look only after present profit which does of necessity
conclude with his felicity, knowing they can never want Masters so long as
ambition reigns in the world, which makes them (like the spirits of Conjurers)
serve them during the days of their better fortune; and those ended, to be as
ready as the rest to bring them to perdition,

And being once disabled to keep the Field, he remains a prey to his
Adversary, unless he prevent it by killing himself. For soldiers bred in so
much liberty will never endure a straight siege, but rather buy their safety
with his head, which they never valued higher than the profit could be made of
it; and if the people stir in his defense; they show a madness no less than
to be found fighting against themselves, it being unpossible to be in harder
condition; so that the hope of bettering themselves takes away all fear of
loosing by the change: And if they should interpose themselves, yet they could
contribute little help, because such as live under an absolute constraint are
not so belliquous as natural subjects, who have something to loose, whereas
these never enjoyed any thing but the courtesy of another; and are so deb^s^d
by continual injuries and oppressions, that they bear any thing with more
ease and pati^nce then Arms which they know not how to use, unless upon great
advantage, and when they are animated with the sweet sound of liberty, for then
they are found to have done wonders, ^pecially upon their Masters; which
proceeds out of fear not valor, as appears by the exorbitant cruelty they
use to the authors of their subjection.

A Tyrant being assailed, he is forced to go against that wholesome rule of
policy, which advises a Prince never to fight in his own Territory, but with
advantage both of time and place, for he must meet him at first without any
respit, least his own should have leisure to join with the adverse party,
which commonly they do.

We read great matters of the State and extent of the Persian Monarchy, yet
Zenophon with a handful of men cut his own passage through the midst of it;
and with what ease they were after overcome, all know or may read in the Story.

And as short-lived most of those governments be, the Turk only excepted, who
is cordeally opposed by none but the Persian, that holds his estate by the same
tenure: And to this may be added the simplicity of the Turkish Nation, who
place the chiefest principle of their Religion in obedience to their King,
though he command thousands of them to make away themselves at once; so it may
be said of these silly people, that they are only daring in destroying
themselves; This Princes strength lying chiefly in his Ianizaries consisting of
about 40000; who being for the most part taken in the wars, or bred up from
children paid for tribute, are of several Nations, and so not apt to combine;
And though an infinite number of Natives go into the Field with him, they are
so slightly esteemed that they serve only to fill up Trenches and Breaches with
their carcasses.

Now were his own people Soldiers by nature, which law and freedom would
soon make them, he need not be so fond of strangers, nor so fearful of his
own.

Yet now the Ianizaries being informed of their strength, begin to use their
Master as the pretorian Soldiers did the Tyrants of Rome, for they know no
inland power can refist them, which gives them the boldness to capitulate with
their Prince, and to seli his head when they meet with a free Chapman; which
makes well for Christendom, for had he not these diversions, he had long ere
this decided the war in Germany by taking that from them they are together by
the ears for.

There is no doubt but God was able to have put spirit enough in the children
of Israel to have left Egypt without leave; or that being obtained, have turned
their faces toward Pharoh in defense of their new purchased liberty; but he
chose rather to bring them through the Sea, as if it were a less miracle for
the water to go back, than for people bred in servitude to st^nd f^ll before
an enemy with hope of success; And it is made more a parant after by his own
choice of the servants of the Princes of the Provinces, when he meant to
deliver his people; that such are fittest for war who live in least fear and
have sometimes quarrels amongst themselves, as these in all likelihood had. So
as I may say under good authority, that since Coaches came up and Hospitality
down, that England is stronger in horses but weaker in men; and if law, the
ready way to every man's right, should be quite lost, as it is in some hazard,
we might quickly grow more basely spirited then we are in the generality, if
it be possible, for he that has not the means or is not used to defend
himself, will never protect another.

For supplies in a necessity, the limited government has ever been most free,
because they know it is for their own preservation; whereas a bad Prince is
then forced rather to give than take for fear his subject, should join with
the enemy, who cannot choose but be as goosefoot a better friend, especially if
he observes but half the conditions he offers, which are ever more tolerable
than they are under: And though both be ill, yet there is some delight in the
change; besides the subjects of Tyrants in the general are not so rich, the
uncertainty of keeping, hindering for the most part the desire of gain: So
though he has the power to command all, yet when it comes together, it does
not rise to so great a sum as such as are free borne do willingly give.

It is a saying worthy to be followed, that a wise man if he cannot keep out a
Tyrant, will be the first to bring him in: yet it must be taken with such
limitations and resistance, as may be justified by honor and probity as well
as by policy and wisdom; for he that shall lend his hand to the raising or
maintaining such a Monster, out of no other reason then private respect cannot
be guilty of less treason then the crossing Gods intentions, who never made
the glorious Nations of this world to serve only as footballs for Kings to kick
up and down according as their wanton and unbridled passions move them.

Yet if Cato had been as wise as Brutus, Rome might have stopped this plague
before it had gained all the people; for if to die with a friend be a sign of
love, it is a far greater to see him revenged, and his issue raised to their
lost liberty: Thus Bruins did, who kept his life safe under the habit of
folly, till he found he might expose it with profit to his Country, whilst
the other flung it away in the midst of despair, when the State had use of
living friends not dead carcasses; had he met the Monster and kissed him, he had
continued his fears, whereas this good man's making away himself left him
secure.

The Bible that is an enemy to indiscretion, commends rather than blames David
that was mad in show, but ^ato was so indeed, else why would be not have
ventured to kill the common enemy with his own hands? which might have been
done with more justice, and at the worst with no less loss then of his own
life; therefore it may be conceived it was not zeal to his Country but
passion made him do it; for if the destruction of few governments can be more
uninst than their beginning, why should a man desperately expose his life to
maintain any title that has lost the old force that was wont to support it?
This being a conclusion in Divinity, that the strongest power is to be obeyed.

For all this I do not think it wisdom to stand by and look on, for he that
has faithfully maintained his faction, though he be overcome is likelier to
find friendship and forgiveness than he that has been a Neuter, in which
state he has no power to show his valor or fidelity, which ever renders the
owner capable of love and piety.

Neither can I think him so highly to be commended, that without consideration
of possibility of success, is resolved to stand to a falling pillar, and to
perish with it, no more than he that upon as little assurance mingles with the
common rabble, which are the rocks on whom great pretenders venture their
ambition; and when the battle is won and lost, have no other reward for the
most part, than the bitter repentance of their folly which has rather impaired
than bettered their condition. And if Reason in any case can warrant the
breaking of this rule, it must be for the defense of Liberty; for the
difference between one absolute Prince and another, in respect the best are
mortal and subject to ill Counsel, cannot be worth so much blood as a crabbed
Title requires to decide it; therefore they that have not the skill to live
without a Master, must welcome him that comes in with least trouble, who being
secure may be the easier expeld upon the peoples dislike.

I have heard reported for the honor of the Protestant Religion, that they
never attempted any thing against their Prince, which may be said at more ease
than proved, as appears both by the French and Dutch Histories: I am so far
from taking this as a disparagement, that I think it may well be just^fied
where strength and number affords a probability of success, it being
ridiculous to maintain, a man may not do as much to save his conscience, as
all Law allows him for the defense of his purse and estate: and those that
rely so much upon Saint Paul in the contrary opinion, do not remember his
Master, who says there are times wherein a sword is more necessary than a
coat, which ought to be sold to purchase it; and he that carries not the sword
in vain, himself would not burden his followers with an useless weapon.

During the Reign of the Heathen Emperors it was a crafie time in the Church,
and therefore the Professors were taught patience, because the body was not
strong enough to purge it self.

He that stands still whilst a weaker than he kills him, is as guilty of his
own death as he that hangs himself. Religion may be above Reason in matters
of Faith, but not against it in manners, and the means of our preservation,
which are wisdom and strength joined with prayers for a good success.

And if this be denied, it will not only discourage us that are Protestants
already, but keep out others that would come in; for who that is to choose will
take that Religion that shall make it damnable to defend it self, and so
destroy one of the strongest principles of nature.

Saint Paul seeing the company half Pharisees, half Saduces, takes this
opportunity and proclaims himself of one of the factions, and by this means
rescued his life: Nay Christ himself, when the Jews sought to entangle him in
his speech, proposes the question of John the Baptist to set them in
opposition with the people, the love of whom was all the earthly strength he
had, as appears by the Gospel.

Did not Abraham tear his brother Lot out of the hands of the King that
detained him, by the persuasion of love and natural affection. I do not
believe that all those took the Protestants part either in France or the
Lowcountreys, did it out of zeal to Religion, more than some that opposed
them: But in such cases discretion makes use of all lawful advantages; and if
Tyranny be overthrown, the means can hardly be capable of reproof, and no
Tyranny is so great as that which is exercised over men's consciences. In the
primitive time the Christians served in great troops under the Heathen
Emperors, but whether they had altogether been able to establish their own
conditions, all reason makes me doubt: Besides, true Religion was to be
planted, and we see patience gains at the beginning more Proselytes, than
either force or prosperity. But now our work is only to defend it: All must
confess, that the Protestants have not yet had the leisure or will to act such
bloody and dark treasons as the Papists, what they have done has been
hitherto bravely with their swords in their hands, the natural and generous
way of deciding a controversy.

But if against this the Duke of Guise be objected, I answer, he was none of
their Prince, next, that he was condemned by the greatest part of the Kingdom
as a man unworthy to live, being thought the cause of most of the ill France
did then labor with, this being apparent to every judgment; therefore what
was done to him was only the execution of a just sentence which so great a Jury
had pronounced against him; yet it cannot be proved that they did it, though it
matters not much.

Christ tells Pilate, if his Kingdom had been of this world, that is
sufficiently believed, his subjects would have fought for him, by which he
seems to me silently to upbraid the cowardlinesse of his followers.

I know the Romans by Tyrants, meant ill Kings, so do not I, who only
comprehend under this title such as encroach upon the just liberties of their
subjects; for a true King is he that watches over his Country for their
general good, acknowledging the particular propriety every one has in what he
enioyes ought not to be violated but where law allows, and necessity compells.

If it be pleasure a King seeks, Law bars him not, but preserves him more
safe in a wild Forest, than the Grand Signior can be in his Seragleo, or when
he goes his progress with an hundred thousand men: or if he delights in things
less honest, Law only informs him by punishing of others for the same faults,
that he which is set out of the reach of her power ought to be a Law to
himself.

To conclude, I ever believed that the maine scope of those rules for patience
and sufferance, prescribed in holy writ, extend only to restrain the
unbridled passions of over furious men, and to persuade temperance in the
tongue and hands, when there is no sufficient power to make resistance; neither
do I like this opinion the worse, because it is maintained by Bellarmine and
the rest of the Jesuits, that having most probability of truth, that is
consonant to all parties. For it is no less than madness to think that God
that has allotted a punishment for all faults, should protect this which is
the greatest, because it destroys the principles of the second table, and
hinders the performance of those of the first; there being no stronger enemy to
Religion than unsettled fear: For how can the Word have a free passage when the
Churchmen have nothing to protect them, when they tell the King of his implety,
and the Nobles of their transgression. So then Tyranny cannot agree with the
joyful tidings of the Gospel, which desires the unity of the spirit in the
bond of peace. Now where Law, Religion, and the Love of the People are, it
makes a threefold cord, not easily broken, which draws on plenty, peace, and
prosperity. And if such a Prince comes to be invaded, he is commonly the last
that suffers, when a Tyrant is ever the first.

FINIS.
