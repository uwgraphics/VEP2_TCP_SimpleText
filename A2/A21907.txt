By the Queen.
A Proclamation against all persons, that disorderly enter into ships that
are brought as Prizes into any Haven, and that do secretly buy or convey away
the goods before they be customed, and allowed as lawful Prize.
WHereas great disorders have lately been committed, and do still continue by
reason of going abroad of diverse men of war, at their return home with
prizes, by diverse and sundry persons, that do soiourne and remain in diverse
port Towns, and places adjacent with great sums of money, with intent to buy
and convey in secret sort of the Captains and Mariners of the said ships, the
best commodities that they can get, as Pearl, Jewels, Stones, and other short
ends of great value: And do also very disorderly, and in secret sort with
their Boats in the night time go aboard the said men of war, to convey away
the goods and merchandise of the said Ships, before it be adjudged good
Prize, and before her Majesty's Customs and other duties be answered, (a
matter very inconuentent to be suffered) but the offenders therein to be
punished according to the quality of their offense. Her Majesty therefore for
reformation thereof does straightly charge and command, that after the
publication of this Proclamation: No manner of person or persons whatsoever,
unless it be the Officers of the Port, and of the Admiralty, or the Owners and
company of such Ships, do go aboorde any such Prizes, or do buy, bargain,
receive or convey out of the said Prizes, or from any of the company of the
same, either on board or on shore, any goods, merchandise or Pillage brought
home in the said Ships being Prizes, or from any of the Ships of the men
of war, until her Majesty's Customs and other duties be first paid, and
the Prize adjudged to be lawful: upon pain not only to forfeite the goods
so bought or received, but also the buyer and the Seller to be committed to
prison, there to remain until order be given from the Lords of her
Majesty's privy Counsel for their delivery.

And for the better preventing of the disorders aforesaid: Her Majesty's
further pleasure is, And so she does straightly command, that immediately
upon the coming in of any Prize from the Seas, some of the Officers of the
Custom House of that Port, and of the Admiralty, shall go aboard, and remain
aboard quietly, without any interruption or resistance of the Captain, Owner,
Master, or Mariners, until the Ship shall be discharged, and there to take notes,
and view of such goods, as from time to time shall be discharged. And likewise
of the chests and pillage of the Captains, and company of any such Prizes
before they be brought on shore. And if any resistance be used toward the
said Officers, or if any person shall found to offend contrary to the
orders aforesaid: Then her Majesty commands all Justices of Peace, Majors,
Vice-admirals, and all other Officers whatsoever, presently to apprehende the
Offender or Offenders, and to commit him or them to prison, aduertising to
the Lords of her Majesty's privy Counsel, the name of the party or parties
committed, with the quality of his or their offenses: That thereupon further
order may be taken as apperteineth.

Given at her Highness Manor of Greenwich, the first day of August 1594. in
the six and thirtieth year of her Majesty's reign.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty.
