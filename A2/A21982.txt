By the King.
A Proclamation signifying the Kings Majesty's pleasure, touching the resort of
people to his Coronation.
FOrasmuch as we find that the Infection within our City of London does
daily increase, and is like (to our grief) rather to augment then diminish,
as well by reason of the season of the year, as by the great Concourse of people
to our said City against the time of our Coronation, some to do their duties
in such necessary services, as to them belongs at that Solemnity, and some
for comfort they take in the sight of our Person, of the Queen our dear wife,
and of our children; Although there could be no greater joy to us then the
presence and confluence of all sorts of good Subjects at such a time, when the
more there should be partakers of that public rejoicing, the more should be
our Particular comfort: yet such is our fear least this their resort should
work a contrary effect both to their and our expectation, namely to be a
means not only of increasing the Infection within our City, but of
dispersing it into all places of this Realm, as we had rather forbear some
part of our Ornament and Custom, which is due to the Honor and Solemnity of
our Coronation, then by having the uttermost thereof performed, be the
occasion of so great an evil to our people, as is the spreading of the
Infection amongst them,

Wherefore we have thought it best to forbear of that Solemnity, whatsoever
is not Essential to it, and to defer all show of State and Pomp accustomed
by our Progenitors, which is not of necessity to be done within the Church at
the time of our Coronation, As also to omit our Solemn entry and passage
through our City of London for this time, intending to perform the same
hereafter in the Winter, when we shall perceive our City to be free from
sickness. And of this our purpose and of the causes thereof, we have thought
good to give notice to all our Subjects by Proclamation, To the end that as well
those of our said City may forbear to proceed in such Shows and Ornaments,
as we hear they out of their love have in hand to honor our said entry, As
also all other people may abstain from resorting to our said City at this
time, other then such, as have necessary Employment in that Solemnity, and
chiefly about such parts thereof as are to be performed only within the
Church: whom also we require to bring with them no greater train of servants,
then of necessity they must use each of them in his degree about their
persons; Wherein they shall both provide for their own good, and give us great
satisfaction in conforming themselves dutifully to this our Admonition.

Given at our Castle of Windsor, the sixth day of July, 1603. in the first year
of our Reign of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland, the six and
thirtieth. God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. Anno 1603.
