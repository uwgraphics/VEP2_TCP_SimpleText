HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
A Proclamation againt excess of Lavish and Licentious Speech of matters of
State.
ALthough the commixture of Nations, confluence of Ambassadors, and the
relation, which the affairs of Our Kingdoms have had toward the business
and interests of foreign States, have caused, during Our Regiment, a greater
opennesse, and liberty of discourse, even concerning matters of State, (which
are no Theames, or subjects fit for vulgar persons, or common meetings) then
has been in former times, used or permitted; And although in Our own Nature,
and Judgment, We do well allow of convenient freedom of speech, esteeming
any over curious or restrained hand carried in that kind, rather as a
weakness, or else over much severity of Government, then other wise: Yet
nevertheless, forasmuch as it is come Our ears, by common report, That there
is at this time a more licentious passage of lavish discourse, and bold Censure
in matters of State, then has been heretofore, or is fit to be suffered; We
have thought it necessary, by the advice of Our Privy Council, to give
forewarning unto Our loving Subjects, of this excess and presumption; And
straightly to command them and every of them, from the highest to the lowest, to
take heed, how they intermeddle by Pen, or Speech, with causes of State, and
secrets of Empire, either at home, or abroad, but contain themselves within
that modest and reverent regard, of matters, above their reach and calling,
that to good and dutiful Subjects appertains; As also not to give attention,
or any manner of applause or entertainment to such discourse, without
acquainting some of Our Privy Council, or other principal Officers there
withal, respective to the place where such speeches shall be used, within the
space of four and twenty hours, under pain of imprisonment, and Our High
displeasure.

And let no man think, after this Our forewarning, to pass away with
impunitie, in respect of the multitude and generality of Offenders in this
kind; but know, that it will light upon some of the first, or for wardst of
them, to be severely punished, for example to others.

And, if we shall be sensible of this kind of contempt, even toward such of Our
loving Subjects, as are obedient to Our Laws, and conformable to Our
proceedings in Church, and Common wealth, unto whom, we cannot impute it, to
proceed otherwise, then out of rashness, evil custom, or too much passion:
much more, let them look to it, who in respect, that they are otherwise liable
to Our Laws, or of suspected affection toward Our Government, may give us just
cause to think, that it proceeds from the ouerflowe of a worse, or more
corrupt fountain.

Neither let any man mistake Us so much, as to think, that by giving fair,
and specious attributes to Our Person, they can cover the scandalls, which they
otherwise lay upon Our Government, but conceive, that we make no other
construction of them, but as fine, and artificial glosses, the better to give
passage to the rest of their imputations, and scandalls.

Given at White Hall, the 24. of December, in the eighteenth year of Our
Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by JOHN BILL, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. M.DC.XX.
