ANE Brief descriptioun of the qualiteis and effectis of the well of the
woman hill beside Abirdene.

ANNO. DO. 1580.

(...) appeiris to be ane divine gift of God grantit and now laitlie manifestit
to the greit support and advancement of health in cure of sic disesis as hes
been obseruit in diueris persounis. Quhairfoir I seeing the samin to have been
obscure from the beginning to their dayis, it being ane ornament and ane publict
utility to the Realm and Burgh, thocht good to make the qualiteis and profeit
thairof acknawledgeit to sic persou^is as be vexit with sic disesis as it is
good for. For of treuth it is of Medicinal quality and, and flowis from
diverse minerallis, as hes been obseruit be the operatioun taist and mineral
ure, quhilk being drunkin, is laxatiue to sindrie, and so must neidis be het of
quality, be ressoun on na wayis it laxis nor molefeis the exterior partis, or
the skyn of mannis body: thairfoir it is laxatiue of the interior partis, and
promouis good passage of the belly, as wrytis Celsus lib. 2. Ca. 12. To
vtheris it is womatiue, quhilk also testifeis the het quality thairof, farther
it geuis good appetyte to them quha at destitute thairof, and gif any man
drink twenty pound wecht of this Fontaine he findis no charge nor burding of
the stomak nor belly be the watter. Quhilk also approuis the mineral quality
thairof, be ressoun all natural and pure sweit watter is flaw in passage,
difficill of concoctioun, flatuous and heuie in the stomak, and generis
distillatiounis, as wrytis Aetius Tetrab. 1. Sermon. 3. Ca. 165. Sa this watter
being of contrarious effectis must neidis be of contrarious qualiteis to
co^mou^ watteris. Ane notabill prufe of the samin hes been obseruit be ane
Indweller in Abirdene, quha laitly causit brew Aill of this watter, of the
quhilk na beist wald taist, nor eit of the draf thairof, nouther Horse, Kow, nor
Ox, sa it being laxatiue, attenuatiue, liquefactiue, digestive, and discussiue,
it must neidis be of het quality, for their ar ye properteis of het watteris,
quhilkis hes been obseruit be the happy succes in cure of diverse disesis in
this watter, quhairof the taist is su^quhat vnplesand, as gif it were brint with
Irin, the ure thairof as it rynnis upon the stains and ground ar of diverse
cullouris, the ane color sad blew, quhilk promisis Iryn, as the taist dois
also, the other color being reid declyning to zallow color, testifeis
Brass, quhilkis two minerallis of proper quality co^fortis the stomak and
Melt, as sayis Auicen lib. 2. Tract. 2. Ca. 19. Cano. Also wrytis Auicen lib.
1. Fen. 2. doct. 2. ca 16. Sic watter as be of the quality of Iryn geuis
strenth to the Interior partis of ma^nis body, and keipis the stomak from
corruptiou^, and promouis the haill faculteis quhilkis gouernis ma^nis body. So
ar the wordis of Gal. wrytand upon Hip. in his buik of Aere watter and places
Ca. 3. Sic watter (sayis he) quhilkis are not abill to burding the stomak and ar
of facill digestioun must neidis to be laxatiue, and procure passage of the
womb be Medicinal het quality. Gif the watter of this notabill Fontaine be
buileit it becu^mis of mair blak color, and the dreggis thairof beiris witness
of the minerallis befoir writtin, as alswa being caryit cu^mis haistely to
corruptioun, quhilk being profitabill as it is for the stomak and Melt, it must
neidis spring from Iryn, also being na wayis byndand nor of desiccatiue
quality, bot rather laxatiue and diureticall, their is na suspitiou^ to be
takin of Alme, it in respect it is discussiue, laxatiue, remollitiue, and
vomitiue, it appeiris be good ressoun to be participant of bryntstane, as the
color thairof also witnessis. And in respect the country is of nature
mineral, this watter being drunkin cuirand sair Eyn, Catarris, sair mouth,
prolapsiou^ of the vult, and dolor of the Tonsallis, it must neidis spring
from Brass, as testifeis Aetius Tetrab. 1. Sermon. 3. Ca. 167. Farther I have
obseruit in diueris persounis quha had drunkin the samin, that it mitigatis the
heit of the Liver, stancheit drouth, perfytlie cuiris Nephritick dolouris both
of Neiris and Bledder, corroborattis the stomak, takis away obstructiou^ of the
Melt, perfytlie cuiris distillatioun from the harnis, hes cuirit sindrie
Hydropicall persounis, specially that kind callit Anasarca and Aschitis. It is
good also be experience for resolutionn of the body, or any pairt thairof
callit Paralysis, profitabill also for sterilitie contractit be suffocatiou^ of
the barn bed, or any other natural cause, writtin be Hip. lib. de sterilibus.
It is good also for palpita^ioun and trymbling of the body being drunkin, in
few dayis it cuiris all sort of cauld guttis be purgatiou^ of sic humouris as
ar the cause thairof. It bringis to good color all Cathetik persounis quhilkis
being of evil habitude and co^stitutioun of body. Being also laxatiue and
prouokis womitine, sa it oppinnis the obstructiounis and oppillatiou^is of the
Liver, quhairby money hes been cuirit of the Gusoch, also it hes cuirit money of
ye fever Terce, and last it perfytlie cuiris (being drunkin) the exterior
scabbis, wyldefyre, darteris, and other filthiness of the skyn. Sa it is may
profitabil for sic as be of het intemperance of the Liver, and constitutiou^ of
them quha be burdinnit be greit and heuie co^stitutioun of body, may propeus
to Hydropesie, Apoplesie, or Paralisie. Sa albeit I have red the qualiteis of
the may ancient Bathis and springis of Medicinal watteris: I find this
spring of the woman hill beside Abirdene to be not far different from the
nature of the Bath of Cornelius callit sa in Aquisgran ane notabil town in
Gallia Belgica, and repugnant to the nature of the Portitanis Bath, quhilkis
dois rather gender Grauel and stain in Neiris and Bledder, nor to procure the
help or dissolutioun of the samin. Ane greit fault I find in the use of this
watter, that Ilk persoun drinkis thairof at their awin pleasure, nether having
respect to the present diseis, natural co^stitutioun of body, nor time of the
eir, quhair by the said watter be the abusaris thairof is rather vilipendit nor
co^mendit. Quhairfoir I wald sic as wald have profeit of the samin prepairit
their bodyis conform to their nature, strenth, aige, diseis, and rest of
circumstances requytit thairto, sic as the time of the eir, quantity of the
watter and time of the use heirof, for it is not aggreabill to all persounis at
all times, not to be takin at pleasure of every one in quantity, as nane other
mineral watter. it this watter is of greitest vertew in the Monethis of Iunij,
Iulij, August After the xx. day of September it tynes the Medicinal stre^th
quhill the nixt eir thairefter. Quhairfoir the commodious time should be
obseruit, asweill of the day, as of the Month, and to be drunkir at morning,
fastand thairefter three houris, as after ane Medicinal potioun. The negligent
use heirof hes frustrat money of their cure, quha sone after the drinking of
this Medicinal watter, hes takin outher meit or drink, quhairby they stoppit
the operatioun of the watter drunkin of befoir. I will not make reheirsall of
the money particular persounis quha hes obtenit their health, being vexit with
diueris disesis be the use of this watter, be ressoun it war to lang. I traist
albeit I speik na farther at this time, nor that quhilk hes been obseruit be
experience, the eirly use thairof sall give occasioun to leirnit Phisicianis to
Intreit the good succes thairof mair largely in times cumming.

FINIS.
