FAIR WARNING, OR, THE Burnt Child Dreads the Fire.
To the True Hearted Nobility, the Loyal Gentry, and Commonalty of this poor
distracted and divided Kingdom of England, etc.
Great Sirs,
I Protest that I have no design or desire to revive you or your Predecessors
Misfortunes, or to involve you in new ones, but only to caution y^u, That you
split not on the same Rock again which our Forefathers had the ill hap to do,
for if we should, the whole World may laugh at us for our weakness. I confess
it is a melancholy thing to reflect upon Crimes, but not always so upon Loss^s,
since we may be necessi^ated to embrace the last, out of a Conscience to evade
the first. It was a sad Omen to this Kingdom, to have the Sun Eclipsed that
very hour the first Long Parliament began (November. 3. 1640.) and though it was
not visible here, yet the Eff^cts were not clouded from our Eyes, for no Age
was ever blessed with a more Pious Prince, or any that ever brought forth more
crooked Natures to perplex a Righteous Soul: it was his good Nature and easy
Cond^scentions that gave their dark Practices confidence to app^ar in the
light, whose yielding Clemency (thinking, like the Sun, by attracting Vapors,
to disperse them) they with the help of a Northern Fog, condensed into a Cloud,
that first darkened, then rained Blood all over the Land; and what Number or
Power was not able to overthrow, Treachery or Bribery did on a sudden ruin.
Now in the close of Miseries, behold an Action detestable, beyond expr^ssion: a
Misfortune which, heightened with accumalated Injuries, deserves to be looked on
with a compassionate Eye, and a bleeding Heart; Is it not a most sorrowful
Object, to see a King set forth to Sale, to behold Majesty become Merchandise,
and Sovereignty sold for Silver; to see a Prince weighed in a Treacherous and
Perfidious Balance, made to turn which way Coin should move the Beam; to
deliver him up for the same cause Aristides was Bani^h'd (Iustus quia Iustus)
and at leng^h to Cruc^fie him between two Thieves? which two at this day do too
much predominate in their Secret Cabals and open Attempts, witness the present
most damnable Plot of the Papist at this time; which I pray God discover
manifestly to their eternal shame* also the great hopes their Brethren, the
Presbyterians, and other Sectaries have of carrying on their Designs the more
secretly under the covert and color of this Hellish Plot. That they have great
hopes to overthrow the Government of Church and State once more, is legible by
the bold Speeches and Threats every where; nay in the late Election in Essex,
they took the Impudence to tell the Loyal Gentry there, they would Fight for it
once more. For if any man do but speak a word in the Vindication of His Majesty
or the Government, it is crime enough to blast him for a Papist, and then to
the Press, and stigmatize him with some mark of Infamy. This was the Preludium
to the late Rebellion; loud Clamours against Popery and Arbitrary Government,
Tyranny and Oppression; these were the Bugbears that they frighted the Common
People with, and set them a work to cry out for a Refo^mation, and Liberty and
Ease from Taxes, especially that Arbitrary Tax, called Ship Money; and for the
Ease of the People they brought in Excise, their Public Faith Money, Free
Loans, their Fifty Subsidies and Eighteen several other Taxes: so that they
drained out of the Kingdom above Forty Millions of Money, besides the Blood of
above One Hundred Thousand Innocent Men shed, and their Plundering,
Sequestrating, Imprisoning all that either truly Feared God and Honored their
King. Any Man that both saw and felt the Effects of the late Rebellion, cannot
but do his Endeavor to prevent our relapsing into that Condition again. I
beseech God to move the Hearts of all those Loyal Souls that have any thing of
Conscience or Religion left, to unite and stand up as one Man for their King
and Country, and maintenance of the true Protestant Religion, as it is now
Established by Law: for all these new upstart Religions are but old Errors
raked out of their Ashes. I pray read the following Catalogue, which is but a
taste of the many Thousands that might be laid open to your view.
