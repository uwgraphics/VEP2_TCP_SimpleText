Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this Death!
Romans 7.24. But God commended his love toward us, in that whilst we were yet
Enemies, Christ dyed for us. Romans 5.8. LONDON: Printed by Robert Ibbitson, for

TO THE Right Honorable, and Right Religious Lord, Robert Earl of Warwick,
Baron of Leez, and to the truly Noble, and truly virtuous, the Lady Elianor,
Countess of Warwick, his most pious Consort. E. B. wishes to your present
prosperities, the addition of many days, increase of Grace in this life, and
the full fruition of Glory in the life to come.
Right Honorable,
IT was the purpose of my dear Husband deceased, to have presented these his
Works unto you Both, by an Epistle Dedicatory, wherein he would have spoken
his gratitude for your manifold favors. And when his wasting weaknesses had
rendered him unfit for that intended service, he desired, if these manuscripts
should be esteemed worthy of public view, they might come abroad under your
Honors Patronage, to be living evidences of his high respect and unfeigned
thankfulness. This Narrative will, I humbly hope, make a satisfying Apology
for my presumption, in prefixing your noble Names before these his Sermons,
which are likely to find the same good acceptance from the Press (as some
eminently pious and learned, upon the perusal of them judge) which they
received from the Pulpit.

My prayers are, that Your Selves and Your Family, may both here and hereafter
reap the fruit of all those encouragements, which many famous Ministers (some
dead, and others surviving to do service) have received from Your Honors
favor.

I humbly crave your acceptance of this Widows mite of Gratitude, for all the
expressions of Your respect, both to my reverend Husband and worthless self.

Right Honorable, I am under many Obligations bound to be

Your Honors humble Servant, ELIANOR BOLTON.

An Epistle to the Reader.
THE Books of learned and godly Ministers, published by others after their
death's, do for the most part come far short of those Books, which they
themselves publish in their lives time. The children of their brains being
herein, like unto the children of their bodies, who many times live plentifully
while their Fathers live, but meet with much hardship after their death's. It
may be said of the posthumous works of most men in comparison of their first
works Printed by themselves, as it is of Abishai and Benaiah, 2 Samuel 23.19.23.
They were very valiant and honorable men, but they attained not unto the three
first Worthies of David.

But it fairs far otherwise with this our Reverend Brother, he has attained a
double happiness which few arrive unto. These ensuing Sermons were written out
in a fair and legible Character, and prepared for the Press in his life time,
and wherein they were defective, they have been supplied and made up, by an
able, learned, and judicious Friend; so that the Reader may assure himself that
they are no whit inferior to those other Books, which he himself set forth, and
that these Fatherless children, suffer no considerable prejudice by their
Authors death.

The Subjects treated on in this Book, are all of them of singular use and
benefit. Here you have exactly proved, That Sin is the greatest of Evils, and
therefore calls for the greatest sorrow, the greatest hatred, the greatest care
to avoid it, and to be rid of it. That the heart of Jesus Christ is exceedingly
taken with his Church and people, and that therefore his people ought to be
exceedingly in love with him. Here you have the Nature, Necessity, and
Difficulty of Faith, learnedly and practically handled, and especially the
Privileges and Royalties of it. Here also is showed the Cause and Cure of
Hypocrisy; And how far a man may go toward Heaven, and yet fall short of it.

The truth is, As the rude Satyr in Plutarch, who strove to make a dead man
stand upright, had so much wit as to say, Deest aliquid intus, there wants a
principle within to enable him to stand. So may I truly say of him that shall
read this Book, and not be very well pleased with the matter therein contained,
Deest aliquid intus, he wants a principle of grace within, to cause him to
close with such wholesome, spiritual, and heavenly truths.

There are other very profitable Treatises of this our Reverend, and godly
Brother (prepared by himself for the Press) yet behind, which may happily be
brought to light, if God shall please to cause this Book to find acceptance
with his people, for whose spiritual advantage it is intended; And that it may
obtain the end for which it is Printed, is the Prayer of

Thy Servant in the Work of the Ministry, ED. CALAMY.

THE CONTENTS OF Sin the greatest Evil.
2 Samuel 24.10. And now I beseech thee, take away the iniquity of thy servant,
for I have done very foolishly.
THe occasion of the words. p. 1. Parts of the Text. p. 3. Words opened. Ibid.
The letter of the words speak three Doctrins. First, Gods servants may commit
sin, commit iniquity, the iniquity of thy servant. Ibid. Secondly, Fresh
sinning, must have fresh repentings. Ibid. Thirdly, There needs fresh pardon,
for fresh revoltings. Ibid. Doctrines handled are two, First, Sin is, and Gods
people do apprehend it to be, the greatest Evil in the World. Secondly, When
God threatens to punish sin, it is the best way to run to God, to take away
sin. p. 3. First Doctrine. p. 4.
That sin is the greatest Evil; Showed, First, By Collation. Secondly, By
Demonstration. First, By Collation and Comparison. First, Most of all other
evils are but outward. Secondly, All other evils are but of a temporal
nature, they have an end, this evil is of an eternal nature. Thirdly, All other
evils do not make a man the subject of Gods wrath. Fourthly, Other evils do
but oppose our well being, nay only our well being for present. Fifthly, Other
evils are but destructive to a man's self, fight but against particulars.
Sixthly, All other evils are Gods Creatures, and so far good. Seventhly, Other
evils are used by God, as medicines either, First, To prevent this; or
Secondly, for the cure of this. p. 4, 5.

Doctrines proved by Demonstration. 1 That which fights against, and opposes
the greatest good, must needs be the greatest evil. p. 5, 6. Secondly, That
which is universally evil, all evil, and no good, must needs be the greatest
evil, but sin is all evil, etc. p. 6. Thirdly, That which is the sole object of
Gods hatred, must needs be the greatest evil; but sin is, etc. Fourthly, That
which separates the soul from the chief good, must needs be the greatest evil.
p. 7. Fifthly, That which is the ground and cause of all other evils, must
needs be the greatest evil; but sin is, etc. p. 8. National evils, 1. Wars, 2.
Famine, 3. Pestilence; personal; temporal, spiritual, eternal. p. 8. Sixthly,
That which is worse than the utmost evil, must needs be the greatest evil; but
sin is worse than the utmost evils, worse than Hell. p. 9. Second part of the
Doctrine (as sin is in it self so) In the apprehensions of Gods people, sin is
the greatest evil; and this appears by p. 9. 1. Their sighs for sin. 2. By
their sufferings to avoid sin, they have esteemed sin worse than 1. Poverty. 2.
Prisons. 3. Death. 4. Hell it self. p. 10.


Consectaries, or Uses. 1. Let us fall down, and admire the wisdom, and adore
the goodness of God, who out of the greatest evil, could bring the greatest
good, be humbled for the fault, and bless God for the remedy. p. 11. 2. Hence
conclude it is the saddest punishment, the fearfullest judgment in the World,
to be given up to sin. Ibid. 3. See what fools they are, who seek to be rid
of other evils, by the admission of sin. p. 12. 4. If sin be the greatest
evil, what then is sin circumstantiated, sin compounded, sin made exceeding
sinful? p. 13. 5. See what fools they are, who make a mock of sin, who sport
with Hell, he who sports with sin, sports with Christ, with killing Christ,
and tearing the flesh of Christ. p. 14. 6. See the utter impossibility of any
thing under Heaven to help us from under the guilt of sin, save Jesus Christ
only, infinite Righteousness is required for one sin, no more for a thousand
sins; no Righteousness proportionable to the evil of sin, but Christ's. p. 15
First, Not our own. Secondly, Nor will the Righteousness of the Law. Thirdly,
It is not the Righteousness of Angels, it must be infinite wisdom to find
out a way; it must be infinite mercy to pardon, infinite power to subdue;
infinite merit to purge and cleanse, infinite grace to destroy sin. p. 16
7 See how much we are bound to Christ who has born our sins, who has an
interest in him. p. 17 And secondly, who has so born them, that we shall not
bear them.
Eight Consectary. If sin be the greatest evil, it then calls out, First, For
the greatest sorrow, though not to the quantity and bulk, yet in quality and
worth; though not in strength, yet in length, and continuance. p. 20 Sorrow
proportionable to the measure and greatness of sin. p. 21 -- To the merit, and
desert of sin. p. 22
Secondly It calls for the greatest hatred. p. 22 Thirdly for the greatest care
to avoid, and he that is careful to avoid, will be acquainted with the falls
of others, with the weakness of his own heart, he is acquainted with the
power and policy of Satan, with the danger and deceitfulness of sin. Deceitful
in Its Objects. Arguments. Pretenses. Excuses. Incroaches. Promises. p. 22, 23

Fourthly, It calls for the greatest endeavors to be rid of it; this evil if
it be kept, makes our good evil; where on the contrary, if sin be removed,
the evil of the evil is taken away. Sin is the sting of every affliction;
Therefore First, Let us choose the greatest evil in the World, rather than the
least sin. Secondly, Let us pity, and pray for such, as are under the state of
sin. p. 24 Thirdly, Let us admire the greatness
First, Of the patience of God in bearing with sinners. And that if you
consider, Sin is contrary First, To Gods works. Secondly, To Gods Nature.
Thirdly, To Gods Will. p. 25

Secondly, Let us admire the greatness of Gods mercy in pardoning sin. p. 26
Thirdly, See what cause we have to humble our selves, that we have had such
slight thoughts of sin. Six Glasses wherein sin is presented, to show sin is
exceeding sinful. Look upon it in the 1 Glass of Nature. p. 72 2 Glass of the
Law. p. 27, 28 3 Glass of griefs woundings, peircings, which The Saints have
found First, In their Admission into the state of Grace. Secondly, In their
relapsings into sin. p. 28
4 Look upon sin in Adam. p. 28 5 Look upon sin in Christ. p. 28 6 In the
damnation of the soul. p. 29


Use 1. See what need we have to aggravate sin to the utmost in our
confessions. p. 29 Six Singular fruits of so doing. p. 30
Use 2. If sin be the greatest evil, then it is the greatest mercy in the
World to be rid of it. p. 31 That appears in these particulars. 1. It is the
dearest bought-mercy. p. 31 2. It is the purest mercy. p. 32 3. It is the
freest mercy of all other, in two particulars. p. 32, 33 4. It is an intituling
mercy. p. 33 5. It is an irrevocable mercy. p. 33, 34 6. It is an universal
mercy, the womb of mercy. p. 34
Seven Glorious fruits of pardon of sin. p. 34, 35 First Use, Labor above all
things to get pardon of sin.

Five sorts of men, who do but dally, and trifle with God about pardon of sin.

these. PArts of the Chapter. p. 185, 186. Parts of the Text. 187. 1 Question
arising out of the words. p. 187. Answered Ibid. and p. 188. 2 Question for
unfoulding of the words, answered. p. 188. Doctrins from the scope of the Text.
1 Doct. The eyes of Christ run through the world, and behold the evil and the
good. Three Uses made of it. p. 189.
2 Doct. Such is the goodness of God, that he commends us for that which is
his own. Two Uses made of this. p. 189.
Doctrins the Text more fully holds forth. First, That slownesse of heart to
believe, is a temper of spirit very offensive unto God. Secondly, It is very
pleasing unto God, when we will believe in him upon small Revelation. Thirdly,
God will reveal great things to them who do so believe in him.
The first Doctrine cleared. p. 190, 191. That we are slow of heart to believe,
demonstrated in five particulars. The 1 Greatness of that power put forth in
the working Faith. p. 191, 192. 2 The complaints of sinners when they come
first to believe. p. 192, 193. 3 Rhetoric work God uses to a poor humbled
cast down sinner to bring him to believe. p. 193. 4 Way God takes to confirm
the covenant of mercy to believers. p. 194. 5 Complaints of the Preacher. p.

Grounds of the slownesse of heart to believe. First, From Satan who has two
stratagems. p. 195, 196, 197. Secondly, From themselves. 1 From ignorance. p.
197. 2 Pride. 3 Too much tenderness. p. 198, 199. 4 Doubt of Gods will. p.
200. 5 Some rest on this side Christ. p. 200, 201.

We look upon their height. p. 203. 2 -- Upon others depths. p. 204. 205. 206.
Three Reasons why this frame of spirit is so offensive to God. 1 It argues and
speaks a corrupt heart. p. 207. 2 As much as in it lies it makes void all the
stupendous things of God. p. 107. in particular. 1 The great counsel of God. 2
The thoughts of his mercy. 3 The purposes of Gods mercy to thee. p. 20. 4
Frustrates the expectation of God. p. 209. 5 Gods end in sending Christ. 6 The
death of Christ. 7 The promises of God to Christ. p. 209.

3 Reason, this keeps a man in an unserviceable condition both to God and Man.
p. 210, 211. Use, See how Satan does delude their souls whom he persuades not
to believe is a virtue, is a thing pleasing unto God. p. 212. Reasonings of
poor souls why they must not believe. p. 213. 2 Use of Exhortation to three
things. 1 To be convinced of the greatness of the sin. 1 You wrong God. 2 You

him. p. 221. Faith a weapon to be weilded against seven charges of Satan. p.
221, 222.
THE CONTENTS. OF HYPOCRISY. ISAIAH 58.2.
THe World divided into four ranks of men. p. 26 Those that are in the pale of
the Church ranked in three sorts. ibid. Those that are pretenders for Heaven,
into two sorts; of which are, the 1 Formal Christian. ibid. 2 Upright and
sincere Christian. ibid.
The Text opened. ibid. Doct. That it is possible for a man to do much in the
ways of God, even to abound in all outward performances, and yet be false at
heart, and have an unsound spirit here, and miss of Heaven hereafter. p. 263
The Doctrine proved and cleared by diverse Particulars; as The first Particular
is, 1 He may hear the Word. p. 265 2 May abound in hearing. ibid. 3 May hear
with affection. ibid.
Four kinds of affections that a Formalist may hear with, 1 With affection of
wonder and astonishment. p. 266 2 Affection of fear and trembling. ibid. 3 With
delight and some kind of love. ibid. 4 With affection of Joy. ibid.
Secondly, A man may not only hope, but pray too, nay, make many Prayers. ibid.
And he may join fasting to prayer. ibid.
Thirdly, A man may seem to be humbled, to mourn, and to weep for sin, and yet
be unsound. p. 267 There are four sorts of tears. ibid. 1 Tears of Anger.
ibid. 2 Tears of desparation, such as are the damned in Hell. ibid. 3 Tears of
compassion. ibid. 4 Tears of Godly-sorrow. ibid.
Fourthly, A man may seem to do much, walk in many ways of duty in outward
show of obedience, to the letter of command. ibid. Fifthly, A man may cast up
his vomit, disgorge himself of all his old ways. p. 268 He may leave sin,
either, 1 Out of fear of evil ibid. 2 Out of a weariness of it. ibid. 3 Out of
love of some contrary sin. ibid. 4 Out of want of fit Instruments, and means to
compass his sin. ibid.
Sixthly, A man may accompany himself with the People of God. ibid. Seventhly,
A man may not only do, but suffer too, and yet be unsound. ibid. Reasons are,
1 Reas. Because no unsound spirit has any thing in it, which is essential to a
Christian, as a Christian. ibid. 2 Reas. Because a false professor may have a
complete resemblance of a Christian in all those things which are not essential
to a Christian. p. 269

Thus the first thing is cleared, now we come to the second thing propounded.
Secondly, How it may stand with 1 Gods end. 2 Satan's end. 3 A man's own ends, to
abound in duty, and yet not be sincere.
First, It may stand with Gods ends, both 1 Toward the good, and they are
merciful ends. 2 Toward the bad, and they are partly merciful, and partly
judicial.
First, It may stand with Gods ends toward the good, and they are merciful
ends. ibid. and p. 270 First, That God may serve his own glory by them, for the
bringing in, and building up of the godly. ibid. Secondly, God suffers unsound
hearts to abound in duties, to maintain an holy jealousy and watchfulness in
the hearts of his own people. p. 271 Thirdly, To make us see there is something
in duty more than duty, which sets a value upon duty, and makes it of worth.
ibid. Fourthly, To tell us that there are other things to be done of a
Christian, than merely to pray here. p. 272 Fifthly, To make his people more
solicitous, after surer, more stable, and proving evidences than these are.
ibid. Secondly, As it may stand with Gods ends to the good, so it may stand
with Gods ends to the bad. 1 His merciful ends. p. 273 2 His judicial ends.
ibid.
Secondly, It may stand also with Satan's ends, and that 1 Toward the good. p.
274 2 Toward the world. ibid. 3 Toward themselves. ibid.
1 It may stand with Satan's ends toward the good. 1 Hereby Satan does labor
to cause Gods people to throw off the work, to desist in their way. ibid. 2 If
he cannot prevail with Gods people, to throw off the work, yet he has a
second end, and that is to discourage Gods people in the work. ibid. 3 If Satan
cannot prevail thus far, yet he labors by these men to scandalize the godly,
to bring evil reports on all that walk in the ways of life. p. 275
You know how wicked men argue, viz. 1 Either from particulars to generals.
ibid. Or 2 By the failing of the person. ibid.
Secondly, It may stand with Satan's end, in respect of the world, as 1 To keep
them off from entering upon the way of life. p. 276 2 To strengthen the
prejudice of wicked men against the ways and people of God. ibid. 3 Hereby he
hardens them in a way of sin. ibid.
Thirdly, How it may stand with Satan's ends, toward themselves that thus
abound in duty, and yet are unsound. ibid. 1 To aggravate their condemnation.
ibid. 2 Because such men are surest his of any, and that on two grounds. ibid.
1 If he stands in that condition, he thinks he is sure enough. ibid 2 If he
falls, he thinks him sure enough, because the hazard is great. p. 277 3 It may
stand yet further with Satan's ends, because he hopes to have some further good
of them another day. p. 278
For the Devil knows, 1 They will be the surest and trustiest servants to him
of any. p. 279
None in the world have more of the infernal nature than they. p. 280 Thirdly,
How it may stand with their own ends, who having corrupt hearts, yet should
notwithstanding abound in duty. 1 To answer the cases of conscience. ibid. 2 To
pacify the quarrels, to satisfy the gripes, and gnawings of conscience. p. 281
Conviction does arise from some common, not saving light, and that, 1 Because
it discovers gross sins, not secret sins. 2 It discovers open sins, not
spiritual sins. ibid. 3 It discovers no sin, as sin, in the nature of it. ibid.
Other ends there are, which are more low than the former, as 1 For ostentation
and gifts of pride. p. 282 2 For affection, credit, and esteem in the world.
ibid. 3 For the advancement of their worldly designs. ibid. 4 That by this
means they might procure Gods blessings on them in this life. ibid.
Next thing is to show what the grounds are whence it arises, that a corrupt
heart may abound in outward performances. p. 283 First ground is natural
conscience. ibid. Second ground is some present distress and trouble on the
conscience, or upon the bodies of men, upon the spirit or flesh of men. ibid.
and p. 284 1 Some present distress upon the spirit. 2 Outward pressures on the
body. ibid.

The fourth thing remains, which is four, where the fault lies, or how it comes
to pass, and that in six particulars. p. 285 1 He fails in the latitude or
extent of his obedience. He is limited, 1 Either to some command most
suitable, 2 Or to the flesh, that is, to the outward of the command. ibid.
2 He is faulty in the manner of his obedience. p. 286 3 He is faulty in his
aims and ends. ibid. 4 He is faulty, in that he rests upon what he does,
and looks no higher. p. 287 4 He makes it self his obedience, which should
quicken his Obedience. ibid. 6 These spiritual performances do not arise from
spiritual Principles. ibid.
There is a fourfold change. 1 A Moral change. p. 288 2 A Partial change. ibid.
3 A Formal change. ibid. 4 A Spiritual change; But not new ibid. 1 For
substance of soul and body. p. 289. 2 For faculties of soul and body. ibid.

Object. Nature cannot act ultra sphaeram, above it self, nature cannot go any
further than Nature. Answered. ibid. -- It is true in the main, but Nature may
be strengthened from above. ibid. Nature considered in diverse forms and
ranks. 1 There is a mere Nature with those relics, (as some say) But I say
restored Principles. ibid. 2 Nature civilized, and moralized. 3 Nature
sublimated. p. 290
Thus you see the Doctrine cleared, and the fourth thing answered. 1 He is a
man, who was never humbled for sin. ibid. 2 He is a man, that was never truly
cast out of himself. ibid. 3 He is a man, that was never fully changed. ibid.
4 He is a man, who is carried upon holy works with a slavish heart. ibid.
There are two great weights that carry him about. 1 Fear of Hell. p. 291 2
Hope of Heaven. ibid.
Use If a man do thus much, and yet fall short of Heaven, what then shall
become of them that do nothing? ibid. Sincerity lies in laboring, and how.
ibid.
These things are necessary. 1 Necessitate Precepti, God has commanded them. 2
Necessitate Medii, they are the way to life. ibid.
Object. This discourageth us, If a man may do thus much, and yet fall short of
Heaven, then it is as good to sit still and do nothing. Answered. p. 292 We
should argue after this manner. Because I may do all this, and yet not be
sincere, therefore I will labor to be sincere in the doing of them. ibid.
Second Use. Discovers the sandinesse and unsafenesse of those bottoms to rest
a man's soul upon. ibid. To stir up those that fear God to get better evidences.
p. 293 1 Because evidences of this kind are obscure, full of ambiguity. ibid.
2 Because they are unconstant and instable. p. 294
Fetch your evidences from your Justification, your interest in Christ, in the
Covenant. These are 1 The clearest. ibid. and p. 295 2 The purest. ibid. 3 The
most satisfying. p. 296 4 The most constant evidences. p. 297
Third Use. If it be possible to do thus much and be unsound, then what care
ought there to be to clear the soundness of our spirits in our performances?
p. 298 First, Clear the sincerity of your hearts in your performances in
particular, and that in three things. 1 In your hearing. p. 299 2 In your
praying. ibid. 3 In your mourning for sin. ibid.
First, A sincere heart desires sincere preaching. ibid. As 1 He desires to
receive the truth of God p. 301 2 He is willing to receive every truth of God.
ibid. 3 He is willing to receive it as the truth of God. ibid.
But now an unsound spirit, 1 He is not willing to receive the truth. 2 Not
every truth. 3 Not as truth; As not 1 For it self. ibid. and p. 302 2 Not to
be a King over them. ibid.

Thirdly, Now an honest heart in hearing, is such as 1 Hears the word as Gods
word. 2 He sides with the word of God against himself. 3 He desires to profit
by the word. ibid. 4 He hears the word with reflection. p. 303
Secondly, To clear the sincerity of your hearts in matter of Prayer. First

duty with all our strength. ibid. Second Character. There is no rest nor
content to the soul, till the heart be wrought to the work. p. 304 Third

duty? ibid. Answered. p. 306 1 In general, Thou meetest, and have communion
with God in duty, when God has enabled thee to act grace in a duty. ibid. 2
When the performance of a duty does lead the soul into better freedom. p. 307
Fourth Character. A heart sincere in prayer, does rise up praying from prayer,
he goes away with affection of, and to prayer, after the prayer is done. ibid.
and p. 308 Fifth Character. A heart sincere in prayer, does eye it self in
prayer. It is a heart that diligently observes it self in duty, views all the
workings of the soul, and takes notice of all the imperfections of the soul in
duty. p. 308, 309 Sixth Character. A heart sincere in prayer, is a praying
heart. p. 310 Object. But you will say, Then all our hearts are sincere, for
who is it that does not desire the thing he prays for. Answered. p. 310 1
Thou prayest for grace, but thou do not desire grace in the beauty and extent
of it. ibid. 2 Thou prayest for the subduing of thy lust; but do thou desire
what thou prayest for? p. 311 3 You pray for Heaven, and one would think you
did desire this; but do thou know what Heaven is, when thou prayest for
Heaven? p. 312
Heaven not desirable to corrupt hearts, in several particulars. p. 313 Seventh

SIN THE GREATEST EVIL*
2 SAMUEL 24.10. And now, I beseech thee, Take away the iniquity of thy servant:
for I have done very foolishly.
THE occasion of these words, was the hand of God upon the Children of Israel,
for David's Sin of Numbering the people.

You read in Verse 2. That David commanded Joab to go and number the people;
and, at the first, Joab he dissuaded him.

But you will say, Was it not lawful to number the people? Did not Moses the
same in the Wilderness, and Joshua, and Nehemiah?

Yea; But Joab saw the pride of David's heart in it; as appears by his answer in
Verse 3. -- And Joab said unto the King, Now the Lord thy God add unto the
people, how many soever they be, an hundred fold. But why does my Lord the King
delight in this thing? notwithstanding the Kings word prevailed against Joab;
though indeed to his trouble, and Isreal's cost.

Happy had it been for David, and Israel too, if the work had not been done.
But Joab goes, and the number is brought in; There were Eight hundred thousand
valiant men that drew sword, and the men of Judah were Five hundred thousand.

Well, But what was the Fruit? what was the Effect of this?

1. You read, -- David's heart smote him, Verse 10. that is, His Conscience
accused him. If Conscience be not a Bridle, it will be a Whip; if it be not a
Curb, it will be a Scourge; if you will not hear the Warnings, you shall feel
the Lashings of Conscience; if it do not restrain from sin, Monendo, by
Admonition, it will put us to Pain in sin, Mordendo, by Contrition.

2. But there was not all, God would punish him for the sin; And you may read
the Sin in the Punishment: He had Gloried in the Number, and therefore God
would Lessen the Number.

Yet he puts it to his choice, which of the Three judgments he propounds
(whether Seven years Famine, or Three months flight before his Enemies, or
Three days Pestilence) he would take.

Every one was Flagellum Mundans, A sweeping Scourge.

But mark David's behavior, God threatens judg^ment, and David goes and Mourns
for sin: For David's heart smiting, and his Prayer, though set before, yet seem
to be afterward, and an effect of the Prophets discovery of sin; as appears by
the Verse following the Text; For -- When David was up in the morning, the word
of the Lord came unto Gad David's Seer -- where you see it is rendered as a
reason, why his heart smote him, and why he prayed thus -- because the Prophet
had been with him, and had convinced him of his sin, and denounced Gods
judgments against him; whereupon David's heart smote him, and he prays -- Take
away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

But here it may be demanded. Why, when God threatened judgment, David should
go and pray for pardon of sin? why did he not desire GOD rather To forbear his
strokes? To avert and turn away his wrath? Than merely To Beg pardon of sin?
or, if he had desired this, yet why did he not Beg the other, as well as that,
and join them together in the same Petition?

Answ. 1. To teach us in all the pressures and evils upon our Outward man, to
turn our thoughts Inward, and lament sin.

2. Because he saw sin the Cause of judgment; and therefore desires the
removing of this, that so the other might be withdrawn also.

3. Because he knew the judgment could never be removed in Mercy, unless the
sin were taken away. Every Preservation is but a Reservation; every Deliverance
is in justice, not in mercy, if sin be not taken away.

4. He was more apprehensive of the Dishonor of GOD, by his sin, than of any
judgment that his sin had brought upon him. Or,

5. He sees sin The Greatest Evil, and therefore seeks the redress of that,
rather than of any other Evil -- Take away the iniquity of thy servant.

In the Text you may observe Two Parts of Prayer: I. Confession. II. Petition.


1. Confession, with self-judging -- For I have done very foolishly.

2. Petition -- Take away the iniquity of thy servant, joined with faith. Or
here you have,

1. The Petitioner, David, set forth from his Relation -- Thy Servant.

2. The Petitioned: GOD.

3. The Petition it self -- Take away, or Pardon the iniquity of thy servant;
for the phrase seems to have respect to the Scapegoat, a Type of Christ, which
was to Carry away the sins of the People into the wilderness, Levit. 16.22.
thereby signifying Christ's taking away sin.

There is little difficulty in the words, but what we may make a difficulty.

As indeed it would be a making of difficulties, to go about to expound that
which is so plain, rather than an unsolding of them, if I should tell you of
the several distinctions men make of sin, Three words in the Hebrew, Exodus 34.7.
(...) By one they will have to be meant Original Sin; by another, Infirmities;
by the other your Grosser Sins. But upon examination, I find them used
promiscuously; and therefore such distinctions of them has no bottom.

The letter of the words, and outward face of the Text, speaks Three Doctrines.

1. That GODS servants may commit sin, commit iniquity -- The iniquity of thy
servant.

2. Fresh sinnings must have Fresh repentings; If you Renew your sins, you must
Renew your Sorrows.

3. There needs fresh pardon, for fresh revoltings: Take away. He does not say,
Assure me it is taken away; but -- Take away. But this will not be the subject
of my discourse now.

That which I intend to speak to, shall be,

The Time and Occasion of these words, which was, when GODS judgments were
threatened against him.

1. Sin truly is, and GODS people do apprehend it to be, The Greatest evil in
the world.

He does not say, Take away the Plague, take away the Judgment threatened; but,
Take away this Sin. He looked upon sin as the Greatest Evil.

2. When GOD threatens to punish sin, it is the best way to run unto GOD to
Take away sin. Or, When GODS hand is either Felt or Feared, it should be a
Christians wisdom To Repent of sin, To Desire sin removed.

We begin with the first,

That sin truly is, and GODS people do apprehend it to be, The Greatest Evil in
the world.

We will take it, 1. In its Pieces. 2. We will close them.

1. The Doctrine does part it self into Two parts: 1. That sin is the Greatest
Evil in the world. 2. That GODS people apprehend it to be the Greatest evil in
the world.


1. Sin the greatest evil in the world.
1. For the first, That sin is the greatest Evil in the world: I may show this,
1. By Collation and Comparison of this with other evils. 2. By Demonstration
and Proof of it to you.


1. If you Compare the Evil of sin, with other evils, you shall see how short
All other kind of Evils are to this Evil of Sin.

other evils are but outward: They are but such as are on the Body, the Estate,
the Name; but this is An Inward Evil. An evil upon the Soul, which is the
Greatest of Evils.

All other evils are but of a temporal nature: They have An End, Poverty,
Sickness, Disgrace, all these are great evils; but these, and all other, they
have An End: Death puts the conclusion to them all. But This Evil of sin is of
an Eternal nature, that shall never have end. Eternity it self shall put no
period to this.

All other evils do not make a man the subject of GODS wrath and hatred. A man
may have all other evils, and yet be in the Love of GOD. Thou may be Poor,
and yet Precious in GODS esteem; thou may be under all Kind of miseries, and
yet Dear in GODS thoughts to thee.

But now this is an evil, that makes the soul the subject of GODS wrath and
hatred.

As the Absence of all other goods, the Presence of all created evils, will not
make thee Hateful to GOD, if Sin be not there: So the Presence of all other
goods, and Absence of all other evils, will not render thee Lovely, if sin be
there.

All other Evils do but oppose your well-being, nay, and your well-being for
present (for they cannot rob you of future happiness) But this opposes your
well-being for ever: For you cannot be Happy, if you be not Holy; Nay, this
opposes your Being. It brought Death; you would sin your selves into Nothing
again, if GOD did not hold you up To be, that you might Be miserable for sin.

All other evils are but Destructive to a man's self: fight but against
Particulars: But this is contrary to the Universal Good, contrary to GOD; and
(as far as it may) Destructive to the very Being of God: As I shall show
hereafter.

All other evils are GODS creatures, and so far good. He owns all the rest, he
is the Author of all the rest -- Is there any evil in the City that I have not
done? Amos 3.6. meaning, All the Evil of Punishment Penal, not Sinful Evil: But
this is the Devils Creature, yea, and worse than he, being All sin.

7. All other Evils are Gods Physic, and used as Medicines, 1. For prevention
of this. Or, 2. For the cure of this.


1. For prevention of this -- That you might not be condemned with the world,
he lays afflictions and evils upon you, 1 Cor. 11.32.

He suffered Satan to tempt Paul, and gave him up to his buffetings, which yet
is the Greatest Evil in the world next to sin, the Greatest penal Evil in the
world: And all to prevent sin; as the Apostle himself says, 2 Cor. 12.7. --
God sent a Messenger of Satan to buffet him -- And what was the reason? why it
was to prevent sin -- Lest he should be exalted above measure: that is, left he
should be proud. And as he uses all other Evils for Prevention. So,

2. For the cure of sin. And you know, no Medicine can be so bad, as is this
Disease. Now all other Evils God has laid upon his people for the cure of sin,
or for the recovery of them out of the state of sin.

And to speak as much as I can at once, There is not so much evil in the
Damnation of a Thousand worlds of men for sin; As there is evil in the Least
sin; the least sinful thought that rises upon your spirits; inasmuch as the
good of these, falls short of the good and glory of God.

Thus you see, by Collation and Comparison of this Evil with others (in which I
might much more enlarge my self) that, Of all Evils, Sin is the greatest Evil,
We will now come to

2. The Demonstration of the Point. 2. Demonstrations.


1. Demonstration.
1. That which fights against, and opposes the greatest Good, 1.
Demonstration or Reason Sin opposes the greatest good: 1. God.
must needs be the greatest Evil* But now Sin opposes and fights against the
greatest Good. Hence a Father calls sin, Dei-cidium, God-slaughter, that which
strikes against the Being and Essence of God, that which (were it strong
enough) were it Infinitely evil, as God is Infinitely good, would labor to
Un-Be God. God is Summum Bonum; and indeed, Non datur Summum Malum, sin cannot
be infinite.

If Sin were as evil, as God is good; that is, Adequately, and Proportionably;
if Infinitely evil, as God is good, sin would be Too hard for God to pardon, it
would be Too hard for God to subdue, Too hard for God to Conquer; Sin would
endeavor to conquer God.

Indeed, there is more evil in the least sin, than there is good in any, nay
all the Angels of Heaven; and therefore you see it conquered them, spoiled all
their goodness, made them Devils; which it could not have done, if the good in
them had been greater than the Evil in sin.

And, though it be not able to conquer God, to overcome him (there is more
goodness in God, than Evil in Ten Thousand Hells of sin; and so it cannot
overcome the power of God, the mercy of God, the holiness of God) yet it fights
against God, and makes party against him every day. It musters up all its
strength against God, and comes into open field to Bid Defiance against him
every day.

Nay, when it is beaten out of the open field, by the power of God, and his
Ordinances, then it has strong Holds, as the Apostle tells us, 2 Cor. 10.4.
and from thence fights against him, and opposes him; there it lusts against
him, it wills against him, the heart rises against him.

When sin is beaten out of the field, yet a long time it will be, before it be
beaten out of strong Holds.

When sin in Practice is overcome and conquered, yet sin in Affection is hard
to be overcome: That Contrariety that is between God and your Heart is hard to
be conquered.

It will cost you many a battle, many an assault, before you can conquer sin in
its strong Holds, overcome sin in the Heart.

Though sometimes it may seem to be overcome, and to render up all: yet
afterward it gathers together again, and will make new and fresh assaults upon
you, to weaken and to wound you.

Nay, and herein lies the Malignity, the poisonous and venomous nature of sin,
that, though God has conquered it, though it be never so weakened, yet will it
act against God, spit its venom still.

An Emblem of it you have in the Thief upon the Cross; that when he was nailed
upon the Cross, his hands and feet made fast, and had but one member loose; yet
that one member could spit its venom at Christ, revile Christ; so, though God
has crucified sin, yet so long as there is any life in it, it will act it
self, and spit venom against God, which shows that Great Contrariety betwixt
God and sin.

And this Contrariety and Opposition of the Chiefest Good, must needs show sin
to be the Greatest Evil.

2. Demonstration.
^. Demonst. sin universally evil, All evil.
2. That which is Universally Evil; all Evil, and no good, must needs be the
Greatest Evil in the world: But sin is All evil.

As we say of God, There is no Evil in him, He is All Good, Quodcunque in Deo
Deus est: So I may say of Sin; There is no Good in it, It is All Evil,
Quodcunque in Peccato Peccatum est.

There is some good in the worst things in the world; and some thing in the
worst things, to make them capable of our choice of them, in some cases; some
good in sickness, some good in Death: But now there is no good in sin, nor can
any considerations in the world make sin the Object of our Choice. Though you
might avoid Death by sin; yet, because sin is Universally Evil, and No good in
it, you may not make use of sin to avoid Death.

And therefore you shall read, That, when the Apostle would speak the worst of
sin, he could find no Name worse than its Own to set it out by, Romans 7.13. ad
finem -- (...) -- Sinful-sin. He calls it Sinful-sin, Nothing but Sin.

3. Demonstration.
3. That, which is the sole Object of Gods hatred, 3. Demonstr. Sin the sole
object of Gods hatred.
must needs be the Greatest evil: But sin is the sole Object. Not only the
Object, but the sole Object of Gods hatred: He hates nothing but Sin.

His love runs in diverse streams toward all things he has made; But his
hatred runs in One Chanel alone, and that is, Toward Sin.

If Man were made the Center of all other Evils in the world, God could Love
him under All, if sin were not there. And, if there be a Confluence of all
other Goods, Health, Beauty, Riches, Learning, etc. God hates you, if Sin alone
be there, Gods love cannot be there, but his wrath abides there.

4. Demonstration.
4. That which separates the soul from the chief good; that, which divides
between the soul, and God the chiefest good, 4. Demonstr. Sin Separates the
soul from the chief Good (i.) God.
must needs be the Greatest Evil: But sin divides betwixt God and the soul,
Isa. 59.2. -- Your iniquities have Separated betwixt you and your God: Betwixt
your souls, and my Grace; your souls, and my Comforts; your souls, and my
Blessings.

It was said of Naaman, That he was a Great man, an Honorable man, a mighty man
of War: But he was a Leper, 2 Kings 5.1. So, whatever Ornaments a man has,
whatever Gifts, Parts, Riches, Beauty, etc. yet, if he be a Leper: though a
Learned man, a Rich man, But a Wicked man, that spoils all the rest.

5. Demonstration.
5. Demonstr. Sin is the root of all other evils.
5. That, which is the ground and cause of all other Evils, must needs be the
Greatest Evil: But sin is the cause of all other Evils.

Is the Old world drowned with water? it is for sin. Is Sodom destroyed with
fire, and turned into an Asphaltite-lake to this day? it is for sin. Is
Jerusalem laid on heaps? Sin has done it. Should I enter on this, I should
find no end.

1. Of National evils.
1. Sin is the cause of All National Evils: We will name some, and but name them.

1. Wars.
1. Wars. Judge. 5.8. -- They chose new Gods: Then was War in the Gates. James
4.1. From whence come wars and fightings among you? is it not from your lusts?

2. Famine.
2. Famine. Psalm. 107.34. -- He turns a fruitful land into a Desert, for the
wickedness of them that dwell therein. Amos 4.6. -- Therefore (sc. for their
sins) have I given you cleanness of teeth in all your Cities, and scarceness of
bread in all your places, etc.

3. Pestilence.
3. Pestilence; as David's sin here of Numbering the people. Read Deuteronomy. 28.21. --
The Lord shall make the pestilence to cleave to thee, till he has consumed
thee from off the land, whither thou go to possess it.

And as sin is the cause of National, so also,

2. Of Personal evils.
2. Of personal Evils; and those are, 1. Temporal. 2. Spiritual. 3. Eternal.


Sin is the Cause, the Meriting, the Procuring Cause of all. All Evils are but
the Births of sin; sin is a Big-bellied Evil, and all other Evils are but the
births of sin.

1. On Body.
Those upon your Bodies; Sickness, Aches, Pains, Weaknesses.

2. On Soul.
Those upon your souls; Fears, Heart-breakings, Terrors, Horrors. If you could
rip up sin, you would find all these to lie in the bowels of the least sin.

Shall I tell you? Sin was the first Founder of Hell; that which laid the
Cornerstone of that Dark Vault: for, before Sin, there was no Hell.

Nay, and it is Sin that Built up Hell, and has fitted Hell with those
Treasures and Riches of Wrath, Fire and Brimstone.

Nay, and that which still Adds to it, and increases the, Fuel, Romans 2.5. --
It treasures up wrath against the day of wrath.

And therefore being an Universal Evil, a Catholic Evil, the Womb of Evils,
and Cause of all, it must needs be The Greatest Evil.

6. Demonstration.
6. That which is worse than the Utmost Evil, 6. Demonstr. Sin worse that the
utmost Evil.
must needs be the Greatest Evil: But sin is worse than the Utmost Evil. That,
which is Greater than the Greatest Evil, must needs be Exceeding Great. Hell is
the Utmost Evil; but Sin is worse than Hell it self. Hell separate from sin is
but miserable, not sinful: A Penal Evil, not A Sinful Evil.

I say, separate Hell from sin (though we cannot really separate Hell from sin,
yet an Intellectual Separation we may make: we may in our Understandings
abstract Hell from sin) And then, I say, sin is worse than Hell; because Hell
is but A Penal Evil, sin is A Sinful Evil; And there is no Penal Evil so bad as
A Sinful Evil. There is good in the Punishment, the good of Justice: But no
good in sin: And therefore sin in it self is the Greatest Evil.

Now we come to the Second, which is the Main. As sin is in it self, so

2. In the Apprehensions of Gods people, sin is the Greatest Evil.

1. Their sighs for sin.

2. Their sufferings to avoid sin do show, they apprehend sin the Greatest Evil.

1. Their sighs for sin, -- you may look into David's Penitential Psalms, and
see what sighs and groans for sin. Look into Psalm 51. Why, what was the reason
of them? All the Sufferings, all the Evils in the world, would not so much have
affected him, as his sin. Paul, Romans 7.24 -- Oh wretched man that I am! who
shall deliver me from this body of death! The Death of his body was nothing to
him, in comparison of This Body of Death.

Paul went through many tribulations, endured a great deal of sufferings (as
you may read 2 Cor. 11, 23, 24, 25. at large) yet all these Scourges, these
Prisons and Persecutions, did not go so much to his heart, as sin, even the
presence, though not the power of sin. Though he suffered much, yet we do not
read, that ever he cried, OH! for all; And yet he does for Sin, OH! miserable
man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of sin! -- So Peter,
Manasseh, etc.

2. Their sufferings to avoid sin. Daniel was content to be thrown into the Den
of Lions, the three Children into the Fire, Paul and Silas into the Stocks; and
many of Gods people have chosen to embrace Prisons, Stakes, Fire, and the
hottest Persecutions, rather than sin.

Which does plainly evidence to us, They esteemed Sin the Greatest Evil.

1. Greater than Poverty; which yet is a great evil. Melius est Panem
mendicare, quam Fidem perdere. Better to Beg, says one, than to sin, -- Heb.
11.24. to the 28. -- Moses chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of
God, than to enjoy the Pleasures of sin for a season. The like of that
Christian- Moses Galcacius Caracciolus, who was a Noble Prince and Marquess,
who yet, that he might not sin, left and forsook all he had, and betook himself
to live meanly with the people of God, merely to enjoy the Ordinances. And
Musculus, a man of excellent Learning, and a famous Divine, who rather than
sin, would close with any condition.

The Story tells us, That being driven out of all he had, he was content,
rather than sin, to betake himself to a Poor Trade, to be a Weaver, to get
bread to maintain his wife and children. Afterward, being cast out of that
way, the world looking upon it as too good for him, he betook himself to work
with a Spade in the Common Ditch of the Town, to get his living. He could down
with any condition, rather than sin.

Nay, they have not only apprehended sin a Greater Evil than Poverty: But,

2. Greater than Prisons, greater than Death it self. It was the speech of
Ambrose, -- Vultis in vincula rapere? Vultis in Mortem? Voluptas est mihi: --
Will you cast me into Prison? will you take away my life? All this is
desirable to me, rather than to sin.

When Eudoxia the Empress threatened Chrysostom, whom she afterward banished.
He sends to her, Go tell her, says he -- Nil, nisi Peccatum, timeo -- I fear
nothing in the world but sin.

3. Nay, they have apprehended sin a Greater evil than Death -- Basil speaks of
a Rich Virgin, who being condemned to the fire, and sentenced to lose her
estate, because she would not Worship Idols; yet afterward was promised life
and restitution of estate, if she would; She replied, -- Valeat vita, Pereat
Pecunia -- Farewell life, let money perish. Look through the Ten Bloody
Persecutions, and our Late Marian-days, and you shall find many instances to
this purpose.

4. Nay, yet further, They have not only apprehended sin a Greater Evil than
Death, but yet more, A Greater Evil than Hell it self.

It was the speech of Chrysostom -- Ego sic censeo, sic assidue praedicabo,
etc. -- I thus think, and thus will I ever preach, that It is more bitter to
sin against Christ, than to Suffer the Torments of Hell.

Anselm says, -- That if on the one side were presented unto him the Evil of
sin, and on the other side the Torments of Hell; he would rather choose to fall
into Hell, than to fall into sin -- At such a distance were their hearts set
against sin: And nothing more ordinary than such expressions as these from the
Saints, in temptations, in troubles of spirit, or in clearing their own hearts
-- Rather slay me, -- Rather Damn me, -- Rather cast me into Hell, than let me
sin against thee etc.

But this shall be sufficient to clear the Doctrinal part. We come to the
Application.

1. Consectary.
1. If sin be the Greatest Evil in the world; 1. Consectary.
Then let us fall down and admire the Wisdom of God; and adore the Goodness of
God, who, out of the Greatest Evil, could bring the Greatest Good: who makes
the Greatest Evil, an Occasion of the Greatest Good that ever was wrought.

Bernard was so taken up with the thoughts of it, that he says, -- Foelix
Culpa, quae talem meruit Redemptorem! -- Happy fault, which occasioned such a
Redeemer!

We should be humbled for the fault, and bless God for the Remedy; and withal,
admire that wisdom and that goodness, which has taken occasion by man's
wickedness, to declare his own goodness; by man's sin, to make known and express
the infiniteness of his wisdom, power, mercy, justice, etc. That this should be
an occasion to draw out all his Glorious Attributes: That he should bring Good
out of Evil, Life out of Death, Heaven out of Hell, Good out of sin, Cordials
out of Poison.

Let us never doubt, never suspect, but God can bring good out of any thing;
turn the Greatest Evils to the advancement of his Glory, and the good of his
people; who can, out of sin and Hell, bring good. What is it to turn
Afflictions, Persecutions, the Plots and Malice of men? What is it to turn
Troubles, Wars, etc. to his own Glory, and Advancement of his own cause? who
was able to turn Sin to all this?

He, that can turn the Evil of sin, which is Pure Evil, and the Greatest Evil;
can much more turn the Evil of Trouble, to the good of his people.

This made the Apostle say, that -- All things should work together for good to
them that love God, etc. He, that has experience of this, needs not to doubt
of any thing else. That God, that can turn Sin, can turn Afflictions, Crosses,
Persecutions, etc. to the good of his Church and people.

2. Consectary.
2. Hence conclude then, That it is the Saddest punishment, 2. Consectary.
the Fearfullest judgment in the world, To be given up to sin. This is the
utmost punishment that God insticteth upon men; and therefore the Greatest of
all Punishments.

God does usually proceed by Degrees, in the ways of his judgments: first, he
begins with lesser; if lesser will not do, then he proceeds to greater, he will
punish yet Seven times more; and still the further he goes, the greater are his
strokes.

Now this is the finishing, the concluding stroke; this is the last punishment,
and the Greatest of all other, To give a man up to the state of sin; To say to
a man, Thou that art filthy, be filthy still, and thou that art unclean, be
unclean still. This he tells them in Ezekiel. 24.13 -- Because I would have washed
thee, purged thee, and thou would not be purged; therefore thou shall not be
purged. And so he tells the Israelites -- Because you would have altars to sin;
therefore altars shall be to you to sin, Hos. 8.11.

Oh! There is no sadder judgment in the world, than for a man To be given up
to his own hearts lust. This sets an Eternal night of Darkness.

A Meipso me libera, Domine, says Augustine, Good Lord deliver me from my
self. You had better be given up to the lusts of men, to the malice and
cruelties of blood-thirsty men; better to be given up to the utmost rage and
malice of our bloody Cavaliers and Irish Rebels, than to be delivered up to
Your selves, to the lusts of your own hearts. Nay, you had better to be Given
up to Satan, than to be Given up to your selves, your sins.

The Incestuous person was Delivered up to Satan, as you read, 1 Cor. 5.5. And
was restored again, and the better for it. But we never read of any, who were
Delivered up to themselves, who ever returned: never any, who were Given up to
the lusts of their own heart, that ever recovered. Better then To be delivered
up to Satan than to sin; inasmuch, as All Penal Evils fall short of Sinful
Evils.

It is Judicial, in respect of God, who may punish one sin with another, and
curse sin with hardness of heart. But this is a sinful evil in respect of us;
we bring the writing and the wax, and God puts to the seal, and then we are
shut up for ever.

And you are in the Highway to this, who Go on in sin, and will not be
reformed; when God has labored by Sickness, Afflictions, to recover you, you
are in the way to this Final Doom -- You that are filthy, be filthy still, etc.

3. Consectary.
3. Consectary.
3. If sin be the Greatest Evil in the world, Then see what fools they are, who
seek to rid themselves of other Evils, by the Admission of sin. He who labors
to prevent other evils, or remove other evils, by the admission of sin, runs
into the greatest evil of all. He kills himself, to save himself; he destroys
himself, to preserve himself -- He that thus saves his life, does lose his life.

There were never any times so bad, but Gods people might have been safe in
them, if they would have admitted of sin. But they have seen their safety to
lie in Suffering, when they could have no safety, but in the Admission of sin:
You see it in the practice of the Three Children.

It was the speech of the Primitive Christians, when they were threatened with
Prisons and Deaths, if they would not renounce Christ -- Parce precor,
Imperator, Tu Carcerem, Ille Gehennam -- S are, good Emperor, thou threatnest a
Prison, but Christ Hell.

When Cyprian was sentenced to dye upon the same ground, the Governor persuaded
with him, that he should pity himself; and rather Renounce his error, than lose
his life, and consult a little on it -- He answers him -- Fac quod tibi
praeceptum est: In re tam justa nulla est consultatio: Sir, you are my Judge,
you are none of my Counselor: In so clear and just a cause there needs no
Counsel. I will not dishonor the justness of my cause, to enter into Parlee,
and Consultation, whether to suffer, or sin. The like of that Virgin whereof
Basil speaks; who bade adieu to estate and life, rather than abandon her
Profession.

Oh! it were a sad thing to secure our selves by that, which is our ruin; to
purchase our liberty by bondage; our safety by sin. You see what it cost F.
Spira, and Cranmer in Queen Mary's days, who knevv not how to be avenged on
himself for his act, but by Burning that hand first, that had subscribed to sin.

It is better to be still in Prison, than for sin to set open the Prison door:
Inasmuch as its better to be Gods Prisoner, than the Devils Freeman. Better to
lose all, than to preserve our estates by the admission of sin.

And therefore, whatever your troubles are, whatever your fears, whatever your
dangers, bevvare of preserving your selves, or purchasing liberty, or life it
self, at so dear a rate, as by the admission of sin; by Dishonoring God, and
wounding your own conscience. Beware of getting Man your Friend, by purchasing
God to be your Enemy.

We know not yet what our times may come unto; but it is out of the reach of
the power or malice of men, To make you miserable, if they do not first make
you sinful.

4 Consectary.
4. If sin separately considered, be so great an Evil: 4. Consectary.
What then is sin circumstantiated? sin against knowledge, against means? If
there be so much evil in sin, in the least sin; what then in the greatest? If
Atoms be so great; How great then are Mountains? If impertinent thoughts be so
sinful, as having more sin in them, than all the treasures of heaven (besides
God and Christ) can expiate; what then are rebellious thoughts, contrived
Murders, speculative Adulteries, contemplative wickedness, covetous Aims and
Ends, contempts of God, slightings, and undervaluing of his ways? If there be
so much sin and hell in a vain idle word; what a hell of sin, what mountains of
wrath in your Carrion-communications, your stinking-discourses, your bloody and
horrid oaths and blaspemies?

Nay; if there be so much evil in one sin, and one sin simply considered: what
shall we think of sin compounded, sin circumstantiated, sin made exceeding
sinful? sins against knowledge, against means, against mercies? Oh! sit down
and consider one sin, and see much in it.

Such a sin I committed against knowledge, such a one against checks of
conscience, such a one against the motions of the Spirit, etc. and tell me, if
the least sin be not exceeding sinful.

5. Consectary.
5. Consectary.
If sin be so great an evil, then see what fools they are, who make a mock at
sin. Prove. 14.9 -- Fools make a mock at sin; they sport at sin. It is a sport
to swear, to be drunk, etc. they will sin for sport and recreation. It is their
recreation to do evil, to drink, to swear, to lie, to profane Gods-day -- These
are Fools. What, Natural Fools? No: he that goes about with a Whistle, and a
Babble, and a Coat, is in far better case than he. He is a Spiritual Fool, the
greatest Fool.

Will you sport with poison? will you sport your selves with Hell? nay worse,
Will you recreate your selves, with destroying your selves? will you sport your
selves with that, which was so bitter to Christ? and will be so to thee, if
ever thou be pardoned.

Who would sport at that, which is the misery of lost men and Devils, both
here, and in Hell to eternity?

One would think this poor sport and recreation, to tear in pieces the flesh,
and wound, and shed the blood of A Stranger, of An Enemy; but how much more of
Our Dearest Friend?

Thou, who sportest at sin, do so with Christ, sportest thy self in killing
Christ, crucifying Christ, tearing the flesh of christ again. Every oath is a
dagger to his heart, as the spear to his side again.

It is the highest piece of a Devilish nature in the world, To sport at sin:
None but Devils do it. It is the Burden of God, he complains of it; and he
accounts it an ease, when he is rid of you -- Ah! I will ease me of my
adversaries, Isa. 1.24.

It is the Wounding of Christ, the Grief of the Spirit, the Trouble of Angels,
the destruction of the Creatures. Will you sport at that, which has brought
all evil on man, all on Christ? which has made Hell, fuelled Hell, and the
Torment of souls for ever?

Oh! make not that your joy, which was Christ's sorrow, and will be yours
eternally, if now your joy in sin, be not turned to sorrow for sin.

6. Consectary.
6. If sin be the Greatest evil, 6. Consectary.
Then see the utter impossibility of any thing under heaven, to relieve and
help us from under the guilt of sin, save JESUS CHRIST only.

Have thou committed but one sin? thou have done that which all the Treasures
of Righteousness in Heaven and Earth are not able to relieve thee, or help thee
in, save JESUS CHRIST.

There is as much required for the answering the guilt of one sin, as the guilt
of a thousand.

Infinite Righteousness is required for one, and no more is required for a
thousand: And that Righteousness none but Christ alone has.

Nothing can relieve us, but that which is Adequate in righteousness to the
Evil of sin. Now there is no righteousness in the world, that is proportionable
to the Evil of sin, but the Righteousness of Christ.

1. Our own, you know is too short; it is called A menstruous rag. A rag, and
therefore cannot cover us- Menstruous, and therefore though it should cover us,
yet it would but cover filth with filth; as the Prophet speaks, Isa. 30.1. --
They cover, but not with the covering of my Spirit, that they might add sin to
sin; that is, the sin of their righteousness, to the sin of their
unrighteousness. They cover a blot, with a blot; add sin to sin, dung to dung.

2. Nor will the righteousness of the Law be large enough, if it were supposed
that a man were able to fulfill all that righteousness, and keep the whole Law
-- Present obedience, though supposed to be Adequate to the Righteousness of
the Law, will never answer for former offenses and disobediences.

The Law indeed is strong enough to damn a thousand, but cannot save one; it
can pour Hell, and Wrath, and Condemnation upon a World of sinners; but is not
able to pour Grace, or to give Justification to one -- The Apostle tells us,
Romans 8.3, 4. -- What the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the
flesh: God (sending his own son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin)
condemned sin in the flesh -- The same Apostle also tells us, Gal. 3.21 -- If
there had been a Law given, which could have given life, righteousness should
have been by the Law. The Apostle tells us again, Gal. 3.17 -- The Law was
given four hundred and thirty years after the promise, to show we must not
work, that we may be justified; but be justified, that we may be able to work.
If God had intended The Law, the instrument of Justification, he would have
given the Law Four hundred and thirty years before the Promise.

3. Nay yet further, It is not the righteousness of Angels (which yet is a
Greater Righteousness than that of the Law; inasmuch as the Angels were above
Man in Innocence) because this also is but a created Righteousness, a finite
Righteousness, and no way proportionable to the evil of sin. If it had, one sin
had not spoiled those glorious Angels of their Goodness at once, and made them
Devils: which that sin doing shows, There was more evil in sin, than Good or
Righteousness in them.

Well then, This shows the utter impossibility of any other under heaven, or in
heaven, to Free us from the Evil of sin, but JESUS CHRIST. Nothing but
Infiniteness can deal with sin. It must be Infinite wisdom -- To find out a
way. It must be Infinite mercy -- To pardon. Infinite power -- To subdue.
Infinite merit -- To purge and cleanse. And Infinite Grace -- To destroy sin.

However you think of sin, yet this has been the Great Enemy which God and
Grace have been contending withal, ever since the world began.

And it has put All-God to it, even the Infiniteness of the infinite God to
rescue us, and to save us out of the Hands and Power of sin.

His infinite Wisdom, Power, Mercy, Truth, Holiness, have been all employed to
conquer sin; I say, so to conquer sin, as to save you the sinners.

The Great design of God in sending Christ into the world; his Incarnation,
Humiliation, Death, Passion, all were about this, The conquering and destroying
of sin.

How Great an Enemy was this, that God must send out his Son to conquer it? He
can arm Flies, Lice, Frogs, the meanest of Creatures, to overthrow the Greatest
Power and Puissance of the earth: but no less than his Son was strong enough to
conquer sin.

You may think of sin as meanly as you will; swallow it without fear; live in
it without sense; commit it without remorse; yet assure your selves, that this,
you make so slight of, required No less than the infinite power of God, to
conquer; the infinite mercy of God, to pardon; the infinite merit of Christ, to
answer for it. It was that which fetched the Dearest Blood from the Heart of
Christ, and will have Thine too, if thou gettest not an interest in him,

7. Consectary.
7. Consectary.
7. If sin be the Greatest Evil, Then see how much we are bound to CHRIST, who
has born your sins, who has born All this evil for you: you, who have an
Interest in him.

Oh, the Love of CHRIST! that he should bear sin, which is more than all
miseries! a greater evil than Death, than Hell it self is!

If there were one in the world, that were content to be Poor for you, to Bear
Pains for you, to be Sick for you, to be Arrested for you, to go to Prison for
you, to Dye for you; nay, to Bear the Wrath of God for you, nay, the pains of
Hell for you: How would you think your selves bound to such an one for doing it?

Why, This has CHRIST done for you. He has Born sin, which is a Greater Evil
than all these: An evil, that has All these evils in the bowels of it. Such,
as none but Christ was Able to Bear.

If God laid the least sin upon thee, pure sin (which none but CHRIST did ever
bear here in this world) it would crush thee to pieces with the weight of it,
though all the Pillars of Heaven, all the Glorious Angels, should contribute
their strength to thee, to help thee to bear thee up.

The least sin does deserve and draw down an infinite wrath, which nor thou,
nor all the Angels in Heaven are able to stand under.

The Damned bear it in Hell. They bear it; and cannot bear it. They are slain
with it, but cannot dye. Ever consuming, never consumed.

And therefore how much are you bound to CHRIST! who has Born sin, a Greater
evil than All other Evils; and with sin, All the Torments, and Wrath, and
Justice due to sin.

All the world is not able to express that Torment which Christ endured, when
he did Bear sin; when he did sweat drops of blood, clods of blood; when he
wrestled with the justice, Grumos Sanguinis.
did bear the wrath of God; when he cried out, -- My GOD! my GOD! Why have thou
forsaken me! -- A strange speech from him, who was the Son of God.

Which made the Fathers of the Greek Church say, (...), etc. By virtue of thy
unknown labors, and those sufferings not revealed to man, Have mercy on us.

It is no dishonor to Christ, to say, That whatever the sufferings of the
Damned were In Pondere, Christ endured; though not In Specie, for the kind.

And therefore let me say again, How much are you bound to Christ, who has
born your sins for you! And the more bound, because it was a Voluntary act of
Christ: none could enforce or constrain him to it. Now the more willingly a
Courtesy is done, the better it is. This does inhance and heighten a
courtesy, when it is done Willingly.

We use to say of such good turns, which come willingly, that we do account
them double courtesies. The will does make all Great. As the more will there
is in sin, the Greater is the sin: And this makes The Sin against the Holy
Ghost. It is done -- Destinata Malitia -- with devilishness and desperateness
of will.

The more Will there is in Service, the more acceptable that Service is:
Whatever you do for God, the more Will there is in it, the more God esteems it;
where, on the contrary -- Si quid boni Triste feceris, Fit de te magis, quam a
quam a te. So here, The more Will there was in this Great act of Christ, the
more are we bound to Christ for it.

Now if you look upon it, from the Beginning to the End, you shall find
nothing but Mere Love, mere good will in it.

His first undertaking of it was Voluntary. It was a Voluntary Agreement
betwixt God and Christ: A willing Contract made in heaven with God, That he
would undertake this great work.

And, he came into the world with as much Willingness, Heb. 10.5, 6, 7 --
Wherefore, when he comes into the world, he says -- Sacrifice and Offerings
thou would not have. In burnt-offerings, and sacrifices for sin thou have no
pleasure -- Then said I, -- Lo, I come to do thy will, O God -- Setting forth
the Freeness and Willingness of Christ to undertake this work.

And hence the Angels sung at his Incarnation -- Good will to Men. It was
nothing but mere Good will.

And, when he was in the world, he carried on the work with as much Good will.
He tells us -- For this end was I born, and for this end came I unto the world
-- Nay, and he says -- He was in pain till the hour came; viz. in pain of
love, till the hour came,

And, when the hour came, though it was a Black and Dismal-hour, called, The
hour of Darkness; yet he would not desert us, he would not leave us. If he had,
He had left us in Hell, without all recovery. But he would go through with it,
though it made him (so far as he was man) to strange at the work of his own
mercy. Nay, He would bear sin, and bear wrath, and would lay down the utmost
drop of blood in his body.

Oh! Oh! Think with your selves, you, that are The People of God, How much you
are bound to Christ.

How may we say, with Bernard -- Tu Vita mea: Ego mors tua. Tu Justitia mea:
Ego Peccatum tuum. Tu coelum meum: Ego Gehenna tua. Tu Divitiae meae: Ego
Paupertas tua -- Thou art my Life, am thy Death. Thou my Righteousness, I thy
Sin. Thou my Heaven, I thy Hell. Thou my Riches, I thy Poverty. Oh! how are you
bound to Christ, who has born sin!

2. But yet more, How are you bound to Christ, who has So Born sin, as we
shall not bear it: So paid tht Debt, as we are discharged? Col 2.14. --
Blotting out the Handwriting of Ordinances, that was against us, and contrary
to us, taking it away, and nailing it to his Cross. As the Death of Christ was
our payment, so the Resurrection of Christ is our discharge, Romans 4. ult. Who
was delivered for our offenses, and rose again for our justification. Are we
not Justified by his blood? Yea, we are; and therefore he did not rise
formally, to justify us; but to declare, that we were justified, that we were
acquitted, that our sins were pardoned.

Had Christ been still in Prison, under the chains of death, we could not have
had any Assurance that our debt had been discharged: As the Apostle says
elsewhere -- If Christ be not risen, we are yet in our sins. But now Christ
being Arrested, cast into Prison, laid in the Grave, and having Broken the
bands of Death, in which it was not possible for him to be held; Having Risen
again; By this is declared, That our sins are discharged.

If indeed Christ had so born sin, as that yet we should bear it; What were we
the better? But Christ having so born sin, as that we shall not bear it, How
infinitely are we bound to Christ for this!

Christ has left nothing for us to do, but, To go receive what he has
Purchased, and laid up in the hands of a Father: Nothing, but, Sue out an
Acquittance; yea, And at the hands of him, who is just, and will not deceive
us; at the Hands of him who will certainly bestow whatever his Son has so
dearly earned at his hands.

If a man Dye, and leave Legacies in the hands of such who are faithful; may we
not go and require them? When Christ Dyed, he entrusted All his Merits into the
hands of his Father; and he has left nothing for us to do, But go, and require
all.

God entered into Bond and Covenant with Christ, That, if he would Bear sin, we
should not bear them. That, if he would Dye for sin, He would Pardon sin; for
all that is included in Isa. 53 -- He shall see the Travel of his soul, and
shall be satisfied.

Well, now Christ has done this; and having done it, he has given all his
fathers bills and bonds into our hands; and withal, a letter of attorney,
whereby we are enabled to call for all this, at the hands of God.

It was for us, that Christ undertook the work; and all that Christ did, it was
to engage God to us: first to satisfy him, and then to engage him; to make God
our debtor, who were once his debtors. And, as long as there is any of the
Blood of Christ to give out (which will never be spent, it is an everlasting
righteousness) so long is the mercy of God, nay; the justice of God engaged, to
bestow it on us, who by faith come over to him.

And there remains nothing for us to do, in point of justification, but, To sue
out all that that Christ has purchased.

We live in the world, as if we were to purchase a pardon, when we are
only to receive a pardon.

God arresteth us for the Debt of sin; But do you think it is, that we should
pay it? alas poor creatures! No, it is but to drive us out of our selves, and
to bring us over unto Christ, who has already paid the debt.

And, Oh! how should this make us advance Christ, admire Christ, prize Christ!
What should indear our hearts more to Christ, than this, That he has born our
sins, and so born them, as we shall never hear them? if we have an interest in
him.

8. Consectary.
8. If sin be the Greatest Evil, Then it calls out, 8. Consectary.
1. For the Greatest Sorrow. 2. For the Greatest Hatred. 3. For the Greatest
Care to avoid it. 4. For the Greatest Care to be rid of it.

If sin be the Greatest Evil, Then it must have The Greatest Sorrow. 1. Sin
calls for greatest sorrow.
No affliction, no trouble, no evil, should be so bitter to us, as sin; because
sin is the Greatest Evil.

It is a sad thing to see our hearts tender, and sensibly affected with Lesser
evils and troubles; and yet to be hard and insensible for sin, which is the
Greatest of evils.

It would therefore be our wisdom, when any other evils be upon us, To turn all
our sighs, tears and sorrows upon sin.

It is an Aphorism in Physic -- Erumpens sanguis, vena secta sistitur: If a
man bleed vehemently in one place, they let him blood in another, and so turn
the stream of blood another way.

It should be our wisdom, when our souls bleed, and our hearts mourn for other
evils, to turn all those mourning affections upon sin: Let them run in the
right chanel.

Those tears must be wept over again, which are not shed for sin. Sorrow is
like Mercuries Influence: Good, if it be joined with a Good; Bad, if it be
joined with a Bad Planet.

It is not so much the Sorrow, as the Ground and Spring of the Sorrow. The
object of it is to be taken notice of. Sorrow was naught i^ Judas, good in
Peter; it was naught in Saul, good in David. In the one, it was a Sorrow to
death; in the other, a Sorrow to cure the wound of Death. In the one, worldly;
in the other, ^^dly -- Worldly sorrow causes death. And such is all sorrow,
the has not sin for the ground, grace for the principle, God ^^t the end.

Where ^^n is apprehended the Greatest evil, it will have the Greatest sorrow:
Sorrow to exceed all other sorrows.

1. Though not ever in quantity and bulk, yet in quality and worth: A little
Gold is worth a great deal of Earth and Rubbish.

2. Though not in strength, yet in length and continuance: Other sorrows are
but like a Land-flood, for a time, occasioned by a Story, which, when that is
over, the flood is down. This Godly sorrow does arise from a spring, and having
a fountain to continue it, it is Permanent, when the other is gone. This is the
difference between the Godly, and the other.

Gods people, their sorrows, which are Spiritual, do arise from a spring; their
worldly, from a storm, a tempest. The wicked, their spiritual sorrows arise
from a storm, some present wringing of Conscience, fear of wrath; and their
vvorldly sorrovvs arise from a spring.

Where sin is apprehended the Greatest Evil, there it shall have the Greatest
sorrow.

1. A sorrow Proportionable to the Measures and Greatness of Sin.

2. A sorrow Proportionable to the Merit and Desert of Sin.

As the merit of sin is infinite, so the sorrovv for it must be an infinite
sorrovv. Infinite, I say, Non Actu, sed Affectu, not in the act and expression,
but in the Desire and Affection of the soul.

He, whose Heart and Eyes dry up together, whose Expression in Tears, and
Affection of Sorrow, do end together; though he had wept a sea of Tears, he had
not yet truly wept for sin.

Where sorrovv is Godly, it has Affections of mourning, when the expression
of mourning cease; because every drop of tears does arise from a spring of
tears within.

As every Act of Faith does arise from a believing disposition, an habit of
faith within; every act of Love, from a Principle of love within: So every
expression of sorrow from an affection of sorrovv in the spirit -- Hence we
read, 1 Samuel 7.6. their sorrovv is expressed by this Metaphor -- They drew water
(as out of a well) and poured it out before the Lord. Their eyes did not
empty, so fast as their hearts filled. Their eyes could not pour it forth, so
fast as their hearts did yield it up. All their Expressions of Mourning did
fall short of those Affections of Sorrow which were in the heart.

This is sorrow for sin: A sorrow proportioned to the measure, to the demerit
of sin: A sorrow, that does exceed al^ other sorrovvs; though not in quantity,
yet in quality; th ugh not in strength, yet in length and continuance.

2. Is sin the Greatest Evil, 2. Sin calls for the greatest Hatred.
Then it calls out for the Greatest Hatred. Nothing is properly the Object of
Hatred, but Evil: And that not All kind of Evil: but sinful Evil -- Penal Evils
are rather the Objects of Fear, than of Hatred, because these are Improperly
Evil.

Nothing indeed is evil? but what makes us evil: an^ these may be a means to
make us good; and therefore are not properly evil, and so an Object of hatred.

Sinful evil is properly the object of hatred, because this is properly evil:
and being the Greatest of Evils, should therefore have the greatest of our
hatred, Psalm. 92.10 -- You that love the Lord, see that you Hate evil. It is
not enough for you, to be angry with sin, and displeased with sin; for so a
man may be with his Friend, one whom he loves, upon some discourtesie: Nor is
it enough that you should strike sin; for so many do to day, and embrace it to
morrow: But you must endeavor to kill sin. Hatred labors after the Un-being of
that it hates: Nothing but the destruction and blood of it, will satisfy the
soul that truly hates sin.

There is a great deal of mistake in men, concerning this point. I might show
you the secret deceits of the spirit, concerning it in brief, and how far
those come short of hatred of sin.

1. A man may fall out with a sinner, by whom he has been drawn into sin, and
yet not Hate the sin; execute the Traitor, and yet like the Treason.

2. A man may fall out with himself for sin, and yet not hate sin; When he has
brought some inconvenience to himself by his sin, which otherwise he likes
well enough.

3. A man may fall out with sin, and yet not hate sin: Cast away the coal, when
burnt with the fire that is in it, and yet not offended with the blackness of
it, or the defilement which he gets by it.

3. Sin calls for the greatest care to avoid it.
3. If sin be the Greatest Evil, Then it calls out for the Greatest Care to
avoid it. Men are naturally afraid to fall into evil. What study, what care,
what endeavors to prevent Evil? Did you apprehend sin to be the Greatest of
Evils, there would be no less care to avoid sin. You would endeavor to walk
closely and exactly with God; to Beware of all the Occasions, Allurements, etc
which might draw you to sin. You would watch in all Times, in all Companies,
good and bad, in all Places: None are so secure, but you may fall into sin, if
you be neglective of your Christian Watch.

Thus, where f^^ is apprehended to be the Greatest Evil, there will be the
Greatest care and circumspection against sin. Such a man

1. He is Acquainted with the falls of others, which are to him, not Land-Ma ks
to Walk by: but Sea-Marks, and Rocks to Shun,

2. He is Acquainted with the weakness and wickedness of his own heart and
spirit; and therefore watches.

He knows he cannot trust any member alone, without a Guard upon it.

The ey^ are full of sin: Adultery, Pride, Envy, lusts of the Eye, 1 Jonn 2.16.
And he cannot trust his eyes, without Jobs Covenan^ I have made a Covenant with
mine eyes; why then should I think ^n a maid? Chap. 31.1.

The Tongue is full of sin: Of Cursings, Murmurings, Revilings,
Vain-Communications: And there is no trusting of it, without David Bridle,
Psalm. 39.7 -- I will keep my mouth, as with a Bridle, that I ^ffend not with my
Tongue. He knows his own weakness and wickedness; and therefore dares not trust
any member, without his Keeper.

3. Such a man, he is acquainted with the power and policy of Satan: who, as
Luther calls him, is Non Promotus, sed Expertus Doctor. A subtle enemy, whose
Temptations are called -- (...), Rev. 2.24. -- (...), 1 Cor. 2.11, -- (...),
Ephesians. 4.14.

He suits his temptations according too.

4. Such an one, he is acquainted with the danger and deceitfulness of sin; and
how it is

1. Deceitful in its Object.

2. Deceitful in its Arguments.

3. Deceitful in its Pretenses and Excuses. Nullum vitium sine patrocinio.

4. Deceitful in its Incroaches.

5. Deceitful in its Promises. And therefore will he keep an holy
circumspection, an humble, awful; jealous fear over his own spirit, lest he
should fall into sin. He looks on sin, as his Greatest Evil; and his Greatest
care and endeavors are to avoid sin.

4. If sin be the Greatest Evil, 4. Sin calls for greatest endeavors to be rid
of it.
Then should it be our chiefest endeavors to be rid of sin. Every man would
labor to be rid of an Evil, and the Greater the Evil, the greater is our desire
to be rid thereof.

Now sin is the Greatest of Evils: How much more then should we labor and
endeavor to be Rid of the Greatest of Evils?

Alas! Alas! what are all other Evils, to the Evil of Sin? which makes our
good, evil. And yet to see the vileness of men's spirits, they would fain be rid
of all other evils, but not of Sin: so Pharaoh -- Take away this Death, this
Plague. They complain of the evil caused, but not of the evil causing -- of the
evil punishing but not of the evil punished -- Flagella dolent: Quare
Flagellantur, non dolent, says Augustine: They howl under the present scourges
and afflictions, but never lament the sin; they would fain be rid of the Pain,
but yet they would fain keep the Tooth. Whereas alas! till sin be removed, the
afflictions will not be removed. If they be, yet not in mercy, but in
judgment: And your Present Deliverance does but Reserve you for a severer
stroke.

Where on the contrary, If sin be removed, the affliction will be removed. They
are like the Body and the Shadow; Remove the Body, and the Shadow must needs be
removed. Sin is the Body; and afflictions be but the Shadow.

Or, if the Afflictions do continue; yet, if God take away sin, the Evil of the
Evil is taken way. Sin is the sting of every Affliction. Sin is that which
imbitters every Cross: And sin being taken away, that which is Vindictive is
taken way, and that which is Medicinal, and for Salvation, does remain. It is
more fruitful, than penal: All for merciful ends, and out of merciful respects;
when sin is taken away.

1. If sin be the Greatest Evil, Then let us rather choose to fall into the
Greatest Evil in the world, than into the least evil of sin.

All other Evils have some Good in them, and are to be the Objects of Choice,
in case we cannot avoid them, but we must admit of sin. Thus you see Moses did;
as you may read, Heb. 11. -- He chose rather to be afflicted with the people
God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.

But now sin, it is All-evil, and No-good; and there is nothing in the world
should make us to choose sin.

2. Is sin the Greatest Evil? Let this then put us on to pity and pray for
such, who are under a state of sin. You pity sick Friends, poor Friends, undone
Friends. But alas! what are all these evils, to the evil of sin? what is
Poverty? what is Sickness? what is anything, to the Evil of Sin? All these are
but Outward: this is an Inward Evil. All these are but of a Temporal nature;
Death but a Conclusion to them all. But this is of an Eternal nature. All other
will never make you the Object of Gods wrath and hatred.

And therefore spend some tears, put up some prayers for such, who are under
the state of sin. O (says Abraham) that Ismael might live in thy sight! So say
thou, There is such a Friend, and such a Friend, a Brother, a Father, etc. who
lies under sin, is in a state of sin; Oh! that thou would pity their souls!
Oh! that thou would snatch them out of the state of sin!

3. If sin be so Great an Evil, Let us then fall down and Admire,

1. The greatness of Gods Patience in bearing with sinners.

2. The greatness of Gods mercy in pardoning sin.

1. Admire Gods patience in bearing with sinners.
1. Here Admire the greatness of Gods patience in bearing with sinners. It may
be thou have been an Unclean Sinner, a Drunken sinner, a Swearing-wretch, these
twenty, thirty, forty, it may be threescore years, and more. And has God
spared thee? Oh! here see the wonder of Gods patience!

If it were not, that God is Almighty in the power of his patience, it had been
impossible he should have spared thee so long. He tells us so, Hos. 11.9. I am
God, and not man -- I will not enter into the city, viz. to destroy it. So Mal.
3.6. -- I am JEHOVAH, I change not -- Therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
consumed; Implying, if he had not been God, if he had not been Almighty in the
power of his patience, they had certainly been cut off long before.

If men be daily provoked and irritated with injuries, and do not come out to
revenge, we attribute it either to their Pusillanimity, or to their Impotency;
either to their want of courage, or want of Power. But now it is not so with
God, His patience is his power. Numb. 14.17, 18. when God had threatened to
destroy them, Moses prays to God to forbear them, and he calls that Act of his
patience, no less than his power -- Now, I beseech thee, let the power of my
Lord be great, according as thou have spoken -- The Lord is long-suffering,
etc. where you see, he makes his patience his power. And so it is indeed, if
you consider what sin is. Shall I say no more of it, than this, which God
says, Levit. 26.21. It is contrary to God.

1 It is contrary to the works of God. 1 Sin contrary to Gods works.
As soon as God set up and perfected the frame of the world, sin gave a shrewd
shake to all, it unpin'd this frame, and had like to have pulled all in pieces
again. And had it not been for the promise of Christ, all this frame had fallen
in pieces again.

If a man should come into a curious Artificers shop, and should with one blow
dash in pieces a Piece of Art, which cost him many years study and pains the
contriving of it. How could he bear with it? Thus sin did, and yet that God
should forbear, Oh! Omnipotent patience!

2. But yet further; It is Contrary to Gods nature. 2 Sin contrary to Gods
Nature.
God is holy, sin unholy; God is pure, sin is filthy; and therefore compared
still to the most filthiest things in the world, to the Poison of Aspes, to
Ulcers, Soars, etc. If all the Noysom Pollutions in the world met in one common
Stuk, it would never equal the Pollution of sin.

God is good, perfect Good: Sin is evil, universally evil. There is good in all
other things, Plague, Sickness, Hell it self, in a kind, has a good in it:
None in sin.

Sin is the Practical-blasphemy of all the name of God. It is the Dare of his
Justice, the Rape of his Mercy, the Jeer of his Patience, the Slight of his
Power, the Contempt of his Love: It is every way contrary to God.

3. It is contrary to the will of God. God bids us -- Do this; 3 Sin contrary
to the will of God.
Sin says -- I will not do it -- Sanctify my Sabbath -- I will not sanctify
it. Here is Contradiction: And! who can endure Contradiction?

It is set down as a great piece of Christ's sufferings, Heb. 12.3. -- That he
endured the contradiction of sinners against himself: certainly it was a great
suffering. How can a Wiseman endure to be contradicted by a fool? And here,
that Christ, who was The Wisdom of the Father, should bear with such
contradiction from fools; here was a great piece of Suffering.

Now sin is a contradiction of God: Sets Will, against Wisdom; and the Hell of
a wicked Will, against an Heaven of Infinite Wisdom, And that God should bear
with such sinners; here is a Wonder.

You know in all the Creatures, Contrariety makes all the Combustion: It makes
all the War in nature, it causes one Element to fight against another: Fire
against Water, Water against Fire: It will make very Stones to sweat, and burst
asunder.

Travel through the whole Creation, and you shall not see Any Creature, that
can bear with its Contrary. And that God and Sin should be Contrary, and yet
the Sinner live in the World: Here is a Wonder, a VVonder of Patience.

2 Admire Gods mercy in pardoning sin.
2. Is sin so Great an Evil? Let us then fall down, and Admire the greatness of
Gods mercy in pardoning sin.

You see how the Prophet cries out and Admires, Mic. 7.18 -- Who is a God like
unto thee! That pardons iniquity, and passes by the Transgressions of the
remnant of his heritage!

It is one of the Greatest works, that God does in the world, To pardon sin. A
work in which he declares, All his glorious Attributes: His Wisdom, his Power,
his Justice, his Mercy, his Holiness, etc. in pardoning sin.

Men that have cheap and slight thoughts of Gods Pardoning-Mercy; have thereby
an evident sign, They never had a pardon: never knew what it was indeed, To
have a pardon.

If ever any work in the world did put God to it, then this of the Pardon of
sin. And, if ever God do intend thee any good, he will instruct thee, and
rectify thy judgment in this, Touching the Pardon of sin.

Therefore does God humble men, at their Bringing-in, To raise up their esteem
of a pardon, To advance the greatness of his own Mercy, in Pardoning sin.

And indeed we should not need such great Preparations and Humiliations in
coming to Christ, if we had but Greater thoughts of the Pardon of sin.

Men make no more of a Pardon, than to Cry God Mercy. Swear an oath, and then
say, -- God forgive me. Or say, -- Lord have mercy on me, when I dye.

It was said of Lewis the 11. King of France, that He wore a Crucifix in his
hat, and when he had sinned, he would but kiss his Crucifix, and then all was
done. And so the Papists make it no more but a Crucifix, and a Confession. Ah!
my Brethren, if ever God mean good to you, he will make you Know what a Pardon
is. Isa. 55.7. when God would draw men up, to Show them a Pardon; he calls them
Above all the World -- My thoughts are not as your thoughts; nor your ways, my
ways, says the Lord. If they were, then I could not multiply Pardons: But as
the Heavens are higher than earth, so are my thoughts above your thoughts, and
my ways above your ways. I am infinite.

If Gods Creating-mercy were so great, as David with doubled Admiration sets
it out, Psalm. 8.1. and the last verses, -- O Lord, our Lord! how wonderful is
thy Name in all the world: who have set thy Glory above the Heavens. What is
then his Pardoning Mercy?

3. Lastly, Is sin so Great an Evil? Then see What cause we have to humble our
souls before God this day, That we have had such slight thoughts of sin, who
has thus judged sin to be the Greatest of all Evils: What slight thoughts have
we of sin? we can swallow it, without fear; we can live in it, without
sense; we can commit it, without remorse. All which shevv^, we have but
slight thoughts of sin, we do not apprehend sin to be such an evil as indeed
it is.

Nay, How faulty are Gods people themselves here? What mean thoughts have they
of sin?

They are not so watchful against it, not so Burdened with it, not so troubled
for it, as they ought to be. All which shows, that though sin do appear to
them, to be A great Evil, and, The Greatest of all other Evils, yet they do not
apprehend it to be so Great an Evil as it is.

Now, that you may be able to have some suitable conceptions of sin to the
greatness of it; that you may be able to see sin exceeding sinful, I will
briefly present it to you in these Six Glasses:

1. Look upon it, In the Glass of Nature; which, though it be but a Dim-Glass,
a Blown-Glass: Sin has dimmed it; yet is this able to discover a great deal of
the evil of sin. The very Heathen themselves have seen and judged many sins to
be the greatest of evils.

Though Spiritual sins were hid from them, their light was not able to discover
Infidelity, and Gospel-sins; yet Moral-sins they have discovered, and have
avoided them, and would hazard themselves; nay, and suffer too, rather than
they would commit such sins. The examples of Plato, Scipio, Cato, and many
others, will clear this.

And all this was discovered by the Glass of Nature, done by Nature; but not by
mere Nature fallen, but by Nature well-husbanded, by Nature improved, by the
implantation of Moral Principles, together with Restraining Grace, and other
common gifts of the Spirit.

The Greatness of their Hatred against sin, the Greatness of their Care to
avoid sin, the Greatness of their Sufferings, rather than they would commit
sin, might be enough to discover to us, the Greatness of the Evil of sin. But
pass by this.

2. The second Glass, wherein you may see the greatness of sin, is, The Glass
of the Law.

A Glass which discovers sin in all its Dimensions, the Guilt, Demerit,
Filthiness and Sinfulness of sin. Hence the Apostle, Romans 7.7. says -- I had
not known sin, but by the Law; that is, I had not known sin so heinous as it
is, I had not known sin in the wideness and latitude of it: I had not known the
sinfulness of sin, if it had not been for the Law, if the Law had not been a
Glass to have discovered sin to me. This discovered sin in its Greatness:
David, Psalm. 119.96 -- I have seen an end of all Perfection, but thy Law is
exceeding broad; that is, by revealing the compass of sin in proportion to its
Wideness and Greatness.

Oh! This will discover to thee more nakedness in one sin, than all the world
can cover; more indigency in one sin, than all the Treasures of created
righteousness in heaven and earth are able to supply; more obliquity and
injustice in one sin, in a very wandering thought, than all the Deaths of men,
and Annihilations of Angels are able to Expiate.

Search into the Law, and thou shall discover Thousands of sins which fall
under Any One Law of God. Oh! Here is A Glass!

3. Look upon sin in The Glass of the Griefs, Woundings, Peircings, and
Sorrows, which the Saints have found,

1. In their Admissions, and first Entrance into the state of Grace.

2. In their Relapsings and Turnings again to folly.

1. For the first: See what Groans, Humiliations, they have endured in their
first admissions into an estate of Grace, in Manasseth, 2 Chronicles. 33.12. in
Paul, Acts 9. in the Converted Jews, Acts 2.37. when the nails which peirced
Christ, now stuck in their hearts, as the arrow in the stags side.

How many of the Saints have there been, who have been cast into a bed of
miserable sorrow, lain bedridden under the stroke of Justice perhaps for many
years: And all this for sin. No age is without a Thousand examples of it.

2. Look upon the sorrows and breakings, which the Saints have endured upon
their Relapsing into sin. See in Peter, in David: Read what sad expressions he
has in Psalm 6. from verse. 1. to verse. 7. and in Psalm 32.3, 4, 5 verses. So
Psalm 51.

How does he complain how his -- Soul is troubled -- his bones are broken --
his eyes are consumed with sorrow -- his bed swims with tears? And all this for
sin -- Here is a Glass, wherein you may see the Evil of sin to be the Greatest
Evil.

Yea, and the least sin, when God sets it on, will do all this.

4. Look upon sin in Adam; and there see the greatness of it. That one sin of
Adam, has brought All the Miseries, Sickness, Death, etc. upon All his
Posterity since that time.

It has been the Damnation of thousands of millions of men; and still it runs
on. Gods justice is still unsatisfied; if it were, there would be a stop: We
should Dye no more, Be sick no more, etc.

Oh! Here you may see sin; sin in its Extensiveness.

5. Look upon sin in Christ: See there what Humblings, what Breakings, what
Woundings, what Peircings, what Wrath it brought upon Christ himself. It was
that, which mingled that Bitter Cup, with such woeful ingredients; which, had we
but fipt of it, when it was so tempered, would have laid our souls under more
wrath, than All the damned in Hell do suffer. Christ did Bear Pure Justice for
sin.

Nay, it made him, who was God as well as man, sanctified by the Spirit to that
work, strengthened by the Deity, To sweat drops of blood, and even to struggle,
and seem to draw back, and pray against the work of his own Mercy, and to
decline the business of his own coming into the world.

Ah! none knows but Christ, nor is a finite understanding able to conceive,
what Christ underwent, when he was to Bear sin, and with that To wrestle with
the infinite wrath and justice of the infinite God; the Terrors of death, and
the Powers of the world to come. Here is a Glass, wherein you may see The
greatness of sin, The wideness of sin, The guilt of sin, The demerit of sin:
All which are set out to the life, in the Death, Sufferings, Breakings and
Woundings of the Son of God.

You, that make light of sin, go to Christ, and ask him, How heavy it was; even
that, which you make so light of, which pressed him down to the ground. And the
least sin would have pressed thee, and all the pillars of heaven, to the Bottom
of Hell for ever.

6. A sixth Glass. Look upon sin in the Damnation of the soul for ever; that
nothing would satisfy the justice of God, but the Destruction of the Creature.
No Sickness, no Prisons; no Blood, no Sufferings, but the Sufferings of Hell:
And those not for a Time, but for Ever. Ah! see here the greatness of sin;
which might be further amplified by the consideration of the preciousness of
the soul, which yet sin ruins to all eternity. And therefore would you know
sin? Quaere Damnatos, Ask the damned what sin is. Lay thy Ear to Hell, and hear
those Skreechings, those Howlings, those Roarings of the Damned. And all this
is for sin. Oh they are dear-bought pleasures, which must be thus paid for
with everlasting pains.

Thus you see what sin is by all these Glasses: And therefore, Oh! how ought we
to be Humbled for our slight thoughts of sin, which is so great an Evil?

USE.
Now if it be so, Then see what need we have to Aggravate sin to the utmost in
our confessions of sin; because all we can say of it, will fall infinitely
short of the Ha^nousness of sin.

You can aggravate no sin so high, as to raise it above it self as to make sin
greater than it is. You can have No Magnifying Glass, to greaten sin above the
Greatness of it. You have such Glasses: to make greater other things above
their own higness; which are able to present small things great; mean things,
of vast bigness: But you have no Glass to multiply sin, and make sin appear
Bigger than it is.

The sufferings of the Saints, the sorrows of the Saints; the sufferings of the
Damned are too short; The Glass ot the Law, the Glass of Christ's sufferings
(which is the greatest) this does not show sin greater than it is: It does but
discover sin in its Just Proportions and Dimensions.

It had not been justice in God, to have required more blood, and to put his
own Son to more suffering, than sin deserved. Nor would this have stood with
Gods Love, his Pity and Mercy to his Son, to have put him to more than sin
deserved.

Though now there be mercy more than enough for the greatest sinners; as the
Apostle says, 1 Timothy 1.14. yet there was not Justice more than enough
exercised upon Christ for the demerit and guilt of sin.

The Death of Christ was -- (...) -- An Adequate Ransom for our souls and
sins: And yet there is a Redundancy of merit, an Overflowing of merit in the
Satisfaction of Christ, to Ransom a thousand worlds more to that, if need
were. As sin is infinite, in regard of the Object; so Satisfaction is infinite,
in respect of the Merit.

Hence Christ's death is not only said to be A Satisfaction, but A Purchase;
not only A Payment, but A Purchase.

A Satisfaction it was to the Justice of God for sin, Full. And A Purchase of
all good things from the Mercy of God; to which his Justice, in respect of the
Validity and Worth of Christ's Satisfaction, is Bound to us. But this by way of
Digression.

See then, what need there is, To Aggravate sin to the utmost; because we
cannot multiply sin to the greatness of it. There will be many singular fruits
of so doing.

1. This will breed shame and confusion of spirit for sin.

2. This will make you advance, and relish mercy better.

When the debt seems little, we are ready and apt to undervalue a pardon. But,
when sin appears exceeding sinful, this does make us value mercy, prize a
pardon.

When sin is seen the greatest Evil, Mercy and Pardon will be apprehended the
greatest Good.

3. This puts us into the nearest disposition, To forsake sin. As he, who
extenuates sin; is resolved to continue in sin; so he, who truly aggravates
sin, desires to be rid of it.

4. Besides, It breeds a Displacency with our selves, when we consider, How ill
we have dealt with God.

5. It produces self-judging, and self-condemnation: as we see in David, Psalm.
51.

6. It will produce spiritual softness, and tenderness of heart for sin. But
this I must pass over.

USE.
If sin be the Greatest Evil, Then it is the Greatest Mercy in the world to be
rid of sin. The greater the evil is, the greater is the mercy to be rid of it.
But now sin is the Greatest Evil.

And therefore you shall see it set down as the only mercy that comes in by
Christ, Mat. 1.25 -- He shall be called JESUS, because he shall save his people
from their sins.

As if all other things coming in by Christ, were included in this one, He
shall save his people from their sins. He does not say -- He shall save his
people from Hell, etc, but, From sin: From no other evil in the world. And this
is the Greatest Mercy.

When God would speak the utmost, even the greatest thought of Mercy, that ever
came upon his heart; when he would set down the greatest work of Mercy, that
ever the God of Mercy wrought: he says no more, but, He shall save his people
from their sins.

Sin was the utmost Evil; and therefore the saving from sin was the greatest
good. And hence David, Psalm 32.1, 2. says -- Blessed is he whose iniquity is
forgiven, and whose sin is covered: Blessed is that man, to whom the Lord
imputes not sin.

Indeed, we have mean thoughts, cheap thoughts of pardon of sin; and the reason
is, because we have slight thoughts of sin: But, if God once open our
understanding, and make us see the vastness and wideness of the evil of sin;
and, if that he should join a feeling sense to that sight, and make us feel
what sin is; if he should let but the least sparkle of his wrath fall upon our
spirits for sin, it would make our faces gather blackness; we should quickly
change our note, and say, -- Oh! Blessed, and for ever blessed are they, whose
iniquity is forgiven, and whose sin is covered.

But, lest I should seem to Beat the air, we will therefore Circumstantiate
this Mercy a little; and you shall see the Greatness of it.

Though indeed, this were enough, to tell you, that sin is the Greatest Evil:
Thence would necessarily follow, That it is the Greatest Mercy in the world, To
be rid of sin; which will more fully appear, if we consider the following
particulars:

1. First then, The pardon of sin is the dearest-bought Mercy; and that is
something to show the Greatness of the Mercy.

You know, the Greater the sum is, that is to be paid for the Purchase of a
thing (provided there be no want of wisdom in the Buyer, nor want of Honesty in
the Seller) the Greater still, and of more worth is the Thing bought or
Purchased.

But now This Mercy, Pardon of sin, was a Mercy dear-bought: It cost Blood,
Mat. 26.28. and that -- Not the blood of Bulls and Goats; for that it was
impossible it should take away sins, as the Apostle has it, Heb. 10.4. What
then was it? Why it was The Precious blood of Christ, 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. -- You
were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
conversation; but with the precious Blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without
blemish and spot. And this, The Blood of God; Acts 20.28. -- Feed the Church of
God, which he has purchased with his own Blood.

Now sit down, and think what a Mercy that must needs be, which is the Price of
blood, and that of the Son of God.

There was no Want of Wisdom in the Buyer; he could not be over-reacht, he knew
the worth of the Commodity: Nor was there want of justice or goodness in the
Seller. He was just, and would not take one drop of blood more than the thing
was worth: And he was A Father too, and therefore would not put his Son to more
sufferings, and require more than the thing was worth.

2. This is the purest Mercy of all other, The Pardon of sin, A mercy that
comes from the Heart and Good Will of God to you.

God may give you all other things, and hate you. You may be Rich, and yet
Reprobates; Great in the world here, and be Damned hereafter. Dives may have
wealth, Herod Eloquence, Saul Command, Agryppa Glorious Apparel: a man may do
wickedly, and yet prosper. These things are not Truly good, nor Truly evil. If
good, the wicked should not have them: If evil, the Saints should not have
them. These are such things as God reaches from his Hand, not from his Heart:
they are general favors, not special Love.

But this is a Peculiar-Favor, the Saints Peculiar, Pure-Mercy, a mercy that
came from the Bowels of mercy, the Heart of Mercy.

3. This is the Freest Mercy of all other, Pardon of sin.

1. There was nothing to engage God to do it.

2. Nor was there any thing, we could do, to purchase it.

All our Prayers, our Tears, our Services, could not purchase the Pardon of one
sin. If for the Active Part we could do as much, and for the Passive part we
could suffer as much as all the Saints, put together, have done from the
beginning of the world to this day.

If we should weep as many Tears, as the Sea holds drops; if we should humble
our selves as many days, as the world has stood minutes from the creation,
etc. All this were Too short to purchase us the Pardon of one sin, though we
did all without sin.

But Alas! All that ever we can do, is so far from striking off any Former
score, that we do but set our selves further in debt thereby: So far are we
from purchasing a Pardon, that we do but increase our Treason -- Operamur, non
in justificationem: sed ex justificatione: we must not work, that we may be
justified: but we are justified, that we may work. -- So that it is the
Freest-Mercy.

And therefore in Scripture you read it all attributed to Grace, Tit. 3.7 -- We
are justified freely by his Grace -- Romans 3.24. -- Being justified freely by
his Grace, -- Romans 4.5. -- God justifies the ungodly -- There is no motive in
us, All is from God. And you shall see it plain, one place for two: In Isa. 43.
Verse 23, 24, 25. -- Thou have bought me no sweet cane with money, nor have
thou made me drink with the fat of thy Sacrifices: But thou have made me serve
with thy sins, thou have wearied me with thy iniquities -- I, I, am he, that
puts away thy iniquities, for my own names sake, and will not remember thy
sins. Would a man have expected this? this shows freeness, when not only no
deservings, (as it is v. 23. and former part of v. 24. Thou have not, etc. but
contrary deservings; Thou have wearied me with thine iniquities. Oh infinite,
oh freest mercy. God is merciful only because he will be merciful.

4 It is an Intituling Mercy: A Mercy that Intitles you to more Good than I am
able to express, or you able to conceive. It is a Mercy, that does interest you
in all other Mercies. It Intitles you to all the Good on Earth, to All the
glory of Heaven. Nay, it is a Mercy-making-Mercy. A mercy, that makes all other
things Mercy to you.

1. Good things are mercies. Your Riches, your Greatness, your Possessions,
your Husbands, your Wives, Children, etc. all these things are no Blessings,
till they be joined with a Pardon; and that makes them all blessings. Nay, not
only Good things: But,

2. Evil things are Mercies to you. Pardon of sin makes Poverty, Afflictions,
Sickness, Death it self a Mercy: Like the Unicorns horn, it takes away the
venom and poison of every Water: Like the Philosophers-stone, it turns All
into Gold. So says the Apostle -- All things work together for good unto them
that love God. A Sanctified-Cross, is better than an Unsanctified Comfort. A
loss in Mercy, is better than an enjoyment in Wrath.

You are never able to make it good, that God does bestow any thing in mercy,
till sin be forgiven. Guilt of sin upon you does turn the nature of things, and
makes those things which are good in themselves, evil to you.

5. It is an irrevocable-mercy -- God may give in other mercies, and call for
them again. Indeed other things are rather lent, than given: Lent Husband, Lent
Wife, etc. Hence they are said to be but Talents in our hands, and we Stewards
of them for a time. God may call for them when he pleases; or we may forfeit
them, and lose them.

How often do we forfeit and lose good things, because of our unworthy walking
in the enjoyment thereof? Hos, 2.8, 9 -- I will take away my corn in the time
thereof; my wine, and my flax in their season. [Mine] It was Gods. And, would
you know the reason? see in the former verse, Because they did not acknowledge
him as the giver of them, but bestowed them on Baal, as though he had given
them.

But now this Mercy is an irrevocable Mercy: A mercy that God never recals; A
Mercy, God never repents of -- The gifts and graces of God are without
repentance -- And it is a Mercy never forfeited.

We may forfeit the sense of a pardon, we may forfeit the comfort of a pardon;
nay, we may forfeit the knowledge of a pardon. I say, you may sin away the
sense, the comfort, the knowledge of a pardon: as it was with David.

But we shall never forfeit a pardon -- Quod Scripsi, Scripsi. If all this
foreseen could not hinder God from giving out a pardon; neither can it make God
repent of a pardon, when he has given it.

Now the Stability of the Mercy is that, which adds a great deal of worth to
the Mercy. As things that are Evil; so much more things that are good, are
heightened from the consideration of the continuance of them, the Stability and
Lastingness of them.

Now this is a Stable Mercy. Take but one Place, Isa. 54.8, 9, 10 -- For this
is as the waters of Noah unto me: For, as I have sworn that the waters of Noah
should no more go over the earth: So have I sworn, that I will not be wroth
with thee, nor rebuke thee. -- Yet further -- For the mountains shall depart,
and the hills shall be removed: but my kindeness shall never depart from thee,
nor shall the Covenant of my peace be removed.

This is the difference betwixt the Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of
Grace. The one, is Temporary; the other, is Eternal. It is a Temporary
Covenant, though an Eternal Rule: The other is Eternal, and Immutable.

6. Pardon of sin is an Universal Mercy, the Womb of Mercy, a Productive-Mercy;
all other mercies grow upon this Tree of Forgiveness of sin. It is a Tree, the
Root whereof is in Christ; and the Fruit thereof are All good things on Earth,
and Glory in Heaven. There are Seven glorious Fruits of Pardon of sin; which I
will but name, and so come to the Last Use.

1. Reconciliation with God, 2 Cor. 5.19. Admission into his favor. He, who
before was an Enemy, is now become thy Friend; for nothing makes God an Enemy,
but sin. And such a Friend he is, who will be a Friend in life, a friend in
Death, when all other Friends forsake; and a Friend after death.

2. Adoption of Children: which follows upon our pardon in justification.

3. Access to God, as to a Father, with childe-like boldness. Sin was that
(...) -- that great Gulf betwixt God and us. Sin the Partition Wall betwixt God
and us: now sin being pardoned, this Partition Wall is taken down, and there is
Access to God, and Access with boldness.

4. Acceptance of our Services: Till sin be pardoned, there is no Acceptance
of any service: Till our persons be accepted and reconciled, our performances
are abominable: But now sin being pardoned, here is acceptance for all our
services. He drinks the milk as well as the wine, Cant. 5.1. And eats the
honeycomb with the Honey, etc.

5. Sanctification of every condition to us: When sin is removed which was the
curse in all.

6. Supportation under Crosses: Upon removal of sin, which was in all, the
heaviest burden.

7. Participation of all the privileges of the Covenant: These are the
inseparable fruits of pardon.

There are other, as Peace, Joy, Comfort, Romans 5.1. which indeed are not so
much Fruits of pardon, as Fruits of Assurance of pardon; not the next, but the
remoter fruits of pardon.

USE.
Lastly, Is sin the Greatest Evil in the world? Oh then! let us, Above all
things in the world, labor to get our selves rid of sin: Get a pardon of sin.
Say with David -- Oh! Take away the iniquity of thy servant.

What will the enjoyment of all other goods profit thee, if thy sins be not
pardoned? what profit had Dives of his wealth? Saul of his Kingdom? etc.

It is a thing greatly to be lamented to see, How active and serious men are,
about removing of other evils on them, and the purchasing and procuring of
other goods; but yet how slight, how superficial they are about getting Pardon
of sin.

Thy Person is under the Guilt of Sin. Thou stand a Condemned man and woman
-- Damnatus antequam Natus. And God has given thee time, and that time is not
a time of Reprival only; but is a time, that God has afforded thee to get a
pardon in.

And it cost no less than the Blood of Christ, to procure thee this time; it
was that that made a stop of the present proceedings of Gods justice against
thee; else thou had been in Hell long ago.

And will thou Squander away This Time? will thou Neglect This Business? will thou eat away, sleep away, nay, drink away, sin away a Pardon?

If there were a man condemned to dye, and yet were, out of Mercy, Reprived,
That he might procure his Pardon, and the King were willing to grant him a
pardon; would you not think that man deserves to die, who shall now spend this
time in drinking, in revelling, etc? why this is your case.

But yet there is another sort that will seek for a pardon; but they seek it
coldly, they seek it formally, they seek it slightly and superficially, they
seek it as if they had no need of it; as if they could do well enough, though
they wanted a Pardon.

There is a great deal of dallying with God, about this Great business. Most
men in the World do but Trifle with God about it.

I will name you five or six sorts of men, who are Tristers with GOD, in this
main, and concerning matter; and these none of the meanest neither. I shall not
now deal with your Debaucht People; but such as will seem to do somewhat for a
pardon.

1 Such, who will seek, and perhaps cry earnestly; but yet still continue in
the practice of those sins, which they beg a pardon of.

I speak not now of Sins of Course. -- Peccata quotidianae incursionis: Sins of
daily incursion: Sins of Infirmity, weakness and Imperfections in Duty; These
the best, notwithstanding their daily praying for pardon of, do yet too often
fall into.

But I speak of grosser-sins. -- Peccata Vastantia Conscientiam: Sins wounding
and gashing the Conscience. And this is a fearful thing, fearful dallying
with GOD.

What would you think of such a man, who should come to beg a Pardon; and yet,
before the Pardon were given out, should run to commit new acts of Treason?
This is thy case.

I see many of you living in a Course of sin; Potting, swilling, swearing. I am
ashamed to name them.

Do you pray for a Pardon? Or do you not pray? If you do not pray, you are no
better than Atheists. And do you pray for a Pardon, and yet live in the
practice of those sins, you beg pardon of? Oh! what fearful dallying with GOD
is here!

Oh! you little think what a strong tie this is against sin, To pray for the
pardon of sin. What? Have you been confessing sin, humbling your souls for sin;
begging of Pardon of Sin? And, no sooner turn your backs upon God, but return
to Sin? Ah! This is fearful dallying indeed.

And this is a Fearful aggravation of Sin; you think to have something come in
for your days of Humiliation, for your prayers for pardon of Sin; you think
there is some good in it. Why? you have begged a Pardon, though you have Sinned;
yet you have prayed, and therefore hope, that notwithstanding your sins; God
will hear your prayers.

But do thou live in sin, and confess sin? Do thou practice sin? and yet
pray for pardon of sin? Do thou commit sin, and yet humble thy self for sin.

Oh! These are Great Aggravations of sin: these do add more weight to sin.

Do you think it would be an Extenuation, or an Aggravation, for a Malefactor
to beg a pardon, and yet run to the same Rebellion again? would he think this
To lessen his sin, because he has formerly begged a Pardon? No certainly, he
would look upon this as a Greater Aggravation. Why this is thy case.

And this you shall see, was Isreal's spirit, which was so much displeasing to
God, Jer. 3.4. -- Thou art my Father, and the Guide of my youth -- They gave
God good words, compast him about with good expressions. But, says the Lord --
This have thou done, and yet done as much evil as thou could, v. 5.

2. A second sort, who dally with God, are such, who seek the pardon of some
sins, but yet keep up the love and liking of others. Thou art, it may be,
Pinched and Troubled for some gross sins, and thou beg'st a pardon for them;
when, it may be, there is some Running-Issue of corruption within, which thou
Overlook'st; some secret Haunt of Villainy, that thy heart runs out after; which
thou can not leave, which thou have no mind to part withal.

Oh! Thou vain man! Thou may cry all thy life, and shall never get good. Thou
may pray as long as thou will: That One sin, kept with love and liking, will
Turn all thy prayers into sin. God will never regard the Prayers of a
sin-regarding-sinner. Psalm. 66.18. -- If I regard iniquity in my heart, the
Lord will not hear me: though I should never act it in my life.

Did thou know the Tenor of the Covenant of Grace and Mercy, the Strictness
of the Gospel, and Severity of Mercy it self against sin; thou would see,
There were an impossibility of having one sin forgiven, as long as one sin is
unforsaken.

Justification and Sanctification: Gods forgiving, and our forgoing, are
equally as large one as the other. As God justifies from the guilt of all sin;
so he sanctifies from the Corruption of all Sin.

Grace in God forgives all Sin. And,

Grace in us makes us forgo all Sin: where sin is forgiven, there sin is
forsaken.

3. A Third sort, are they, Who seek a pardon of Sin, without sense of Sin; who
seek forgiveness of Sin, without remorse for sin: Men, who are never troubled
with any sense, with any compunction of heart for sin.

Would you not take it for a dallying with you; if one had greatly offended
you, and should come to desire you your forgiveness, without any sense or
remorse of it? What do you think God will do?

This is certain -- Without blood there is no Remission of Sin, as the Apostle
speaks -- Christ was wounded, and thou must be wounded too, before thou have a
pardon -- Christ did bleed, and conscience must bleed, before ever he give a
pardon.

It was a speech of Bradford -- He never left a duty, till, etc.

Will a man in good earnest beg a pardon, who was never attached for Treason,
or so much as thoroughly sensible, that he is guilty of it?

4. A Fourth sort, are such, as cry for Forgiveness, but yet never look after
their Prayers. Would you not think it a slighting, if a man, who had offended
you, should come and beg a pardon; and as soon as he had said a few words to
you, should turn his back, and go away, and never expect, nor wait for an
answer from you?

Why thus do you deal with God: You put up prayers, but look not after them.
He, who begs in earnest, Oh! he will Diligently observe, what Answer, what
Return God makes: He will observe what word of Comfort God lets fall, what
intimations God will afford to his spirit, and will be exceeding chary of them.
As you see Benhadads servants did, 1 Kings 20.31, 32, 33. After they had put up
their requests, the Text says -- The men did diligently observe, whether any
thing would come from Ahab; and did hastily catch at it. So should we do: Come
with sackcloath, put up our prayers with remorse; and, when that is done, when
we have prayed our prayers, let us wait our prayers, to see what intimations we
shall receive from heaven. Thus David, Psalm. 85.8. -- I will hear what God the
Lord will speak; for he will speak Peace to his people, and to his Saints, etc.
Psalm. 5.3 -- In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and I will look
up.

5. A Fifth sort, who dally with God, are they, who follow not their prayers
with endeavors to get assurance, that their Sins are pardoned. Who search not
into the Covenant of Grace, acquaint not themselves with the Promises of Grace;
search not into the Word of Grace, frequent not the Means of Grace: These men
dally, who frequent not the Word, Sacraments, etc. and such like Means for the
Assurance of Pardon.

A TREATISE OF THE Loves of Christ TO HIS SPOUSE.

BY SAMVEL BOLTON, D. D. And MASTER of C. C. C.

LONDON: Printed by Robert Ibbitson, for Thomas Parkhurst, and are to be sold
at his Shop over against the Great Conduit in Cheapside, 1656.

A TREATISE OF THE LOVES OF CHRIST TO HIS SPOUSE.
CANT. 4.9. Thou have ravished my heart, my Sister, my Spouse: Thou have
ravished my heart with one of thine eyes; with one chain about thy neck.
A Text, which after we have been some while in Heaven, we shall be able to
understand.

Certainly none can speak fully to this Text, but they who have the full
enjoyments of this Love.

But things that are not possible to be expressed, are not totally to be
omitted; and therefore we will lanch into the main Ocean. And when we are not
able to apprehend this love, let us cast our selves in, and let it comprehend
us.

Some things in the General we premise.

1. For the Author, or Penman; it was Solomon inspired by the Spirit of God.

2. For the Title of the Book; it is called The Song of Songs; or, a most
excellent Song. So it is called for the excellency; and sublimity. The doubling
of the words declare the excellency. As when the Scripture speaks of base
things; by doubling the words they are more debased; as it was said of Cham,
Genesis 9.25. A servant of servants shall he be: that is, a vile slave. So when
it speaks of good things by doubling the words, it declares the excellency of
the thing, Deuteronomy. 10.17. The Lord your God, is God of Gods, and Lord of Lords.
Thus much for the Title.

3. As concerning the Matter; there is difference among Interpreters.

1. Aben-Ezra a Jewish Rabbin thinks it to be an History of the Church of God
from Abraham to Christ.

2. Another thinks it to be an Hystory of the Church from Christ, to the
freedom of the Church by Constantine, a Roman Emperor, who lived in the
beginning of the fourth Century.

3. Another makes it contain a prophetical Hystory of the condition of the
Church from David to the end of the World. And divides the book into these two
parts. The Church 1. Under the Law. 2. Under the Gospel.


1. The Church under the Law, from David to the death of Christ, which is
continued from the beginning of the Book, to the sixth verse of the fourth
Chapter.

1. As it was from David to the Captivity; which says he, is contained in the
first Chapter, and the two first verses of the second Chapter.

2. As it was in the Captivity, from the second verse of the second Chapter, to
the fifteenth verse of the second Chapter.

3. As it was after the Captivity, till the death of Christ, the abrogation of
the Church under the Law; which continues from the fifteenth verse of the
second Chapter, to the sixth verse of the fourth Chapter.

2. And from that, to the end of the Book is contained an Hystory of the Church
Evangelical, till Christ's second coming. Of this mind is Brightman.

But to leave this, we think (and with us goes the stream of Orthodox
Interpreters) that the subject matter of this Book is a Parabolical Hystory of
the mutual loves betwixt Christ, and his Church, set down under the persons of
the Bridegroom, and his Bride. And thus much of the Book in general. We will
now draw nearer to our Text.

In the former Chapter we read, how the Church, the Spouse of Christ does
declare her exceeding love to Christ, and her high appretiations of him, with
her earnest desire to enjoy him, whom her soul saw so precious, and that Christ
might discover to her, how kindly he took her affection.

In this Chapter he does again enter into a singular commendation of the
excellency of the Church, declaring also his unfeigned love to her.

The whole Chapter contains these parts.

1. A singular commendation of the Church by Christ; which is set down
allegorically from the first verse to the fifth, and from the tenth to the
fourteenth verse.

2. A gracious profession of Christ's love to his Church, from the fifth verse
to the tenth.

3. The Churches reply, with Christ's answer again to her, verse. 15, 16, 17.

In the Churches reply; 1. A commendation of her head and Husband, verse. 15.2.
An earnest desire, of further communication of his Spirit, and communion with
himself, verse. 16.

In Christ's answer there is contained a Promise of his gracious acceptance of
such fruits as the Church shall yield him, verse. 17.

This verse which I have read to you is a branch of the second part. (scil.)
The gracious profession of Christ his love to his Church; of which, if I read
no more than this verse, we see enough set down to astonish and amaze us all.

Thou have ravished my Heart, my Sister, my Spouse. Quid mirum, si regnum
caelorum vim patitur, etc! What wonder if the Kingdom of Heaven suffer
violence, when the King of Heaven himself suffers violence!

Christ does here speak in the manner of a Lover, whose heart is exceedingly
ravished, and taken with the beauties, virtues, and graces of his Spouse.

Give me leave to explain the words, and we come to Doctrine.

1. Thou have ravished.] What is meant by that? The expression is great, that
the God of Heaven should be so taken, even to ravishment with his Church and
people. And yet let me tell you, the word speaks more than any expression can
utter.

The word is in the Hebrew, (...) of which these interpretations.

1. Aben-Ezra translates, rapuisti animam meam: Thou have taken away, thou have
stolen away my Heart, my Sister, my Spouse.

2. Rab. Sol. Traxisti animam meam ad te: Thou have drawn my heart to thee.

3. Talmudici prisci. Copulasti cor meum cum tuo: Thou have coupled my heart to
thee; thou have One-ed my heart: as if he should say, thou have so joined me,
as thou and I have but One heart.

4. Another, Vulnerasti cor meum: Thou have wounded my Heart, my Sister, my
Spouse.

5. The seventy, They (...), Excordiasti, Eripuisti cor meum: Thou have
unhearted me; thou have taken my heart from me. And here our Translators,
Thou have ravished my Heart. All which laid together, they are mighty
expressions, setting down, to wonder and amazement, the exceeding love of
Christ to the Church.

Thou have ravished, wounded, stolen away, drawn my heart to thee.

2. My Sister, my Spouse.] We will join them both together: both are spoken of
the same person, the Church of God, which Christ calls, (...):

1. Sister, Because she is the Daughter of his Father in Heaven, and
fellow-heir of Glory with Christ.

2. Spouse, Because Christ had married himself unto her.

3. With one of thine eyes: with one chain of thy neck.] Not to postil on them.

1. With one of thine eyes; with one chain, i. e. with thy Graces, thy Wisdom,
and Knowledge, thy Faith, and other Graces: As if he had said; I need not to
behold both thine eyes: the beauty of one of them is so great, it takes my
heart. And I need not to behold all thine Ornaments: even one chain alone has
taken my heart, and drawn my heart to thee. Christ has an high account of the
least of his peoples Graces.

Thus having explained the words, we come to the conclusions. Thou have
ravished my heart.]

That the Heart of Jesus Christ is exceedingly taken with his Church and
people. Thou have ravished.

That which does so indear the Heart of Christ to them; that which takes the
Heart of Christ, is the beauties and graces of his people.

The least Grace of his Church, does greatly take the Heart of Christ. One Eye,
one Chain.

We think he cannot love us, we are so weak in Grace: but it is his own,
though never so weak, and he can love; we will fall upon the first of these.

That the Heart of Jesus christ is exceedingly taken with his Church and
People. In the prosecution of this we will show,

1. What is meant by his Heart being taken.

2. We will show that Christ's Heart is thus taken.

3. We will show upon what grounds his Heart is so much taken with his Church,
and so come to apply.

For the first; What is meant by his Heart being taken?

And here I must tell you in the entrance, that we cannot sufficiently express
it. It is one of the highest expressions in the Book of God toward his Church,
that the Heart of Jesus Christ should be taken with his Church.

An expression, which if we but let lie upon our spirit, the weight thereof
would sink us; shall I say, he does dearly and entirely love us; nothing is
too much to do, nothing is too great to suffer, nothing too much to give to us,
he does exceedingly love us.

Shall I say, his heart does exceedingly delight in us, his soul does
exceedingly rejoice over us, above all the World.

Shall I say, we are exceeding precious in his eyes, we are choice in his
esteem, Isa. 43.3, 4. such as he will give the World for, such as he will give
himself for, if he can but gain us, he esteems he has riches enough, and
reward enough for it.

Shall I say, his desires are toward us, he in a manner desires no more than
us; shall I say he thinks himself happy in the enjoyment of us, we are reward
enough for all his pains, and all his labor.

Why all this and more the Scripture says, and all this is yet short of this
expression, his Heart is taken with us.

This, the next particular will give us further insight into.

2. That the Heart of Jesus Christ is exceedingly taken, I may demonstrate to
you by diverse arguments.

That which the thoughts are taken up withal, that the heart must needs be
taken withal.

This is plain, you know a man will busy his thoughts about that which he
cares for: would thou know what thou love; Vis nosse quod ames, attend
quod cogites. Bern.
see what thy thoughts are upon. As if he had said, there can be no better
character to discover what your hearts are taken withal, than to examine what
your thoughts are most taken up withal; for what the thoughts are taken up
withal, the heart is taken withal. Now the thoughts of Christ are exceedingly
taken up with his Church and people. We are ever upon his thoughts.

There has not been a moment from all eternity wherein we have been out of
the thoughts of Christ.

Before the World was; we were on his thoughts, he thought on us to
everlasting life, loved us with everlasting love.

After we had lost our selves, we were then on his thoughts, when he
interposed himself between God and us, to stay his wrath from us.

Before we came into the World we were on his thoughts, witness all the
Scripture, in which are such expressions of his heart to us. After he came
into the World, you see we were the whole of his thoughts, we lay ever upon
his heart; you see by his doings, sufferings, prayer for us. Read the 14, 15,
16, 17. of John. See how his thoughts were taken up with us, when he was to
leave us, what love he showed, what care he expressed to us, what earnest
prayers he put up to God for us; read Joh. 17.9. to the end of the chapter.
Yea and what provision he made for us, he would not leave us comfortless, but
send his Spirit to comfort us, to guide us.

And now he is in Heaven, are not his thoughts on us? did he not tell us he
went to prepare a place for us, he went to do our work, to intercede for us,
to plead for us.

The Church of Christ is never a moment off from the thoughts of Christ, Isa.
49.15, 16. And therefore his Heart is exceedingly taken with his Church.

That which a man does affectionately and indearedly love, that the heart is
much taken withal, be it Husband, be it Wife, Child, the World, whatever.

Now Christ does exceedingly love his Church, we are said to be the dearly
beloved of his soul, Jer. 12.7. and read here, he loves us beyond all
expressions, so God loved the World, Joh. 3.16. so Christ he loves us beyond
all conceptions, Ephesians. 3.19. it is a love which passes knowledge.

In the former verse the Apostle went about to measure this love, height,
depth, breadth, length.

But he found his line too short, his measure would not reach, therefore he
concludes it a love beyond all knowledge.

A man may express much love, but he may conceive of more than he can
express. Why this love of Christ is above all we can conceive, above
knowledge. It is an infinite love. It is, I say, an infinite love, which is
more than if I should lay all the bowels in the Creature together, etc.

A greater love than all. Witness what is done, suffered, and yet love above
all. And therefore Christ's Heart is exceedingly taken with his Church and
People.

That which a man does glad his heart with, and which he rejoices over, he
must needs be taken with.

A man will not rejoice over the enjoyment of that he loves not. The rich Fool
rejoiced over his full Barns, but it was because his heart was taken with his
possessions.

Joy is a fruit of the hearts being taken with any thing; you rejoice in your
riches, Husbands, etc. in the possession of what ever your heart loves. Now the
Heart of Jesus Christ does exceedingly rejoice over his Church and People; they
are his by donation, God gave them to him; they are his by purchase, he laid
down his life for them; if we lay down our life to compass a thing sure we
rejoice in it.

We are his Riches, we his Treasure, his Ammies, Ruhama's, and Hephzibah's,
his precious ones, his People, his Spouse; and therefore he must needs rejoice
over us, Isa. 62.4, 5. Thou shall be called Heph-zibah, for the Lord
delights in thee: yea as the Bridegroom rejoices over the Bride, so shall
thy God rejoice over thee, Zeph. 3.17. The Lord will rejoice over thee with
Joy, he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing. And
therefore seeing Christ does rejoice. Ergo is the Heart of Jesus Christ
exceedingly taken, etc.

That which a man does delight to converse withal, that his heart is taken
withal.

Now Christ does delight exceedingly to converse with his Saints, he loves to
speak to them, and he loves to hear them speak to him, Cant. 2.14. Oh my Dove,
let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice, for thy countenance is
comely, and thy voice is sweet. When the Disciples are talking of him, Christ
joins himself to them. Ergo is the Heart of Christ much taken.

When the two were going to Emmaus, Luke 24.15. Christ comes and joins with
them, delights in their talk, Mal. 3.16. when Gods people were gathered
together, the Lord hearkened and heard.

5. That which a man thinks nothing to dear for, nothing too much to give for,
to do for, or suffer for, that the heart must needs be taken withal.

But thus it was with Christ to his Church.

1. He suffered in his Body, those spittings, buffetings, scourgings, etc.
that was dear to him, which he gave his heart blood for.

2. He suffered in his soul even the wrath of God for her.

3. He emptied himself of his own glory, took upon him the form of a servant,
with all our infirmities; penal, not culpable, as it is said of Jacob, he
counted all his labors but little for Rachel, because he loved her, Genesis
29.20.

6. That which a man's soul is satisfied and contented withal in the enjoyment
of it, that a man's heart is taken withal.

If a man's heart were not taken with the love of a thing, he would never think
himself happy, never be contented and satisfied with the enjoyment of it.
Whereas on the contrary, where the soul is filled with satisfaction in the
enjoyment of it (what ever it be) the heart is taken with it.

Now you shall see that the Heart of Jesus Christ is fully satisfied and
contented with the enjoyment of his Church, though it have cost him so much
pains, so much sweat and blood, yet the enjoyment of it is reward enough to
him. It is the reward which God promised him for his work, Psalm. 2.8. Ask of
me, and I will give thee the Heathen, etc. here, merit of me, lay down thy
life, and I will then give thee a Church, a People. And that which does
satisfy, Isa. 53 11. He shall see of the travel of his soul and be
satisfied; he shall see the fruit of his sufferings in the saving of souls,
and shall be satisfied with it. It shall be reward enough to him for all
pains that souls are saved, Isa. 62.11. his reward is with him, and his work
before him, he is the salvation of his people.

And this is that which some think is meant by the joy set before him, in Heb.
12.2. Who for the joy that was set before him, endured the Cross, despised the
shame.

Which Joy (says an holy and learned Interpreter) is nothing else but the
fruit of his sufferings, the redemption and salvation of his Church and People,
according to that in Isa. 53.12. Therefore will the Lord divide him a portion
with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he
has poured out his soul unto death.

And it is an Interpretation may be backed.

Well then, seeing whatever the heart of man rests satisfied in the enjoyment
of, the heart is taken withal.

And that Christ does rest satisfied in the enjoyment of his Church and People,
though it cost so much to obtain it. Ergo needs must it follow that the Heart
of Jesus Christ is exceedingly taken.

That which a man is exceeding chary of, dear of, his heart must needs be
taken with, those things which take our hearts, we are exceeding dear and
chary of them.

If it be the World, Husband, Wife, Child, a man is exceeding chary of them.
Deal gently with the young man Absalom, 2 Samuel 18.5. his heart was taken with
him, and he was chary of him.

Now Christ is exceeding chary over his Church: Oh! it is dear to him,
therefore he gives charge to the World, touch not one of these, you touch the
apple of mine eye, offend not one of these little ones, they are dear to me,
he is chary over them.

Yea he does not only charge, but menace too, and threatens men if they shall
hurt any of his little ones.

It had been better for you, that a Millstone were tied about your necks, and
cast into the middle of the Sea, than to offend any of these little ones.

Christ is exceeding chary over his Church and People, they are dear to him.

Take a taste of it, Job. 18.8. when he himself was in that Agony, and when
he suffered himself to be hailed before the Judges, and to dye, yet you see
how chary he was over his Disciples; why says Christ, I am he you seek for,
if therefore you seek me, let these go their way: As if he had said, I am he
whom you seek, and against whom your malice goes forth, do what you will with
me, but spare these, let these go (what have these done?) with Jonah, cast me
into the Sea, that the storm may cease, nail me on the Cross, fling me into
the grave, do with me what you will, that these may escape.

Oh! Christ must needs be chary of them, when he would put his back between
his Church and the stripes, interpose his soul between the wrath of God and
them.

Drink of that bitter cup that they might not taste of it, be wounded that
they might be healed, bear the curse, that they might carry away the blessing,
as there was no sorrow to his sorrow, so no love to his love, all loves are
lost, nay, seem hatred in comparison of his.

Another place, John 7.9. to the 16. see there when he was to go from them, how
chary he was over them, he commends them to his Father, and desines him to
keep them whom he had given him. As if he had said, Father they are mine, and
I love them dearly, I have done much for them, but I will do more, therefore
preserve them, therefore keep them.

I am no more in the World, but these are in the World, holy Father, through
thine own name keep those whom thou have given me; thus you see how chary
Christ was over them. And therefore his heart is exceedingly taken with his
Church.

He will keep them from trouble, he will buy out their trouble with the
troubles of the whole World, and their lives with the lives of thousands; you
have a place for this, Isa. 43.3, 4. I gave Egypt for thy ransom, I gave
Ethiopia and Seba for thee: God will give whole Kingdoms for his Church to
preserve them from trouble. I have loved thee, therefore will I give men for
thee, and people for thy life. As if he had said, I stand not at it to give
the heads of a thousand men, the lives of ten thousands to save thy life, to
preserve thee. The Ram to save Isaac, he is chary of them; if not to keep
them from trouble, yet to support them in trouble.

He is chary of them, he will deliver them out of trouble, he will not
suffer the rod of the wicked to rest.

Though for a time, yet, etc. many are the troubles of the Righteous, but he
knows how to deliver his, and reserve the wicked. If Christ do not deliver thee
from trouble, yet he will deliver thee in trouble; and at last he will
deliver thee out, who knows how to deliver his; when thou not, etc.

That which a man thinks all too little, nothing too much, too dear to bestow
upon, that the heart of a man is exceedingly taken withal.

Where all the expressions that a man can lay out, do still fall short of his
affections to it, it is a sign the heart is much taken with such a thing.

When a man thinks not riches, nor labor, nor his blood, his life too dear;
this shows the heart is much taken with it.

Now the Church is so dear to Christ, that he thinks nothing too dear, nothing
too much for it.

It was not his blood within his veins, nor his life within his breast, which
he counted too dear for her.

He can beseem to bestow any thing on her.

He will bestow temporals on her, Dabit sua quod non detinuit se.
at least so much as is necessary for her. All things necessary for life,
godliness, if he give himself, how much more all things? Romans 8.32. will he
give the greater, and deny the less? no. That love which gave the greater, will
not deny thee the less; if it were good for thee; so much he has engaged
himself by Covenant to give thee as to bear thy charge to Heaven, and then
there is no want.

The Lions shall hunger and suffer want, etc. He bestows Grace on thee; and
Faith is more precious than Gold: He might bestow out words on thee, and yet
his heart never taken with thee. Dives had more wealth; uttered more eloquence,
Saul more command, Agrippa more glorious apparel, than those his heart is taken
withal.

He may give Wealth to a Dives, Command to a Saul, Eloquence to a Herod.

But he never bestows Grace on any, but it is an evidence his heart is taken
with a man.

As Abraham gave portions to the sons of the Concubines, but Isaac had the
inheritance.

He will bestow his Spirit on thee, to inlighten, renew, etc. He will bestow
himself on thee, the collectioner of all other blessings; God cannot extend his
love further in giving, nor we ours in desiring. And that which a man bestows
himself upon must needs be precious in his eyes. Christ does bestow himself on
thee.

Who is the summum genus of gifts, the gift of gifts. The gift which does
entitle us to all other gifts, all is yours, if you be Christ's.

The gift which sweetens and sanctifies all other: Like the Unicorns horn takes
away the venom and poison of all other. There is a curse with all other gifts
if Christ be not given.

A curse to your Gold, your Silver, your Prosperity, your Meat, Drink, Health,
and Strength.

But where Christ is given, he takes off the curse, sanctifies all; he does
not only turn comforts into blessings, but crosses into blessings.

A blessing in sickness, in poverty, in death, etc. Christ bestows himself upon
his Church, he does pass over himself, and all his by deed of gift, he and
all his is yours: As you and all yours are his; your sins, and sorrows all his.

And all his are yours; his merits, his Spirit. As Christ said to the Father,
so may ye to Christ; all thine is mine; his merit, clothing, his blood drink,
flesh meat. He is meat, drink, clothes. Christ does not stay here, but he
bestows Heaven upon his Church. It is the Manor house which he has reserved
for his Spouse. Father, I will that those whom thou have given me, may be
where I am, etc. Joh. 17.24.

They are married together, and co-habitation is a marriage duty, etc.

As Ahasuerus had two houses for his Spouses.

And therefore seeing Christ thinks nothing too dear to bestow upon his Church:
hence must needs follow; That the Heart of Jesus Christ is exceedingly taken
with his Church.

1. Those which Christ has made all things for, to serve for the good of them.

2. Those whom he has prepared Glory for, Heaven for.

3. Those which he has shed his blood for, must needs be dear to him, his
Heart much taken with them.

If a King should build a stately house, for one with whom he would solace
himself all his life; and should at last give life too, you would think sure
he loved him.

1. God made all for thee, the Sun, Moon, Stars, Creatures; all this frame of
the World; sure you are dear to him.

2. God prepared Heaven for thee, a place of Glory, Happiness; where thou
should for ever enjoy him, and solace thy self with his love.

3. Christ shed his blood for thee, which was more dear to him than ten
thousand Worlds. What is all the World, and ten thousand Worlds in comparison
of one drop of his blood? and therefore they whom he shed his blood for, must
needs be more dear to him than all the World; his Heart is taken with them.

Thus far now we have gone in the breaking up the rich Cabinet of Christ's
Love, the sent whereof has cheared and revived us. We will now proceed to the
further discoveries of it, and that is, to the third thing we propounded, Why
the Heart of Christ is so much taken with his Church and People.

We will but give you these three grounds, all which are taken not from us,
but from himself, his own mercy. In brief, Either From his own Grace to us,
Amat Deus non aliunde hoc habet; sed ipse est unde amat; et ideo vehementius
amat, quia non amorem tam habet, quam hoc est ipse. Bern.
Or From his own Grace in us.


The first Ground or Reason, why the Heart of Christ is so taken, is,

1. Because we are his. Propriety you know is the great ground of love. We
love our own; our own Husbands, Wives, Children: They are ours, we have
propriety in them. So here; we are His; He has propriety in us, and
therefore loves us, Cant. 7.10. Cant. 7.10.
The Spouse makes the same argument. I am my Beloveds, and he is mine:
therefore his desire is toward me, therefore his heart is taken with me;
therefore his soul loves me. And we are his, in the dearest and sweetest
relations.

1. We are his People, his subjects. Christ is the King of Saints, whose
throne is in our hearts, and will brook no Rival: whose Scepter is his Word,
and whose Word is our Law. Nay, least this be too little.

2. We are his Friends. Henceforth I call you not Servants, but Friends. We
are his Friends and Favorites. Nay,

3. We are his Children, begotten again, and born again to everlasting life, 1
Pet. 1.3, 4. Being born again, etc.

4. We are his Spouse, such as he has married to himself in faithfulness and
truth, and such as he delights in.

5. We are his Members. The Church is his Body, his fullness, and every one
Members in particular, as the Apostle speaks.

6. We are his Jewels, his Treasure, Mal. 3.7. In the day that I make up my
Jewels, they shall be mine. And therefore his heart must needs be taken with
us. Christ has the same argument. Where the Treasure is; there will the heart
be also. The Heart, and a man's Treasure lie together. Now we are his Jewels,
his Treasure, Ubi thesaurus tuus, ibi cor tuum. Bern.
his Portion, his Inheritance; that which his Father left him; and he must
dearly earn it too. And therefore the Heart of Christ is exceedingly taken with
his Church and People. So you see this is the first ground, why, because we
are his, and his in the dearest, nearest, choicest of Relations.

To be brief, we are his these four ways. We are his 1. By Choice. 2. By
Purchase. 3. By Donation. 4. By Covenant.


1. First, We are his By Choice. He set his heart on us from everlasting,
which was his first love, and that which has carried God through all the
expressions of his mercy toward us, to this day, even to admiration of Angels,
and astonishment of men. These were his primitive, his bosome-thoughts to us,
his first love, which is most dear and precious. As the first love of the
Creature to the Creator is most precious in Gods esteem: the Virgin-love of the
soul to God; those affections the soul has, when first enamoured with God.
Therefore he tells the Children of Israel: He remembered the time of her
Espousals, the kindness of her youth. That will not out of his mind, Jer. 2.2.

So the first love of the Creator to the Creature; his bosom-thoughts, Amor Dei
non invenit, sed facit amore dignos. Bern.
they are most precious. Oh! these take the heart; these are the fullest, these
are his freest thoughts toward us, 2 Timothy 1.9.

All the World stood before him, from the first man to the last. And why he
should choose us, Non quia nos delexerimus Deum, sed quia ipse prior dilexit
nos, denique dilexit, etiam non existentes, sed and resistentes, juxta Pauli
testimonium, quoniam cum adhuc inimici essemus reconciliati sumus (...) Deo,
per mortem Christi filii ejus. Bern. in Cant. (...).
and pass by others; others finer pieces of Clay than we are: others of
greater parts, greater abilities: which if it had pleased God to have conquered
to himself, might have brought him far more glory, done him more service. Here
was only his free mercy. There was no ground to make him choose us, before he
loved us: but there is some ground to cause him to love us, now he has chosen
us. We are his, and his by free choice, chosen and singled out of a world of
men. And therefore will he love us.

2. We are his By Purchase. He has bought us, and that at a dear rate, with
the price of his own blood, Gal. 4.5. Christ was made under the Law, that he
might buy out those, who were under the Law. Hence, 1 Cor. 6.20. You are bought
with a price. And what was the price? It could not be too little for the
meanness of the commodity, not worth owning when he had it. But it cost him
his dearest Hearts-blood; as 1 Pet. 1.18. We were not redeemed with
corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ,
as of a Lamb, without blemish, without spot. So then we are his by Purchase;
we are the fruits of all his pains; of all his doings and sufferings; we are
the commings in which Christ had for his Blood; we are his Purchase.

God did covenant and bargain with Christ, that if he would lay down his life
and blood for a people, he should have them: which you see in Psalm. 2.8. Ask
of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, that is, says
one, merit of me, lay down thy life and blood, and thou shall have a people:
as you see in Isa. 53.11, 12. He shall see of the travel of his soul.

That if he would dye, we should live: if he would bear the curse, we
should have the blessing. If he would bear that wrath our sins deserved, and
interpose himself between the Justice of God and us, the quarrel should be
taken up; God would be at peace. If he would purchase us, he should enjoy
us. And Christ he undertook this. He loved us; and seeing he could not have
us, except he did buy us; and could not buy us, except he gave his blood for
us, and as it were sell himself to the justice of God, that he might buy us
out: He was content to do it. He redeemed us, not with silver or gold, etc.
And now being purchased by him, his by Purchase, and so dear a Purchase; his
heart must needs be taken with us. Indeed he bought us, because he loved us:
and now he loves us, because he has bought us. If we did lay down our
blood, our life for the purchase of a thing, and could after live to enjoy it,
how exceedingly would our hearts delight in it! Christ has given his blood,
and laid down his life for the purchase of his Church and People; and he lives
to enjoy his purchase; and therefore the Heart of Christ must needs be taken
with it.

Shall I tell you? You are all the delight which Christ has in the World: He
delights to see you, he delights to be with you; he delights to converse
with you; and all the delights of Christ are taken up with you; he has
nothing worth beholding but you, in the World.

3. We are his By Donation. God has given us to him, Joh. 6.37. All that the
Father has given me, shall come unto me, Joh. 17.9, 11, 12. I pray not for
the World, but for them whom thou have given me. -- Holy Father, keep through
thy own name those whom thou have given me.

We were so bought, as yet we were given: else where is Gods Mercy? and so
given, as yet we were bought: else where is his Justice? Gods arms are equal;
in the length of the one, you have the measure of the other: and therefore he
did so express his Mercy to man, as withal he did preserve his Justice. They
were so given, as yet bought; and so bought as yet given.

And being his by Donation, God having made them over to Christ by Deed of
Gift, being the full desire of Christ, hence the Heart of Christ is taken with
them.

4. We are his By Covenant, Ezekiel. 16.8. Then I entered into Covenant with thee,
and thou becamest mine. Christ became ours, we his: He is our King, and we
his People he is our Husband, and we his Spouse: he has given himself to
us, and we have re-given our selves to him: we his delight, he ours. And
being his in Covenant, in mutual stipulation, and bargain, the Heart of Christ
is taken with us.

2. Because she is adorned with his beauties. She is beautiful, Cant. 4.1.
Cant. 6.4, 10.

There is a twofold beauty which Christ does communicate to his Church, which
makes the Church lovely in his eyes.

1. The beauties of his Righteousness.

2. The beauties of his Holiness and Graces.

But these are not communicated the same way.

The one is communicated to us By Imputation.


The other By Emanation, or Infusion.


The one a Beauty, Imparted.


The other, Imputed.


1. Christ does communicate to his Church his Imputed Beauty, then 2. His
Righteousness, wherewith he clothes our souls. Hence He is called
Jehovah-our-Righteousness. And is said to be made Wisdom, Righteousness,
Sanctification and Redemption. And we to put on Christ.

Now this Righteousness Christ does communicate to us by Imputation making it
ours, as if we in our own persons had wrought it. And it is as truly ours to
save us, to justify us, as it is his to glorify him. And God looking upon us
through Christ, and Christ looking upon us in himself, as clothed with his
Righteousness, he beholds us beautiful. He sees no iniquity in Jacob, nor
transgression in Israel. Not but that there was iniquity in Jacob; but God did
not see it; God looked on him as clothed with the Righteousness of Christ,
and so is said, not to see it.

As the Sun shining through a red glass upon a wall, the wall looks red: not
that this color is inherent in it; but relucent upon it: So God looking on us
through Christ, does behold us Righteous in his Righteousness; not that this is
inherent in us, or beheld in us; as the Papists charge us, but quoad gratiosum
Dei conspectum, we are rather beheld in it.

I am not ignorant, there are some, besides Papists, that deny the imputation
of Christ's Righteousness, and say too much with them, Iustitiam putatativam.
Justitiam Christi imputari commentum est, and call this imputative
Righteousness, an imaginary and fancied Righteousness.

I wish they would consider that we say.

We say there is a twofold Righteousness in Christ.

1. His essential and personal Righteousness, as God.

2. His Mediatory Righteousness, wrought as Mediator.

The first of these cannot be imputed to us; it is essential, but the latter
of these (Justitia Mediatoria) his Mediatory Righteousness, or that
Righteousness he wrought for us as Mediator, whereby he did subject himself
to the Precepts, to the Penalties, Commands, and Curses; answering both Gods
vindictive and rewarding Justice; This is communicated to us, and made ours, by
virtue of which we stand recti in curia, justified in Gods sight, which is the
first beauty Christ adorns his Church withal.

2. A second beauty wherewith Christ adorns his Church, and makes her lovely,
is, The Beauties of his Graces; which may be called the Beauties of Holiness,
and set forth to us by those Bracelets, and chains, Ezekiel. 16.9. and here by one
Chain, etc. which is communicated to us, by way of Infusion, or Emanation,
whereby Christ by his Spirit, does derive from himself as the universal
Principle, and common stock of Grace; Grace for Grace, according to that, Joh.
1.16. Of his fullness we have all received Grace for Grace.

I know there are many interpretations of this. Chrysostom. The Gospel for the
Law, because it follows, The Law came by Moses.

Others, Gratiam, super Gratiam, or Gratiam gratiae accumulatam, one grace to
another, or abundance of Grace.

But this I conceive the meaning. For every Grace that is in Christ, there is
some Grace communicated to us answerable to it, in some proportion. As the
Child in Generation receives from the Parents member for member; or as the
Paper from the Press, letter for letter; or the Glass from the face, image
for image; or the Wax from the Seal, stamp for stamp: so we from Christ, Grace
for Grace.

There is no Grace in Christ appertaining to our sanctification in general,
which is not in some weak degree fashioned in us. And hence the work of Grace
and Regeneration is called a forming of Christ in the soul. And whiles we
behold him, we are said to be changed into his likeness, 2 Cor. 3.18. And
we are said to have the same Spirit in us, that is in Christ, Romans 8.9. If any
man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And the same Mind is in
us, that is in Christ, Phil. 2.6.

There is a bastardly holiness, a painted false beauty, which is spun out of
our selves, wrought out of our own Principles, with which we shall lie down
with sorrow at last. Sparkles of our own kindling.

But the true holiness flows from Christ, and is imparted from Christ to his
Church, whereby she is beautiful with his beauties, adorned with his Graces.
And being thus, the Heart of Jesus Christ must needs be taken with her.

Thus you see the second Reason, why the Heart of Christ is so much taken.
Because she is adorned with his Beauties, clothed with his Righteousness,
adorned and beautified with his Graces; which ingageth the Heart of Jesus
Christ.

He that loved us in our own blood, cannot choose but love us, as we have his
beauty put upon us; he cannot but love himself, and delight in himself,
wherever he does behold himself: why these beauties are pieces of himself,
part of his beauty, his rays wherewith he himself is adorned. And he cannot
look upon any soul clothed with his Righteousness, and beautified with his
Graces, but his heart is exceedingly taken with them, Cant. 6.4, 5. Turn away
thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Christ seems as not able to
bear the view of such a beauty. Turn away thine eyes, etc.

2. Because they are the persons, upon whom God intended to advance the great
design of glorifying the Riches and Freeness of his Grace and Mercy.

Now those whom God has intended for so great purposes, as these are, which
are the greatest Purposes that ever came upon his heart, his heart must needs
be taken withal. You know the more glorious and excellent the End to which
any thing serves, the more precious is that thing in our eyes. Now we serve
for no other End, but the expression of his Mercy, the advancement of the Glory
of his Free Grace, which are Ends as high as himself, Purposes as great as
himself.

And therefore God is not only taken with the expression of it, but with the
persons upon whom he does express it. Therefore I say is the Heart of God so
exceedingly taken with his Church.

Indeed God may single out some men for the purposes of expressing the glory of
his Power and Justice, the advancement of them; and yet God hate the men, as
you see it plain in Pharaoh, who for this cause was set up to advance his
Power. But God never singled out any to be the subjects on whom he does
intend to advance the Riches of his Grace and Mercy; but his Heart is
exceedingly taken with them.

Those, who serve to such high purposes as these, and are designed to such high
ends as these; The advancement of the Glory of his Grace and Free-Mercy (which
is the most precious attribute of God, and which some think is called his
Glory, Exodus 33.18. Let me see thy Glory,) and if the 19. verse may interpret
it, that Glory was his Mercy, and his Mercy his Glory; and therefore such must
needs be precious in his esteem.

Now his People are they, whom God has singled out for these great purposes,
for the Expression of more Mercy, than we can express, nay, than we can
conceive, nay, than we can believe at all times, but weakly at best.

And therefore the Heart of Jesus Christ must needs be taken with them.

My Brethren, If God had not singled out some to express himself thus upon, God
had not been known in the World; for there is nothing so much reveals God to
be God, as his Mercy and Grace.

And therefore God singled out a few upon whom he would advance the riches of
his Grace, that his Mercy, and in that himself might be made known in the
World.

As Paul says of himself, 1 Timothy 1.16. that he obtained Mercy, that he might
stand up a Pattern of all long-suffering. As if he had said. We should not
have known how patient God is, we should not have apprehended how
long-suffering God is to sinners, if he had not had such an example of
patience, such a pattern of all long-suffering, as I was: So we should not
have known how Merciful, how Good God is, if the choicest attribute of God had
been lost to us; like as if a great River had run under ground not discerned;
if God had not singled out some, upon whom he might have expressed the Riches
of his Mercy.

And those whom God does intend to be the subjects upon whom he may advance
so high designs, so great purposes, must needs be exceeding precious to him.

My Brethren, you that are the People of God, are such as he has intended to
advance his Mercy, and Glory of Free Grace upon; You are they he sent Christ
to dye for, the greatest work that ever was wrought in the World. You are they
whom he reared the fabric of Heaven for. You are they in whom he intends to
delight, and with whom he will solace himself for ever.

And God looks upon us now, not as we are, but what he intends to make us. He
sees to the utmost of his design on you, to eternity, and loves you now with
that love.

If God should look upon us, as we are, he might see enough in us, to
withdraw his heart from us: or if not, yet enough to cool and quench his
affections toward us; being there is so much blackness with our beauty, so
much deformity with our comeliness, so much corruption with our Graces: Nay, so
much blackness, and so little beauty, and so much corruption, and so little
Grace.

But he looks upon us, not as we are in our selves, but as we are in Christ,
and not what we are for present, but what he intends to make us in Christ.
He looks to the end of his design, even to that which he has designed us to.
-- When we shall be presented without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing:
holy, and without blemish, Ephesians. 5.27. -- When we shall be satisfied with
his likeness, Psalm. 17.15. -- When we shall be (...), like to the Angels;
nay, like unto God, Glorious with his Glory, as now Gracious with his Grace.

And therefore God having intended us to such high purposes, and looking upon
us for present, what he purposes to make us, and what he has designed us to;
needs must the Heart of Jesus Christ be taken with us.

Thus having showed you, what it is to have the Heart of Christ taken with the
Church; and proved unto you that the Heart of Christ is thus taken with it; and
given you the grounds and reasons of it; I will now descend to application;

If so be, that the Heart of Jesus Christ be taken with his Church and People:
Then from hence we may deduce these Consectaries.

1. Consectary.
1. This then may be a ground for us to expect, and hence our Faith may be
strengthened in the expectation, that Christ will yet do more for his Church
and People, than yet he has done.

Indeed he has done much for our Nation, for our English Sion.

He might have ruined us, for a Generation of such as provoked him. We have
been a Provocation of his Anger to this day. He might have suffered our
carcasses to have fallen in the Wilderness, and kept our posterity to have
entered into Canaan. We have looked toward Egypt, toward Babylon. He might
have laid the foundation of purer times in our blood, raised up a purer Church
upon the ruins of us.

But God has seemed to overlook our great unworthiness: And to the terror of
our enemies, and even to the astonishment and wonder of us all, has begun, set
forth, and gone forward in a way of mercy; such ways as have been untrodden in
former times.

And that which God has given us in hand, is an earnest of what we have in
hope: that we have in possession bids us but look to what we have in promise.

And expect the performance of it, because God loves the Church: the Heart of
Christ is taken with the Church.

He loves his Church, and therefore he will purify his Church, aad take away
her dross and tin.

He loves his Church, and therefore will he reform his Church.

He loves his Church, and therefore will he take away whatsoever does offend,
all soul-burthens, all conscience-burthens, which oppress the spirits of his
own People.

1. The Church is his Fold, and he will destroy the Wolves, which have gotten
in to devour the sheep.

2. The Church is his Field, and he will weed out the Tares, and bind them in
bundles to burn them.

3. The Church is his House, and he will sweep it.

4. It is his Flore, and he will fan, and blow away the chaff.

That love which made him engage himself to his Church, in precious promises,
will not suffer him to rest, till he has made good those promises to it.

That love which moved him to begin, will not suffer him to rest, till he has
made an end.

You see in Ezekiel. 37.27. the whole Chapter is but an addition of Mercy to Mercy.

When God begins to go forth toward a people, in a way of mercy, he knows no
stop, he can make no end. I will do this, and also this, as you see in that
Chapter. God adds Mercy, to Mercy.

And the reason is, because Free-love begins, and that knows no end.

The proceedings of Gods Mercy, toward his Church and People, do arise from
himself, his own Free Grace.

His Justice is from us; but his Mercy is from himself.

If, when he threatened to punish Israel, he says, he will add Judgment to
Judgment. This, and this also will I do, Amos 4.12. How much more then when
he promises to show Mercy to Israel, will he add Mercy to Mercy.

God has Also's of Mercy, as well as of Judgment. See in Ezekiel. 37.27. My
Tabernacle also shall be, etc.

Well then: Is the Heart of Christ taken with his Church and People? Then will
we with confidence believe, and with patience wait and expect, that Christ
will yet do more for his Church and People, than ever he has done, because
he loves them?

Let us but join Supplication with Expectation; Praying, with Waiting, and we
shall see it, to the joy of our hearts.

I never read, that ever God bestowed any great Mercy and deliverance upon his
Church and People, but he first stirred up the hearts of his people mightily to
pray unto him.

And never did God mightily stir up the hearts of his People to seek him, but
he wrought some great Mercy and deliverance for them.

God loves to make his People as thankful as they were prayerful: As happy
Injoyers, as they were humble Seekers. When Trouble sends us to Prayer, then
Deliverance shall send us to Praises.

Let us then join our Supplications to our Expectations. Times of great
Expectations, should be times of Great Supplications: whether they be

1. Expectations of Hope, the Object whereof is Good.

2. Or, Expectations of Fear, the Object whereof is Evil.

3. Or, Mixed Expectations between Hope and Fear, as our times are; they are
times of Expectation, and therefore they ought to be times of Supplication.
We are now big with Expectation; let us now be mighty in Supplication. Great
Stones are not to be turned over without great strength. Great Mercies are not
to be gotten without great strivings. The Man-child of Deliverance is not to
be brought forth without pangs.

Let us then be mighty in Prayer. That will make all our present throws and
pangs subservient to deliverance: And then let us stand still and wait.

1. Wait for performance of Promises. 2. Wait for performance of Prayers.
There are many thousand Prayers registered in Gods-book, and many thousand
Tears put up in Gods-bottle. Let us wait when all these shall come down upon
our heads in a warm shower of Mercy.

Wait when the great revenew of Prayers will come in. The longer the stay, the
greater will be the harvest. We say, great Engines move slowly. Magnarum
rerum tarda molimina.
Small things they are quickly wheeled about; but great Mercies they are long in
conception, long in the womb, and long in the birth.

This is all our comfort: God will not bring to the birth, and afterward not
bring forth: nor will he bring forth, and afterward shut the womb again, as
he says, Isa. 66.9.

He is Alpha and Omega, the Beginner, and the Finisher; where he lays the
foundation, there he will lay the roof upon it.

2. Consectary.
If the Heart of Christ be once taken with his Church and People: Then he
will never take his heart off from them. His heart once taken, shall never be
taken off. Men may love to day, and hate to morrow: but God cannot: whom he
loves once, he loves to the end; even to all eternity.

As there was nothing in us, that was the ground of his planting his love upon
us: so there is nothing that shall be able to over-turn the thoughts of his
love, when once they are fixed on us.

Indeed our behavior may be such, as may cause God to be angry with us, and
correct us sharply; yea, and make us to know, we had better never to have
tried conclusions with him: But there is nothing shall cause him to hate us,
and cast us off. He may correct his Spouse, but he will not divorce her. The
Israelites were so hard-hearted, that for every trivial fact they would put
away their Wives: But the Lord hates putting away, Mal. 2.16.

If sin foreseen were not able to hinder him from planting his heart on us:
but though he saw what we would be, yet he loved us: How then shall it be
able to over-turn the thoughts of his heart, when once they are fixed on us?

Men indeed are not able to see to the utmost of things; they are not able to
discover and foresee all the inconveniences and evils that may arise: and
therefore that being discovered after, which was not fore seen before, may be
a ground to alter their affections, and change their thoughts, when fixed. The
less Judgment and foresight in men, the more fickleness, and changeableness
in men.

But now God he foresaw all. He foresaw all that, which thou now think
is a ground for him to alter his mind to thee.

And, if all that foreseen could not hinder him from fixing his love on thee,
neither shall it be able to move him to take off his heart, when once his
heart is taken with thee.

Hence he is said to make an everlasting Covenant with us, and he will never
depart from us. Nay, He will put his fear into our hearts, that we shall
never depart from him, Jer. 32.40.

And Isa. 54.9, 10. says the Lord (speaking of the Covenant of Grace, which
he will make with his people.) It shall be as the Waters of Noah unto me:
for as I have sworn that the Waters of Noah should no more go over the Earth:
so have I sworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. As if he
had said, this is as sure as the other: the one as firm as the other. You have
experience of the one, believe the other. I give you the same pawn, the same
seal of Heaven to confirm it.

If Men were as bad as Devils, they should never bring a second flood upon the
World; because God has sworn never to destroy it. And as he has sworn to
that, and is therefore steadfast and immutable. So he has sworn to the other,
that he will never leave you, nor forsake you; and therefore God will not.

Object. But alas! Do we not see that God does sometimes forsake his Church
and People?

Answ. Now for the answer of this, we will premise these three Distinctions.

1. There is a seeming, and there is a real forsaking. 2. There is a Temporary,
and an eternal forsaking. 3. There is a partial, and a total forsaking.
From these we will lay down three Conclusions, in answer to the Objection.

1. Conclusion.
God does sometimes Seemingly, Deus bonos non negligit, cum negligit.
when he does not really forsake his people. God does not really neglect his
People, when he seems to neglect them.

He seemed to neglect and forsake Job, Heman, David, Christ himself, when he
cries, My God! My God! why have thou forsaken me?

It was Dissimulatio, non indignatio, as one speaks. He feigned himself to be
gone, but was not gone.

The Cloud may take the Sun from our sight; but not rent it from the Sky. God
may seemingly be gone, when he is really there.

He seemed to be gone from Job, but he was really there. Otherwise Job could
not have trusted in him, in that great difficulty.

The same I may say of Heman, of David. Though God seemed to be gone, yet he
was really there. Otherwise they could not have prayed, exercised their Faith,
and sought after God, as they did.

So also was it with the Church in the Canticles, cap. 3.1. cap. 5. beg. And
that is the first Conclusion, God may seemingly, when not really forsake his
People.

2. Conclusion. God may partially forsake his People; but he does never
totally forsake them.
I say, God may in part forsake his People, which may be occasioned on their
part, by some fresh and new-acted sin. As you see it was with David, Psalm.
51.1. David had sinned: God had withdrawn himself. God was gone, comfort was
gone, light was gone for a time. Works of Darkness, and walking in Darkness
went together. He did not follow the Direction, and therefore wanted the
Consolation of the Spirit.

But though he does partially sometimes, yet he does never totally forsake
his people.

For the clearer understanding of this Conclusion, you must know there is a
threefold Presence of God 1. Quickening. 1. Comforting. 3. Supporting.


1. God may forsake a man in part, in respect of his Quickening presence, and
leave a man to the barrenness, flatness, deadness of his own spirit for a time,
that the soul cannot pray, hear, meditate, do any thing, as formerly it has
done. As it was with Sampson when his locks were cut, his strength was gone;
and therefore though he thought to go out, and do as he did in former times,
yet he found there was no such matter; he was become even as another man: so
it is here; our strength lies, not in our hair, but in our head. When God is
gone, our Locks are cut, our strength is gone. And though we may think to go
upon duties, as at other times, and meet with those lively and vigorous
workings of spirit in duty: yet we shall find no such matter; we are even
become as other men.

Indeed so much of his Quickening Spirit God leaves in the worst of times, as
usually, to keep up the heart to duty. The soul will pray, will read, etc. but
he gives not so much, as to carry the soul through the duty, with that life
and vigor of affection, which formerly it had.

Time was, that the soul never came to prayer without an inflamed heart, never
upon the duty, without a quick and enlarged soul. But now the spirit is dead in
duty, cold in duty, heartless in the performance of those things, wherein the
heart was so much taken.

2. God may forsake a man in respect of his Comforting presence. Though man is
not able to rob us of our comforts, and take away our joys, they are such as
the arms of men are not long enough to reach; yet God he can. He may eclipse
our joys, and damp our comforts, and withdraw the beams of his Countenance
from us, and leave us in darkness and trouble. I say, he may turn our Day into
Night, our Light into Darkness, our Comforts into Discomforts.

Thus you see it was with Job, with David, with Heman, Psalm. 88. who, although
they had the Quickening-presence of God, yet they wanted his
Comforting-presence.

And indeed of the two, it is better to want the Comforting, than the
Quickening-presence. Better to want Comfort than Life; Joies than Graces, or
the lively exercise of them. The one is the Esse, the other but the Been Esse
of a Christian. A man may live, and serve God, and obey him; and yet want his
Comforting-presence; as you see, Isa. 50.10. But he cannot live without his
Quickenning-presence.

3. God may forsake a man in part, in respect of his Quickening-presence, and
he may more forsake a man in respect of his Comforting-presence: But God does
never forsake us in respect of his Supporting-presence.

In the saddest condition, in the darkest night, in the stormiest day, the soul
has still support from him.

David, Job, Heman, they wanted the Comforting-presence of God for a time; but
yet they had his Quickening, and they had his Supporting presence.

As he told Paul, so he did for all. His strength was seen in their weakness,
and his Grace was sufficient for them. Sufficient to bear them up in the trial,
and sufficient to bring them out of the trial. So much for the second
Conclusion.

3. Conclusion. God may forsake his People for a time, not for ever.
It is but a Temporary, not a Final, not an Eternal forsaking, Isa. 54.7, 8, 9,
10. For a moment have I forsaken thee; but with everlasting kindness will I
gather thee, have mercy on thee. For the Mountains shall depart, and the Hills
shall be removed: but my kindness shall not depart from thee.

And thus much shall serve for the answer of the Objection. And notwithstanding
that, the Conclusion is firm. That if the Heart of Christ be once taken with
his Church and People, he will never take it off; he will never clean forsake
them.

And, as God will not forsake his Church, as Forsaking has relation to
Spiritual cases, Soul-distresses: So I might show you at large, to prevent
another Objection.

That he will not forsake his Church, as Forsaking has relation to temporal
and outward distresses.

You may take his word for it, Josh. 1.5. I will not leave, nor forsake thee.

It is true, it was a promise made to Joshua in particular; but belongs to the
whole Church of God in general.

General promises may have particular applications, and particular general.

As general promises belong to every paticular Member: so particular promises
may belong to the whole body. And therefore though it was a promise to Joshua;
yet the Apostle (who knew the mind of God makes it ours, as well as his. He
brings it into the Common-stock, and shows it part of our riches, Heb. 13.5.
Let your Conversation be without Covetousness; for he has said, He will
never leave thee, nor forsake thee. In brief; He will not forsake his Church;
1. Either he will protect them from dange^^ 2. Or he will deliver them out,
3. Or he will support them in, 4. Or he will sanctify all to them.


Which is the third Conclusion which flows from this Doctrine.

3. Consectary. If the Heart of Jesus Christ be taken with his Church: then
all the passages of Gods providence in the World, are for the good of his
Church and People.
All the dealings of God in the world, not a step God takes in the World, but
he walks toward his people in it.

1. All the passages of Gods Providence to the Church in general.

2. All the passages of Gods Providence to any member of the Church in
particular, they are all for good.

1. For the first, All the passages of Gods providence to his Church in
general, they are for good. Be they sad, or be they joyful, they are all for
good. Are they sad? it is to humble them, to quicken them, to purge them, to
purify them, to blow away their chaff.

This is certain. Whatever is done in the World, is done either by Gods
Permission, or by Gods Approbation. God must either permit, or allow of what
ever is done in the World.

And assure your selves, God would never permit, much less would he ever
allow, and approve of any thing to be done in the World, which should not be
for the good of those he loves so dearly.

Whatever wind blows, be it North, or South, good or evil; all is for the
Churches benefit. As the Physician orders poisonous and destructive
ingredients unto useful services, the health of the Patient: So God turns
those things which in themselves are evil, and destructive; to the good and
comfort of his Church and People.

Hence is it, that Christ turns the sadest and sorest perplexities that ever
the World shall see, into an use of Comfort to his Church, Luke 21.25, 26, 27,
28. There shall be signs in the Sun; and Moon, and Stars, distress of Nations,
with perplexity, etc. Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after
those things which are coming on the World; for the Powers of Heaven shall be
shaken; and then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a Cloud, with Power
and great Glory. When these things begin to come to pass -- then look up, and
lift up your heads: for your Redemption draws nigh.

One would think this were a strange consequent deduced from such an
Antecedent. A Consequent so comfortable, from an Antecedent so terrible. It
seems strange, that such a terrible Doctrine as this, should afford an use of
Consolation. Yet so it is. Be the Premises what they will, the Conclusion is
good. Be his Providence what they will, his Promises are good: and those
Promises shall turn all his Providence to good at the last.

2. As all the passages of Gods Providence to the Church in general: So every
passage of his Providence to any Member of it in particular, is for the good of
the Church.

1. All your Enjoyments, they are love. You may read the Heart of Christ, the
image of a friend, engraven upon all you have. You may behold the impress of
love, the good will of God circled about all you do enjoy.

All that wicked men do enjoy, is but from the Hand of God; Ex largitate.
that is the highest tenure they can show; even his general Providence, which
causes the Sun to shine upon the good and bad. And this Tenure may be cut off
at pleasure.

But all that you do enjoy, is from the Heart and good will of God. They are
expressions of his good will to you, and you may read Love in all.

Nay, they are the Earnests of further love. You may see and read Heaven and
Glory in all you have.

We may well say; whatever the People of God do enjoy, They are 1. The fruits
of Prayer. 2. The performance of Promises. 3. Expressions of Love. 4.
Encouragements to believe. 5. Inablements to obey. 6. Earnest pennies of Heaven
and Glory.


2. All your wants, as well as all your enjoyments are mercy, are love. There
is an Expedit in all the sad passages of Gods providence to you. They are
Expedient to try you, Expedient to humble you, to exercise you, to win you,
to wean you, etc.

Whatever thy condition is, it proceeds, 1. From the best God. 2. From the best
of God; his Heart and good will. 3. It is the best for thee.


Wicked men have a curse hid in their best things: a curse in their gold, a
curse in their silver, a curse in their health. But Gods people have a blessing
hid in the worst things. You have a blessing in poverty, a blessing in
sickness, a blessing in crosses, a blessing in death it self.

Riches are not in the Promise, but Mercy is in the Promise. Though Poverty,
yet Mercy; though Afflictions, yet Mercy; And you can all tell me, A cross in
Mercy, is better than a comfort in wrath. A loss in love, better than an
enjoyment in displeasure. More dye in the Flood, than in the Ebb. Though
prosperity be more cordial, yet afflictions are more physical. We often
surfeit of Cordials, when Physic does us good. And a sanctified cross is
better than an unsanctified comfort, etc.

4. Consectary.
If the Heart of Christ be taken with his Church and People;

1. Then see what a fearful thing sin is, which does cause God oftentimes to
deal hardly with that, which his soul loves so dearly.

God does oftentimes afflict and punish his Church sharply and severely: which
yet his heart is much taken withal. And sin is the cause. And therefore what a
fearful thing is sin!

How grievous would it be to you, to be forced to take hard courses with a
Child your heart is taken withal? though it be to do him good.

Why God is taken with his Church, and do you not think it moves God to afflict
and chastise it?

We would fain do all the good we can to the persons we love. Oh! we can
never do enough for them. Why so it is with God to his Church: He loves his
Church, and willingly would he do any thing for it. And it is the grief of his
soul, that he must take contrary courses with us, to do us good: that he must
be forced to afflict and chastise them he loves so dearly: to bring them to
Life by Death, to Good by Evil, to a Crown by Crosses.

When God parted with the ten Tribes, you see what a conflict there was in him:
how his bowels stirred, and were moved toward them, notwithstanding all their
sins, Hos. 11.8. How shall I give thee up, Ephraim! How shall I deliver thee,
Israel! How shall I make thee as Admah! How shall I set thee as Zeboim! My
heart is turned within me; my repentings are kindled together.

How loath was God to seal to a Bill of Divorce! His heart loved her, though
she was an Adultress to him.

And when Judah did justify the sin of her Sister Israel, exceeding her in
Idols, what trouble was it to God to cast her off! How willing was he to
receive her after all her adulteries? Jer. 3.1. Thou have played the Harlot,
etc. And when she would go on in her adulteries: yet how unwilling still was
he to give her up? till at last it grew so high, that there was no Remedy, 2 Chronicles. 36.16. he must needs do it.

And when he had done it, how exceedingly was Gods heart moved, that he must
be forced to deal so hardly with them he loved so dearly? read Jer. 12.7,
8.9, etc. See how God laments over the loss of that which their sins would not
give him leave to keep. -- I have forsaken mine house! I have left mine
heritage! I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her
enemies! And what was it that forced God to deal so hardly with them he loved
so dearly? Why it was sin, 2 Chronicles. 36.15, 16. He sent Messengers, because he
had compassion on them: They mocked the Messengers of God, and despised his
words, and mis-used his Prophets; until the wrath of the Lord arose against his
People, till there was no Remedy. And which of these has remained to be done
among us? How has our Sun been darkened, the Stars lost their light! How many
burning and shining lights have been taken out of our Candlesticks, and planted
in others! How many blown out by the rage of wicked men!

Did we not justly fear, by reason of that Idolatry, Superstition,
Profanation of Sabbaths, Persecution of the Saints, and Messengers of God,
that our day was gone; our night approaching?

Did we not fear, that we were come up to this, that there was no remedy?
That God should have opened the Sluices of his wrath, and let in a Sea of his
displeasure upon us? made us an Aceldema, a field of Blood, long before this?

Ah, my Brethren! Never Nation, never Church from whom God has showed himself
more unwilling to depart and leave, than England.

Look upon the passages of us to God, and his ways toward us; and see how
unwilling he declared himself. God has upheld us, as if he himself should
fall, if we did not stand: as if his Glory could not stand, if we fall: as if
his Glory had depended upon our preservation.

And how can we better answer Gods dealings toward us, than to abandon that,
cast out that which was our fear, and gave God just occasion to destroy us? Let
us now do by our sins as the Israelites did by their Leaven. There was 1.
Inquisitio fermenti. There was search made for it. So let us search out that
Leaven of sin, Superstition, Idolatry, which have sowred our Kingdom, and laid
us open to the stroke of Gods wrath. Search your houses, search the land,
search your hearts. 2. Ejectio fermenti. 3. Execratio fermenti.


And let all be found in us, if ever we would have a Passover.

Otherwise our Preservations from former, will be but Reservations to future,
and worser evils: sin will cause God to punish those he loves.

5. Consectary.
If the Heart of Christ be so much taken with his Church; Then let this
discover to you, into what you way resolve all the passages of Gods love to his
Church and People, even into his own Love. His Grace is the rise, and his Glory
is the end.

There are two main streams, in which the goodness of God does run to his
Church.

1. The higher, and 2. The lower.
But both these streams have the same Head, the same spring from whence they
come, even his own Love.

1. For the higher, or upper streams, and these are four.

1. Election. 2. Justification. 3. Sanctification. 4. Glorification.

And all these arise from the great Abyss, and Sea of his mercy toward his
Church.

His heart is taken with us; and therefore

1. He chose us, Deuteronomy. 7.7, 8. The Lord loved you not, nor chose you, because
ye were more in number than any people: but because the Lord loved you. So God
did not set his heart on us, because we were better than others; for there are
others in the World who might have been made more lovely.

His heart is taken with us; therefore

Operamur ex Justificatione, non in Justificationem.
2. He justifies us. We could do nothing to strike off any former score: for
all we did, set us further in debt: it was but an adding of sin to sin, guilt
to guilt: the sin of our righteousness, to the sin of our unrighteousness,
Covering a blot with a blot; as Isa. 30.1.

No, it did arise from this. His heart was taken with us, therefore did he
justify us, Tit. 3.7. We are justified freely by his Grace. The like, Romans
3.24. Romans 4.5. All which show, that into this, all the expressions of his love
are resolved.

His heart is taken with us; therefore

3. He did sanctify us. Our holiness is not wrought out of our own
Principles; spun out of own bowels; compast by our own strength and industry:
but freely imparted and given of God.

As our Righteousness is freely imputed: so our Holiness is freely imparted.

That thou art not a killing Cain, a self murdering Saul, a despairing Judas, a
profane Esau, a drunken Baltazar, a filthy Sodomite, it arises from this,
mere Mercy.

But that God has not only restrained thee; but renewed thee; not only chained
up thy spirit, but changed thy spirit: This is Free-Mercy. And so the Scripture
tells us, 1. Pet. 1.3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who of his abundant Mercy has begotten us again. -- Not only Mercy, but
abundance of Mercy. So James 1.18. Of his own free will begot he us. And that
in John 1.13. We were born again, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
nor of the will of man: But of God.

Not of blood] Nor great men, nor good men can do it. Regeneration comes not by
Generation.

Nor of the will of the flesh] Our will is but a fleshly will, and cannot beget
a spiritual nature.

Nor of the will of man] It is not all the endeavors of holy men, who labor
to do us good, can do it.

But the Will of God] It is a mercy we give least concurrence to, of all
other. When we have Grace, then we are helpers for the growth, and increase
of Grace: but who shall give Grace?

When the Candle is lighted, it will burn; but none but God can light up the
Candle.

In after Sanctification we concur: There is no concurrence in Regeneration.

This is the freest Mercy of all other. When God has wrought Grace, there is
some engagement for God to go on: but there is nothing to move him to bestow
Grace. Here is the ground: His heart is taken; therefore he sanctifies us.

His heart is taken with us; therefore

4. He glorifies us. As our Justification, so our Sanctification, and
Glorification arise from the same ground: His heart is taken with us.

The Papists indeed would have us to merit Heaven. And the Council of Trent
denounce a curse upon those, who say, Quid sunt omnia opera ad tantam gloriam!
Bern. Si homo mill annis serviet.
A Justified person cannot merit Heaven. But alas! What are all our deserts to
this Glory! If a man should serve God, and suffer a thousand years, what were
this to merit eternity in Glory?

No, here is the ground of all. His heart is taken with us, and therefore he
glorifies us. And so the Scripture speaks plain, Ephesians. 2.5. By Grace ye are
saved. And lest he should never make it firm enough, he adds, in the 8, and
9. verses, By Grace ye are saved -- not of works.

So that you see into what to resolve the higher streams of his Love: his
choosing us, his justifying, his sanctifying, and his glorifying us. His heart
is taken with us -- therefore he chose us; therefore he justifies us, etc.

2. As you may see into what to resolve all the higher: So the lower streams of
his love to his Church. All into this. His heart is taken with his Church.

His heart is taken with us; therefore he does protect us.

His heart is taken with us; therefore he will preserve us.

His heart is taken with us; therefore he will support us.

His heart is taken with us; therefore he will deliver us.

All the good we have in Hand, and all the good we have in Hope: All the
Mercies bestowed, and all those which God is bestowing on us: Look upon all as
a continued thread spun out of the bowels of Free Grace, and Mercy.

God has done great things for us; and from this they have arisen: His Heart
is taken with us, his Love toward us, Jer. 31.3, 4. I loved thee with an
everlasting love; -- therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee.

Alas! If God had looked upon us, and taken either ground or motive from any
thing in us, to do this for us, we should never have enjoyed it.

1. There was no ground, no foundation of desert in us. (We abhor the
thoughts of it) for God to raise such a fabric of mercy upon, as he has done.

If any thing in his Church were the foundation of the structure of mercy,
which we expect God to raise, we might look for a mean building. Such weak
foundations must have as weak a structure. A building must be proportionable
to the foundation. But seeing Gods own heart is the foundation; his own mercy
and good will toward us, which is so strong, so firm, so full a foundation:
Hence it is, that we may expect a structure of mercy suitable to the
foundation.

And, as this is the foundation of all those great and stupendous things,
which God has done for us: So it is a ground for us to expect, that God will
yet do greater things for us, than ever he has done.

Indeed, when we look upon our selves, we are at an end in our thoughts, and
think God is at an end in his Mercy: but when we look up toward God, and see
there the ground of what we have, this keeps up our hearts from sinking, and
causes us to look upon all we have, as an earnest of more.

Men that are at the top of an high place, if they look downwards, their eyes
dazzle, and their heads grow dizzy: but if they look up toward Heaven, they
recover themselves again. God has raised us up to some height of mercy; and if
we look downwards, if we look upon our selves, we are driven past the utmost
of our thoughts: but let us look up to Heaven, whence this mercy we have, has
its spring and foundation, and we shall quickly recover.

Though there be nothing in us; yet there is something in God; and that which
is in God is the ground of this mercy; and therefore will he go on in the
ways of his own mercy.

I have often thought within my self; how far God at this time has out-gone
his people in Mercy.

He has not only out-gone the deservings of his People, but out-gone the
desires of his people, the prayers of his People. And consulting below, I am
ready to think God is at an end of his Mercy.

But, when I recover my self, and look upon the ground of Gods doing good to
his Church and People: Not to be any goodness in the Church: but merely his
own goodness: This does revive me again; put heart into me that God will yet
do greater things for his Church, than yet he has done.

As I said before; when God does execute Judgments upon his Church, he adds
Judgment to Judgment: so much more, when he comes in a way of Mercy to his
Church, he adds Mercy to Mercy.

God is oftentimes weary in going on in a way of Judgment, because the
exercise of his Judgments are drawn out by us, our sins. He is said not to
afflict willingly: and his Judgments he calls his strange work. It is not so
natural to God, and therefore he is quickly weary of it.

But God is never weary of the exercise of his Mercy; and therefore he goes
on to add Mercy to Mercy. We say, the Be gives Honey naturally; the sting
only, when she is forced to it: So God, it is natural to him to show Mercy,
but he is provoked to exercise Judgment.

Hence he is called the Father of Mercies, begets Mercy. Mercy is the Issue of
God, most natural to God; and being so, hence Mercy pleases him. Actions of
Nature are Actions of Delight. God is never so well pleased with any carriage
toward his Church, as those which are in the ways of mercy.

Nay, if he do afflict his Church, it is to show Mercy. Mercy is the end of
all his dealings toward his Church; and therefore Mercy being so natural, so
pleasing; and that the Mercy of God is the ground of his expressions of love to
us, as it is: though our sins may draw out the expressions of his Justice; yet
his Mercy does arise from himself: Hence we may have a ground to expect yet
greater things than ever.

6. Consectary.
If the heart of Christ be so much taken with his Church. Then see with what
confidence we may pray for the good of the Church of Christ. Christ's heart is
taken with it.

A man may pray for himself, and doubt of hearing, because he is not able to
make out his particular interest in Gods Love. But if a man pray for the good
of the Church, he is sure to have hearing, because the heart of Christ is
taken with it.

Let us then make use of all our interest and acquaintance in Heaven, in the
behalf of the Church at this time.

1. It is a thing, which God commands. 2. A thing, which God expects. 3. A
thing, which God rewards. 4. A thing, which God threatens the neglect of.
Much might be said to move you. Your good, and your evil lies in the
Churches. As Jeremy used this as an argument, why, to pray for the civil estate
of Babylon; because in the peace thereof they should have peace: if theirs in
Babylons, how much more ours in Sions?

7. Consectary.
If the heart of Christ be so much taken with his Church, Then what will
become of those, who are enemies to his Church and People!

Is the heart of Christ so much taken with his Church and People. Then woe be
to them that offend his Church. If you touch them, you touch the apple of his
eye.

Gods People are dear to God. They are his Spouse, his Children, his Members,
purchased with the price of his blood; his inheritance, his Portion, all his
commings-in. Those he dyed for, shed his blood for, one drop whereof is worth
a thousand Worlds. And therefore those whom he was content to shed his blood
for, certainly he does more esteem than all the World besides.

We say, whiles the Iron is in its own nature, you may handle it, and meddle
with it; but if once the nature of fire be added unto it, if you touch it, it
will burn you: So whiles the Children of God, are but the Children of men, you
may deal with them as with other men; but if once the nature of God be stamped
on them, the Image of Christ be drawn upon them, it will be dangerous for you
to meddle with them, least fire break out of their mouth to devour you.

We read, Zach. 12.3. God said, he would make his Church a burdensome stone,
etc.

St. Jerome on that place says, it was a Metaphor taken from the custom of the
Jews, who to try their strength, had at the gates of the City great stones; if
they could lift them, well and good; but if not, they crushed themselves with
them: So God will make his Church a burdensome stone. Whoever lifts at it,
shall crush himself; whoever seeks to hurt it, shall ruin himself. You see it
in Pharaoh, Haman, Achitophel, Julian.

Haman lifted so long at this stone, that it fell on him at last, and crushed
him.

Pharaoh followed the Children of Israel so long, that he could not return at
last, but was overwhelmed in the Waters.

Julian attempted it so long, till at last himself was overthrown.

He that shoots in a Piece overcharged, strikes down himself, not that which
he aimed at. He who intends evil against the Church, shoots in a Piece
overcharged, and is sure to be struck down with his own recoil.

We see it in our days. They who have dug pits for us, have fallen into
them themselves. They who laid snares for us, in them is their own foot taken.
They have but made Rods for their own backs; paved a way to their own
destruction; dug graves to bury themselves, in seeking our ruin.

The Scepter of Christ has been too strong for the Principality of Satan, he
has a Rod of Iron; a Scepter of Power, Eris sub pedibus.
an arm of strength, to crush in pieces all his enemies. And therefore as
Pilates wife said of Christ; Have nothing to do with that just man: So I to
thee, see thou a godly man? beware of having any thing to do with him, by way
of offense. For their Angels always behold the face of their heavenly Father.

8. Consectary.
If the heart of Christ be so much taken with his Church, Then see here the
Ground of Acceptance of the services of his people.

God being taken with the Persons, is taken with the performances of his
People. He had respect to Abel, and then to his Offering. Christ, his heart
was taken with the person, and then with his performance.

Hence Christ says to his Church, Cant. 2.14. Let me see thy Countenance, let
me hear thy voice: for thy Countenance is comely, and thy voice is sweet.

Indeed, if Acceptance should arise from the worthiness of our duties, we
should never look to be accepted. There is so much sin in our services, so
much evil in our good, so much coldness in our best heats, so much formality in
our chiefest power, so much deadness in our best life, so much of the World, so
much of our earth in our employments for Heaven. And if Acceptance should
arise from any worth in them, we should be sure to miss of it: But arising
from his good will and Mercy to us, his heart being first taken with us, is
taken with our performances. Hence the Assurance of Acceptance.

Nay, and not only of our purest and perfectest services; but even of our poor
and imperfect duties, such as we throw away for dead, and cast prayers, Cant.
5.1. He drinks the Milk as well as the Wine.

We look upon a prayer accompanied with deadness, distraction, as a cast
prayer. Oh! say we, how can God accept of such impure, imperfect services!

But hence it arises not from the excellency of your prayers, but from the
indulgency of his Grace. It is the voice of his Spouse, though never so weak.
It is the cry of a Member of his, though never so faint. And he can put his
odours, his incense to them, though never so impure, and make them acceptable,
Rev. 8.4.

Use of Examination.
But now, my Brethren, it will be a great matter of inquiry, whether we have
an interest in this love.

As one said when he looked upon the Rainbow, and in that read Gods Covenant,
never to drown the world again. Ah! but says he, what is this to me, If I
be drowned, I may be drowned, though the World be not drowned.

So may you say, You tell us of the exceeding love of Christ to his Church. But
what if I be not of his Church? what if I have no interest in his Love? what is
all this to me?

But then I suppose you are desirous to know whether you have an interest in
this love. It concerns your everlasting good to have an interest, and your
present comfort to know you have an interest.

Now in this inquiry I would have you

1. To examine your hearts thoroughly. Deceits lie low. A false evidence is the
fruit of a slight and superficial search.

2. In your inquiry let not any thing which is compatible with any, who have no
interest in this love, be a bottom, on which your soul rests.

I have told you sometimes, and tell you again. Whatever another man may have
and do, and yet have no interest in this love of Christ, cannot be a
sufficient evidence for thee, that thou having or doing that, have an interest.
-- Acquaint thy self with the most clearing and proving evidences.

3. Take thy evidences from the carriage of the Spirit: neither at the best,
nor at the worst, but the middle way, which is most thy self.

If thou look upon thy self at the worst, thou may be discouraged. If at
the best, thou may be deceived. Many have had such affections in an Heat,
which in cold blood have nothing of them.

4. Judge not of thy self by particular actions and carriages: but look upon
the universal frame and bent of thy spirit. No certain rule is to be
established upon a particular instance, whether good or bad.

I might lay down other rules to observe in your inquiry. But we will come to
the inquiry it self.

Would thou know whether thou art one with whom Christ's heart is taken? See
whether thou art of his Church. Art thou one, who art taken out of the World?
Art thou one, whom God has called? one whom he has justified? one whom he
has regenerated? sanctified? Art thou one, who art washed, purged, renewed?

These might be in the general; but are too obscure. But I will name you but
one, and it is a plain one, and none more demonstrative.

Would thou know whether the heart of Christ be taken with thee? why then
see,

Art thou one, whose heart is taken with Christ? If Christ be taken with thee,
thou art taken with Christ. It is a mutual, a reciprocal taking. Whatever God
does to the soul, it makes an impression in the soul of the like to God. God
delights in us; and thereupon we come to delight in him. God knows us, and
thereupon we know him, Joh. 10.14. God apprehends us, and thereupon we
apprehend him. He chooses us, and thereupon we choose him. He loves us, and
thereupon we love him, 1 John 4.19. His heart is taken with us, and thereupon
our hearts come to be taken with him. Our love to him is nothing else but
radius amoris Dei erga nos in Deum reflexus: a beam of Gods love reflected back
upon God. So that this now is a true character of Christ's heart being taken
with thee, if thy heart be taken with Christ.

Quest. But you will say, How shall I know whether my heart be taken with
Christ?

Ans. For the answer of this, because upon this foundation I will lay the whole
weight of this discourse, in this Use,

1. A heart taken with Christ, is a heart which knows Christ, and has tasted
of Christ. Are you such as know Christ? Invisa possumus amare; incognita
nequaquam.
For knowledge of Christ precedes the love of Christ. He who does not know,
cannot love. Things unseen may, but things unknown cannot be loved, 1 Pet.
1.8. Whom having not seen ye love, but never not known.

All love to Christ does arise from discoveries and manifestations of Christ to
the soul. Either from the discoveries of those beauties, those attractive
excellencies that are in him, or with that, from the discovery of his heart and
good will toward us.

Now blind men cannot discern of beauties; nor ignorant men of the beauties of
Christ. Christ is to them as a Mine of Gold covered over with earth and
rubbish: as a Bed of Pearl and Diamonds hid with an heap of sand: as a glorious
Messiah under a contemptible outside. And wanting eyes to see through the Veil
of his Flesh. through the bark and outside of his Humanity, they can behold no
beauty in him. As Isaiah speaks of carnal men, Isa. 53.2. When you behold him,
you see no beauty in him, that shall make him desired.

Now then, art thou one who knows Christ? did ever God reveal him to thee in a
promise? what apparitions has Christ made to thy soul? what manifestations?
what discoveries that may evidence to thee, that thou know him?

There are four manifestations, or discoveries of Christ to the soul, which do
exceedingly take the soul. Indeed every apparition of Christ does take the
heart: but at these times the heart is not only wooed and won, but overcome
with his sweetness and glory.

1. After the soul has long lain bedrid in sorrow, been overwhelmed in the
deeps of Legal Humiliation, and have been broken and shattered in pieces with
consternation, and apprehensions of sin, and Gods wrath for it. Then a
discovery of Christ, and apparition of Christ to the soul, is a resurrection
from the dead.

When Christ comes by a promise into the soul, and displaies his glory, the
Riches, and Greatness, and Freeness of his Grace, as to Moses; The Lord God,
gracious and merciful, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression and sin,
Exodus 34.6. I, I am he who forgiveth thy iniquities, etc. Isa. 43.25. Then is
the soul beyond expression, inamoured with him; now it is overcome with his
beauties and excellencies, and even ravished with his love. And this is the
first eminent taking of the heart with Christ.

2. When the soul has been upon the stormy Sea of temptations and desertions;
has long labored under the sense of Gods withdrawings and absence from the
soul. And Christ returns again, breaking the dark and thick cloud, and shining
into the soul. Who can then express the warmth, the comfort, the revivings,
the holy heats and flames of love and affection to Christ.

You see how it was with Job. I have heard of thee with the hearing of the ear:
But now mine eyes see thee. And certainly the sight of his beauties did take
him: those eyes which saw him were like a burning-glasse to the heart, to
kindle the flames and fervors of holy affections toward him again.

You see how it was with the Church, Cant. 3.4. Christ had withdrawn himself:
She makes inquiry after him, but could not hear of him. At last after all her
trouble, Christ appears to her soul. And you may read there, how exceedingly
her heart was taken with his return. I found him whom my soul loves; I held
him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my Mothers house,
Cant. 3.4.

3. When the soul does sit down to contemplate, and read over the beauties and
loves of Christ: when it is in the contemplations of those surpassing
excellencies, and admired sweetness which is in Christ. And Christ (whiles the
soul is busy in feeding on these thoughts) does make a discovery of himself to
the soul: makes the soul to see a vision of his glory: Oh! how is the heart
taken with him! it is even drowned and sunk in a Sea of glory. Ah! what
clasping, what embraces! what loves are there then betwixt Christ and the soul!
It is impossible for me to express: or for me, or you to conceive. It is a
vision of glory, the porch of Heaven.

4. When the soul is under outward pressures, afflictions, prison, sickness,
upon deathbed. Then a visit of Christ, a discovery of himself does exceedingly
ravish and take the heart. Here is kindness indeed, riches for the poor,
liberty for a prisoner, a cordial for the sick; Here is all in Christ's
manifestation.

Well then, would thou know whether thy heart be taken with Christ? do
thou know Christ? did thou ever see the face of Christ in a promise? what
apparitions has Christ made to thee? what manifestations within thee, in the
work of Grace? what manifestations to thee, in the beginning of glory? You who
know not Christ, cannot love Christ.

2. Sign. An heart taken with Christ, is not excessively taken with any thing
else.
The sweetness of Christ does overcome all the sweetness in other things, in
the Creatures. Vincit dulcedo dulcedinem.


As it is nothing but ignorance which makes men admire any thing here on earth:
if men knew the excellency of other things, they could not admire such trifles
as they do.

So here, it is nothing but ignorance of better things which makes us dote upon
things here below. Did we see his beauties, all the World would be blackness.
Did we see his fullness, all the World were but emptiness.

I say; did we but know the excellencies and beauties of Christ, and the
satisfying-sweetness of his love; Nothing should have a room in our hearts,
save he only. The higher we ascend toward Heaven, the lesser will the things
on earth appear.

If you go to the top of the Mountains, men would appear but small: but if it
were possible to go up to the Sun, the Mountains would appear nothing.

The love of Christ has a raising-power, working our hearts as high as Heaven,
and being there, all things here below are of no account and esteem to the
soul. So says Paul, a man on fire with the love of Christ. Yea doubtless I
count all but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ -- And do
count them but dung, that I may win Christ, Phil 3.8.

Well then; they whose hearts are taken with the Creature, taken with the
World, taken with sin and vanity: These are too gross to be taken with
spiritual loves.

3. Sign.
What the heart is taken withal, the soul seems to live more in it, than in it
self. Do but examine it in any thing the heart is taken withal; whether your
comforts, your delights, your happiness lies not in them. The Worldling he
lives in his possessions. The Voluptuous man in his pleasures. And can no more
live out of them, than the Fish out of the water, the Salamander out of fire.
So here. If thy heart be taken with Christ, then thou live more in Christ,
than thou do in thy self. I live, yet not I, but Christ, says the Apostle,
Gal. 2.20. Thou can no more subsist without him, than the Beam without the
Sun: than the spark without the fire. Nay, no more live without him, than the
body without meat, nay, the body without the soul. Christ is to the soul, as
the soul is to the body. Now as the body cannot live without the soul: So the
soul cannot live but in Christ, who is Anima Animae, the Soul of the Soul, for
me to live is Christ.

I say, if thy heart be taken with Christ, thou live in Christ more than in
thy self. Thy life, thy comforts, thy happiness, they are all folded up in him.

As Judah said of Benjamin. Jacobs life was bound up in the Lads life, Genesis
44.30. So the Soul of Christ; my life, my joys, my comforts, they are all
bound up in thee. All my fresh springs are in thee; says God of his Church,
Psalm. 87.7. And, whom have I in Heaven but thee! and in earth in comparison of
thee! Psalm. 73.25. says the inamoured soul of God, his heart was taken with
God, and he lived in God more than in himself.

It was the speech of Luther, who (being in a great distress and spiritual
trouble) had writ about the walls and table in his study, in great letters,
Vivit. A friend comes to him, and demands the reason. He replies, Vivit
Christus; and si non, non optarem unam horam vivere. -- His life was in Christ.
He lived more in Christ than in himself.

Which makes the life of a Christian so safe, none can hurt him, and so sweet
too, being a life in Christ out of himself. The best of others lies in
themselves: but the best of a Christian, those precious things in him, lies out
of himself, and lies in Christ.

4. Sign.
What the heart is taken withal, that the comforts of the life are upheld by
from day to day. We have many a weary step to go, and can no more go without
comfort, than Elijah without food. Comfort is to the soul, as the soul is to
the body. As the body without the soul is dead, so is the soul of men without
comfort.

Now would you know what your heart is taken withal: see what the comfort of
your life is upheld by from day to day.

Is Jesus Christ the comfort of your life? is he the joy of your hearts?

Ex quovis font.
Wicked men have varity of springs. If one be dry, they go to another.

But the Saints have but one: Christ. And if he be gone, all is gone.

5. Sign.
An heart taken with Christ has high appretiations and valuations of Christ.
It values and esteems him above all the comforts and contentments in Heaven and
Earth, Psalm. 73, 25. Whom have I in Heaven, but thee! and in the Earth, in
comparison of thee! Here is the breathing of a soul taken with Christ. He
prizeth Christ above all the comforts and contents in the World.

For the better unfolding of this sign, there is 1. Something considerable in
the Act. 2. Something in the Object -- Christ prized. 3. Something in the
Measure -- above all the comforts, contents, etc.


1. In the Act of prizing Christ, that we do not mean a bare and naked
Estimate of Christ, in the Understanding: but such an one as prevails with the
soul, and commands the spirit of a man to do actions consonant and agreeable to
that rate the Judgment set on Christ. I say, by prizing of Christ, we do not
mean a bare acts of Dijudication, what a man in his Judgment may conclude
Christ to be worth. Many be, that will tell you, they conclude Christ to be
worth a World: who yet will not part with any thing for Christ.

But I mean such an act of the understanding, as brings up the Heart, and the
affections to close with Christ in that height which the Understanding rates
him at.

I say, such an Act of Appretiation as prevails with a man to do actions
consonant and agreeable to the rate it pretends to set on Christ. As you see
the wise Merchant. He did not barely judge that the Pearl was worth all he
had: but he did Actions consonant and agreeable to it. Seeing he could not
enjoy the Pearl without parting withal he had to compass it, he sells all to
compass the Pearl.

That is the first. A soul taken with Christ does not only barely judge and
esteem Christ worth all; but will part with all for the compassing of Christ.

2. Here is something considerable in the Object. Christ prized.

1. We do not restrain and limit this only to the Person of Christ. There is
something in the Person of Christ, which may prevail with an Unbeleever, to
esteem of him. The dignity of his Person being God-Man, having all beauties and
excellencies in him. This may raise up a kind of esteem of Christ in the
hearts of unbeleevers.

2. Neither do we limit it only to the Benefits of Christ, and the great
things which he has done for man in general, in his humiliation, death,
passion, etc.

But we are to take Christ in the extent of Christ: Christ in his whole
Latitude: Christ in his Holiness, Christ in his Laws, Christ in his Government,
Christ in his Truth, Totum Christi, the whole of Christ. He that prizeth not
Christ in his whole latitude, and extent, does not prize Christ at all as he
ought to do.

As we say of Faith; it does not eligere Objectum, it does not choose its
Object, single out what it will esteem, and what not: but prizeth of Christ
fully in the latitude and extent of Christ, of Christ in his Person, Christ in
his Beauties, Christ in his Laws, in his Holiness, Truth, Government: And so
highly, that they sold themselves to gain a Truth; lost themselves to save a
Truth: They have made this brave adventure, thrown away themselves, that they
might keep up a Truth; as you see it in Queen Mary's days, in point of
Transubstantiation. So that is the second. The soul taken with Christ is taken
with All-Christ. As all in him is lovely: so the soul loves all; and prizes and
esteems of all of Christ.

3. That which is considerable in the Measure is, That a soul taken with
Christ, does prize Christ above all comforts and contents in Heaven and Earth.

This Christ commands, Mat. 16.24. If any man will come after me, let him deny
himself. If any] It is set down indefinitly. Not only you, who are poor, and
have little to lose, and deny your selves in: but they, who have most. You that
are rich, you that have lands, possessions, have Crowns and Scepters. If any
poor, any rich, any beggar, any Prince, etc.

He must deny himself] Not only in things unlawful, but lawful. He must
yield up his sins as a snare; his comforts, estate, and all as a Sacrifice for
Christ, if he call for them, Mat. 10.37. He that loves Father or Mother more
than me, is not worthy of me. These relations are expressed: but under these
are comprised all the comforts and contents on earth.

And this was not only commanded, but it is practiced by those, whose hearts
are taken with Christ. You see in Abraham, who left all; in Moses, who prized
more of the reproach of Christ, than all the treasures in Egypt; in David,
Psalm. 73.25. Whom have I in Heaven but thee! or in Earth, in comparison of thee!

As the World would be nothing else but Angiae stabulum; a noisome sink, a
prison to a godly man, were it not that he injoys something of Christ here: So
Heaven it self were but a gaudy Pageant, Vanity, if God and Christ were not
there.

The Heaven, which carnal men do fansy is a Turkish-Heaven, an heaven of
pleasures, delights, comforts, but fleshly, outward. They conceive of it,
according to their Principle.

But the Heaven of a godly man, it lies in God, it lies in Christ. Indeed

That is not Heaven, which is by God; but that is Heaven, which lies in God, to
a godly man.

It was the meditation of one: Not Heaven, O Lord; but God, Non coelum Domine,
sed Deus and Christus.
and Christ. Rather ten thousand times Christ without Heaven, than Heaven
without Christ.

Thus does the soul, that is taken with Christ, prize Christ above all the
comforts, contentments of Heaven and Earth.

6. Sign.
An heart taken with Christ, the thoughts are taken up with Christ.

Such a man he thinks Christ, and he speaks Christ, he lives Christ.

You know whatever a man's heart is taken with, it is never off his thoughts,
never off his heart, he is never well but thinking and speaking of that he
loves. The thoughts are the character of what the heart is taken withal. If
thy heart be taken with Christ, thy thoughts are taken up with him. Christ is
always upon thy thoughts; he lies next to thy heart; when thou go to bed
he is with thee, Cant. 1.13. and when thou awakest he is with thee; as David
says, Psalm. 139.18.

Indeed Gods people may have swarms of other thoughts; but they are not
entertained, they are not welcome to them; they are their burden, and trouble.
They come in as Intruders, and are not entertained as Guests. A wicked man
entertains them as Guests, as friends; but they come into a godly man, as
intruders, never invited, nor find they welcome. This is that Jeremiah speaks.
Jer. 4.14.
How long shall vain thoughts lodge within thee? in a wicked man's heart they
are Lodgers, and entertained as Guests; he keeps doors open, spreads a Table
for them, makes them a bed, bids them welcome: But in a godly man they crowd
in, and find no entertainment.

And as the Thoughts are taken up with Christ, so the Tongue. He thinks, and
he speaks Christ. When Christ is in the heart, the tongue will discourse and
speak of him. Whatever is in the heart, and the heart is taken withal, that a
man's discourse is most taken up withal. As Psalm. 37.30. The mouth of the
Righteous speaks wisdom, and his Tongue talks of Judgment. And why?
because the Law of his God is in his heart, verse. 31. So here on the same
ground. Thy talk shall be of Christ, of his beauties, his love, etc. because
Christ is in thy heart. What the heart is taken withal, the Tongue will
discourse on.

1. And indeed we cannot have a fuller Subject to discourse on. Other Subjects
they are empty subjects, quickly barren. Talk of what you will, you will be
quickly at an end. The bottom of other things are quickly sounded. But Christ
is a full Subject. (Whatever you fall upon, is fullness in Christ.) An
everlasting spring, which affords fresh supplies of matter. New and
unconceiveable discoveries do arise afresh to be matter of supply to all
eternity.

2. You cannot have a sweeter subject. Christ is All-sweet: A Rose without
prickles. A Rose, for sweetness: without prickles, for content. And nothing is
so but Christ. All the things of the world since the fall, have been Roses
beset with thorns. Though there be many sweets in the World; yet they are not
all-sweet; they are beset with thorns: crosses with comforts, and afflictions
with affections. Christ is All-sweet, and nothing but sweet. Tota pulchra, as
he said of his Spouse. Thou art all-fair. Beauty without spot. Sweet without
prickles. He is a Garden full of flowers, full of sweets. You can light of
none but you may lade your thighs, and go home satisfied.

3. You cannot have a more delightful subject. Christ is the delight of all
both in Heaven and Earth. He is Gods delight; his heart is taken with him; he
lies in his bosom. And his Son, in whom he is well pleased, he is the delight
of the Angels, whose delight it is to study Christ, and desire to learn and
hear further discoveries of Christ by his Church, as Peter has it, 1 Pet. 1.12.

4. You cannot have a more profitable subject. A subject which in conversing
upon, we are transformed into his Glory, 2 Cor. 3.18. into the glory of him,
who is the subject of the discourse. Have you not been kindled with heavenly
fire? have not your hearts burned in the converses of him, as well as in the
converses with him? Indeed we cannot converse of him aright, but in some
measure we converse with him.

Does it not sometimes fetch up your souls to glory, and leave you in Heaven?

Do you not find it profitable to quicken you? to raise you? to comfort you?
to inflame you? to humble you? to melt you? to transform you?

Does not a discourse of his love quicken you, when you are dead? comfort you,
when you are dejected? raise you, when fallen? humble you, when proud? inflame
you, when cold? Enlarge you, when straightened, and pent within your selves?

Oh! That such worthless subjects should so often take up our Tongues and
Thoughts! And Christ, so full, so sweet, so delightful, so profitable a
subject, which shall be matter for our souls discourse to all Eternity, shall
be thrown aside, as if not worth taking up!

You, whose hearts are taken with Christ, declare it to your own comfort, and
the good of others. In this let your thoughts be taken up with him, let your
discourses be more of him, show your selves to love him, by thinking Christ,
speaking Christ, living Christ more.

6. Sign.
An heart taken with Christ, thirsts after communion with, and nearer
conjunction to Christ. You know whatever your hearts are taken withal, you
desire, and thirst after communion, and converses withal. So it is here
betwixt Christ and the soul. The soul taken with Christ longs to be with him,
and thirsts after communion with him.

1. In Grace here. 2. In Glory hereafter.
1. In Grace here. Oh! How the soul once taken with Christ desires converses
with him, in prayer, in hearing, in meditation, Isa. 26.8, 9. The desire of our
soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee. With my soul have I
desired thee in the night; yea with my spirit within me will I seek thee
early. And this is the Genius of a soul taken with Christ: that duty does not
content him, if he find not Christ in duty. If the end of a duty have left
him on this side Christ, it has left him so far short of comfort.

Others indeed, though they do a duty, yet as their hearts seek not Christ in
the duty, so their souls can rest content without him, when the duty is done:
but it is otherwise with a right-born-soul.

'Twas the speech of Bradford, that he could never leave a duty, till he had
found communion with Christ in the duty: till he had brought his heart into a
duty-frame. He could not leave confession, till he had found his heart
touched, broken, and humbled for sin; nor Petition, till he had found his
heart taken with the beauties of the things desired, and carried out after
them: nor could he leave thanksgiving, till he had found his spirit enlarged,
and his soul quickened in the return of praises.

And it was the happiness of Bernard, a Heaven upon Earth, that he says of
himself, I never went from thee, without thee. Nunquam abs te, absque te
recedo. Coelum extra Coelum.
He found God in every duty: he had communion with God in every prayer; which
indeed is Heaven on this side Heaven.

Thus he, whose heart is taken with Christ, thirsts after communion with him,
and no duty contents him, wherein he has not found either his quickening, or
his comforting-presence: either communion with his Grace, or communion with his
comfort.

2. As he thirsts after communion with him here in Grace: so does he desire
communion with him in Glory, To be with the Lord, as the Apostle.

Whiles the soul is here, it sees the distance too great betwixt Christ and it,
that she cannot enjoy that sweet communion with him. As the Apostle says.
Whiles we are present in the flesh, we are absent from the Lord. And
therefore the soul breaths after him, desires to be with him. Cupio dissolvi,
says the Apostle, I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ.

The like of David, Psalm. 42.1, 2. As the Heart pants after the waterbrooks;
so pants my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living
God. When shall I come and appear before God! He had tasted the sweetness of
Christ, and did not fear the bitterness of death.

Vitam in Patientia; mortem in Desiderio.
He had Life in Patience; Death in Desire; because by death he should be
carried to more sweet and intimate conjunction with Christ.

It was the speech of Augustine, Lord, I will dye, that I may enjoy thee. Eja
Domine, mortar ut te videam, nolo vivere, Volo mori.
I will not live, but I will dye. I desire to dye, that I may see Christ; and
refuse to live, that I may live with Christ.

And this disposition you see in the Spouse here. Her heart being taken with
Christ, she could not brook the distance betwixt Christ and her; and therefore
cries out, Cant. 8.1. Make haste, make haste my beloved.

Though in one sense it is true; he that believes makes not haste; yet here
he that believes most, and loves most, makes most haste.

The more the soul believes, and the more the heart is taken with Christ, the
greater are the desires to be with him.

Till Simeon had gotten Christ into his arms, he was unwilling to dye: but
after he had Christ in his arms; Lord, now let thou thy servant depart in
peace; for my eyes have seen thy salvation.

Indeed here are but the Espousals between Christ and the soul. Some
Broken-Rings, Contracts, Espousals, betwixt Christ and us. But then is the
great Marriage-day, the Solemnization of our Nuptials, to all eternity.

Here we do see him but dimly and darkly, at the best, and there are
oftentimes clouds come in, and interpose themselves, between Christ and us: but
then we shall see him face to face, and never shall there cloud come between
Christ and us to all eternity. There we shall see him in his Glory, his full
discoveries.

Here we enjoy him but in part. The distance is great betwixt him and us. All
which distance does arise from that within us. Were it not for sin we might
be in Glory, even in Grace. But then we shall enjoy him in fullness.

Heaven is the place, which God has intended to set forth himself to his
People in his Glory, to all eternity. Where there shall be no fears, no sin,
never smoke of distrustful thoughts shall arise more. Where there shall be no
sorrow, no tears. All sighing and sobbing shall pass away, and nothing but joy
shall keep the house.

We are now the Sons of God. But it does not yet appear what we shall be;
for we shall see him as he is.

7. Sign.
A heart taken with Christ thinks nothing too much to do, nothing ^^o much to
suffer for Christ.

You know Love cannot be posed. We say, there is no difficulty in Love.
Things impossible to others, are easy to them who love. And things burdensome
to others, delightful to them who love. If once thy heart be taken with
Christ, thou will think nothing too much to do, nothing too much to suffer for
him.

As Christ thought nothing too much for us, because his heart was taken with
us; neither shall we think any thing too much for Christ.

We read how prodigal the Saints have been of their Riches, their Blood, their
Lives for Christ, because they loved him.

1. They have not accounted their estates too dear for him, Heb. 10.34. They
took joyfully the spoiling of their goods.

2. They have not accounted their lives too dear, Rev. 12.11. They loved not
their lives to death for him.

If they must dig in Mines, or be cast to be devoured by Wild-Beasts for
Christ, as it was the usual sentence of Christians, Christiani ad n^ talla ad
Ecstias.
in the primitive times, they were willing to do and suffer it.

See this in the Virgin of whom Basil speaks, who was condemned to death,
because she would not worship Idols.

And the like of old Polycarp and others.

This is certain: A soul taken with Christ knows no difficulty in its love. It
loves him with an unlimited, an uncircumscribed love, which no duty, no
difficulty can pose.

8. Sign. A heart taken with Christ is exceedingly cast down with the
withdrawings and absence of Christ.
The comforts of the soul are laid up in Christ: and when he is gone, all is
gone. Comfort gone, Joy gone, the Heart gone with him.

As Mephibosheth said; Take all, now my Lord is come back: so the soul says,
Take all, take the World, take Riches, take Heaven, and Glory, so far as Heaven
and thou are two things. That my Lord may return with my soul. Datkness is
terrible to the soul, and this is thick darkness, and therefore says with
Absalom, let me see his face, mea non prosunt sine te, nothing besides thee,
can either satisfy or profit me.

9. Sign. A heart taken with Christ is fully content and satisfied with the
enjoyments and possession of Christ.
The possession of the thing beloved does content the soul so far as there is
satisfaction and contentment with it. The reason why we do not meet with full
contentments and satisfactions here in the possession or our loves, is because
they want of fullness.

But now it is not so with Christ. He is able to brim the soul, to satisfy
the spirit to answer all the desires of the heart; and therefore the heart
taken with him, needs must rest satisfied and contented with him.

Such a gulf of desire is in the soul of men, that if God should cast in a
thousand worlds, there would be no contentment, except Christ be cast in. And
Christ is so full contentment, that if God bestow him, they will neither need
nor desire any more.

And thus much shall serve for the use of trial; we will now come to an use of
Exhortation, and conclude this.

Use of Exhortation.
1. To them of his Church. 2. To them who are not of the Church. 1. To them of
his Church.
Is it so that the heart of Christ is so much taken with his Church and People?

1. Direction to them of the Church.
1. Walk suitably to this love. Dignities, and suitable walkings to dignities
must go together.

Now this suitable walking we will express in these five things.

1. Walk cheerfully. 2. Walk thankfully. 3. Walk humbly. 4. Walk watchfully. 5.
Walk obediently.

1. Walk cheerfully. Walk as Heirs of such a Mercy. Here is a truth speaks
comfort, when all the world speaks nothing but terror.

2. Direction to them of the Church.
2. Beware of abusing this love. Precious things are committed to us by a word
of Caution. This is a precious Truth; and therefore let me add to it this
word of Caution. Beware of abusing this Love of Christ.

Christ's Love are his bowels, and he will never endure to have his bowels
injured, his love abused. You know a man will not have his Love injured; the
abuse of his power, of his wisdom, greatness, does not touch a man so nearly,
as the abuse of his Love. This is an injury men cannot endure.

So to speak after the manner of men; Christ can least endure his Love should
be abused. There is no abuse like it. Therefore beware of it.

Now this Love of Christ is injured these ways, and beware

1. When we slight the entreaties, reject the tenders, cast aside the offers
and beseeches of his Love.

When love stoops to you, when the mercy and goodness of Christ does as it
were, come on its knees to you, and entreats you to do this, or not to do that.

And yet you will stop your ears, pull back your shoulder, slight the
entreaties. This is an abuse.

2. When the Love of Christ does slacken our hearts to duty, loosen our
engagements, makes us more remiss to or in service. This is to abuse his Love.

We should reason from Mercy to Duty; and not from Mercy to Liberty. Abundance
of Grace calls in for abundance of Duty.

The Love of Christ should constrain us; as the Apostle, 2 Cor. 5.

This should make us live more humbly, more actively, more studious to please,
more diligent to obey, more careful to serve him.

This should make us live at higher rates for Heaven, more spiritual, more
heavenly minded. It is a Cord let down from Heaven, to fetch our souls up
thither.

And does this cause us to be more remiss, more careless? Does this, which
should quicken, slacken our hand to duty? Oh base ungrateful neglect of Love!

3. when we take heart to sin thereby. Grow more loose, careless. This is an
high abuse of this Love.

Because God is Good, will thou be Evil? because he is Merciful; will thou
be sinful? because he is Gracious, will thou be impious? What fearful abuse
of Love is this! This is to wound Christ in the house of his friends.

To return good for good, is but Humane. To return evil for good, is Wicked. To
return good for evil, is Christian-like. But To return evil for good, and the
greatest evil for the greatest good, Sin for Love; this is devilish.
Were you his enemies, he knew how to deal with you; he could revenge
himself, and the abuses of his love upon you: but you are his friends, and
those bowels which you wrong, are stirred in him, when he goes about to punish
you. Oh Ephraim! How shall I give thee up! how shall I deliver thee, Israel! my
bowels are turned within me. My repentings are kindled together, Hos. 11.8.

The greatness of God prevails with wicked men; that awes them often, that they
dare not sin against him. But the goodness of God; this should prevail with us,
There is mercy with thee; therefore thou art to be feared,

It is set down as the Principle in such, with whom the heart of Christ is
taken, Hos. 3. ult. They shall fear the Lord, and his goodness, in the latter
days.

None but venomous spirits will suck poison from such a sweet, as thence to
draw encouragements to sin, from that which is the great encouragement to
service.

The Love of Christ had so prevailed with Chrysostom, that he used to say,
Ego sic censeo, sic assidue praedicabo.

And Anselme. That if on the one hand he should see sin, and on the other, the
torments of Hell: he had rather choose to fall into Hell, than fall into sin.

4. When we stagger and doubt, give way to misgiving thoughts of Christ's Love,
and unbeleevings of our own hearts: we abuse this Love.

What is it possible that Christ should do or suffer more than he has done
and suffered to persuade your hearts of his Love?

If Christ should ask the question of you, who doubt most of his Love. What
shall I do to answer your scruples: to satisfy your souls for ever, in this,
that I love you? could you rationally desire more than what he has expressed
in his words, and to your heart, and if notwithstanding all be in vain, 1 Samuel
25.21.
may he not justly say as David of Nabal. Surely in vain have I done all this,
when this all comes to nothing.

3. Direction to them of the Church.
3. Be much in the contemplation of this Love of Christ. Dwell upon this. This
Love of Christ will be matter of eternal perusal in Heaven. We shall do
nothing but read over this Love. Oh! let us not be strangers to it now.

View it in the 1. Fullness. 2. Freeness. 3. Bounty. 4. Perpetuity thereof.


1. Measure it in the Fullness of it. It is a Love which reaches to every
necessity.

A love able to make you holy, and able to make you happy. Thou art under guilt
and sin; thou art terrified by the one, and ashamed and confounded because so
loathsomely defiled by the other. Why

It is a pardoning, a purging, a sanctifying Love; it is a Love as large as
himself, though the persons beloved be finite.

2. Read it over in the Freeness of it.

1. It was an undeserved, 2. It was an unsought-for Love.
1. It was an undeserved Love. We may provoke him to anger, but we cannot
tempt him to love. Amat Deus, non aliunde hoc habet.
The former does arise from our sins, the latter from himself.

His choosing, justifying, adopting, saving love, all are free.

2. It was an unsought-for Love. Never a prayer put up for it. I am found of
them that sought me not, Isa. 65.1.

3. Read it over in the Bounty and Expressions of it.

1. What he did. 2. What he suffered. 3. What he has given to his Church.
4. Look upon it, in the Perpetuity, Permanency, and continuance thereof. A Love
which reaches from Eternity to Eternity. From Eternal choosing, to Eternal
glorifying. An unchangeable Love.
Let us then peruse this Love. Read it over in all the Dimensions. Dwell upon
the thoughts of it till your hearts be

Humbled, melted, enabled, in-nobled, winned, quickened, comforted, etc.

The Thoughts of this Love are

1. Soul-humbling Thoughts. Nothing lays the soul lower than Love. The
consideration of this will vile a man to Hell, Ezekiel. 36.25, to 33. where you
may read some expressions of love, how it affects.

These would be

2. Soul-melting Thoughts. They will not only humble, but melt; not only break,
but dissolve the heart. Nothing does melt the soul more than Love.

The Law may break us; but it is as the breaking of a flint; every dust retains
hardness: but it is the Gospel that melts us.

The thoughts of Gods Justice do stone the heart, make it more hard: but the
thoughts of Gods Mercy do melt the heart.

You know you never mourn indeed, till Love, till Mercy do melt you. Every drop
of tears sticks like an hailstone, and congeals in the eyes: but when Love
comes in, then all the springs are opened, and a man is dissolved into waters.

So much apprehensions of this Love of Christ: so much godly sorrow. They are
like the Fountain and the Stream, whereof the one does rise no higher than the
other.

The thoughts of this Love have

3. A Soul-inabling Power. It will not only engage us to service; (as the
Apostle. The Love of Christ constrains me.) But it will enable us to service;
make us pray, and pray with affections, pray with life; make us hear, and hear
with strength. This puts us upon work, and puts life, virtue and vigor into our
actions.

No actions stronger than those that come from Love: Things incredible and
impossible to others, are yet easy to them who love.

See what the Saints have gone through, what they have done, what they have
suffered. Let but the thoughts of this love lie on your spirits a little, and
you will find that Love is strong as death, Cant. 8.6. and will mightily carry
us through that, which otherwise may seem impossible.

They will be

4. Soul-innobling thoughts. They will make you like themselves. Whatever the
soul feeds on, the soul is digested into the nature of it. So here, feed on the
thoughts of this love, and your spirit will be digested into it. Whiles we
behold as in a glass the glory of the Lord; we are changed into the same
Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord, 2 Cor. 3.18.

In nature the meat is digested into the nature of the eater. Here the eater is
turned into the nature of the meat. The contemplation of his Glory makes you
glorious.

They will be

5. Soul-winning Thoughts. Love you know is of an attractive nature. Amor
amoris Magnes.
Nothing wins more than Love. Love is the Loadstone to draw Love again.

As the Sun shining upon a Glass begets a reflection of the beams back again:
so the love of God shed abroad in our hearts, begets a reflection of love back
again toward God. You see Mary. Much was forgiven her; she had tasted of much
love from God; and she returned much love again to him. She loved much.

The Power of God does shake the heart:

The Majesty of God does dread the heart:

The Justice of God does awe the heart:

But it is the Mercy of God, the Love of God, which does persuade, win, and
draw the heart. Nothing wins a man's heart to God but his Love.

The fear of God, dread of God, may bring a man's feet into his ways: but it is
the Love of God, which brings his Heart into his ways.

They are

6. Soul-quickening. 7. Soul-comforting thoughts.

Oh then! that we were but wise to improve this Doctrine, this truth, to the
good of our souls!

I tell thee Christian, if thou would give this truth but scope in thy
heart, it would help thee, and relieve thee of all the burdens under which thou
groanest.

1. Do thou labor under a proud heart? this would humble thee.

2. Do thou labor under a dejected heart? this would raise thee.

3. Under a dark heart? this would comfort, revive thee.

4. Under a dead heart? this would quicken thee, and put the Spirit of Heaven
into thee, whiles thou art on earth.

5. Under an hard heart? this would break thee. Nay this would melt thee,
dissolve thee into waters.

I say, the more thou gets up (with Elijah) into this Chariot of love, the more
would the mantle of sin and corruption depart from thee.

6. Under a worldly heart? This would dead thy heart for ever to the World, and
set thee all on flame with the fire of heavenly affections.

I am confident of it; whatever a Christian desires to enjoy; whatever a
Christian desires to be rid of, if he can but dwell upon this truth, and be
able to manage it: He shall have it more fully, he shall have it more quickly
than any other way.

Would thou be rid of a proud heart? would thou have an humble heart?
would be rid of a dead heart, and desire a quick heart? would be rid
of an hard heart, and have a broken heart? would be rid of an unbeleeving,
of a doubting, of a dejected heart, and would be mighty in Faith, full of
comfort? Why, do but let thy soul be carried captive with this Truth: be but
content this Truth should master thee; be but willing to entertain it, believe
it, embrace it. I am confident on it, all this will be done. I may set down a
probatum est, to it. Oh! That we were wise to manage this Truth!

There are many look upon this but as a pleasant dream, a Chimera, a fiction.

And some believe it; but slightly; there wants depth of earth.

And some there are (poor souls!) to whom the comfort of this truth belongs,
who think this is too good news for them. They think, if they should own it, it
would be but too great a sale for too small a Boat; rather overturn them, than
do them good; rather ruin them, than help them. And therefore they must feed
upon black thoughts, upon Hell, upon justice, upon sin, upon their corruptions.

Ah! Poor souls! Satan deludes you; you take a way to undo your selves. Either
to discourage you, to say there is no hope; or else to break you, that you
shall never be able to do God service.

Look as long as you will into Hell: pry as long as you will into the dark
vaults of your souls: rake as long as you will into the kennel of your hearts.
You shall find nothing in Hell, but Hell, in your hearts but sin; and having
found it, run from him.

That man looks too much on sin, who shuts his eyes from a mutual interview
of love between God and his soul.

And hither you must come at last. Free Grace must be owned; Free-Mercy must
be acknowledged, and advanced by you; if ever you would be saved; if ever you
would be comforted.

You may think what you will; but sure I am, 1. There are no Christians more
cheerful. 2. None are more thankful. 3. None are more humble. 4. None are
more believing. 5. None are more active. 6. None are more courageous. 7. None
more serviceable and useful toward God and men, than they, who lie continually
at the breast of the promise; than they, who set up Gods Free Grace; and own
that good which God makes out to them.


Thou may be a Christian; but thou will be a sad Christian, an
uncomfortable Christian, a dark Christian, a deserted Christian, a dead
Christian, an unserviceable Christian: if thou do go on to feed upon black
thoughts; and wilt not own that comfort which Christ tenders; embrace that good
which Christ speaks, and believe the Riches of his Grace and Mercy to poor
sinners.

Do but sit down, and from the sight and sense of thine own unworthiness, take
but occasion to advance Free Grace and Mercy. Let there be place for that to
come in. Let those thoughts find entertainment. And thou shall quickly find a
strange change in thy spirit.

1. Thou, who could not mourn before, shall now be able to pour our tears,
as if thou were all turned to water.

2. Thou, who before could not believe, could not be comforted, wilt
even think it a wonder, that ever thy heart should be so dark, so doubtful.

3. Thou, who before wast dead, shall now find a spirit of life come into
thee, and make thee active in the work of the Lord.

Make but the Experiment, and thou will converse more with the promise, with
the Love of Christ, with the Free Grace of God, whiles thou live; if you
would but remove your unbelief.

But who shall remove this stone? God alone must do it. But if this were done,
this truth would let in a flood of mercy upon you; and even sink and over-whelm
you in a Sea of mercy and glory; where now you go drooping, and hang down your
heads, because you will not own that portion, which Christ has left you; nor
that comfort which Christ does tender and speak to you.

4. Direction to them of the Church.

4. Direction to them of the Church.
4. Labor for a reciprocal affection, a mutual taking between Christ and us.
Is Christ's heart taken with you? Oh! let your hearts be taken with him. Does
Christ love you: Oh! do you love Christ. Are you dear? are you precious to him?
let him be dear and precious to you.

Whatever God does to the soul, it makes an impression in the soul of the same
to God. He loves us, and thereupon we love him; so his heart is taken with
us, thereupon our hearts are taken with him. You see here the mutual
Indeerments betwixt Christ and his Church, Cant. 5.16.

Paul's heart was so much taken with Christ, that he was ever in his thoughts,
ever upon his tongue. He names him sixteen, or seventeen several times in one
chapter, 1 Cor. 1.1. as Chrysostom notes.

Peter did but let a word of Christ fall, and it is a door to open to further
discourse of him. He takes occasion upon the naming of him, to enter into
discourse concerning him. As you see, 1 Pet. 1.7, 8. So greatly were their
hearts taken with Christ, that they could think nothing but Christ, speak
nothing but Christ. No sentence complete, wherein Christ was not part of it.

He was the one of their esteems; the one of their affections; the one of
their desires; the one of their delights. And so ought he to be of ours.

Get your hearts taken with Christ, this will make you Christians indeed; this
will make you humble, active, cheerful Christians.

An heart taken with Christ is Heaven on this side Heaven. An Heaven on Earth.
Glory in Clay.

It is the Paradise, where Christ delights to walk.

It is the House, where Christ delights to dwell.

It is the Throne, where Christ sits in his glory.

It is the Habitation of the blessed Spirit.

It is the Delight of all the blessed Trinity.

An heart taken with Christ is the humble soul indeed, is the active soul, the
living soul, which breathes forth nothing but love and desire after Christ.

It is an heart dead to the world; for the World can never take that heart
which once is taken with Christ. All is empty to him, whom fullness fills. All
is blackness where Beauty shines.

Oh! then get but an heart taken with him, and thou live a Life of Glory, and
a Life of Grace. This is the Porch of Glory, the suburbs of Heaven.

I told you before, there were four special times in which the heart was taken
with Christ. I might add a fifth, which I hope is our times. -- When Christ
goes forth in his glory, for the redemption and deliverance of his Church, and
punishment of his enemies: Then is the heart taken with him.

1. Taken with his Wisdom. 2. With his Justice. 3. With his Power. 4. With his
Mercy and goodness. Which are the visible attributes Christ does manifest in
the deliverance of his Church.
You see this, Isa. 25.9. when God went forth in his Glory, to deliver his
Church, the Saints were taken with him, even to admiration, and speak glorying.
Lo, This is our God, we have waited for him, and he will save us. This is
the Lord; we have waited, and will be glad in his salvation.

Here was a Triumphant song of the Church. This is our God; This who appears so
glorious, so full of Majesty. This, This is our God, not yours. And good reason.

1. Christ never appears in his Glory to his Church; but he makes his Church
glorious.

You see, when God delivered his Church from Babylon, he did appear in his
Glory. Psalm. 102.16. When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his
glory.

And you see, as he appeared in his Glory, so he made the Church glorious,
Isa. 54.11, 12, 13. (speaking of the same time.) Behold I will lay thy stones
with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with Saphires. I will make thy
windows of Agates, and thy gates of Carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant
stones.

2. Christ now comes in, with the Performance of Promises; and needs then must
he be glorious, and the Church be taken with him.

If Christ were so glorious, when he made those promises: what is he, when
he comes in to make good those Promises? Christ has reserved abundance of his
visible Glory to be seen by his Church; now at the end of the World.

Our Forefathers have seen him but an obscured Christ, a persecuted and
kept-down Christ. Though glorious, yet humble-glory. But it will not be long
before the Church see him in his Glory, when he comes to destroy that man of
sin with the brightness of his coming.

Blessed be God for what our eyes see. Let us follow him with admiration with
the Church. This is our God; follow with spiritual triumph. This is our God.
And let our hearts be taken with his goings forth; who is set forth in his
glory now to redeem, and to deliver his Church and People.

A TREATISE OF THE NATURE AND ROYALTIES OF FAITH.

BY SAMVEL BOLTON, D. D. And MASTER of C.C.C.

LONDON: Printed by Robert Ibbitson, for Thomas Parkhurst, and are to be sold
at his Shop over against the Great Conduit in Cheapside, 1656.

A TREATISE OF THE NATVRE and ROYALTIES OF FAITH.
JOHN 3.15. That whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have
eternal life.
I Have intended (with Gods assistance) to enter upon a Discourse of Faith,
which might last till we come to the place, where faith shall be no more. And
although my preaching of faith may end before, yet your practicing of it must
not. The just shall live by faith, and the just must dye in faith.

This Text I have chosen for the foundation of this Discourse: Which, before I
come to handle in particular, I shall show what coherence and dependence it
has with the former words. For which purpose, you must know that this Chapter,
from the beginning to Verse 22. contains a discourse between Christ and
Nicodemus. In which you may observe, 1. The Occasion of the Discourse. 2. The
Discourse it self.


1. The occasion of this Discourse most likely, was a Question put by
Nicodemus, which is not here expressed; but is probably employed in Verse 3. in
that it is said, That Jesus Answered; and by the Answer, you may guess what the
Question was. It may be, such an one as this, What he must do that he might be
saved?

2. We have the Discourse it self: Which was partly continued, and partly
interrupted. Continued by Christ, and partly interrupted by Nichodemus, in
diverse places, by his Objections, Cavils, and fleshly Reasonings.

This Text is a part of Christ's continued discourse, and has special relation
to the foregoing verse, As Moses lift up, etc. so must the Son of man be lifted
up: Verse 14. That whosoever believes in him, be he who he will, Jew or
Gentile, bond or free, Barbarian, Scythian, etc.

Or be his sins what they will, for nature, never so heinous; for number, never
so many; for continuance, never so long practiced: Yet whosoever believes,
etc. if they believe, they shall be as readily and certainly pardoned and
saved, as other less offenders.

Whosoever believes.
In which words we have, 1. The Promise. 2. The Condition of the Promise.


Or here is 1. An act, Believe. 2. The object, Christ. 3. The Fruit and Benefit
that comes in thereby, 1. Negatively, Should not perish. 2. Positively, But
have Eternal life.

Now about the Act and the Object, we shall make these two enquiries, before we
come to lay down the Conclusion.

1. What act of faith that is, whereby a sinner stands justified before God?

2. Upon what Object this Act is to be terminated?

1. For the first, What Act that is? You must know, that faith in the general
consideration, has diverse acts and objects, and that the acts are diversified,
according to the diversity of the objects: so many particulars as are recorded
in Scripture, so many particular objects; and accordingly so many particular
acts there are of faith in general. But our enquiry is, what is the formal Act
and Object of justifying faith?

Now for the first; viz. What is the formal Act of Faith? You must know, that
there is much difference amongst Divines about it.

1. Some would have it to be a bare and naked assent to every truth revealed by
God. Thus the Papists.

2. Some say it is a firm and radical assent to this great Proposition, That
Christ is Messiah and Savior of the world.

3. Others place it in a receiving of Christ in all his Offices, as a King,
Priest, and Prophet.

4. Some in Assurance and Particular Knowledge, or Persuasion that we are in
the state of Grace, and have an interest in Christ, etc.

5. Others do place it in rolling our selves upon Christ, and resting in him,
when the soul assenting to that great Proposition, that Christ is the Savior,
the Mediator, does roll and rest it self upon him, and trusts in him.

In most of which different opinions, we find this agreement.

1 That it is an Act of Faith whereby we are justified, not Faith as an Habit
of Grace inherent in us, but Faith as an Act; not Faith in actu primo as an
Habit infused; but in actu secundo.

2 That it is such an Act as is not wrought out of our selves, or our own
Principles, but such as is wrought by the Spirit of Christ, and the mighty
Power of God.

3 That it is such an Act as brings over the soul to the true object, to
Christ, by whom we are justified.

4 Such an one as all the benefits of Christ do belong unto; accompany Christ
in blood, Christ in water, Christ for Justification, Christ for Sanctification,
Christ for Salvation; in all these there is an exact agreement among them. And
therefore although there be some difference in respect of that formal Act
which justifies; yet seeing they preach, and cry down themselves, and advance
and set up free grace, and mercy, both in the work and fruit of it; The Papists
have no cause to cry us down for dis-agreement, which for their parts, they are
like the four winds blowing in the faces of one another in many points, as
might easily be showed, if here it were pertinent.

We know, that while we are here, differences there will be, for we know in
part, and prophesy but in part. It were an happy thing if we could be all of
one heart, and all of one mind, but seeing it will not be. I could wish that
although we be not all of one mind, yet we might be all of one heart, and
that difference in judgment, might not breed alienation in affection,
especially seeing we all aim at one thing, one mark, one end. All agree in
hoc uno, in this one, to set up Christ, the mercy of God, free grace, and by
crying down our selves, and why then should we not agree amongst our selves?

And therefore in all these diversities of Judgments concerning the formal Act
of Faith, whereby we stand justified before God. I shall not deal so much in
the throwing down of other men's opinions, as in the establishing of mine own.

1 Because I conceive there is little wisdom in it, to uncover the nakedness
of our Brethren, by bringing them in, contending with one another.

2 Because I think there is little profit in it, especially in promiscuous
Congregations. Such debates being fitter for the Schools than for the Pulpit.
Polemical and Controversal points may beget Notion, little Motion; fill our
heads with Notions, but not our hearts with sanctified affections. And
therefore I will break my self in as plain and modest a manner as I can;
amongst all these differences to declare what I adhear to, and to establish it
by some Scriptures, and so pass it.

Now then I conceive that that formal act of Faith whereby we are justified
and instated into Christ, is an Act of Affiance, and recumbency, rolling
resting, trusting or Christ for Justification, and consequently for salvation.

For the proof whereof we are to observe, that the words both in the Old and
New Testament, by which the Act of Faith is expressed, do import such an act as
this.

In the Old Testament we meet with three words especially which import this
act of Faith, (...) which being referred to Christ, do express that Act whereby
we are justified.

1 (...) the first of them, as Rabbi Kimchi observes, does primitively and
properly signify to retire into some safe place for harbor or shelter; So
Judge. 9.15. come, (...) (says the Bramble) shelter or cover you under my
shadow, and the Prophet uses the same word, Psalm. 57.1. (...) my soul trusts
in thee, I will retire my self under the shadow of thy wings, and so it being
referred to Christ, betokens that Act, whereby we do betake our selves to
him as to our Sanctuary, where we may be preserved in safety from the tempest
of Gods displeasure, and so Psalm. 2.12. when his wrath is kindled, yea but a
little, (...) Blessed are all they that put their trust in him, or that retire
themselves to him; upon which place Junius notes, that that retyring unto God,
which is affirmed to be the cause of our blessedness, is no other than sincere
Faith, and what act of it, but this of affiance?

2 (...) The second word in the Old Testament signifies to roll; and being
joined with the Praeposition (...) signifies to devolve and roll something on
another, as Psalm. 37.5. (...) roll thy way upon the Lord, and trust in him,
etc. and Prove. 16.3. (...) roll thy works upon the Lord, and thy thoughts
shall be established, agreeable to which is (...), cast thy burden upon the
Lord, etc. And this word applied to Christ, imports that Act, whereby, being
laden with sin, and seeking ease, we at last discharge our load, and cast it
upon Christ.

3 (...) The third word signifies, to put confidence, trust and affiance in
any thing or person; so as securely to lean and rest upon it. So Isa. 50.10.
he that walks in darkness, and sees no light, (...) let him trust in the name
of the Lord, (...) and stay or lean upon his God, and Isa. 26.3. Thou will keep
him in perfect peace, whose mind (...) is staid on thee, (...) because he
trusts in thee; which word in the matter of Justification, designeth that
Act, whereby, finding and feeling our own weakness, as unable to support our
selves, we do lean and rest on Christ, as David, Psalm. 28.7. The Lord is my
strength, and my shield, my heart (...) trusted in him, and I am helped, etc.

And to these words in the Old Testament, we may add those forms of words in
the New, and so we shall find that what in the Old is expressed by some one
of these words, is in the New expressed by believing in and upon. To instance
in a few,

We trust in the name of his Holiness, says the Old Testament, Psalm. 33.21.
and, He that believes in his name, says the New, John 1.12, 13.

Trust in the Lord with thy whole heart, says the Old, Prove. 3.5. If thou
believe with thy whole heart, says the New, Acts 8.34, 37.

In thee, O Lord, have I trusted, let me not be confounded, says the Old,
Psalm. 31.1. and 25.2. and, He that believes on him shall not be ashamed, says
the New, Romans 10.11. So that you see, that to Trust, and to Believe, are
Synonima, import the same things; though they differ in name, yet not in
nature: He that Trusts Believes, and he that Believes Trusts.

In which sense we have the phrases of believing in or upon, 1 Pet. 2.6.
Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, and he that believes on him shall
not be confounded: Where, by believing on him, cannot be meant any thing, but a
laying and building our selves upon Christ as the foundation, that we may be
made a spiritual house; as you have it in Verse 4, 5. the like we have, Romans
10.10.11. He that believes on him: and so, 2 Timothy 1.12. For I know in whom I
have believed, etc. (...): Whence it is apparent, that to believe in God, is as
much as to commit our selves to his trust: for so it there follows, I am
persuaded, that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him, or
deposited with him, or delivered up unto his keeping to that day, that is, his
soul to everlasting life: So that we see, that to believe in Christ, is with
confidence and trust to rely upon him. And thus much for the formal act of
faith.

2. For the formal object of faith, and that not of faith at large, for so the
word of God is the objectum adaequatum of it; but as it is particularly
justifying faith, quatenus justificat, as it properly justifies; which is not
the believing of every truth of God, but that only which by way of eminency,
is called, The Truth, that is, Christ himself, with all his merits, John 14.6.
and so here in the Text, He that believes in him: Hence justifying faith, is
often called the Faith of Christ, because he is the proper object of it, Romans
3:22 26. Gal. 2.16.20. And faith in Christ, Acts 20.21. and Faith in the blood
of Christ: Whence I thus argue:

That Object to the Belief, of which justification and salvation is promised,
that is the Object of justifying faith.

But to believe in Christ, is Justification and Salvation promised:

Therefore Christ is the object of justifying faith.

Thus, as briefly as I could, having showed what is the formal both act and
object of justifying faith, I shall now lay down this one Conclusion.

Doct. That the great thing which is required at our hands for Justification
and Salvation, is believing in Christ. He that believes shall be saved.

In the prosecution of this, we will show, 1 What Faith is. 2 That Faith is
the great requisite. 3 Why God has made choice of this to be the instrument
of Justification. 4 How Faith does justify, whether formally, or
instrumentally. 5 What be the Royalties of Faith.


1 What Faith is.
For the first, What Faith is, We will not define the habit of Faith, but the
Act of Faith, nor every Act, but that only which justifies. Now according to
the diversity of opinions herein, such is the diversity of Definitions.

They who hold the Assent to be the Act of Justifying Faith, define it to be
a firm and willing Assent to the truth of God in general, and to this truth in
particular, that Christ is the Messiah and Savior of the World. They who hold
it to be a receiving of Christ, define it to be such an Act, as whereby we
receive Christ in all his offices.

But not to trouble you with these. That which I will give you is this.

Definition.
Faith is an Act of a regenerate person, whereby knowing, and assenting unto the
Promises of God, and to this Truth in particular, that Christ is the Messiah or
Savior of the World, does rest upon him for Justification, Sanctification, and
consequently for Salvation.

Now to explain this Definition.

1 I say, that Faith is an Act; for we speak not of Faith in actu primo, as an
habit infused, and implanted in us, but in actu secundo, as an Act whereby we
are justified, for we are not justified by Faith as an habit, or as a grace
inherent in us, but (as I said) by Faith as an Act, as it goes over to Christ;
as we see here the Promise is not made to the Habit, but to the Act of Faith.
He that believes, etc. That is the first, I call it an Act,

2 The subject person, so it is said to be an Act of a regenerate person, a
man universally sanctified, regenerated and born again; for take Faith which
way you please, for the Act or for the Habit, neither of them are before
Regeneration.

1 The Act of Faith, that is not before the Habit of Faith; a thing must be in
esse before it can be in operari, there must be a Habit of Faith within,
before there can be the exercise of Faith without.

2 And this Habit of Faith is not infused before other graces, it being part of
our inherent Sanctification, as infidelity is a part of our corruption, nor is
it again infused alone, but together with the rest of the graces of Gods
Spirit, by which we are regenerated. So that Faith is an Act of a regenerated
soul.

A man cannot believe till his understanding be enlightened, and his will
changed, and this is not before Grace.

Again, to believe is an Act of a living man, not of a soul dead in sin, and
therefore the soul must first be endued with the life of Grace, before it can
perform this living action.

Indeed we are said to be sanctified by Faith, and so it might seem that our
Sanctification were a fruit of Faith, an effect of Faith, but we are not to
understand this as meant of the first work of Sanctification, which is not
acquired or put forth by us, but infused by God, together with Faith, as being
a part of it: But it is meant of the second or further work of Sanctification,
and so Faith sanctifies us, as it lends a hand to help forward, and to perfect
our Sanctification; for so Faith does strengthen and increase Grace in us, by
drawing down strength and life from Christ daily; and in this sense, as to
their been or melius esse, all our graces have a kind of dependence upon Faith;
as a Mediatory grace (as I may say) as our Mediator to our Mediator; in
fetching down influence and strength, for the strengthening and increasing of
grace in us.

And therefore by the way, it may be a good Admonition to you, when you find
any weakness in your love, patience, or in any other grace, still to strengthen
and increase Faith; whereby you may draw down from Christ strength to all the
rest.

3 The third thing in the definition expresses what this formal act is, and
here we have 1 The essentiale Antecedens. 2 The essentiale constituens.

1 The essentiale Antecedens, essentially pre-requisite to the justifying Act,
and this is knowing and assenting, which two I might separate for the better
discovery of our adversaries error, in their implicit Faith, who hold that it
is sufficient for some only to believe as the Church believes, although they
know not themselves any thing that they believe, to maintain which blind Faith,
they say that Justifying Faith may be without knowledge, nay, that it were
better to be defined by ignorance, than by knowledge.

But we must not stand to answer every thing that comes in the way, for so
we should stay long enough at the threshold.

I will therefore join these two both together, as essentially pre-requisite,
whereby we know and assent to our own miserable estate, the freeness of God
promise, and grace which he has tendered to the soul in Christ, both
essential Antecedents to justification, of which some expound that, John 6.40.
every one that sees the Son and believes on him, shall have everlasting life.
Where, by seeing they say is meant Christum praedicatum videre and agnoscere
pro filio Dei, to see and acknowledge Christ the Son of God, and Savior of the
World, and indeed this must go before; It is gradus ad rem; though not gradus
in re, it is a pre-requisite or preparatory to justifying Faith, but it is not
justifying Faith; as in the Generation of a man, the sensitive soul goes
before, and prepares a fit organ for the infusion of the reasonable soul and
yet not the sensitive, but the reasonable soul does inform; so in the
reparation of man, hystorical faith does precede, and make way for the
inducement of justify^ng Faith, and yet not the former, but this does justify;
as Calvin says, a Vulgar knowledge and assent to truth, does join a man no
more to God, than the sight of the Sun does lift a man to Heaven. Otherwise did
this hystoricall assent justyfie, then it as well as Justification should be
proper only to the Elect; so Justification is, Romans 8.30. but so is not an
hystorical assent, for that Simon Magus had, and other Reprobates may have.

2 Essentiale constituens, or that formal Act whereby we are justified, and
that is rolling or resting our selves upon Christ, or trusting on him, for they
are Synonimaes; expressing the same thing in diverse words.

And that this is the formal Act of justifying Faith, I refer my self and you
to what in this kind was said before. I here only say, that that which is
imputed for Righteousness, and by which we are justified, that is the true and
formal Act of justifying Faith.

But such a kind of believing is imputed for Righteousness, and is that by
which we are justified; so says the Apostle, Romans 4.5. to him who believes
on him that justifies the ungodly, his Faith is imputed to him for
Righteousness, and Romans 10.10, 11. with the heart man believes unto
Righteousness, and in the next verse, he Interprets that believing, by
believing on him; for the Scripture says, whosoever believes on him, etc.

And therefore we conclude, so to believe is the justifying Act of Faith.

4 The fourth thing in the Definition, is the fruit which comes in, or the end
of this Act, and that is, 1 Next and immediate. Justification and pardon of
sin. 2 Mediate. Sanctification and growth in grace. 3 Ultimate. The Perfection
of all in Glorification.


But here some may object,

Object. 1. First, there are many who do trust, and yet are not justified: many
who profess that they do this act, but yet live in their sins, as Balaam, etc.
Therefore this is not the justifying Act.

Ans. I answer, That although every one say he trusts, yet every one does
not truly trust, for there is a double affiance or trust. The one is a slight
and superficial affiance, grounded upon no other foundation than a great
apprehension, that it is good to be saved by Christ, but yet so as neither to
leave their old course, or embrace a new. The other is a settled and grounded
affiance, and so qualified, as that it is not to be found in any not truly
justified, if it be, I shall yield the cause.

1. It is a holy Trust: Jude, v. 20. Build up one another in your holy faith;
not as though holiness were required as an ingredient into faith, in the act of
Justification, or giving us our first interest in Christ; but this I mean, by a
holy trust, that it is such a trust as is accompanied with holiness in the
root, and brings forth works of holiness in the fruit; such a faith as is
accompanied with holiness in the heart, and declared in the holiness of our
lives: For although it be fides sola, faith alone which justifies, and gives
us the first interest in Christ; yet it is not fides quae sola and solitaria,
it is not a faith which is alone, but such a faith as is accompanied with
holiness in the root, the graces of Gods Spirit, and holiness in the life.

The faith which does justify us, is not in formis, but formata; not a dead
faith, but animated and quickened with grace and holiness, the whole man being
sanctified.

2. It must be an unfeigned Trust, 1 Timothy 1.5. 2 Timothy 1.5. There is a
counterfeit and hypocritical Trust, such as never comes to God from love, but
for shelter in a storm, Psalm. 78.34, 35, 36. When he slew them, then they
sought him, and yet did but flatter, etc.

Or such a faith it is, that closes not fully with Christ in all his Offices.
They are content to have him as a Savior, but not for a Lord; the privileges
and dignities that come in by Christ, they are willing to own, but not the
duties and services which he requires. They will commit themselves to Christ to
save; when in trouble, then, Lord help; but to the Devil to serve, Who is Lord
over us?

Whereas now a true faith, is as careful to do its services, as to partake of
its privileges; if it throw it self into the arms of Christ, to save it; it
will throw it self at the feet of Christ, to serve him, as Paul, Lord, what
will thou have me to do?

3. It must be such a Trust, as arises from a believing disposition within:
There must be a seed and habit of faith, before there can be an act of faith:
Although the acts be discerned before the habits, yet there must be a habit, a
believing disposition within, before we can act. I know there are many, who in
case of danger, lying upon their death bed, or some present wrack and disquiet,
will make show of doing this act of faith; but yet wanting this believing
disposition within, like Jonahs Gourd, or the untimely fruit of a woman, or the
stony ground-seed, having no root, soon withers, decays, and comes to nothing.
God respects not the act of faith, if it arise not from a believing
disposition within; but God has sometimes accepted of the believing
disposition and desires of faith, when there has not been strength enough to
erect any vigorous act of believing: I believe, help my unbelief.

4. It must be a perfect Trust, 1 Pet. 1.13. Trust perfectly in the grace
revealed. Perfect, I say, not in respect of the measures and degrees of Trust,
there is none such here: But yet perfect in respect of the nature of it; i. e.
there must be a full carrying of the soul over to Christ, and a full rolling
and resting on him. It cannot be meant of the perfection of degrees, for there
can be no such absolute perfection, to which another degree may not be added;
there is none so perfect in faith, but that he may be more perfect; none so
strong, but that he may be stronger; although we cannot be more justified to
day, than we were yesterday, in the sight of God. For we say, that Gratia
remittens or justificans, the justifying grace of God admits of no degrees, is
not capable of magis and minus. Yet the assurance of our Justification is, a
man may be more assured of his Justification to day, than he was yesterday.

As justifying faith does imply imperfection in the subject, so the faith it
self, whereby we are justified is imperfect, whilst we are here, in respect of
degrees.

But in the nature of it, it must be so perfect, that it carries the soul over
wholly to Christ alone, resting and rolling on him; for an imperfect trust in
this kind, is as good as nothing. He that does not rest the full weight and
stress of his soul on Christ, does nothing for the matter of trust. It is not
every faint stirring and moving of the heart, not every incomplete resting, but
such a full rest of the soul upon Christ, that if he fails us, we are sunk and
undone for ever.

As you know a man is said to lean upon a thing, not when he bears up himself
only by his own feet, but when he rests a great part, if not the whole weight
of his body, upon some thing or person else, so that if it fail, he falls: so
thus it is to lean, to rest upon Christ, to commit the whole weight and stress
of our souls to him, that if he fail me, I am undone, I am lost for ever, I see
I am in a miserable condition, I see he is an all-sufficient Savior, I see
that there is nothing but death in me, I see there is life enough in him, and
he invites me to come over to him, he entreats, beseeches, promises, and
therefore I will go over to him, I will cast my self wholly on him, I will look
no other way, therewill I trust, and if I perish, I perish: I will dye in his
arms, I will dye believing. This indeed is that great act of faith, which
entituleth us to Christ, and gives us an interest in him; even in the dusk of
the morning the soul has an interest. And therefore on the contrary, there is
no readier way to be mistaken, and so to miscarry, than to trust equally to two
stays, to trust to Christ, and to trust to our selves too. As there is no way
whereby a man is likelier to fall, than to trust equally to two boughs, whereof
the one is sound, and the other rotten; whereof if one break, it is as bad as
if both did, the man is sure to come to the ground; whereas had he pitched his
whole weight on the sound one only, he had been born up. So here, in leaning
both on Christ and our selves; whereas if we commit our souls, and all their
burdens to Christ only, if we fail, he sinks with us: We are sure to be
upheld, the Promise, Covenant, the Oath of Christ, even Christ himself, and all
would sink, if we fail.

If thy trust be thus qualified, I pronounce thee a justified person; no soul
ever miscarried in a trusting way, it is such an act as does engage all the
Attributes of God, his Justice, Truth, Mercy, Power, and all to do us good.

Object. 2. But I have put forth this act of faith, and yet, alas, I am not
justified.

Answ. Thou say thou puts forth this act of faith, and thus qualified, and
yet thou say thou art not justified. How know thou that? Thou say thou
art not, because thou do not know thou art, I know that will be the next. For
thus poor hearts reason to their own discouragement. I want assurance of
Justification, therefore I am not justified; I want that inward peace, and
therefore fear my peace is not made with God. Though there be nothing more
clear than this, that a man may have peace with God, and yet want the peace of
this in himself; it is possible for a man to be justified, and yet want
assurance of it within. Affiance, does justify in the Court of God; Assurance
justifies in the Court of Conscience; to be justified is one thing, to be
assured is another.

In the object all is sure, in the subject there may be much uncertainty: It is
possible for a man to put forth the act of faith, yea, and to continue in so
doing, and yet walk without peace, and apprehensions of his own safety; thy
condition may be safe in the promise to the eye of faith, though not to thy
self in the evidence of sense. Thy condition may be safe and secure, although
thou for the present do not apprehend thy own safety, or the security of it.
It is secure in the promise, in respect of God; though stormy and troubled to
sense, in respect of our selves.

Thou must not therefore look for a clear day, and that the shower be over, as
soon as thou have taken shelter; nor for a calm, so soon as thou have cast
anchor: but thou must abide under the shelter, and ride at anchor, till the
shower and storm be over, and wait till times of refreshment shall come from
the presence of the Lord.

Godly security, and apprehensions of safety, do not ever presently attend the
act of faith at the heels. Thou must stay the Lords leisure, and wait till all
clouds and storms be blown over, till all doubts and fears shall vanish, Psalm
57.1.

Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart: but, with
the Husbandman, we must wait in patience, till the corn come up, and the crop
come in.

The storm does not cease, as soon as the ship-man has cast anchor, the winds
then may yet blow, and the tempest may be as strong, nay, it may be stronger
than before; but the rock to which thou art fastened is sure, or if thy anchor
hold, all is sure. Nothing shall hinder safety, though something may interrupt
thy security to thine own apprehension.

To trust is the act of faith, but apprehended security is the fruit of
believing, and therefore comes not till afterward, it may be some months, may
be some years, after long experience. Nay, it is not an inseparable fruit of
believing, I mean, thy apprehended security is not: thou may possibly never
in this life reach the apprehensions of thy security, and yet thy condition may
be secure. It is secure (as I said) in the promise, though not to sense, if
thou dyest whilst thou ridest at Anchor, having thrown it out, and fastened it
on Christ; yet thou dyest in the ship, and not in the sea; thou dyest in the
Covenant of Peace, and there is safety, though the storm in this world may
never cease. That which I would commend to thee, is to be much in self-purging,
self-humbling, self-examination, trust much, and steadfastly to the end. Do as
they did in that great storm, when neither Sun nor Stars were seen for many
days, cast out anchor, and wish for day; nay, cast out two anchors (that is
safest in a tempestuous night) trust and pray, that God would break into thy
soul with a calm morning light; and mean while wait, and say, When will the day
break, and these shadows, this darkness, this tempest fly away. My soul, wait
thou only upon God, for my expectation is from him, Psalm. 62.5.

Object. 3. But (say some) To believe is an act of the understanding, and is
nothing else, but an Assent to the truth of Divine Revelations; which is
expressed in Scripture, By receiving of Christ, John 1.12 -- To as many as
received him, to them he gave power to become the sons of God: even to as many
as believe in his name. Where receiving of Christ (which, say they, is An act
of the understanding assenting to this truth, That Christ is the Messiah, and
Savior of the world) is made all one with Believing. And so, Isa. 53.11 -- By
his knowledge (Notitia sui, not, sua:) By the knowledge of him, shall my
righteous servant justify many: which knowing is an act of the understanding
also.

The like, John 17.3 -- This is life Eternal, To know thee, etc. All which
places do report thus much, That Faith is an act of the understanding, not of
the will. And to this they allege the testimony of the Greek Fathers; which
make Faith, (...): An undoubted Assent to the Doctrine of Salvation; and to
this Proposition in particular, That Christ is the Messiah. So that by all
this, it is clear (to them) that Faith is an act of the understanding, not of
the will: But now Trust is an act of the will, and therefore cannot be the
formal act of justifying Faith.

Answ. Now, for Answer of this, we must know, that

1. To Believe: In the general, is no more, than to assent to the truth of a
Proposition for the Authority of the Speaker. It is no more than An act of the
understanding, whereby we Assent to the truth of Divine Revelations.

But we speak not of Faith in general, but of justifying Faith, of that formal
act of Faith, whereby we stand justified before God. And here we say, that --
Faith is not an act of the understanding only, but of the will also.

The first: It is Too Low: Non pertingit ad justificationem; as one says, It
reaches not so high as Justification.

The second, Brings the Soul over to Christ, by an act of Trust, whereby a man
is justified.

By the first, we do but Discover the Justifying-Cause, the Founain of Life,
Christ himself.

By the latter, we Throw our selves into this Fountain, In ipsum quasi totos
nos immergimus.
and draw water of life from him.

Hence one, None can be justified, but by union with Christ; Nullus potest
justificari nisi per unionem ad Christum. Durand.
and the first union is by Faith.

By what Faith? The Speculative act of Faith?

No sure: This does no more unite the soul to Christ, than the sight of the
Sun, does draw a man up to heaven.

By what Faith then? But by this act of Trusting, Resting, Leaning, etc.

Hence Augustine -- To believe in Christ, Credere in Deum, est credendo, in
Deum ire.
is by believing to go into Christ, and to be incorporate into his body; which
the Papists themselves will not say, is done By a bare act of the understanding.

And therefore to pass this, and come to the places alleged: Where the first
is,

1 John 1.12 -- As many as received him, to them he gave power, etc. where, say
they, by Receiving, is meant no more but An act of the understanding, whereby
they assented to this, That he was the Messiah.

For answer to this place, we say, That this word Receiving, does not only
denote the understanding, but implies the will also. Which will appear by this
one Reason, among many.

That Receiving is to be understood, which is opposed to the Jews not receiving
of him. For, having said in Verse 11 -- He came to his own, and his own
received him not. Immediately is added -- But as many as did receive him, to
them he gave power to become the sons of God: So that the matter of Inquiry
will be, How the Jews did not receive him.

Was it then only in this, Their not assenting that he was the Messiah? or,
Rejecting him, and Refusing him for a Savior?

It could not be the former, Their non-assenting to the truth of this; That he
was the Messiah: Though it was the ground why Sundry did not receive him; yet
it was not the ground, why all did not receive him.

For we read, There were diverse of the Scribes, and Pharisees, and Priests, who
knew right well, that he was The Christ: For so much do the Husbandmen
themselves confess, in the Parable, as Christ brings them in ( Mat. 21.38.)
saying -- This is the Heir, come, let us kill him, and seize upon his
inheritance.

And how could our Savior justly charge them with the Sin against the Holy
Ghost, unless they had known him to be the Messiah? Mat. 12.32. and wilfully
rejected him against knowledge and conscience?

And how can any be said, To make shipwreck of Faith, which yet the Scripture
says some have done? 1 Timothy 1.19. unless you will say, A man made shipwreck of
that he never had; except he do historically believe, as Simon Magus, and
others did; who did not feign a Faith in words, as Calvin says; but being
overcome with the Majesty of the Gospel, did in a sort (sc. historically)
believe and acknowledge Christ the Author of Life and Salvation.

Nay, and if man did not Historically believe, then all the sins committed
against the Gospel, were only sins of Ignorance, and not against Knowledge. So
that there were no sins in the Gospel against Knowledge: Nor, Now neither; if
this be granted.

And therefore, as their Non-Receiving of him, was not so much an Act of the
Understanding, whereby they Assented not to this, That CHRIST was the Messiah:
But rather an Act of the Will, whereby they refused him to be their Savior.
As you see plainly expressed by CHRIST, Luke 19.14. -- we will not have this man
to reign over us. So Mat. 23.37.

So that their Receiving of him was not a bare Act of the Understanding,
whereby they Assented to this, That CHRIST was the Savior: But an act of the
Will, whereby they chose him, embraced him, rested and trusted upon him as a
Savior.

And therefore, seeing this Act of Receiving of CHRIST, is not an act of the
Understanding; but an act of the Will embracing him, trusting on him: And that
this Receiving is Believing, as the Evangelist says.

Therefore To believe is to trust.

To the other places, Isa. 53.11. and John 17.3. where Faith seems to be an
act of the Understanding. As -- By his Knowledge shall he justify many. And
-- This is eternal life. To know thee, etc.

We are to understand them Senechdochically: where part is set down for the
whole: The whole nature of Faith being implied in those Phrases.

These Phrases are Hebraismes: In which language, words of Knowledge and Sense,
do imply the Will and Affections. They do not only signify the Act of the mind
and Sense, but imply the Will and affections too.

As you see, Psalm. 1.6. -- The Lord knows the way of the Righteous; That is,
The Lord loves, The Lord approves of the way of the Righteous.

So where it is said. -- Depart from me, I know you not. That is, I love you
not; I allow not of you; I approve you not.

And so may that place in Isa. 53.11. be interpreted. Non solum agnitionem
Personae, and beneficiorum Christi significat; sed etiam Fiduciam quiescentem
in Christi.
It does not only signify the knowledge of the person, and benefits of Christ;
but resting and trusting upon them; Such a Knowledge of Christ, as is mingled
with Faith, and works our Wills to accept of CHRIST, to trust in him. CHRIST,
being So known, (as to be Embraced, Rested upon, Trusted upon) shall justify
many. He speaks of such a Knowledge of CHRIST as is joined with Faith.

And, to the Testimony of the Fathers alleged. As we will not Resolve our
Faith into the Authority of any, though never so eminent in the Church: So, No
Authority shall bear us down in this matter, if it be not Consentaneous, and
Agreeable to the Word of Truth. It is no matter what others have taught before
us, Nil refert quid hic, aut ille ante nos docuerit; sed quid is, qui ante
omnes est, CHRISTUS. Ciprian.
but what CHRIST himself (who was before all) has taught, who is Truth himself.

So that, seeing this is not manifested, I might refel them with the same ease,
as they are alleged.

But, seeing Authority is stood upon; And I reverence Authority, when it is
with God.

And that Authority does make Faith nothing, but An Act of the Understanding,
whereby we assent.

We will in the same way overthrow that, by setting Authority against
Authority; Weight against Weight: That, if nothing will be said for us? so
nothing may be said against us. One may balance the other; if not weigh it
down.

Now, that it is An Act of the Will also, let us hear Augustine. -- Fides sine
Voluntate non potest esse. Et Fides in Credentium Voluntate consistit: Faith
lies in the Will. Again. -- Voluntate utique credimus: Verily we believe with
the Will. Credere non potest, nisi Volens. August. upon John 6.44. God makes a
man willing before he can believe. A man may receive the Sacrament against his
Will; pray against his Will. But he cannot believe against his Will, said
Augustine.

Another, -- It were not Virtuous to believe, if it were not voluntary. --
Ipsum velle credere, est essentiale Fidei? To believe willingly, is essential
to Faith.

Another upon Romans 10. -- With the heart man believes; upon which he says --
Signanter dicit, Cord creditur; id est Voluntate: He says remarkably, man
believes with the heart, that is, with the Will.

To these I might allege many more. But these shall suffice. By which you see,
That Authority is more for us, than against us.

But, leaving the Contestation, we will come to the Issue, and conclude this.

And, To speak what I think. I conceive, that to believe, is not an Act of the
Will only: Nor an Act of the Understanding only: But

An Act of the whole Soul.
It is so an Act of the Will, as the Understanding is folded up in it: and so
an Act of the Understanding, as that the Will and Affections are joined with it.

Hence, by some it is called (Actus Complicatus) An Act, wherein many Acts are
folded up? An Act of the Understanding, An Act of the Will.

And 'its not Absurd to me, but very fit to say, That That Act whereby the
whole Soul is justified, pardoned, purified; is an Act of the whole Soul.

As the Apostle says. -- With the Heart man believes to Righteousness. So
that, In Intellectu habet Initium; In Voluntate Complementum: It begins in the
Understanding; It is complete in the Will and Affections.

All that I know of moment against this, will be this, That we shall seat
Faith in diverse faculties; which is improper.

Now, for the Answer, or removing this, we say

1 That Distinction of Faculties is a Philosophical Opinion; and not received
by all. So that the Will and the Understanding are two distinct Faculties, is
an Opinion not received by all. Many there are that make them more Notional
than Real: As the East, West, North and South in the Heavens. Not that there
are such things, but that such things are feigned, for our clearer
Understanding.

It is thought by many of good worth, that Anima intelligit in intellectu:
Eligit in Voluntate, etc. That there is no such distinction of Faculties: But
that the same Soul does Understand in the Understanding: Will in the Will:
Does Understand, Will, Love, and do all.

And there is Scripture for it, where we read all these Acts attributed to the
Soul it self: As namely an Understanding Heart, A willing mind, etc. And
therefore seeing it is a bare Philosophical Opinion, and not received by All,
This will not overthrow, nor strengthen any Divine Truths.

2 Though this were true, That there were distinction of Faculties: yet, I say,
Making of Faith an Act of the whole Soul, of the Understanding, Will and
Affections: There Is no Necessity will follow thereupon, of planting it in
diverse and distinct Faculties.

Why may it not be Planted and Subjected in the Heart? which is the proper
seat of Faith, as well as of other Graces.

As others, who have made The Formal Act of Faith, a willing Assent, which is
both An Act of the Will and Understanding; to avoid the seating of the Habit
in diverse Faculties, have placed it in the Mind; which, (say they) comprehends
the Understanding and the Will:

So we here; To avoid the like, do seat it more properly in the Heart. And
therefore that absurdity of seating Faith in diverse Faculties will not follow
on us; Though we say, That this Act of Faith, whereby we are justified, Be
such an Act, wherein many other Acts are folded up: The Understanding assenting,
The Will trusting, etc.

Object. 4 But to believe, is to be assured. And therefore it is not to trust.

Ans. I say, That to believe, is not to be assured. And to be assured, is not
to believe. Faith is not Assurance; Nor is Assurance Faith, as many have held.

I will not trouble you with the Controversy; only I will infer these things.

1 If Assurance were the Act of Faith, whereby we are justified: Then where
there is no Assurance, there is no Faith. This were an hard Consequent. Nay,
then, Whoever lives and dies without Assurance, cannot be saved. They who
live and dye without Faith cannot be saved, And if Faith were Assurance: Then,
Whoever lived and dyed without Assurance could not be saved: Which far be it
from me to hold.

2 That which is a Consequent of justifying Faith, is not Justifying Faith.
This is plain.

But Assurance is a Consequent of Justifying Faith. It is that, which follows
it, 1 Sometimes in order of Time. 2 Always in order of Nature.


1 Sometimes in order of Time, 1 John 5.13. -- These things have I written unto
you, that believe on the Name of the Son of God, that you might know, that you
have Eternal life: where you see Believing goes before, and Knowing or
Assurance follows after. It is not contemporary with Faith, but follows it.

2 Always in order of Nature. As we say, The Truth of a Proposition is ever
in order of Nature, before the Knowledge of the Truth of it, Things must be in
Esse, before they can be in Cognosci: Things must Be, before they can be
known to Be: So there must be pardon of sins, before there can be Assurance
of pardon. A man must be Justified, before he can be assured he is
Justified. Justification must needs go before the Apprehension of Justification.

Now, that which apprehends Justification, is not Justifying Faith, but
follows, it: For Apprehension follows Justification. No man can truly apprehend
himself to be Justified, till he be Justified.

But Justifying Faith is in nature before Justification.

And therefore; unless we should say, that That which follows, is That which
goes before; we cannot say, that that which apprehends Justification, is
Justification: And by Consequence, Assurance is not that Faith which Justifies.

3 Again. If to believe were to be assured that we are Justified, and our
sins pardoned: Then it will follow; God commands us to believe an untruth.

Why, How will that follow?

Thus, Because God commands every one to believe, 1 John 3.23. -- This is his
Commandment, that we believe on the name of his Son JESUS CHRIST.

Now, If to believe were to be assured, we are Justified, and our sins
pardoned: Then God commands to believe an untruth: That our sins are pardoned,
before they are pardoned: That we are Justified, before we are Justified.

Nay, Such as are Reprobates, and shall never be pardoned: If to believe, were
to be assured of pardon; Then, I say, God commands them to be assured of
pardon: And so commands to believe a lie, an untruth.

There is 1 The Act of Faith, and 2 The Fruit of Faith.


The Act of Faith is, To cast our selves on CHRIST, to rest, to trust on him.

The Fruit of Faith, is Justification, pardon of sin, Reconciliation.

Now God commands no man to believe the Fruit of Faith, until he has done
the Act of Faith. He commands no man to believe he has an interest in the
Promise, till he has performed the condition of the Promise.

The Promise runs upon this condition. He that believes, shall receive
remission of sins, Act. 10.43. Act. 16.31.

To the first Act of Faith, All men indeed are tied under pain of damnation,
Mar. 16.16. Joh. 3.18. The World shall be condemned for unbelief. And there is
no condemnation, but upon breach of some Commandment. And therefore all men
are tied to do the first Act.

But now to the latter, none are tied, but such as have done the former.

The first is the condition of the Promise: or, The Duty. The second is the
Benefit, or Fruit of the Promise.

So that we conclude this: That

Assurance is not the Act of Faith whereby we are justified before God: But
yet, That whereby we are justified in our selves: in the Court of Conscience.

We are said to be Justified in three Courts.

1 In foro Dei: In Gods Court. 2 In foro Conscientiae: in Court of Conscience.
3 In foro Communi: In the Court of men.
1 In the Court of God; It is not Assurance: But Faith, Affiance, trust, that
does Justify.

2 In the Court of Conscience; It is not Faith, but Assurance which Justifies.
Where the (...), or first Proposition is the undoubted Word of God, -- he that
beeleves shall be saved. The (...), or Assumption is the Testimony of our own
spirit, with that word. The (...): is the verdict, and Testimony of the SPIRIT
of God, testifying with our spirit, according to the word, whereby we have
Assurance.

In the Court of men: It is nor Faith, nor Assurance, that Justifies; but works.

Object. 5 But you will say. If Assurance be not the Act whereby we are
justified, Because it is a Fruit of Justifying Faith: Much less can Trust be
the Act of it, because it is the Fruit of Assurance.

That, which is the Fruit of Assurance, cannot be the Act of Justifying Faith.

But this Trust and Affiance is a fruit of Assurance; Assurance is the cause,
and works Affiance as the Effect.

Therefore Trust or Affiance, cannot be the Act of Justifying Faith.

Answ. Assurance is twofold, 1 Principiorum; of Principles. 2 Conclusionum; of
Conclusions.


The first; The Assurance of Principles is no more but such a grounded,
undoubted Assurance as Believes the main Proposition of the Gospel: as, -- He
that believes shall be saved.

The second; The Assurance of Conclusions, is such an Assurance as is
necessarily deduced from the word, by Application, in a practical Syllogism;
after this manner.

He that believes shall be saved. But I believe. Therefore I shall be
saved. The first is, The Assurance of the Object. The second is, The Assurance
of the Subject. The first, Of the thing believed. The second, Of the Believer,
The first is, The Assurance of the general Proposition -- whoever believes
shall be saved; which is called -- ((...), 2 Col. 2. The full Assurance of
Understanding, or Knowledge, which is the Plerophory of Assent to the Truth of
the Gospel, touching CHRIST a Savior.

The second is, (...), The Assurance of Faith, Heb. 10.22. And that is, when
we are assured, CHRIST is OUR SAVIOR.

The first goes before the Act of Trust.

The second follows the Act of Trust.

And this Act of trusting and resting upon CHRIST, is the ground of such
Assurance,

Object. But you will say. How shall we rest upon CHRIST for Salvation, unless
we be first assured of Salvation by him?

Answ. Indeed, unless we know CHRIST to be the only Savior, we cannot rest
upon him for Salvation. But to say, A man cannot rest upon him for
Justification and Salvation, except he know he is already Justified, and
shall be saved: I see little sense for that.

May not a man trust upon his friend, who has engaged himself, and promised to
do such a thing for him, until he knows it were already done for him? So
here. May not the Soul rest upon CHRIST, who has promised pardon and
forgiveness to them that trust on him, except it first knew, that CHRIST had
already pardoned, and forgiven him?

The ground of this mistake, I conceive to arise from one of these two grounds.

1 That they take TRUST for ASSURANCE; or 2 That they take TRUST for a FRUIT of
ASSURANCE: And so all one with HOPE.
Now, for the clearing of the first, you must know, that TRUST does signify
these two things.

1 Ipsum Actum Innitendi; the very act of leaning, etc. 2 Consequens effectum
Fidei; the consequent Effect of Faith.
1 It signifies that very act of Leaning, Resting, Rolling on CHRIST; which is
properly the act that Justifies.

2 Sometimes it signifies, the consequent Effect of Faith; as full assurance,
and persuasion; the lively sense of pardon, and remission of sins.

But when we speak of that act of Trust, which Justifies, we mean not Trust
in this second Acception; For this is not Justifying Faith: but Fidei
Justificantis Filia: the Daughter of Justifying Faith, which comes after much
sweat and pains in the work of God, trial and experience of our selves, and
truth of our Graces.

But we speak of Trust in the first Acception; the resting and rolling of the
soul upon CHRIST.

The former we say is the act of justifying Faith: and propriissimus actus
Fidei justificantis: the most proper act of justifying Faith.

The latter we grant is the fruit of the former Trust, and Assurance; both set
down by the Apostle, 1 Timothy 1.12. -- I Know (says the Apostle) whom I have
believed: (...): whom I have trusted, or committed my soul unto, There is the
first act of Faith. -- And I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I
have committed to his trust, to eternal life, There Is the second act of Trust.
He will be all this to me, which I have Trusted to him for.

1. I know] There was Hystorical Faith, Assent.

2. Whom I have trusted or committed my soul to. There was justifying Faith.

3. I am persuaded.] There was the fruit of it.

To the first Act there concurs, 1. A discovery of our own emptiness. 2. A
Discovery of CHRIST'S fullness for Justification. 3. A casting of the Soul upon
him, for Justification and Salvation: Going out of our selves, and casting our
souls upon Christ.


To the second Act, there is required, 1. Not only a Knowledge, that he is a
Savior. 2. But also, a Knowledge that he is My Savior, upon whom I trust, or
I am persuaded of Salvation by.


The second mistake is, That they take Trust for a fruit of Assurance. And so
no ore but Hope. Propter Spem Roboratam: for strengthened Hope.

Answ. That this act of Trust, which we make justifying Faith, is not an act
of Hope, but does differ from Hope, or that affiance which they make Hope
strengthened; In this,

1. That Hope looks to the end, which is Salvation: But this act of Trust,
looks to the Means, which brings to the end, and that is Christ.

2. The act of Hope is to expect: But the act of Trust is to lean, and rest.

3. The Object of Hope is, Bonum Futurum, a Future Good: But the object of
Trust is, Bonum Presens, a Present Good.

This act of Trust does rest upon Christ, Non per modum expectantis; sed per
modum possidentis, not by way of Expectation, but by way of Possession. As --
He that believes in the Son has life. It is not said, -- He shall have life;
but -- He has life: not in Spe, but in Re; not in Hope only, but in Hand; The
life of Righteousness, and Justification in Hand: The life of Glory and
Salvation in Hope.

And thus much shall serve for the first thing, what Faith is. In which, I
hope, most of the controversy is over.

2. We now come to the second, That Faith is the only requisite, whereby we
should be justified, and saved.

I shall not need to stand long on it.

1. Union, and Communion with Christ is requisite to Justification and
Salvation. There was no way whereby we should be Justified, whereby we
should be saved: But only by virtue of our Union, and Communion with Christ.

1. No other way, but by virtue of our Union with Christ. In our selves we
were dead Branches, and grew upon a dead stock; and there was no help, nor hope
for us, till we were cut off from our own stocks: the stock of Nature; And
were ingrafted into Christ, who is the Stock of Life. Hence the Apostle. -- He
that has the Son has Life; and he that has not the Son, has not Life. He
that is united and ingrafted into Christ, has Life; the Life of Justification
here; and shall have the Life of Glorification hereafter. -- But he that has
not the Son -- He, who is not united to Christ, has not Life: Nor the Life of
Justification here: Nor the Life of Glorification hereafter. So that you see,
there is no Hope of Life, or Justification, except we be united to Christ;
who has all Life in him. There Is nothing but death in the World, out of him:
And there is no way to have Union with Christ, but by Faith, which is one bond
of our Union with Christ.

It is Faith that unites us to Christ, as Members to the Head. And being
Members of Christ, God pardons us.

If a Malefactor had committed treason against a King, and were adjudged to
lose his hand, or his eye. If he could now make his Hand, or his eye which he
were to lose, to become the Hand, or the eye of the Kings Son: He should be
spared; he should not lose them: They were the hands and the eyes of the Kings
Son: And the King would spare them for his Sons sake: So here.

We were guilty of Treason; were condemned to death. Now this is the dexterity
of Faith, to make our selves to be Members of Christ: It is Faith that does
ingraft us into Christ; whereas before we grew upon dead stocks: now being
ingrafted into the stock of Christ, the stock of Life, we have Life derived to
us.

It is Faith that marries us to Christ; and being married to him, he answers
all our debts.

It is by Faith we put on Christ, by Faith we are built on Christ, as the
House on its Foundation.

And therefore, seeing there is no way to be saved, but by our Union with
Christ. And there is no Union but by Faith. Therefore it follows, Faith is the
great requisite whereby we must be saved. That for Union.

2. For our Communion with Christ, Faith is necessary. There is no way to be
saved, but by virtue of communion with the Righteousness of Christ.

1 Not by our own; any done by us; or wrought out of our selves. This is too
short. -- A menstruous ragge. A ragge, and not able to cover us, as a Garment
too narrow for us. We cannot weave a web of Righteousness of our own, able to
cover us; we shall but add sin to sin.

2. Not by Righteousness of Saints, or Angels.

1. Theirs is incommunicable. There Is no way, whereby we should have communion
with it. They are not of our Natures, to wit, the Angels. There must be an
union of Nature, before there can be communion. Nay: But were it communicable:
yet it were insufficient. It is but a finite Righteousness, and therefore not
able to answer an infinite debt.

If the least sin did lie upon the back of the tallest Angel in Heaven, it were
not enough. All the Righteousness he has would not be enough to save him
from Hell. And therefore theirs can do us no good.

To make short of it.

There Is no way to be justified, and saved, but by Communion with the
Righteousness of Christ; the Righteousness of his active and passive obedience:
Obedientia Legis, Obedientia Crucis.

1. The one, In Precium. 2. The other, In Praemium.
By the one, answering Gods condemning Justice.

By the other, answering God commanding Justice.

By the one, satisfying his vindictive Justice, whereby he did bear our
scourges.

By the other, answering Gods remunerative Justice, whereby he did perform our
services.

Now there was no way to have Communion with this Righteousness of Christ, but
by Faith.

Faith gives us Union with Christ. And by virtue of our Union, we have
Communion with him.

As, by virtue of our Oneness with the first Adam, His sin was made ours: So,
by virtue of our Oneness with the second Adam, His Righteousness is made ours.

Faith makes us Members of Christ. Faith unites us to Christ. And, by virtue of
our Union with him, as the Members with the Head; we have derived from him
Life and Spirit, Sense and Motion.

We have communion with him, In his Wisdom to direct us; In his Righteousness
to justify us; In his Holiness to sanctify us; In his Redemption to glorify
us. -- Christ is made to us Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and
Redemption.

Faith ingrafts us into Christ, as the Branch into the Vine. And by virtue of
our ingrafture into him, we draw forth life, strength, and nourishment from
him, who is our root.

By Faith we put on Christ, and so have communion with the Robes of his
Righteousness, whereby we stand justified in Gods sight.

As Jacob got the blessing, by his elder Brothers apparel: So we by the Robes
of Christ, which are called (...): The Righteousness of Saints.

By Faith we are married to Christ; and by virtue of this marriage, we have
communion with all his Riches, as the Wife has with her Husbands Estate: And
Christ has communion with all our debts.

So that you see; Faith is that Grace, which gives us union with Christ. And,
by virtue of that union with him, we have communion with all of Christ.

It gives us communion with the Righteousness of Christ. He is -- The Lord our
Righteousness. And by Faith, it is as truly ours, to save us; as his, to
glorify him.

It gives us communion with the Life and Spirit of Christ: with the death and
sufferings of Christ; with the merits and victories of Christ; with the
privileges and immunities of Christ, as Adoption, Sonship, etc.

It gives us communion with his Wisdom, to direct us, with his Power, to
protect us, with his Mercy; to save us.

So that, As David said. -- God has sworn in his Holiness -- He had made a
Promise to him. And therefore he says -- I will rejoice. I will divide
Shechem, and mete out the Valley of Succoth. Gilead is mine: so the soul may
say, God has said, This Son of mine I have given you, Isa. 9.6. And therefore
Christ is mine.

3. Why God should make choice of this Grace for our Justification?

Not to say any thing of this, which might be one Reason. That the Remedy
might answer the Fall. The Fall was by unbeleeving. As you see, He gave credit
to the Serpent, and not to God. So God would make our Recovery by Faith. But
this we pass.

We read in Scripture of four grounds, wherefore God made choice of this Grace
for the Justification of a sinner.

1. That Justification might be of Grace, 2. That the Promise might be sure.
3. That it might be to all the seed. 4. That no man might boast.
The three former you shall read, Romans 4.16. The last, Ephesians. 2.9.

1. For the first. God made choice of this, that we should have Justification
by way of believing. That it might be by Grace. If it had been by any other
way; by reason of any thing wrought in us, or by us; If it had been by Desert,
not of Grace; of Wages, not of Mercy; of Debt, not of Favor: If God had
promised Justification upon any work of ours; had told us, we must bring so
much Humiliation, so much Repentance, so much brokenness of Spirit, so much
Grace, so many Prayers, Alms-deeds: and then we should be justified: It had
not then been of Grace, not of Free-Mercy.

And therefore God, For the advancement of his Free Grace and Mercy, that we
might cry out with them in Zach. 4.7. -- Grace, Grace. That we might see,
admire, adore, the Riches of his Grace, The height, and depth, and breadth and
length of his Free-Mercy. Therefore has God chose this way for the
Justification of a sinner.

2. That the Promise might be sure. If it had been any other way, the Promise
could not have been sure.

That which makes the Promise sure, is this.

1. That it is not founded upon any thing in us. If it were, it could never be
sure. If there were any thing besides the breast of God to be a bottom and
foundation for the Promise; It could never be sure.

2. That it is not performed, nor contrived for any thing done by us; but out
of his Free-Mercy and Love. If indeed, there had been any thing in us, which
should have been the ground of the performance of this Promise to us: we had
been lost long ago.

If God had put us upon the condition of Obedience; and had given us Grace, as
he did Adam: yet the Law is strict, requiring an exact, Personal, Universal,
and constant obedience: And every failing would have lost us, undone us for
ever.

But now, When our Righteousness is in Christ; A Righteousness not wrought by
us, but wrought by Christ himself; And freely given to us upon the alone
condition of Faith. This makes our condition sure.

3. That the Promise might be to all the seed, not to them of the Law only;
but to them who were strangers to the Law of God.

God had made a promise to be the Father of Abraham, and of his seed.

Now this Promise could not have belonged unto us, If God had not provided a
way, that we might be of his seed. Now, according to the flesh, this was
impossible: That we should be of Abraham's seed: and therefore by consequence,
we could have had no interest in this Promise.

And therefore God has made Faith to be that Grace, which makes us
spiritually to be the Seed of Abraham; that so the Promise might belong to us.

If God had made the Law the condition of the Promise: Or, if he had made the
Law and Faith together: yet then we had never come to be of Abraham's Seed:
Because we were not under the Law.

But God having made Faith the Grace, which does make us the Children of
Abraham. Hence is the Promise to us, as to his seed: not to that part which is
of the Law; but to that part which is of the Faith of Abraham -- who is the
Father of all that believe.

Though we are never so far from the Law, and the kindred of Abraham in the
flesh, yet God has provided security for us, that we might be his Children,
and be inheritors in the Promise, which is, by Faith.

Therefore God chose Faith, that the Promise might be to all the Seed, not to
the flesh only; for then we should not be of his seed; but to the Spirit.

4. The fourth Reason is, Ephesians. 2.9. That no man might boast; That is, That no
man might have cause to glory in himself, or rejoice in himself.

Now, if it had been by any other way, by any thing done by us; we should have
gloried. And therefore God chose this way, that we might glory alone in him, 1
Cor. 1.30, 31. -- That no flesh might glory in his presence: Christ is made
Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption, that he that glories,
might glory in the Lord, Isa. 45.24, 25. -- In me you shall have Righteousness
and strength, and in me you shall glory.

God is exceeding chary of his Glory. As in our Salvation, he aimed at the
manifestation of his Glory: So he has had care to bring it about in such a
way wherein there may be the Preservation of his Glory.

Now, if God had pitched it in any other way, than in the way of Believing, his
Glory could not have been preserved: we would have been sharers with God; we
should have divided the spoils of Glory with him.

And therefore God chose this, which is

A mean Grace in it self. And so his Glory shall not be obscured, but more
perspicuous, as 1 Cor. 1.

Nay, such a Grace, as does throw a man out of himself: empties a man of
himself, and casts him upon another. It is such a Grace, as makes the Soul all
in another; nothing in it self: Rich in another, poor in it self; found in
another, lost in it self: Saved by another, damned by it self. -- I live (says
Paul) yet not I, but Christ in me. I live by the Faith of the Son of God, or
Faith in the Son of God, Gal. 2.20.

It is such a Grace as makes a man stand upon another bottom: live by another
life: Rich by another riches: clothed by another Apparel: fed by another
meat. A poor beggarly grace in it self. And therefore God chose this.

It is such a Grace, as gives God all the Glory: As it was said of Abraham --
He gave glory to God by believing, Romans 4. He gave glory to his Truth, to his
Power, to his Wisdom, to his Mercy: So this Grace in the Justification of a
sinner, it gives God all the glory, it robs him not of any piece of Glory, it
gives him the glory of his Mercy, of his Truth, -- He that believes, puts to
his seal, that God is true. It sets up God, makes him Alpha and Omega, the
beginner and finisher of all. And therefore it being a Grace that honors God
above all, therefore God honors it above all other, making it the Instrument
of Justification.

And therefore, my Brethren, if ever you would have pardon from him, give him
the glory of his own Free Grace.

Here is the controversy between God and man, to this day. God is willing to
save us, if we will give him his Glory: But our proud hearts will not yield to
that, That God should be all in all.

Every man would willingly be something in himself, stand upon his own bottom.
God is willing to give us a Righteousness wrought out for us: But we would
have a Righteousness of our own making. We love the Spiders motto. -- Mihi
soli debeo. To owe nothing to any, but to our selves.

We are too like that proud Papist, who said, -- He would not have Heaven
Gratis, we would merit it.

God is willing to give us objective worthiness, worthiness in another, in
Christ. But we would have subjective worthiness: A worth in our selves. But
this will not be allowed. God will have us poor in our selves, empty in our
selves, cast out of our selves, unbottomed of our selves. He will have us
poor, and blind, and naked, before he will bestow mercy on us.

God will not have us bring our penny to his purchase: One dram to this
fullness; one shred to this garment of Christ. He will have it by Faith, that
so it might be of Grace; that not we, but he might have all the Glory.

This is one Reason I am persuaded of the enlargement of our troubles of
spirit, and breakings; Because we will not let God be all in all: we will not
let God have all the Glory. Glad we should be, to be sharers in our own
Salvation. Glad, to do something. We would have it of Debt, not of Grace; of
Works, not of Faith; of Merit, not of Mercy.

God would forgive us our deb^s, but we would pay them; we are loath to be
proclaimed Banckrupts, unable to pay. God would willingly cloathe us, but we
would make a garment of our own.

God would give us Heaven, but we would deserve it.

God would give us pardon upon believing, that so we might not glory in our
selves; but in him: But we would have it by way of working. That all, or at
least something, might be attributed to our selves.

But you see, God has aimed at the Magnifying of his own Glory: and therefore
he has chosen Faith, to be the Grace whereby we should be Justified. And
if ever you would be justified, if ever you would have Glory, give him Glory.

4. The fourth thing at first propounded to be cleared, was, How Faith
justifies.

For the clearer answer whereto, we will lay down these two Distinctions.

1 Faith may be considered,

1. Either formally, as an inherent Grace of God in us.

2 Or instrumentally, as that whereby we receive Christ. In the first sense it
has nothing to do with Justification.

The Papist, because we deny Faith to justify in respect of its own
worthiness, say that we make it titulum sine re, as it were a matter of
nothing, whereas in respect of Justification, we acknowledge it the only
instrument, and that is much to be said of it.

2 Faith is considered,

1. Either absolutely as a Habit, or Act of ours.

2. Or Relatively, as it has relation to Christ, and makes us one with him.

In the former sense again it has nothing to do with Justification, but in the
second sense as it is related to Christ, and brings us over to Christ, so it is
said to justify us, because it brings us to him, by whom we are justified,
Act. 13.39. By him (speaking of Christ) all that believe are justified; by him,
but not by Faith absolutely, but only as relating to him.

Indeed we are said to live by Faith, as well as by Christ, Gal. 2.20. to have
remission of sins by Faith, Act. 10.43. as well as by Christ, Ephesians. 1.7. to
be justified by Faith, Romans 3.28. as well as by Christ, Isa. 53.11. to have
peace with God by Faith, Romans 5.1. as well as by Christ, Col. 1.20. to be
sanctified by Faith, Act. 15.9. as well as by Christ, 1 Cor. 1.30. to overcome
the World by Faith, 1 John 5.4, 5. as well as by Christ, John 16.33.

To be the Sons of God by Faith, Gal. 3.26. as well as by Christ, Ephesians. 1.5.
to have eternal life, and to be saved by Faith, John 5.24. Ephesians. 2.8. as well
as by Christ, Math. 1.21. John 3.17. 1 John 5.11.

But now you must consider that none of these are spoken of Faith absolutely
considered, as either an Habit or Act of ours, but only relatively, as Faith
brings us to Christ, and makes us one with him, by whom alone we are
justified, adopted, sanctified, etc. for between Christ and Faith there is such
a Relation, that as Justifying Faith is called the Faith of Christ, or Faith in
Christ, or Faith in his blood, so again the Righteousness of Christ, by which
we are justified, is called the Righteousness of Faith.

And so we conclude this point, that Faith does not justify as absolutely
considered in it self, but relatively, as it has relation to Christ the
object, and as it brings the soul over to him, makes us one with him, by whom
we are justified, have remission of sins, salvation, etc.

5 What are the Royalties and Privileges of Faith? First Royalty.
1. Royalty of Faith. Its an heart-clearing Grace.
1. Faith is an heart-clearing Grace.

When we are under the guilt of sin, Faith does justify us. And it is one of
the Royalties of Faith, one of the Peculiars of Faith. that Faith alone does
justify: As the Apostle, Romans 3.28. -- Therefore we conclude, that a man is
justified by Faith, without the deeds of the Law And this Faith clears the
heart of the guilt of sin.

1. By procuring a sufficient Play Master; Christ, who has satisfied Gods
Justice to the full; answered all Bills, Bonds; paid our debt to the utmost
farthing. Hence, John 16.10. -- I will send the Spirit, and he shall convince
the World of Righteousness; because I go to my Father, and you shall see me no
more; -- That is; he shall convince the World, That Perfect Righteousness is
wrought for them. That Gods Justice is completely satisfied. But how shall we
know that? Because -- I go to my Father, and you shall see me no more. -- That
is, you shall see me no more in this kind, you shall see me no more to come
to suffer, or satisfy for sin; for I have done that already, I have completely
satisfied Gods Justice for sin. And therefore you shall see me no more in this
kind.

Indeed, If Justice had not been completely satisfied: If there had been but
one sin upon the file unsatisfied for, we should have seen him again. Heaven
could not have held him. But now seeing he is gone, and we see him no more an
humbled, a suffering-Saviour; this shows all is done.

To this I might add, Col. 2.14. -- He has blotted out the hand writing of
Ordinances, that was against us, which was contrary to us, and has taken it
out of the way, and nailed it to his Cross. -- where, by handwriting of
Ordinances, is not meant the Ceremonial-Law only; but whatever did bind us
over to the Curse: whatever did bind us over to death. -- All which Christ
has removed by his death.

And the Apostles Gradation is observable here. In the 13th. verse he had set
down, that our sins were forgiven. -- Yea, but that is not enough, may some
say. Though the debt be discharged, yet the writing is to show. -- No, says
the Apostle. The Handwriting of Ordinances is blotted out. -- But, may some
say again; it is not so blotted out, so defaced, but it may be read, and put
in suit again; a new quarrel may arise. No, says the Apostle, -- It is taken
away. Oh! But (you will say) it is not so taken away, but as it is laid aside
for a time: it may be produced hereafter. No, says the Apostle, there is no
fear of that -- it is nailed to the Cross; it is torn in pieces, it shall never
be seen again; never shall a new quarrel arise for the same. Christ has not
only paid the debt, but canceld, and torn in pieces whatever might witness or
testify* against us.

If a Debtor did know his Debt were answered; yet if he have his Bonds and
Bills uncalled in; he is still in fear: But, when he has all things which
acknowledged his debt, crossed, torn in pieces, made utterly void; then he is
safe, he knows there is a discharge.

Why Christ did not only discharge our debt, but defaced and abolished all such
things, as made acknowledgement of our debt; he left nothing, that might
witness against us untaken away.

And this is the first way whereby Faith does clear us; viz. by producing, and
bringing forth Christ, who has cleared all, who is called a Suerty, Heb. 7.22.
Not only in passing his word for us; but paying the Debt for us, answering all,
and cancelling all, that was against us. But Faith does not clear us only by
producing of a sufficient Play Master, but

2. By making us one with Christ, by which this payment is ours; is all for us.
So that we may say with Ambrose -- Pro me natus, pro me vixit, pro me mortuus.
Faith will say, he was born for me; he lived for me; he dyed for me: for
me he fulfilled all Righteousness, satisfying both Gods Commanding, and his
Condemning Justice; doing my services, bearing my scourges. Hence he is
called, Jehovah Tsidkenu. The Lord our Righteousness: by Faith having communion
with this Righteousness, as if it were our own; a Righteousness wrought by us.
Hence Job 33.26 -- God shall render to man his Righteousness; that is the
Righteousness of Christ, which is called ours by Faith, and is as much ours to
justify and save us, as His, to glorify him. Hence the Apostle, Romans 8.1. --
There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ; that is, to such as are
Believers: for they are all one. And why no condemnation? They are sinners as
well as others. It Is true, they are. And therefore the Apostle does not say --
There is nothing worthy of condemnation in them: But -- There is no
condemnation: Because Christ has taken away the guilt, and condemning power of
sin; he has answered all our debts, canceld all Books, satisfied for all our
sins, which did bind us over to condemnation, and wrath of God. So that we
may say, -- There is no condemnation to such.

As for the Law, it cannot condemn us; because we appeal from the law to the
Gospel, from the Court of Justice, to the Court of Mercy* So that the Law has
nothing to do with us.

And, as for the Gospel, that cannot condemn us; because we are Believers. The
Gospel does not require what sinners we have been, what sins we are guilty
of: but whether the appealer do believe; whether we be Believers or no, which
being once cleared, we are justified.

You see this in the poor Publican. He was dragged forth into the Court of
Justice, and was there cast: Yet the sentence took no hold of him, because of
his appeal to the Throne of Grace, the Court of Mercy, where by Faith pleading
nothing but Gods Mercy, and his own misery -- God be merciful to me a sinner:
he went away justified, says the Text, Luke 18.14.

And this is the first Royalty of Faith.

It is an Heart-clearing-Grace, which it does, by producing one, who has
cleared all, and by making us one with him, in all he has done, giving us an
interest in all.

Second Royalty.
Second Royalty of Faith. Its an Heart-cleansing-Grace.
2. Faith is an Heart-cleansing-Grace; An Heart-purifying, and purging-Grace.
Hence Act. 15.9. it is said -- Their hearts were purified by Faith. Faith opens
a way for a stream of blood to run through the soul, whereby the soul is
washed, not from the guilt of sin only; but from the filth of sin also. -- The
Blood of Christ does cleanse us from all sin, -- not only from the guilt, but
from the filth of sin. -- Hence the Apostle, -- If the blood of Bulls and
Goats, and the ashes of an Heifer sprinkled upon the unclean did purify the
Flesh: How much more shall the Blood of Christ (who; through the Eternal
Spirit, offered himself without spot) purge and cleanse our Consciences from
all dead works, to serve the living God? Heb. 9.13, 14.

And Faith does cleanse the Heart, 1. Argumentatively. 2. Operatively.


1. Argumentatively; By way of Argument, where in Faith takes up Arguments, 1.
From God. 2. From our selves.
From God, and that

1. From his Nature. He is an holy God; and therefore he will have an holy
People. A pure God; and therefore he will have a pure People. Hence Lev.
11.44. -- Ye shall be Holy; for I am Holy. I the Lord your God am Holy. The
like, Lev. 19.2. And Peter urges the same, 1 Pet. 1.15, 16. -- As he which has
called you is Holy: so be ye Holy in all manner of Conversation; For it is
written; Be ye Holy, for I am Holy.

2. From his Mercies, 1. In Redeeming us. 2. In calling us. 3. In Justifying
us. 4. In promising to glorify us.


1. In Redeeming us. Has Christ dyed for me, and shall not I live to him;
Has he shed his Blood for me, that I should be Holy and clean? And shall I
delight in uncleanness, Pro me filius Dei jugulatus.
and filthiness? was he slain for me? and shall I delight in sin? Has he
suffered so much to purify me? and shall I be unclean still? has he done
so much to wash me? and shall I be filthy still?

2. In calling us, 1 Pet. 1, 15, 16. -- As he which has called you is Holy:
so be you Holy in all manner of Conversation, it is an holy Calling, 2 Timothy
1.9. that calls us to Holiness, and Faith; a purged ear, that hearkeneth to
that call.

3. In Justifying us. Has he freed me from the damning Nature of sin? and
shall I delight in the defiling nature of sin? has he freed me from the guilt
of sin? and shall I love the filth of sin? Has he done so much to wash me?
and shall I be filthy still? Has he suffered so much to purify me? and
shall I delight in uncleanness still? Has he made me a Member of Christ? and
shall I be a filthy Member of so holy a Body? Has he made me a Branch? and
shall I be a polluted-Branch of so holy a Stock? Has he lifted up the light
of his Countenance on me? and shall I ever countenance sin? has he smiled on
me? and shall I ever smile upon sin?

4. In Promises to glorify us, 2 Cor. 7.1. -- Having therefore such precious
promises, let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness both of Flesh and
Spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God. -- As if he had said -- Seeing
God has been so merciful, and gracious to us, to make us precious Promises,
let this put us on self-purging, and self-purifying. Thou look for an
holy-Heaven, and will thou not be holy? Thou hopest for Salvation; and will thou not purify thy self? -- He that has this Hope, purifies himself, as God
is Pure, 1 John 3.3.

Thus does Faith take up Arguments from God, his Nature, his Mercies.

2. It takes Arguments from our selves, 1. From the necessity of being
cleansed. 2. From the convenience thereof.


1 From the Necessity: Because otherwise, we can have no assurance of
Justification. They who are freed from the guilt of sin, are freed from the
filth of sin. They who partake of the Blood of Christ for pardon, partake of
the water of Christ, to purge. -- Christ came by Water and Blood. They who will
have him a Redeemer, must have him also a Refiner, to take away their Swini^h
nature, to wash them inwardly; not outwardly: for so may a Swine be.

2. Because otherwise we can never have Assurance of Salvation. -- They who
look for new Heavens must have new hearts. They who look for Glory, must have
Grace: First Grace, then Glory. -- For without Holiness no man can see the
Lord. -- No unclean thing shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven -- he that
has this hope, will fit himself for the Place, he will labor to be a pure
person; as he desires to enjoy a pure place. -- Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God. A pure God, a pure Heaven, a pure Place, requires a
pure Person.

2. The Convenience: This is fully made out in the necessity of it; and that
with an advantage, there is such a convenience, as that it rises up to a
necessity in all the former particulars; so that to an holy heart there is a
moral impossibility of the contrary. How can I do this great wickedness, and
sin against God, said Joseph? Genesis 39.9.

This is the first way of Faiths purifying the Heart, -- Argumentative -- or by
way of Argument.

2. Operative. As Faith does operate and work for the cleansing of our nature,
making use of Christ, who is called A Fountain, Zach. 13.1. A Refiner, Mal.
3.3. A Purger, Joh. 15.2.


He is said to come with Refiners fire, with Fullers Soap, to purge and
purify us. And thus Faith makes use of Christ, by the least touch of whom, the
sinful flux of sin is dried up and staid. And Faith makes use.

1. Of the Merit of Christ; the Blood of Christ; which is apt to purge us, and
cleanse us from sin. And for this end was his Blood shed, even to cleanse us
from sin, Tit. 2.14. -- He gave himself, (not only to be a Redeemer, to
redeem us from Hell, and the guilt of sin: but) to purify to himself a
peculiar people, zealous of good works, Ephesians. 5.26, 27. -- He gave himself
for us that he might sanctify us, and cleanse us by the washing of Water,
through the Word.

So Faith makes use of this Fountain, to wash and cleanse the soul; it opens
this Fountain to the washing of the soul.

2. It makes use of the Prayer of Christ, John 17.17. -- Sanctify them through
the Truth; thy Word is Truth.

3. Faith makes use of the Promise of Christ; wherein his Fidelity and Truth is
engaged for our Purification, Jer. 33.8. I will cleanse them from all their
iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, Ezekiel. 33.25. -- I will
sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your
filthiness; and from all your Idols will I cleanse you, Isa. 4.4. -- The Lord
shall wash away the filth of the Daughter of Zion, and purge away the blood of
Jerusalem from the midst thereof. Hence they are called Purging-Promises.

Thus Faith makes use of Christ, of the Merit of Christ, of the Blood of
Christ, of the Prayer and Promise of Christ; whereby it sets on the work of
Self-cleansing; whereby it purifies the soul: By virtue of which it washes the
soul from all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, 2 Cor. 7.1.

Third Royalty. Faith is a Heart-commanding Grace.
Christ's Viceroy here in the Soul, which Governs, Rules, Third Royalty Faith.
Its an Heart-commanding-Grace.
and bears sway in the soul, by virtue of the power and Scepter of Christ.
Christ has made Faith his Deputy here in the Soul, and not any other Grace but
Faith. He knows Faith will rule by Christ, by his power, not its own: So Rule,
as not to wrest the Scepter out of Christ's hand: It will rule for Christ, and
to Christ: for his Glory, and to his Glory, not its own: and therefore he has
given Faith jurisdiction in the Soul. So that it is a Soul-commanding Grace: It
is the Taskmaster of the Soul, puts every Grace upon its work, and burden: It
will not suffer any Grace to be idle, but puts every Grace to its work.

Nay, it inableth the Soul to Do, what it Commands the Soul to Do.

To every Precept we have still a Promise. Nay, every Precept is a Promise.

Where God Commands us to Repent and Believe: to make our selves new hearts; to
wash and cleanse our selves; to circumcise our hearts; He has promised in his
new Covenant to do what he has commanded; to give us Faith; to work
Repentance in us; to make us new hearts; to circumcise the heart; to wash and
cleanse us from our filthiness.

And Faith urging the Precepts of God, makes use of the Promises of God: sues
out the Promise, and fetches strength from the Promise, to perform the Precept.
-- Lord, thou have commanded me to make me a new heart: and thou have
promised to take this stony heart from me, and to give me an heart of Flesh.
Lord, perform thy Promise to thy Servant, in which thou made me put my
trust. Thou command me to be Holy, and thou have promised to make me
holy: Thou art the Lord, that Sanctifies. Lord, make me Holy. -- Da quod
jubes, and jube quod vis: sic enim implebitur voluntas tua, and obedientia
nostra: give what thou command, and command what thou will: and so both our
obedience and thy Will shall be fulfilled.

Thus you see; as God, so Faith ruling by God, from God, does not only
authoritatively impose commands, and lay duties upon the soul, but mercifully
and friendly helps and inables the soul to do what is commanded.

It is not a Rigid-Master, -- Reaping where it sows not; commanding fruit from
that ground whereon it sows no seed: but sows strength to reap Obedience:
inables to do what is commanded to do.

It is said -- by Faith Abraham obeyed. Faith did enable him to obey; and made
his obedience fruitful, and acceptable. Faith enabled him to obey, even in
that great act of Obedience; when his Son, his only Son, the Son of his Love,
the Son of the Promise, the Son of his Old Age, etc. was to be taken away by
death, killed, murdered, and that by his own hands, etc. And yet Faith enabled
him hereunto.

Fourth Royalty, Faith is an Heart-quieting Grace, an Heart-calming and
stilling-Grace.
It is a Grace they lays all the tumults in the Soul: all the insurrections in
the Soul. Fourth Royalty of Faith. Its an Heart-quieting-Grace.
When Passions are up, and unruly Affections do stir, Faith does allay and hush
them. When Passions of Fear are up, Faith lays them; will not suffer unruly
fears to come into the Throne, to command the Soul.

When Passions of Anger are up, Faith does quench their heat: when Grief stirs,
Faith does bridle and moderate this: when Discontent is up, and the Soul is
ready to murmur and quarrel against God, and his dealings; Faith does lay all
these risings. Faith has a special art to still the Soul, to strike it dumb in
these cases. Hence you see David. -- I was dumb, and opened not my mouth,
because it was thy doing. -- Faith struck him dumb.

We read indeed Zachary was dumb; but Infidelity struck him dumb. -- David
says here -- he was dumb, but Faith struck him dumb. The former was a
Penal-dumbness: God silenced his Tongue, because he suspended his Faith: But
this latter was a dutiful-Dumbness; such a Dumbness as Faith has caused in the
Soul; which shut up his lips, from murmuring, not from praying, Psalm. 39.9. he
prays there, -- I was dumb, and opened not my mouth; and yet -- Take thy
Plague from me, I am consumed by the stroke of thy hand, etc.

The like power of Faith you see in the case of Aaron, when it silenced his
Soul, in such a sad condition, Levit. 10.3, 4. -- And Moses said unto him, This
is that, the Lord said, etc. And Aaron held his peace. Why, what was his trial?
why it was the loss of his Sons, the loss of his Eldest Sons, when they were
young, and without posterity; in the first day of their Ministration; in the
sight of all the Congregation, and by so fearful a Judgment, as fire from the
Lord; and in the act of their sin, offering strange fire: Nay, and which (some
think) was joined with Drunkenness too: whereupon immediately follows the
prohibition of Wine. So that the Congregation might suspect, they went but from
fire to fire; from a destruction by fire, to a preservation in fire; from a
temporal, to an eternal burning.

Yet now in all this mark the Power of Faith. Moses having declared the Author
God; the cause, their sin: It Is said, Aaron was dumb, and held his peace:
Audita voluntate Dei silet: having heard the Will of God, he was mute and
silent; his Tongue was chained up, hereby confessing, says Calvin, Justo Dei
Judicio extinctos esse: That they were slain by the Just Judgment of God.

The like you see in Eli, when Samuel had declared what God had said to him
concerning the destruction of his house: why, says he, -- It is the Lord, let
him do what pleases him, 1 Samuel 3.18.

And remarkable was that in Job. -- You may read in the first Chapter, how one
wave came upon the neck of another.

1. The Sabeans fell upon his Oxen, and his Asses, and slew his Servants.

2. Another comes and tells him, -- Fire from Heaven had burnt up his Sheep.

3. A third tells him, -- The Caldeans had taken away his Camels.

4. A fourth he comes and tells him, -- His Sons and his Daughters were eating
and drinking, and a wind blew down the house on their heads; and buried them
all in one grave. His whole stock was lost in one day. Nay, He lost not his
stock of Cattle only, but of his Children also.

My Brethren these were great trials, enough to put a man out of patience;
enough to make the most composed man besides himself: To lose his goods, his
Cattle, his Substance, and all in a day: Nay, to lose his Sons and his
Daughters, which were his whole Posterity, the stay and hope of his Family: yea
and all at once, at one clap: and that so suddenly; yea, and in the midst of
their merriments.

These were great Trials: where Yesterday it might have been said, who so rich
as Job? now to day, who so poor as Job?

Yet mark here now the Power of Faith; how it silenced the Soul. In stead of
murmuring, he fell down, and worshipped and said, The Lord has given, the Lord
has taken away. Blessed be the Name of the Lord. Thus you see the Power of
Faith.

And, my Brethren, you had need of Faith. As the Apostle said of Patience: So I
of Faith: -- You have need of Faith. As you walk in the way of this life, you
shall meet with such things as will move you, as will put you besides your
selves: If Faith do not settle and compose you; you cannot be undique sursum
(like a Dye) light upon your square: if Faith be not your bottom.

You may have crosses and losses before you die. You may lose your Husbands,
your Wives, your Children, your Goods. Jobs lot may befall you.

And every one of these may cause a man to rise up against himself, may cause
an uproar in the Soul. We are not Stoics, we are not without Passions, nor
sinfull-Passions, mutinous-Affections: And therefore we had need of something
in the Soul to sway and keep down these unruly distempers. And this is only
Faith which can still, and calm the soul in all storms, and tempests.

A man without Faith in such a case as this, is like a naked man in a storm;
like an unarmed man in a battle; like a Ship unballanced, and unanchored in a
Tempest. A man without Faith is under no command. Passions of Anger, Fear,
Grief, and all command him. And Passion without Faith is violent, breaks down
all banks, drowns, overwhelms, and destroies the Soul. And therefore you had
need of something to balance the Soul, to charge the Soul, to calm and still
the Soul, in such a condition.

Now you see Faith is an Heart-calming, an Heart-quieting, and stilling-Grace;
which it does after this manner.

1. Imperiously. 2. Perswasively.
1. Sometimes Imperiously; and that either 1. Commanding, or 2. Checking the
Soul.


1 Imperiously commanding the Soul. Laying charge on the Soul to be quiet, to
be still. -- My Soul, be silent to Jehovah, said David.

As Christ did the Waters and the Wind. -- Peace, and be still, and there was
a great calm: So here, when the Waves are up, and threaten to overflow the
banks, to overwhelm the soul; Faith lays her command upon the soul. -- Peace,
and be still. No more words. Leave your murmurings. Leave your impatiency.
Thus sometimes Faith calms the soul.

2. Imperiously checking the the soul. -- You do not well to be angry. You do
not well to grieve. You do not well to be discontented, to be impatient. You
offend God, cause him to scourge you more, to lay more load upon you; seeing
you bear this so impatiently.

As the Town Clerk of Ephesus stilled that uproar with these words, Act. 19.40.
-- We shall verily be called in question for this days uproar, seeing there
is no cause can be given-of this concourse: So Faith does sometimes lay the
tumults in the soul. -- You shall verily be called in question one day, for
this Passion, this Discontent, this Murmuring, this Uproar: seeing no cause can
be given, that you should quarrel with God, as you do.

2. Faith does sometimes calm the Soul, in a Mild, and perswasive-way; wherein
it reasons with the Soul -- Why art thou so much cast down, oh, my Soul! Why
art thou so troubled! so disquieted within me! In which reasoning, Faith will
take an Argument of Patience.

1. From the Author of Afflictions. That is God. Afflictions, troubles arise
not out of the dust, but from God, which was the ground of David's patience. --
I was dumb, etc. Because it was thy doing. So of Jobs, -- The Lord has given,
the Lord has taken away. So in case of Shimei his cursing David. David did not
bite at the stone, and never mind the thrower: but he looks up; discovers the
hand, as well as the stone. -- Let him alone. It may be God has bid him go
forth, and curse David.

2. Sometimes from the ground of Gods dealings; and that is sin. Faith
produces sin to be the cause. For this cause; and this stops the mouth. Psalm.
51. That thou may be just when thou judge. This lays a Soul in the dust;
makes a man accept of the punishment of his iniquity. As you have the phrase,
Levit. 26.41. That is, lie down, justify God, clear God in all his dealings:
be so far from murmuring, that the Soul will take Gods part in all; clearing
God, and condemning it self.

Thus you see the Church -- Wherefore does a living man complain? A man for the
punishment of his sin? -- it is his mercy that we are not consumed.

Thus Faith brings to remembrance our sins. Such a time: such a place, etc.

It lays the finger on the sore place, discovers the cause, which causes a man
to make himself the subject of Gods anger: and turns a man's anger against
himself.

This was some ground of David's patience; when Shimei cursed. -- Go up thou
Bloody man. -- It made him smell his own sin, his Blood, and so became patient.

3. Sometimes from the end of Gods dealings.

1. In general. And that is for good; though it be not bonum, yet it is in
bonum: Though it be not good, yet it is for good. It is a Chastising-mercy:
not in vindictive-Justice.

There is a Misericordia-puniens: and there is a Justitia-parcens* A
punishing-Mercy, and a sparing-Justice.

As God does exercise his Sparing-Justice toward the wicked, when he suffers
them to go on in sin; and does not punish them, as we read, Hos. 4 14. -- I
will not punish your Daughters when they commit Whoredom; nor your Spouses,
when they commit Adultery. the like, Ezekiel. 16.42. -- I will cause my fury
toward thee to rest, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry. Upon
which one says, -- Solo auditu tremisco; I tremble at the very hearing. For,
if God will correct no more, then he will destroy next. This is a
Sparing-Justice. And, as God does exercise this toward the wicked: so he
exercises a punishing-mercy toward the good. Hence the Apostle, 1 Cor. 11.32.
-- We are chastised of the Lord, that we might not be condemned with the
World. -- That we may not be condemned with the World, He suffers the World
to condemn us. That we may not love the World; he suffers the World to hate
us. That we may be crucified to the World; he suffers the World to crucify
us. Therefore we meet with Crcrosses, with abuses in the World, because he
will not have us perish with the World.

God takes liberty to chastise our carcasses, to heal our consciences: to
afflict our bodies, to save our souls. And we have oftentimes occasion to
bless God more for crosses, than for comforts.

As there is a curse hid in the best things to the wicked: so there is a
blessing hid in the worst things to the Godly. There is a blessing in sickness,
a blessing in crosses, in losses, etc.

Hence, -- All his ways are ways of mercy. His correcting, and comforting
ways: His scourging and solacing ways. The ways of health, and the ways of
sickness; ways of prosperity, and ways of adversity. All are in Mercy -- All
things shall work together for good unto them that love God.

Thus in the general, Faith does clear to the soul, whereby it does possess the
Soul with patience under any evil, and lays the tumults and quarrels of the
Soul.

2. In particular, Faith discovers at what end God aims.

1. It may be the trial and exercise of our Graces; as in Job.

2. It may be for the Destruction of sin, and ruin thereof. Either Pride,
Worldly-mindedness, Adherency to the Creature, with many more. To humble us, to
wean us, to win us, to make us more thankful, with many such ends. All which
discovered and cleared by Faith to the Soul, do exceedingly calm and still the
heart in every condition.

Fifth Royalty. 5. Faith is a Soul-Securing-Grace.
It is such a Grace that does shelter and secure the Soul from all evil. Hence,
5. Faith is a Soul-securing Grace.
Prove. 29.25. -- They who trust in the Lord shall be safe, or, shall be
lifted up on high, (as the word signifies) above men, above the World, above
all storms, above all troubles; shall be set out of danger, out of Gunshot.

As Noah's Ark was carried above all waters; So Faith shall carry the Soul above
all dangers. He that trusts shall be safe. So that you see Faith is an
Heart-securing-Grace. We may sit down securely under the shadow of Faith.

It is a Soul-Securing-Grace. Nothing else will secure you but believing. Build
as many Towers of succor as you can; Raise up as many Castles of strength, as
your provisions will reach: yet all these are but Castles in the Air; there is
no foundation for them, nor shelter in them. Beat, and cast out as many Anchors
as you can; yet you will but Anchor on the waves; you shall never find a
bottom to rest on, to secure your souls from trouble.

All the provisions in the Creature; All that thy power, thy Policy can do, and
find out, will not compass thee with safety, if thou do not trust. There is
nothing does secure the Soul, and set the Soul out of danger; but a
Resolved-Trust. And no Trust, but a Trust in God.

1. Not a Trust in Riches. -- The Rich man's wealth is his strong City: but it is
so in his conceit only; it is weak.

2. Not a Trust in Friends. -- Deceitful Friends Job calls them. -- Waters that
fail -- as Jeremy calls them. But -- broken Walls, and tottering Fences, as the
Psalmist styles them, Psalm. 62.3.

3. Not a Trust in Princes. If any could secure the Soul, one would think they
might; but these cannot. Psalm. 62. throughout, Psalm. 146.3, 4. Prove. 10.15.
Nahum. 3.12, 13. We read the Children of Israel would trust in the shadow of
Egypt. Egypt was a Wel-spread-Tree, it promised security under her boughs, and
branches; but it could not; there was no security, Jer. 2.37. God threatens he
would reject their confidences, and they should not prosper thereby.

So that no Trust, but a Trust in God will compass the Soul with safety, and
this will; it is an Heart-Securing-Grace.

1. It sets a man upon a Soul-Security-Bottom; which is God himself; Christ
himself. This is that Bottom David cried to be set upon. -- Set me upon the
Rock, that is higher than I. Why one would have thought, David had been secure
enough upon his own Bottom; He had a good bottom to stand on, if there be one
in the World. He was a King, and had provisions for safety. If any man might
be secure, then he. But he sees he could not be secure in himself.

-- His feet began to sink: And therefore cries out for a better bottom. Oh! Set
me upon the Rock, that is higher than I.

Time was, a Man was his own bottom: A bottom to himself; But it was but a
Sandy-bottome. Even in his Innocence there was no Security in it. But now God
has appointed our Bottom to be out of our selves, and to be in him. And
therefore our conditions are secure: the Soul that stands on this bottom, is
safe, is secure.

This Christ sets down in the Parable of the Horse built upon a Rock; that is,
upon himself. Though The winds blow, the waves and billows beat; yet there is
no danger of our fall. -- We stand upon a Rock.

Why, but may not a Weak and Tottering house be built upon a strong
foundation? And what is it then the surer for the Foundation? It may be blown
down, though the foundation be never so strong. Yea, But no Christ is such a
Rock, as does derive virtue and strength unto the structure and building.

Indeed a man may build a weak house upon a strong foundation, and the house
fall for all that: because the rock is a dead thing; and cannot impart any of
its strength unto the structure.

But it is not so here. Be the building never so weak: yet this Rock can hold
it up: because it diffuseth its strength into the building. Hence 1 Pet. 2.4,
5. Christ is called a living, not a dead, Rock -- A living stone. -- To whom
coming as to a living Stone, we also as lively-stones are built up a
spiritual house. Which shows the transformation of the building into the nature
and firmness of the Rock.

Thus you see, Faith is a soul-securing-grace.

It sets a man upon a soul-securing-bottome. It makes God our security, who is
called, The strong-God. The mighty-God. The Rock of Refuge. A defense. A
Shield. A Tower. A Fort. An High-place, Mich. 4.8. The Tower of his Flock. The
strong hold of the daughter of Sion. A Covert from the storm, Isay 32.1, 2.


Faith makes All-God our security. It ingages all-God to be our security.

His Power. And is not this able to secure us? His Wisdom. And will not this
secure us? His Truth. And will not this secure us? His Mercy. And cannot all
this secure us?
He, who trusts in the Lord, Mercy shall compass him on every side: He is
hemmed in with Mercy. Or mercy imbraceth him on every side, to secure him.

As trust does compass mercy: so mercy does compass trust. As trust imbraceth
mercy: so mercy imbraceth trust.

It is not Faith it self, that does secure us: But Faith does make God our
security. It sets a man upon a soul-securing-bottome: on a soul-securing-God:
on a soul-securing-Power, on a soul-securing-Mercy. Therefore needs must a
Believing, a Trusting-soul be secure.

2. It instates the soul, in soul-securing-promises. The promises of
preservation from trouble. Promises of Deliverance out of trouble.

All the promises, which God has made of Security. Faith instates the soul
into them all.

He has promised -- When we pass through the waters he will be with us, and
the waters shall not overflow us; When we pass through the fire; the flame
shall not kindle upon us, Isa. 43.2.

He has promised -- He will stand at our right hand, and we shall not be
moved, -- Psalm. 16. -- He will never leave us, neither forsake us, -- Heb.
13.6. -- The Gates of Hell shall never prevail against us, Mat. 16.18.

He has promised to be a Tower, a Rock, a Refuge, a Covert from a storm, an
hiding place in time of Danger, etc. And it is faith, that does instate us,
into these Soul-securing-Promises.

As there is no promise to us, till we believe: so, if once we believe, all
the Promises are ours.

Look into the word of God: and what promises soever there are made for
securing the soul; All these are thine.

3. Faith does instate us into soul-securing-Priviledges.

1 It makes us the Sons and Daughters of God, John. 1.12, 13 -- As man as
received him, to them he gave power, or privilege, to become the Sons of God:
Even to as many as believed in his name, -- Gal. 3.26. You are the children of
God by faith in Christ. And will not a father secure his child?

2. Faith makes us the Spouse of Christ, the members of Christ. It ingrafts us,
and unites us into him. And will he not secure his members.

3. It make us the inheritance of Christ. He has promised to be a Tower to
his Flock. A strong-hold to the Daughters of Sion, These are all
soul-securing-priviledges: And therefore believing souls shall be secure.

Oh! Then, Would you be secured from the evil-day? would you be secured in
the evil day? Labor for Faith. This alone secures the soul. It sets a man upon
a soul-securing-bottome; Instates a man in soul-securing-promises; Gives him
right to soul-securing-priviledges.

Abrogate fears, Surrogate Faith, Down with fears, which betray the succor of
the soul, and set up believing.

Sixth Royalty. 6 Faith is an heart-humbling Grace.
6 Royalty of Faith. Its a soul-humbling Grace.
Whether it be a Legal, or whether it be an Evangelical- Faith, it works
humiliation. The one a Legal humiliation, and casting down: The other an
Evangelical-humiliation; we shall in this chiefly deal with the first.

It is said of Ahab, that he humbled himself, put on sackcloath, and went
softly. And this was the fruit and effect of his Legal-Faith, whereby he
believed the truth, and certainty of Gods Judgments denounced against him, and
his house. The men of Nineveh, when Jonah preached that sad Sermon. Jonah 3.4.
-- Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be destroyed -- It is said -- They
believed God; That is, The truth of that message, which Jonah brought from God.
And it follows, as an effect of this Faith -- They humbled themselves, and
proclaimed a fast, and put on Sackcloth, and sat in ashes, from the King
upon the Throne, to the meanest of them.

And my Brethren, Faith has a great influence into the work of self-humbling.

1 It takes up self-humbling Considerations.

From God, the justice of God, the threatenings, the curses God has denounced
against sin.

2. Faith does Realize all this to the Soul, which God has said against sin.
Faith does not make these things more real, then they are: but does Realize
things to the Soul, not imaginary, but real things, which, being looked upon as
real things, do humble.

This is the Reason, why one, when he hears of Gods threatenings denounced
against Sin; goes home, and lies in the dust; is humbled, and cast down; as
Josiah, when he read the book of the Law. And another stands up, out-faceth
Hell, and the curse; He is never humbled; nor cast down. It is because the one
he looks upon these things are real; and true: the other he looks upon them,
as fancies, Imaginary things.

If men believed, that all that evil, which God has threatened against Sin,
were true, they could not drink down sin as water, nor eat the bread of Sin,
with such delight, as they do.

If the swearer did believe, there were a flying Roll gone out against him, as
Zachary says. If the Drunkard did see death in the Pot, etc. If I say, wicked
men believed the Reality and Truth of these things; they could not go on so
quietly in their wicked courses: but would be humbled.

Hence the Apostle sets this down for the ground, why the Preaching of the word
was not profitable to them. -- Because it was not mixed with Faith in them that
heard it. They did not believe what they heard: and so neither the word of
Terror, nor the word of Comfort did profit them.

As the promises of God are not quickening, raising, comforting, except there
be Faith: so the Threats are not Killing, humbling, working, if Faith be not
there.

We may preach, till our spirits fail, and spend our labor in vain, our
strength and pains for naught, if the things which God speaks, and we preach,
be not believed.

If you by unbelief, do slight all the threats of God denounced against sin, if
you make child's play of them, as the word signifies, 2 Pet. 3.3.

If you look upon these but as Bug-bears, things to keep men in awe, and not
real things: No marvel if you be not Humbled.

But, if by Faith you would Realize these things to your selves, and behold
them not as Fancies, and sad dreams, but such things as are infallibly true,
real things, not as painted Hell, painted fire, but as real: you would them
find them to work; These mingled with Faith, would lay a man in the dust. Now
this is a property of Faith, to Realize the Object, or thing believed; and
hence comes an influence on the soul, to humble and abase it.

3 Faith does not only take up humbling Considerations, and Realizeth all these
to the Soul. But Faith makes all this present. Faith does give a present being
to all this. Hence Heb. 11.13. Faith imbraceth the promise. The word is (...).
-- Faith kisseth the promise; gives a present being to the promise.

And as it gives a present being to the promise, or word of comfort: so to the
threatening and word of terror. Faith discovers death and hell, and all at hand
for Sin. Faith looks upon sin, in all it is Doomes-day apparel, and array:
smells fire and Brimstone in sin.

Whereas unbeleevers, they look on these things at the wrong end of the
Prospective, and that makes things near, seem a far off, and that afar off, is
not seen at all.

But Faith looks upon them through the right end of the prospective; And there
things a far off, are seen at hand, present. Hence it is called -- The Evidence
of things not seen. As it was said of Abraham -- He saw the day of Christ, and
rejoiced: and yet Abraham was dead many hundred of years before Christ: yet by
virtue of his prospective, by virtue of his Faith, he saw it, as if it had
been present, though it were never so far off: So here though the second day of
Christ, the day of judgment be a far off; yet Faith sees it, and is humbled;
Faith gives it a present Being.

4. Faith applies and brings home all this to Soul. As the word of Comfort, the
Promise is applied, and brought home to the Soul by Faith: so the word of
Terror, the Threatening is brought home to the soul by the same Faith; by which
the Soul is cast down and humbled.

The manner of Faiths Application is by a practical Syllogism, where the
Major, or first Proposition is the Word of God: The Assumption, or second
Proposition is the Testimony of Conscience: and the conclusion is inferred from
them both, as he that believes not, but continues in sir, is for the present
guilty and obnoxious to wrath, at the last Judgment.

But I believe not, but continue in sin.

Therefore I am for the present guilty and obnoxious to wrath, to be inflicted
at the last Judgment.

Seventh Royalty. 7. Faith is an Heart-softening-Grace.
Such a Grace as does not only humble us, but soften us: not only break us, 7.
Royalty of Faith. Its an Heart-softening-Grace.
but melt us. In the Law it humbles us, it breaks us: but the heart like a
flint, every dust still reteins its flinty, stony Nature, is a stone. And
therefore in the Gospel it melts us, it dissolves us. Thunders of Sinai
terrify, but Dews of Sion mollify.

So much Faith, so much Sorrow, they are like the Fountain and the Stream,
whereof the one arises no higher than the other. So much Faith and
apprehension of Mercy: so much brokenness of spirit for sin.

Where Unbelief does stony the Heart, harden the Heart, dries up the spring and
issues of sorrow. No Heart is so hard as an Unbeleeving-heart: neither the
Promises, nor Threatenings; neither Mercy, nor Justice; neither Word, nor works
will melt it: Faith on the contrary turns the Soul into Water; dissolves a man
into tears; opens all the deep springs of sorrow in the Soul.

1. Faith looks upon Heart-melting-Promises: Takes a survey of the Riches of
Gods Love and Mercy, in making such precious Promises, which does exceedingly
melt.

2. Faith takes up Heart-softening-Considerations, from the Love and Mercy of
God toward us, which are Heart-melting-Mercies; from the goodness and
sweetness of God. Faith makes us see God as he is. It makes God no otherwise
than he is, not more gracious, not more merciful than he is: But Faith
discovers him as he is, a gracious and a merciful God. It does but undraw the
Curtain, but take off the Mask, which Satan and Infidelity have put on; and
makes us to behold God as he is, in all his glorious excellencies, Soul saving
attributes, and Mercies: which who can behold by Faith but must needs mourn and
dissolve into tears, that they have offended him? Thus you see, Ezekiel. 36.31.
when God had discovered himself in his Pardoning-Mercy, his washing,
Forgiving-Mercy to the believing soul; then they shall mourn and be humbled.

Oh! There is nothing breaks the heart more than Mercy; nothing melts a man
more than the smiles of God, the Mercies of God; which being discovered to the
Soul, the Soul is not able to stand stubborn under it.

3. Faith looks upon a Soul-melting, a Soul-softening Object; upon Christ; a
wounded, a broken Christ. And who can behold him but with an Humbled, and a
broken-heart? A bleeding Christ, without a bleeding Heart?

Oh! Here is enough in this Object to open all the springs of sorrow in us; we
need not to go to Bellarmines Twelve Considerations to open the Fountain of
tears in us, we need not bring in the miseries of mankind for one; nor the sad
condition of the Souls in Purgatory for another. We need not be beholden to
him for such considerations as these, to help us to mourn. Oh! Here is enough
in Christ, in a broken and wounded Christ, to open all the springs in thee; and
if thou had a Fountain of tears, to spend them all. The Considerations of his
sufferings, 1. Either in themselves. 2. Or in their cause. 3. Or as the Effects
of sin.


1. The Considerations of his breakings and sufferings as they were in
themselves.

1. The sufferings of his Body. What woundings? breakings? scourgings?
crownings? peircings did he endure upon his Body?

2. The sufferings on his Soul. What conflict and struglings with the wrath of
God? the powers of darkness? what weights? what burdens? what wrath did he
undergo, when his Soul was heavy unto death; be set with terrors? as the word
implies. When he drunk that bitter Cup, that Cup of bitterness? that Cup
mingled with Curses, which made him sweat drops of blood? which if men or
Angels had but sip's of, 'twould have made them reel, stagger, and tumble into
Hell.

2. The Consideration of his sufferings, in the Cause, as the meriting cause of
all our good, procurer of all our Peace, Life, Salvation. -- He was wounded,
that we might be healed, scourged, that we might be solaced; drank the
bitter Cup of wrath, that we might have the draught of Mercy. -- He was slain.

But not for himself, says Daniel. But -- wounded for our transgressions,
broken for our iniquities; The Chastisement of our peace was upon him. Faith
looks upon these his sufferings, as the meriting causes of our good.

3. The Considerations of his sufferings, as effects of sin; as the effects of
our sin; as that which our sins have brought upon him: Which Consideration must
needs effect and break our hearts.

When the soul shall look upon Christ, and say. It was I, that have been the
murderer; I, that have been the Traitor: my sins which brought all this evil on
thee. I sind, and thou sufferedst. It was I, that did eat the soue Grape; and
thy teeth were set en edge. My sins were thy death: yet by thy death, thou
brought the sinner life. I have wounded thee, yet thou have healed me: even
out of that wound which my sins have made, have thou sent out a Plais^er, even
thy Blood for my sins. Oh! This must needs fill the heart with sorrow.

Faith still looks upon an Humbled Christ, with an Humbled Heart: upon a Broken
Christ, with a Broken Heart: upon a Bleeding Christ, with a Bleeding Heart:
upon a Wounded Christ, with a Wounded Heart: Hence, Zach. 12.10. -- They shall
look upon him whom they have peirced. And how shall that sight affect them? It
follows. -- They shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only Son, and
lament for him, as one lamenteth for his first born. In that day there shall
be a great mourning, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon, in the Vallie of Megiddon.

God made the same Organ for seeing, and for weeping. And the soul that sees
well, weeps well. Never soul that did by the Eye of Faith look upon this Son of
Righteousness, but their frozen hearts did melt within them.

Would you ever be mourning men and Women for sin? would you be in
bitterness, as one is in bitterness for his first born? Oh! Steep your thoughts
in the blood of the Lamb: Dwell a little on Christ crucified: Look wistly upon
Christ by Faith: and this will solvere Gelicidium: melt and thaw our frozen
hearts; turn us from stones into flesh.

Eight Royalty. 8. Christ is an Heart-transforming-Grace.
8 Royalty of Faith. Its an Heart-transforming-Grace
Such a Grace as does transform the Soul into the nature of the Object. Faith
is as powerful in this spiritual conception, to work in us the image of the
Object seen, as Fantasy is oftentimes in the natural conception.

The Poets tell us of some that did transform such as beheld them, into stones:
such a power there was in the Object, the thing beheld, as to transform say
they. But here it is true. If by Faith we cast our Eyes upon Christ, of
stones, we shall be turned into men; of sinners into Saints; of a hard heart,
to a soft and fleshly; of Children of Satan, to the Sons and Daughters of God,
Joh. 1.12. -- As many as believed on him, to them he gave power to be the
Sons of God. Sons, not born of the flesh, or the will of the flesh: but of God,
who begets like himself. -- As that which is born of flesh, is flesh: So that
which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit. -- Hence we are said to be -- made
partakers of the Divine Nature. -- To be transformed into the image and
likeness of God. To be Holy, as He is Holy: Pure as He is Pure. To be as
he is in this World.

Never soul that looked on him by Faith, but came away with another heart. --
They looked to him, and were enlightened, says the Psalmist, Psalm. 34.5.

But plainly you shall read the Transforming Power of Faith, 2 Cor. 3.18. --
Whiles beholding as in a Glass, the Glory of the Lord; we are changed into the
same image, from Glory to Glory.

Such a Glass he is, that never did the Eye of Faith behold him, but the Soul
was changed with the sight, from a Wolf into a Lamb; from a sinner, into a
Saint; from Darkness to Light. -- You were once Darkness; now are you Light in
the Lord. It turns a man upside down; wholly transforms him.

Indeed, there is no change of the substance of soul and body; nor of the
faculties of soul and body: but the qualities of the faculties are clear
changed.

The Head is transformed; where before was darkness, now there is Light: where
before it did judge highly of carnal things, and low esteemed spiritual: it
does now the quite contrary.

The Will is transformed: where before it was full of obstinacy and stoutness,
contradiction and rebellion: now there is pliableness to good. and conformity
between Gods Will and his. They are not two, but one Will. Gods Amen, is his
Amen: Gods Fiat. his Fiat: Gods Will, his will.

So the Heart, that is transformed; whereas before it was nothing but a noisome
sink of sin, nothing but a Cage of unclean birds, the womb of sin, a seminary
of lust: Now it is washed, purged, purified, sanctified, made a fit Receptacle
for Christ, an Habitation for God, by his Spirit.

Thus you see Faith is an Heart-transforming-Grace. We cry and say, Oh! If I
had another heart I could believe. If my heart were more holy, more sanctified:
why the way to get another heart is to believe: do but believe, and you shall
see another heart come into you; another Spirit; another Soul. Do but look upon
Christ, and you shall be transformed. It is such a look as sends a man away
with another heart.

As the Wise men; It is said, -- After they had seen Christ, beheld Christ,
they went home another way: So, when by Faith we have seen Christ, it sends
the Soul another way, with another spirit, with other Principles, with other
Resolutions.

There is this Power of Faith, to transform the Soul into the nature of the
Object believed. Belief of the Promises breeds Principles in the Heart suitable
to the Promises. Belief in Christ breeds a Spirit suitable to Christ.

As Faith, Belief in God a Father, breeds Principles of Love, Fear, Reverence,
and Obedience in the Soul; such things as are agreeable: So the belief in
Christ a Savior, breeds Principles of Trust, of Love, of Desire, with the like.

Ninth Royalty. 9 Faith is an heart-pacifying Grace.
9 Royalty of Faith. Its an Heart-pacifying-Grace.
Isa. 26.3. -- Thou will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
thee: because he trusts in thee. A place alleged by One; who (lying on his
deathbed, and enjoying abundance of peace and calmness of spirit; being
demanded, how it came to pass, he was not now assaulted with Satan) replied;
He knew no ground, no cause, save this: God had promised -- To keep that soul
in perfect Peace, whose mind was stayed on him, who trusts on him. He relied
on Christ, and therefore enjoyed rest.

Isa. 27.5. -- Let him take hold of my strength. That is, by Faith, lay hold on
my Covenant, my Christ: and I will be at peace with him.

Hence the Apostle, Romans 5.1. -- Being justified by Faith, we have Peace with
God. Romans 15.13. -- Now the God of all hope fill you with joy, and peace in
believing.

An unbeleeving-heart is a stormy heart, an unpeaceable-heart. All things Above
us. Within us. Quae supra nos Intra nos, Infra nos, Contra nos.
Below us, are all against us, whilst we are Unbeleevers.


1. Above us, we have an angry and displeased God.

2. Within us, we have a stormy and troublesome Conscience, threatening nothing
but death; like the troubled Sea, casting up mire and dirt; as Isaiah speaks,
Isa. 57.20. -- There is no Peace, says my God to the wicked.

3 Below us, we have there all the Creatures our enemies, ready upon Gods
commission to execute his displeasure upon us.

But now, being Believers, all is at Peace.

1. All above us is at Peace. The Controversy betwixt God and us is ended.
Faith takes up the quarrel betwixt God and us. -- We have Peace with God, Romans
5.1.

2. All within us is at Peace. A peaceable God makes all at Peace: Tranquillus
Deus, Tranquillat omnia:
when once our Peace is made in the Court of Heaven (which is upon the first
act of believing.) Then follows Peace in the Court of Conscience -- Peace which
passes all understanding, Phil. 4.7. Our rest is, to behold God at rest; our
Peace is, to see him at Peace* Eum quierem aspicere Qu^^ esce^e est.


3. All below us are at Peace with us. We have Peace with all the Creatures.
All are now our Friends, Job 5.23. -- The stones of the Field shall be at
league with thee; the Beasts of the Field shall be at peace with thee, etc.
Thou shall know that Peace shall be in thy Tabernacle.

Prove. 16.7. When a man's ways please the Lord, he will make his enemies to
be at peace with him: When before upon our Rebellion with God, all the
Creatures were our enemies; now being reconciled, all are made friends.

1. Faith makes us the Servants to the God of Peace, in whose service there is
Peace, Prove. 3.17. -- All his Paths are Peace. Every step of Godliness has
Peace with it: And the reward of whose service shall be Peace, Psalm. 29.11. --
The Lord will bless his people with Peace, Psalm. 85.8. -- The Lord will speak
Peace to his people, at the last, though they meet with much trouble for the
present; war within, and war without, war with lusts, war with Satan: yet the
God of Peace shall tread down Satan under our feet at last; and put an end to
this war, Romans 16.20. They shall have a Peace in the Conclusion: And a Peace
after war is the surest and most setledst Peace, Psalm. 37.37. -- Mark the
upright man. -- The end of that man is Peace. Though there be storms and
troubles in the way; yet the end of the journey, that shall be Peace; A calm
after storms; and never shall there arise storm more, to all Eternity.

2. Faith makes us subjects to the Prince of Peace; unto Christ, who is called
-- our Peace, Ephesians. 2.14. And our Peace he is.

1. Not only meritoriously; by shedding his Blood for the purchase of our
Peace, Col. 1.20. -- Christ is our Peace, having made Peace through the Blood
of his Cross. So Isa. 53. -- The chastisement of our Peace was upon him; Or,
that chastisement (which did meritoriously procure our Peace) was upon him. God
directed all the war against him, that we might have Peace: As Jonah was
thrown into the Sea, that the storm might cease; so Christ upon the Cross, into
the Grave, that God and we might be at peace together.

But Christ is not only our Peace thus meritoriously by procuring Peace for us;
But also,

^. Efficiently; by working of Peace in us. Christ has not only wrought Peace
for us, but he works Peace in us; Pacifying our Consciences, calming our
stormy spirits, settling and establishing his Peace in us.

Christ is called the Prince of Peace; as the King is the Fountain of Honors,
and bestows them where he will; so Christ is of Peace, and bestows it when and
where he pleases. We read that Moses was a man of Peace: but he was not a
Prince of Peace. He could not bestow Peace: he could not instill peaceable
and calm affections into the mutinous Israelites.

But Christ, he is not a man of Peace: but King of Salem, Prince of Peace; who
is able to bestow Peace; who can calm the most stormy and troublesome spirits,
with as much ease, as he did the Winds and Waters; which was but with a word
-- Peace and be still.

Now Faith makes us one with Christ, who is the Prince of Peace. Christ joined
God and us together, and Faith joins Christ and us together; in whom we have
Peace, John. 16, 33.^ In me ye shall have Peace. Faith makes us subjects to
this Prince of Peace, whose Kingdom and reign over his people does not consist
in meat and drink, but in Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost.

3. Faith does interest us into the Covenant of Peace; and therefore being
Believers, we must needs have Peace. I say, Faith does interest us into the
Covenant of Peace; the Gospel of Peace; the alone condition whereof is
believing. -- Whosoever believes shall be saved.

Time was, that [ Hoc age: do this] was the condition of life. -- do this and
live. So ran the old Covenant: But now [Crede: Believe: and be saved] The Law
required works. It Is called a Covenant of Works: but the Gospel Faith: Its a
Covenant of Grace, Made out of mere Grace, and performed of mere Grace, wherein
God promises pardon of sins, upon mere Mercy and Grace.

4. Faith does instate us into the conditions of Peace. Faith gives us the
grounds of Peace, Justification, Reconciliation with God, pardon of sin, and
Sanctification of the whole man. As there is no Peace, where God is not
propitious; so there is no Peace where the sinner is not sanctified.

A Believing heart is an holy heart: and an holy heart is a peaceable heart.
Grace and Peace: and Righteousness, and Peace, are still coupled together. To
show, that where there is no Grace, there is no Peace: and where there is
Grace, there is Peace, though not ever in the Possession, Gratia est bonum
initiale. Pax est bonum finale.
and sensible enjoyment; yet ever in the hope and assurance of the promise of
Peace. Grace is the root, and Peace is the fruit. -- A good Conscience is a
continual Feast. They who do the work of God, shall have the Peace of God, Gal.
6. -- They who walk according to this Rule, Peace shall be on them, etc. Hence
the Psalmist, Psalm. 119 165. -- Great Peace have they that love thy Law. They
which love the Law of God, shall have the Peace of God.

Object. But you will say. Many have Peace, who yet are not Believers. many are
Believers, and yet want Peace. Therefore Peace is not a Fruit of Faith.

Ans. Now to meet and to resist this Objection,

For the first. Many have Peace, who yet are not Believers. I grant it. Many
who are unbeleevers have quiet Peace. -- Are not in trouble as other men, Psalm.
7.3, 5.

1. A Peace they have; but it is a false Peace. And a true war is better than a
false Peace.

2. A Peace they have: but it is not the Peace of God, rather the Peace of the
Devil. -- The strong man keeps the house, and therefore all is at Peace.

3. A Peace they have, but it is but an outward Peace: not an inward Peace. --
The heart knows its own bitterness -- even in the midst of laughter, the heart
is sorrowful; when the Countenance is full of cheer, the Conscience is full of
woe.

As the godly have often the Pearl of Joy in the Heart, when the dew of tears
is in their eyes: so the wicked

4 A Peace they have, but it is but the Peace of a dreaming, sleeping man: not
the Peace of a man awakened, or it is but

5. A Peace of a condemned man, before his Execution: The Peace of a calm
before a storm.

I have showed you, there is a fourfold Conscience.

1. Good and quiet. 2. Not god, nor quiet. 3. Good, but not quiet. 4. Quiet,
but not good, which quiet does arise partly.
From ignorance of their condition: or

From carnal security: or

From brawninesse of Conscience, want of inquiry into Conscience. But it is far
from true Peace. Sure I am. Pax non est, ubi non est Gratia. Pax est Haereditas
Sanctorum.
Where there is no Grace, there is no Peace. Hence says one, Peace is the
inheritance of Saints, only. 'Twas all the Legacy which the Prince of Peace
lest to his Subject. -- Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you, Joh.
14.27.

There may be godliness without Peace, for a time; but there can be no Peace
without godliness. As Jehu said to Jehoram, -- What Peace? so long as the
Whoredoms of thy Mother, and her Witchcrafts be so many? So I say to you.
What Peace?

-- There is no Peace, says my God to the wicked, Isa. 57.21.

1. They have no Peace with God: God is their enemy.

2. They have no Peace with Conscience: that is full of storms: as one said of
Jonah, ubi peccatum, ibi procella: Where sin is, there is a storm. A sinful
Conscience, is a stormy Conscience: though for the present it is quiet: yet it
is like a Book bound up, wherein, if ever it be unclasped, if ever it be
opened; nothing but hellish Tragedies will appear.

And, that Peace thou have in a sinful way, it is a forerunner of eternal
war: it is but like the Peace of the old World -- They ate, they drank, they
married, and gave in marriage, till at last the flood came, and swept them all
away, Luke 17.27. -- It is but the Peace of Sodom, the Peace of Agag, the Peace
of Joab, and Shimei, the Peace of Eli's house: the Peace of all ungodly men --
who, when they say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction, as travel upon a
woman with child; so that they shall not escape, 1 These. 5.3.

Object. 2. The second part of the Objection is, Many are Believers, who yet
want Peace.

Ans. Indeed the best have no perfection of Peace; because they want a
perfection of Grace. They have no perfection of Peace, because they have not
the perfection of Faith, the perfection of Grace.

If there were a perfection of Grace, then there might be a perfection of
Peace. But the perfection of both is reserved to another world.

Though sometimes Believers may have such a Peace as may overcome all doubts,
fears, troubles, etc. yet ordinarily their Peace is not so high. There is
doubting as well as confidence; fear as well as Faith; trouble as well as Peace.

The Peace of the godly here is a peace joined with war. Our inward Peace is
joined with inward War, war against sin and corruption. It is such a Peace as
does not consist in freedom from war; but in an actual warring: The Flesh
still lusting against the Spirit and the Spirit against the Flesh. And, till
this great Make-ba^e be taken away, till sin be destroyed, we must look for
no perfect Peace.

2. But secondly. You say; Believers want Peace. It may be they do: They want
the sense of Peace, but not the ground of Peace. They have the ground of Peace,
interest in Christ, Reconciliation with God, Justification, pardon of sin,
Sanctification; although for present, they want the sense of Peace, the clear
apprehensions of all this to their Souls.

They have Peace with God, Romans 5.1. But they want Peace with themselves. The
direct act of Faith gives a man Peace with God, Isa. 27.5. -- Let him take hold
of my strength, and I will be at Peace with him. But the Reflect act of Faith
is it which gives a man Peace within himself. A man may have the one, and yet
want the other.

3. It may be they hold some secret Compliance with some secret and sweet
corruption. There may be some secret Jonah, which lies under hatches; some
secret Achan, which lies undiscovered; some secret close corruption, which may
cause God to make war against his own people, and deny them Peace.

And therefore, in this case we must do as the Mariners in the storm; as
Israel in their trouble; cast lots: enter upon inquiry, what that is, that
troubles our Peace; and then cast him overboard, that our hearts may be calmed.

We have a passage worth observation, 2 Samuel 20. from verse. 16. to 23. Joab
besieged Abel, and threatened war. A woman cries out from the City, to know the
cause. He returns her answer. -- There was one Sheba the son of Bichri, who
was a traitor to the King. Cast his head over the Wall, and all shall be at
Peace; which done, Joab, and all Israel retired every man to his tent, and
there was a Peace.

Thus God does oftentimes besiege one of his own Subjects, because they harbor
some secret Traitor* some close lust and corruption. And therefore it would be
our wisdom to inquire and find out the Traitor: to yield up our sins, and God
will be at Peace with us; whereas otherwise God will never be at Peace with
him, who is at Peace with his lusts; nor spare him, that spares his sin.

4. It may be they want present Peace, because for present, they are in
warring conditions, 1. In great Combats with lusts and corruptions. 2. In
great Conflicts with Satan. 3. In sad deserted conditions. At which times they
may want the sense of Peace.


The Soul is now in the pursuit of Peace. And, though with Rebekah, they have
some struggling in the womb for a time: yet God will part the womb at last --
He will speak Peace to his People at last: he will break the Cloud, and
discover himself.

5. You say; Believers want Peace.

But it is, not as they are Believers, but as they are Doubters, If they had
more Faith, they would have more Peace.

It may be they give away to jealous mis-giving, and mistrusting thoughts of
God, or of themselves.

Some there are who do nothing but make objections against themselves, and Gods
dealings with them. And a quarrelsome heart is for the most part, a troublesome
heart.

You shall see some to whom God has given evidences of their estate and
condition, and such as might content them, such as they might have Peace in:
But they will quarrel against them.

Either their evidences are not so clear as others are; not written in so fair
and legible characters as others are.

Or else they want sealing. And therefore they will take no comfort in them.

Thus do many forsake their own mercies, breed their own disquiet, and are
injurious to their own peace. When God has spoken Peace, and Peace to their
Souls: yet they return back again to folly; to the folly of Unbeleeving,
Doubting, Questioning of Gods love. And no marvel, if such do want Peace.

Men, that will forgo their evidences, give up their claim and title to
Christ. Men whom Satan can make unsay what they know God has said to their
hearts, may soon sit down in dumb silence and discouragement.

If when God has manifested himself to you; has come and supped with you;
has given you the white stone of absolution, the Hidden Manna of comfort and
consolation; those manifest experiments of his love: and yet you will join
Issue with Satan, give way to doubts: No marvel if you disturb your peace;
bring insufferable fears and disquiets upon your selves. And it were just with
God, to leave you to the doubts and mis-givings of your own hearts; and never
to give you a word of Peace more: but suffer you to bring your gray hairs with
sorrow to the Grave; seeing nothing will satisfy you.

6. The Reason why Believers have no more Peace, is, Because they seek Peace no
more in a way of believing. They seek it more in the Law, than in the Gospel:
more in Sanctification than in Justification: more in the Precept than in the
Promise: more in working, than in believing: more in their Obedience than in
Christ.

And therefore no marvel, seeing all this is imperfect, that they have no more
perfection of peace.

So long as you make the grounds of your peace any thing within your selves, or
any thing wrought by your selves; you will never have fullness of peace.

There may be some peace for a time in these things: but it is not a full and
satisfying peace; nor yet a permanent and constant peace, It may be gotton to
day; lost, or encumbered to morrow.

Every imperfection will disturb your peace. Every failing will raise up a new
and fresh storm, breed a new quarrel in the soul.

He that would have peace, must seek it in the God of Peace; in the Prince of
Peace, in Christ himself; in whom he said, Joh. 16.33. -- We should have
Peace.

When there is a storm in your selves, there is peace in him: when there is no
peace in you in regard of your imperfections and failings; there is yet peace in
Christ, who is a perfect Savior. The Sacrifice is imperfect, but the Priest is
perfect.

Tenth Royalty. 10 Faith is an Heart-inabling-Grace.
10. Royalty of Faith: Its an Heart-inabling-Grace.
It is such a Grace as inables a man; 1. To do. 2. To suffer.


A Believing Christian is a strong Christian. He is strong for any service. It
is said; -- By Faith Abraham obeyed God. Faith did enable him to obey. And it
was a great act of Obedience, as you may read; scil. The offering of his Son,
his only Son, the Son of his love. If it had been an adopted Son only, and not
his Natural, or if his Natural, and but one among many, the trial had not been
so great, But he was his own, and only Son, and the Son of his old age; and
therefore like to have no more; the Son of the promise; not an Ismael, but an
Isaac, a Son long expected, now exceedingly rejoiced in; he was the Son of his
Love. Now to part with such a Son was a great trial.

But here was not all the trial. If he had but parted with him in the way of
Nature, by a natural death; this had not been so much: but to part with him in
way of Sacrifice, wherein he was to be cut in pieces; nay, and he himself
must be the Butcher of this Son of his Love; must imbrue his own hands in the
blood of this Son. This was a great trial; yet here was seen the power of
Faith, tht it enabled him to obey. He did not consult with Flesh and Blood;
did not dispute, but obey -- By Faith he obeyed.

Faith it is an Heart-inabling-Grace. It will enable you to pray; yea, and to
pray to purpose, to wrestle with God. Beleeving-prayers, are wrestling prayers;
wherein the Soul wrestles with God by strength of his Promise; his Covenant,
his Truth, his Christ.

It inables you to hear, and to hear with profit: when Faith; does incorporate
it self with the Word, it will be profitable. Faithful hearing is ever fruitful
hearing.

It will enable you to receive the Sacrament, and to receive with comfort.
Faith is the Organ, whereby we feed on Christ; receive Christ. Faith is the
instrument that conveyes Christ the Conduit-pipe.

A believing Receiver is a blessed Receiver.

It will enable you to bring forth much fruit, To be fruitful in Obedience. It
plants us into a fruitful stock; and how can we be barren Plants? It draws
life and nourishment from Christ. A faithful Christian is a fruitful
Christian. Men of a good Belief, are men of a good Life. That soul that has
yielded obedience to the Promise, in a way of believing, is ready to subject it
self to every Precept, in a way of Obedience.

Faith does enable a man to contend with lusts, with the strongest corruptions;
-- The sons of Zerviah, which else would be too hard for us.

It inables us to combat with Satan. It is our shield, whereby we resist; it
is our weapon, whereby we conquer; It sets Christ against Satan, by whom we
over-overcome, as the word is. -- We are -- more than Conquerors.

It inables us to overcome the World -- This is our Victory whereby we
overcome the World -- even our Faith.

Whereas unbeleef does slay and disable the heart, both from doing and
suffering. An unbeleeving heart is an impotent heart. The state of unbeleef is
a state of impotency and disability; to the performance of any thing, that is
good. There is a total, and universal impotency in an unbeleeving heart. He
cannot pray, hear, receive.

Faith, on the contrary does enable and strengthen the soul to all Obedience.
It inables a man to yield.

A willing Obedience, cheerful Obedience, voluntary Obedience; a constant, a
fruitful, an universal Obedience. It will enable a man to do his duty, Toward
God, Toward others,


Toward himself. It inables a man to walk through the duties of all relations
faithfully. The Husband to the Wife: the Wife to the Husband, The Parents to
the Child; The Child to the Parent; The Master to the Servant; The Servant to
the Master, etc.

Faith is the great Task-Master of the Soul. But it is not like Pharaohs
Task-Master, to command burdens, and afford no help: To require the Tale of
Brick, and give no Straw. This indeed the Law does. It is an hard Task-Master.
It commands; but gives no ability. Jubet; fed non juvat. Efficit quod imperat.
Jubet and juvat.


But not so Faith. It commands, and lays in strength to do. It gives what it
commands; by going over to Christ, and fetching strength from him; whereby the
soul is enabled to obey what it is commanded.

It is said of Christ, That -- His Government shall be upon his shoulders: Not
only in his hand having a Scepter only to command, but upon his shoulders,
wherein there is support to obey commands. So it may be said of Faith, which
governs from Christ, and by Christ, Its Government is upon its shoulder;
inabling the soul to do what it commands.

1. Faith begets Soul-inabling-Principles; Principles in the soul suitable to
the things commanded; whereby a man is enabled to obey.

All strength for new Obedience arises from a new Nature. And this new Nature
is nothing else, but that conformity to the Law of God, whereby a man is not
only able to obey, but willing to obey: when Principles are wrought in our
hearts suitable to the Precepts: when there is a Law within us, answering to
the Law without us: -- It will be meat and drink; it will be natural to obey:
it is not now hard to pray to clear. -- The yoke is easy, the burden is light.
These things are not tasks but delights; not medicines, but meat; not physic,
but food, Psalm. 40. -- I delight to do thy Will, says David: and what was the
ground? -- Thy Law is in my heart. There were Principles agreeable to the
Precepts, and that made him not only to obey, but to obey with delight.

2. Faith supplies a man with Soul-inabling-Strength, from without. We have
need not only of preventing, but assisting Grace: not only of operative, but
cooperative strength: not only of inherent, but of assistant, the continual
succors, aids and supplies of the Spirit of Christ. And Faith does supply the
soul with strength from him, -- without whom we can do nothing, and through
whose might we are enabled to do all things.

Faith lays in supplies of strength from Christ, wherewith we are enabled for
any service. It calls in for all the strength of Christ, the aids of the
Spirit, whereby we are strengthened.

2. Faith does furnish a man with Soul-inabling-considerations.

1. From God, the mercies of God, the goodness and sweetness of God; All which
do encourage and enable the soul to obey. A loving Master makes a diligent
Servant. A merciful God, a working Christian. Nothing does so prevail with the
heart as love. -- The Love of Christ constrains us.

When Faith shall discover to the heart what we were, what we are, what God
might, what God has done with us; it will break out with David with a -- Quid
Retribuam, etc. What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits! I will
take the cup of Salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my
vows, etc. Psalm. 116.12. This overcomes the Soul with Love. That heart that is
overcome with the sweetness of mercy, is prepared to overcome any difficulty of
service. -- My heart is prepared, my heart is prepared.

2. From the work. Faith furnishes a man with soul-inabling-considerations from
the excellency of the employments: he sees a piece of Heaven in tem: he sees
these services full of beauty, sweetness, desireableness, No service to the
service of the King. Oh! what then is the service of the King of Kings.

3. From the rewards which God has promised to obedience. And these rewards
Faith makes use of, to quicken and stir up the soul to Obedience; to be spurs
and incentives to us, as they were to Moses, who -- had an eye to the
recompense of the Reward; as they were to Christ himself; who for the joy that
was set before him, endured the Cross, and despised the shame, Heb. 12.2, and
Heb. 11.26. All which have a mighty influence into the soul, to enable and
quicken it to Obedience.

2. Faith inables the Soul to suffer. Yea, and to suffer the sufferings of the
greatest magnitude. You see, Heb. 11. -- Through Faith they were stoned, they
were sawn asunder, were slain with the sword.

1. It puts the soul into a suffering frame. It deadens a man's heart to the
world, mortifies a man to to the world, and makes a man alive to God.

A man dead to the world does not much care either to leave the world, or any
thing in the world: now Faith deadens a man's heart to the World.

1. Faith puts the Judgment into a right frame. It makes the Judgment lightly
to esteem of earthly, and highly to esteem of Heavenly things: lightly to
esteem the favors and frowns of men, highly to value the favor, and fear the
frowns of God.

2. Faith prevails with the Will; to choose God above all; and to part with all,
the leave all, if they come in competition with God. This Faith does
habitually, in habitual preparations in the work of Grace, when first the Will
chooses with Christ. Thus Faith inables the soul to do actually, when ever it
is brought to trial.

3. Faith works upon the Affections, to love God above all, to delight in God,
to fear him, etc.

A man, who loves any thing, chooses any thing, prizeth any thing above God, is
a man unfit for sufferings: he is not in a sufering frame. If God and these
things come in competition, they with Demas will forsake God, and cleave to the
present world. Men, whose hearts are too much engaged to the World; whose
affections are too much set upon the Creature: men, whose wills choose any thing
more than God: whose Judgments do prize and esteem of any thing more than God;
to whom God is little, and the world is great: these men are unfit for trials.

And therefore this is the first way, whereby Faith does enable the Soul, by
putting it into a suffering frame.

2. Faith does furnish the soul with suffering Resolutions. A believing heart
is a resolved heart. Nothing causes a suspension in the Will more than
Unbeleef. He that doubts is like a wave of the Sea, sometimes going this
way, and sometimes carried back again. Whereas Faith does resolve the heart,
makes the soul resolve as Peter, but in a better strength, -- I will dye,
rather than deny thee.

Faith does cloathe the soul with suffering resolutions, to go through a Sea,
through a Wilderness, through the hottest Skirmishes, the hardest Trials for
Christ. You see it every where in Scripture. In Michaiah, in Jeremiah, in the
three Children, in Daniel, in the Apostles. And to these I might add many
more. As that of old Polycarp; when he was persuaded to deny Christ, rather
than to dye for Christ. (...), etc.
-- These fourscore and six years I have served Christ; and he has never hurt
me all this time, and how then can I blaspheme my King and Savior?

The like of Cyprian, who being desired to consult with himself, before he
should suffer, Fac quod tibi praeceptum est.
replies. -- Do your office. In so just a thing as this there needs no
Consultation.

The like of that rich Virgin which Basil speak of; who being condemned to the
fire, was offered her life and estate, if she would renounce her Faith; she
returns Valeat vita, pereat pecunia, etc. Let my money perish, my life cannot:
and though I lose this life, I shall have a more enduring, a more abiding, a
more abounding life in Christ.

To these many more might be added, to show how Faith does furnish the Soul
with suffering Resolutions, as that of Chrysostom, who said -- if you take
away my goods, etc.

3. Faith begets suffering graces, courage, magnanimity, patience, humility,
self-denial, contempt of the World, high prizing of God. It sets God above all
the comforts and contentments in Heaven and Earth, It gives adherence to the
Truth; by which the Soul is enabled to undergo any thing.

4. It lays in suffering-strength: strength from God, strength from the
Promise, which says -- When thou passest through the water, it shall not
overflow thee, when thou passest through the fire, it shall not kindle upon
thee, etc. Isa. 43.2. It fetches strength from Christ, who like Simon of
Cyrene, helps to bear part of every Cross.

Thus Faith goes out of it self; stands upon another bottom; leans upon
another power; rests upon another strength, whereby the Soul is enabled to go
through any thing. All this is conveyed by this Instrument of Faith.

5. It propounds to the Soul suffering rewards. That -- For these light
afflictions which are but for a moment, we shall receive a far more exceeding
and eternal weight of Glory.

That for the loss of temporals we shall gain eternals. That -- If we suffer
with Christ, we shall reign with Christ.

That No man shall lose Father or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands, or
Houses, or Brethren, or Sisters, for his Names sake: but he shall receive an
hundred fold more, here, and shall inherit everlasting life, Matthew. 19.29. God
will be all this to thee. Nay, God will be more than all this to thee. More
than Riches, more than Friends, more than Life it self unto thee.

All which considerations do exceedingly enable the Soul to undergo sufferings
and trials.

Eleventh Royalty. 11. Faith is an Heart-in-nobling-Grace.
That which sets one man above another: 11. Royalty of Faith. Its a
Soul-in-nobling-Grace.
That which does raise up and exalt one man above another, in Gods esteem, is
Faith. that which does put a difference between man and man, is Faith or
nothing, Acts. 15.9.

1. Faith is such a Grace as sets us above others, our Persons above others. A
Grace which makes us Kings, and Priests unto God: which raises us, and sets us
out of the crowd. They are noble, whom God does in-noble: honorable, whom God
does honor. God is the King of Kings, the Fountain of all Honor, who can
exalt whom he pleases, and throw down whom he pleases: who can in-noble
whom he pleases, and abase whom he will. And this honor have all his Saints.

This has God thrown upon the poorest Believer, he has made him a King, and
a Priest, Rev. 1.6. 1 Pet. 2.5.9.

2. Faith sets our performances above others. Our prayers, our duties, our
obedience. Faith raises them above others, Heb. 11.4. -- By Faith Abel offered
to God a more excellent Sacrifice than Cain. Cain offered Sacrifice as well as
Abel: but Faith put the difference betwixt them. -- By Faith he offered a more
excellent, a more noble Sacrifice than Cain.

Faith puts a difference betwixt the works of Christians, and the works of
Heathens. Though there were no difference for the matter, yet Faith puts a vast
difference for the manner.

Faith puts a difference betwixt the Abba-Fathers of a Child, of a Saint: and
the Ave-Maries, of a superstitious Papist: betwixt the Prayers of a Saint, and
the Devotions of a sinner: betwixt the cries of a Saint, and the howlings of an
Hypocrite. But to return.

Faith is an Heart-in-nobling-Grace.

1. It begets in us Soul-in-nobling-Principles. Principles like our selves. It
is such a Grace as does sublimate a man, begets high, glorious, and heavenly
Principles in the soul. By this we are -- made partakers of the divine nature.
It is an Heart-spiritualizing-Grace.

Whereas Unbeleef does sensuallize a man, beasts a man, as Nebuchadnezzar, Dan.
5.20.21. Hence we read, An Unbeleeving heart is called a gross heart, -- make
their heart gross: so Faith does raise up a man, spiritualizes a man. A
Believing heart is a fine heart, a spiritual heart, It refines the soul.

Faith does raise up a man as high above reason, as reason does raise a man
above mere sense. It sets a man as high above a man, as Reason does a man above
a Beast.

Faith is the Spirit of Grace. Not only a spiritual Grace: but the Spirit of
all our spiritual Graces. It has nothing but spirituality in it; and has to
do with nothing but spiritual things; with God, with Christ, with Heaven, with
Justification, pardon of sin. All which are spiritual things, far above sense;
nay, and Reason too: their objects reach not so high, which things though they
be Real, and none more Real, yet they are spiritually Real, not sensually;
Real to Faith, not to sense, nor to Reason neither. And therefore unbeleeving
men do esteem these things either meer-nothings, or they are next door to
nothing in their thoughts; Imaginary things: Notiones secundae: which have no
foundation in Being, no existence in the World.

2. Faith does implant us into Soul-in-nobling-Relations.

1 It makes us Servants to the great God of Heaven and Earth, who (though it
were Hyperbollically said of Tyrus Merchants, yet may it truly be said of God)
makes all his servants Kings. Gods service is an honorable, a noble service.
Nay, it makes us not only Servants, but

2. It makes us friends of God. Abraham a Believer, was called Gods Friend:
nay, not only Friends, but

3. It makes us Sons and Daughters of God. -- Gal. 3.26. -- You are the
Children of God by Faith. We may glory in our Pedigree. A Believer is best
born, nobly born, Jam. 1.18. -- Of his own Will begat he us, by the Word of
Truth, Joh. 1.13. -- Born of God. Nay

4. It makes us the Spouse of Christ, who is such as Husband as does en-noble
his Wife. We know among men; The Wife is honored with her Husbands honor.
The Lawyers have a speech, -- Mulier fulget Radiis Mariti: The Wife shines with
the Husbands Rays: she shines with his brightness. If he be honorable,
whatever she was before, yet now she cannot be base: If he be noble, she
cannot be ignoble, because he confers and throws all his honors upon his
Wife.

So here, by Faith, being made the Spouse of Christ, Christ does en-noble his
Spouse: Christ does adorn, and beautify his Spouse, Ezekiel. 16.10, 11, 12, 13.
-- I clothed thee with broidred work, and shed thee, and covered thee with
silk. I decked thee with Ornaments, etc. We shine with the beams of his
Justice. Holiness, Riches, Graces. -- Christ is made to us Wisdom,
Justification, Sanctification, and Redemption, 1 Cor. 1.30. -- Of his fullness
we all have received, and Grace for Grace, Joh. 1.16. -- Nay

5. Faith makes us the Members of Christ, who is such an Head as does en-noble
his Members. Christ throws more Glory and Honor upon the meanest Member of his
Body, than all the World is able to make us heirs of. It were better to be the
meanest Member of Christ, than to have all the Glory of the World, out of
Christ; better to be the meanest twig in this Vine, Melius non ^^se, quam sine
Christo esse.
than to be the most glorious branch in the World, out of Christ. Better it is
not to be at all, than not to be in Christ.

3. Faith puts us upon Soul-in-nobling employments.

It puts a man upon Prayer, Holy exercises, Communion with God; which are noble
Employments, above the World. Faith makes the soul live high, above the World,
above the Earth. Faith carries the soul to Heaven, makes it live were it had
its First breath, and being, makes our way to lie above, our Conversation to
be in Heaven, our joys to be there, our affections there, our hearts there.
-- By Faith Enoch walked with God; he conversed with God, had to do with God
daily, the great God of Heaven and Earth daily in supplications and
meditations, and holy conversation. All which are noble employments. The higher
the person we have to do withal, the more noble are the employments.

And they are such as do in-noble the Soul. No man has to do with God in any
way, but he is in-nobled by it. -- Moses face shone, when he had been
conversing with God. God does shed Glory upon all those, who have to do with
him. None have to do with a glorious God, but are made glorious. None with an
Holy God, but are made holy. If you have to do with him in Prayer, or any of
his Ordinances, he sends you still better away.

4. Faith does entitle us unto a Soul-in-nobling Inheritance: unto Heaven, unto
Glory. It makes us not only Sons of God, but Heirs. Every Son is an Heir, nay,
and a Joint-Heir with Christ, unto that eternal inheritance of Glory. Romans
8.17. Hence the Apostle, 1 John 3.2. -- Now we are the Sons of God: but it
does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know when he shall appear, we
shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. -- Then when Christ who is
our life shall appear, we shall also appear with him in Glory, Col. 3.4.

We shall be Citizens of Heaven. Faith does entitle us to Crowns of Glory. --
To that House not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens, 2 Cor. 5.1. To an
inheritance, incorruptible. and that fades not, reserved in Heaven for us, 1
Pet. 1.5. -- To a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory, 1 Cor. 4.17.

Which Inheritance is so certain, by Faith to Believers, that the Apostle
says, -- We sit together with him in heavenly places, Ephesians. 2.6. we sit now
with him in respect of our Union by Faith; and shall sit with him hereafter, in
our Communion with his Glory, when we shall be invested with those Royal
Robes of Glory.

Thus you see Faith is a Soul-in-nobling-Grace. It makes God a Father, Christ a
Brother, Angels fellow servants, Heaven our Inheritance. It brings a man into a
noble kindred, a noble family, the family of Heaven, and makes all the family
of Heaven our kindred. It brings a man unto noble acquaintance; puts a man upon
noble employments; intitles a man unto a noble inheritance: invests us with
in-nobling Privileges; and begets us a noble spirit, a spirit suitable to all
these; suitable to our Father, our Kindred, our Acquaintance, our Employments,
our Inheritance.

The whole frame of Christianity turns upon the hinge of Faith. As the Blood
through the veins, so Faith runs through every vein of the whole body of
Religion. It is the staff of our strength, the support of all our comfort, and
the life of our soul.

In my discourse, of which I have (though indeed the Privileges of Faith
requires an Angel rather than a Man, to make relation of it; yet I say, I have)
adventured to lay down diverse Royalties and Privileges of this Grace: wherein
all that I have said, or can say, falls short of the excellency of it. When I
have told you what I can, you may say (as the Queen of Sheba, when she found
the Truth to exceed the Relation) that the one half has not been told you.
Coelum and Deus: so Coelum and fides non patiuntur Hyperbolen. I cannot here
Hyperbolize. I cannot play the Mountebank; to set down more in the Bill than is
in the Physic: more in the Relation than is in the Balsome. All I can say will
fall short of the preciousness of Faith.

Yet mistake me not; whatever I have said, or shall say of Faith, I speak not
of Faith absolutely, but of Faith relatively: The Act with its Object. We will
not make a Christ of Faith, nor raise up Faith any higher, than we may set up
Christ with it, by it, above it. Well then, to proceed, we have laid down
diverse glorious Privileges, or Royalties of Faith: we have yet more
remaining such as these.

Twelfth Royalty. 12. Faith is a Soul-fatning-Grace.
The believing Christian is the thriving Christian. 12. Royalty of Faith. In a
Soul-fatning-Grace.
It is such a Grace as does nourish and strengthen the soul. It weakens
corruption, but strengthens Grace. It starves the flesh, but fattens the spirit.

It is indeed a sin-starving-Grace. Faith will not feed and fuel lust. It will
neither entertain nor maintain corruptions. Faith will abridge sin of that
nourishment, those dainty bits which it met withal in an unbeleeving heart. It
will not lay in provision for lust.

Unbeleef is the Caterer and the Provider for sin. Sin has its full desire in
an unbeleeving heart; whatever it lusts after, it shall have: nothing shall be
wanting to feed lust.

If a man be addicted to the lust of uncleanness: there is nothing the lust
does desire, but an unbeleeving heart will make a supply of. It shall have
Books, Ballads, Plays for the purpose. It shall have obscene objects, and
pictures to gaze upon. There shall be nothing wanting for the fomenting and
cherishing of the corruption: nothing shall be denied, that may oil and
increase the flame of lust. All a man has, all his power, all his riches, his
estate shall be laid out for the fewelling of his corruption; and so I might
show in other lusts.

But now Faith, it starves sin: it will not hold out the dugg to nourish a
corruption: It will -- not provide for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof:
It will abridge sin, and cut it short of those dainty bits, which formerly it
had in the soul: It will not afford it a thought, a motion, a look, nor any
thing that may fuel it, or feed it.

It is a sin-starving-Grace. But though it starve the flesh, it fattens the
spirit. It is a soul-fatning-Grace; which it does after this manner.

First Preparatory way. 1. Per modum removendi.
1. By a Negative way. By destroying Soul-consuming, soul-destroying,
soul-pining lusts and corruptions, which will hinder out spiritual fatning.

Men use to purge, before they go to fatten. Faith must give the soul a purge:
otherwise the soul would never thrive; though the pasture be never so good. If
there be corruptions in the soul unpurged, the soul will never grow and thrive.

If a Child do secretly feed upon Chalk or Dirt, or such like trash, it will
never grow nor thrive: though the food it eats be never so good and wholesome
meat.

So if the Soul do secretly feed upon some secret lust or corruption, it will
never grow, never thrive, though the food it feeds upon be never so nourishing.

And therefore Faith does purge the heart of lust and corruption, which may
hinder our spiritual growth. Faith cuts off the suckers from the Tree, which
does eat out the heart of the root, and hinder the growth of the Tree. Faith
takes the Child from the Dugge, which consumes the Parent. Faith will separate
a man from his lust, and will not suffer a corruption to hang upon us, to
hinder our spiritual growth.

2. Faith does put a man into a Soul-fatning-pasture. The whole Word of God is
the Pasture for Faith. The Word of God is objectum Adaequatum, the Even and
Adequate object of Faith. There is the only walk of Faith; which, though it be
an enclosed Pasture, a Field enclosed, a Pasture paled in: yet there is enough
in it to satisfy Faith. We shall not need to stray any whither else for want
of Pasture; here we may go in, and go out, and find Pasture; we shall not
need to feed upon stubble and straw of humane traditions: here is enough in it
to nourish us up to eternal life. -- The Scriptures are perfect, and able to
make perfect the man of God to every good work, 2 Timothy 3.16, 17. Here is Milk
for Babes, and meat for stronger men. -- Here the tallest Elephant may swim,
and the poorest Lamb may wade. Great and small, strong and weak may find
nourishment in the Scripture. Parvali, magni; fortes, infirmi habent in
Scripturis unde alantur and satientur.
Here we may find nourishment for our Knowledge, for our love, for our zeal,
patience, humility, and all our Graces. They are able to make a man wise to
Salvation. They nourish our Obedience.

Would thou then nourish thy Knowledge? Read here. The Scriptures are able
to make thee wise to Salvation.

Would thou nourish thy Faith? Read here upon those Faith-strengthening
Promises, God has made for that purpose.

Would thou nourish thy Love? Oh, Read here of the Love of God to thee; that
height, depth, that length and breadth of his love in Christ; That love that
passes Knowledge, And this will be a burning-Glass to kindle love and
affections to him. This will be as the Lodestone to draw thee. Read here of
the excellencies of God, which may draw thy affections.

Would thou nourish thy Humility? Oh, Read here, what thou wast by Nature.
Look into the Glass of the Law. That will discover thy vileness, lay thee in
the dust. Read Ezekiel. 16. See what a piece thou wast, and then be proud if thou
can.

Would thou nourish thy Zeal? Read here of the Zeal of others; which may
kindle Zeal in thee.

Would thou nourish thy Patience? Read here examples of Patience; in Job,
Jeremiah and others, whose long suffering will shame thy short breathed
impatience.

Would thou nourish thy fear of God? Why here see what is the excellency of
fear, etc.

3. Faith feeds upon Soul-fatning-Dainties: meat which the World knows not of,
As Christ said, -- I have meat, which you know not of: So Faith has meat,
which the World knows not of. As the life of a Christian is an hidden life: so
the food of a Christian, the meat of a Christian, is an hidden meat, an hidden
Manna.

Faith feeds upon Soul-fatning-dainties; choice food; the cream of nourishment;
and that is 1. Upon the Promises. 2. Upon Christ himself.


1. Faith feeds upon Soul-fatning-Promises. Indeed the whole Word of God is
food for Faith; both the Precept, and the Promise: But Faith feeds chiefly upon
the Promise, whereby it is enabled to walk in the Precept.

The whole Word of God is sincere Milk, whereby we grow: and the Old and New
Testament may be called, The Breasts of Consolation; but the New is the better
Breast. More of Gods heart and love runs in the New, than in the Old. The
Children of the Bondwoman suck at the Breast of the Old, at the Law: But the
Children of the Freewoman suck here, at this Breast, the Gospel.

Thus Faith, feeds, not only upon the Word: but the choice of the Word, the
Promises. Yea, and not only the Promises, but the choice and freest of the
Promises: the Cream, the spirits of Nourishment.

And according to the proportion of Faiths feeding hereon, such is the
proportion of strength and nourishment conveyed down into the Soul. He that
feeds sparingly, is but a spare Christian, gets but little strength: He that
eats liberally is strongly nourished.

The difference that we see in Christians here; some weak, others strong; Some
Infants and Babes, others Grown men, some thrown down with every blast of
Temptation, others able to stand out all assaults: The difference arises
hence, that some feed more sparingly, some more liberally by Faith upon the
Promises of Grace: and so some are stronger than others are.

If you grow not, it is because you feed not: you play with the Breast, you suck
not daily. A man may have meat before him, and yet dye, if he feed not. The
best feeder here is the best grower. The Larger the appetite, the stronger the
Christian. The more the soul does feed upon Promise, still the more strength is
conveyed to the soul, the more the soul is nourished.

2. Faith feeds upon a Soul-fatning- Christ. The choicest dish that Faith does
feed upon is Christ himself.

Christ is food for the Soul -- His Flesh is meat indeed, and his Blood is
Drink indeed. And he who feeds upon Christ most, is the most living, the most
growing, the most fatning Christian.

Christ is the breeder, and the feeder of spiritual life: the begetter and the
nourisher of life in us. Hence he is called -- The Bread of Life. Not only
bread to beget life in dead men: but bread to nourish and increase life in
living men. And by Faith we feed upon Christ; Faith is the Organ whereby we
feed upon Christ, and gets nourishment for it self, and all its fellow-Graces.

When Faith has had a good meal here, all the Graces of Gods Spirit are
bettered by it: our Love, Humility, etc. All are strengthened by it.

Now Faith feeds upon Christ 1. In the Word. 2. In the Sacrament.
Christ is Bread. 1. Spiritual. Panis Spiritualis. 2. Sacramental. Panis
Sacramentalis.


Christ is Spiritual Bread in the Word, to beget and increase life.

Christ is Sacramental Bread in Eucharist, to nourish and augment our Spiritual
life in us.

The one is Christ, in Ordinary. Christ in the Word is the Dayly-Bread for
Faith to feed upon.

The other is Christ Extraordinary, for Festival Gaudy-dayes.

And in this order Faith feeds on Christ.

First, Faith feeds upon Christ in the Word; and then Secondly, Faith feeds
upon Christ in the Sacrament.

None feed on Christ in the Sacrament, but they who have fed on Christ in the
Word.

By the one we have Union, by the other Communion with Christ: By the one
ingraftment into Christ, by the other we have nourishment from Christ. Christus
grandescit in Sanctis
By the one Christ is formed in us; by the other Christ grows up in us, to a
perfect man.

Faith thus feeds upon Christ, who is the sum of all nourishing things: who
is the heart, the staff of nourishment. Hence he is called Bread, which is the
staff of nourishment.

Christ is the heart of nourishment in the Word, in the Sacraments, in every
Ordinance: All which are but empty things, convey no spiritual strength to us,
if we feed not upon Christ in them.

If Christ do withdraw himself from the Ordinances; If we feed not upon Christ
in them, they will do us no good. If we feed not upon Christ in the Word, the
Word will not profit. If we feed not upon Christ in the Sacraments, the
Sacraments will not nourish.

Men may live out their days under the Ordinances; come to the Word, and to
the Sacraments; and yet, when all is done, be like Pharaohs lean Kine, never
the fatter for all this food, if they feed not upon Christ in them.

And it is suspicious, when men live under such precious Ordinances, and yet
grow no more, that surely they feed not on Christ.

Alas! Could we be so barren in our Graces, so lean in our lives, seeing we
go in such rich Pastures, and are fed with such precious dainties, the Word,
and Sacraments; if we fed upon Christ in these? No, my Brethren, this is the
great reason why we have such pined and starved souls: This is the reason of
all our weaknesses, our spiritual faintings, our declinings, our consumptions
under the Ordinances; we feed not upon the Spirits of nourishment; we feed
not upon Christ in them: Panem Domini, non Panem Dominum. Purum Elementum non
est Alimentum.
we let not Faith feed on Christ, and so are not nourished. We eat the Bread
of the Lord, but not the Bread which is the Lord: we feed upon the Elements,
not upon Christ. It is true here, The pure Elements are no nourishment. If
Christ run not through the Bread and Wine they nourish not.

Well then; would you have your Soul nourished? take your fill of these
Soul-refreshing-Dainties, whereby you may get strength. Here drink your fill.
The best measure is no measure. Bibite, and Inebriamini.


Feed upon the Promises, feed upon Christ, whereby you may be nourished. Feed
on Christ daily. Sometimes we have such a Feast on Christ, as, in the strength
of which (with Elijah) we go many days. God sometimes gives such abundance of
Refreshments, that the Soul goes cheerfully a long time. But this is not
Ordinary. And therefore there is need of our Daily feeding upon Christ. Christ
must be Daily-Bread for Faith to feed on. And it must be our Prayer for the
Soul, as well as for the Body -- Give us our Daily-Bread -- Bread for the Soul,
as well as Bread for the Body.

That Day, wherein Christ has not been fed on, is a Declining-day.

Thirteenth Royalty. 13. Faith is an Heart-Emptying-Grace. 13. Royalty of
Faith. Its an Heart emptying-Grace.

There are two things, which are the most natural acts of Faith.

1. It empties a man of himself. 2. It fills the Soul with Christ.
The Soul cannot be filled with Christ, whilst it is full of it self. And
therefore Faith does first empty a man of himself, cast a man out of himself,
and then fills the Soul with Christ.

Faith does cut a man off his own stock, the stock of Nature, the stock of
Death, before it does ingraft us into Christ, the Stock of Life. Faith does
strip a man of his own clothes, his own Garments, which are too short to cover
him, before it puts on the Robes of Christ. It throws us off from our own
bottom, whereon we stand, before it set a man upon another Foundation. It
makes a man poor in himself, before it enrich him with Christ. It empties a man
of himself, before it fill the Soul with Christ.

Now there are two things in general, which Faith does empty the Soul of, 1. Of
all Opinion of Righteousness in our selves. 2. Of all Opinion of strength to
help our selves.


1. It does empty the Soul of that windy conceit, that Pharisaical Opinion of
Righteousness in our selves. Faith does not empty a man of any Righteousness,
but of the false Opinion of Righteousness. It does not empty us of any worth in
our selves, there is none: but of that fond conceit of worth in our selves.
Faith makes us see we are worthless Creatures, Rev. 3.17.18. -- Thou say, I
am rich, and increased with goods: I have need of nothing. And know not,
that thou art wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. -- I
counsel thee to buy of me Cold, that thou may be rich, etc.

My Brethren; we are all of us naturally, full of our selves, full of our
selves, full of the self of Pride, full of the self of Love, Self-love, full of
Self-conceits, full of Self-sufficiency; we are apt to think highly to our
selves. We all hold of Adam in Capite; we are all full of Pride. As Pride was
the Fall of Adam, so it would be the ruin of us.

We think we are Rich, full, need nothing. As the Church did in the place
before quoted, Rev. 3.17, 18.

Thus, where Faith comes, it empties a man of himself, his Self-conceits; it
does discover our selves, to our selves; makes us see our selves, as we lie
weltring in blood, in our own blood, Ezekiel. 16.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. even in the Blood
of Guilt, and the Blood of Filth. It puts down those Towering thoughts, those
Ayery imaginations, those Mountainous conceits which men had of themselves. It
casts us out of our selves, makes us Nothing in our selves; makes us poor in
our selves, (...), as the word is, Mat. 5.3. -- Beggars in Spirit: Poor
Beggars. It makes us miserable in our selves, empty in our selves, blind,
naked, lost in our selves. Faith makes us to see all this in our selves*

Faith makes us see, in stead of Righteousness, there is nothing but Sin in us;
in stead of beauty, blackness; in stead of comeliness, deformity. It discovers,
there is nothing but Damnation and Hell in us; nothing but Hell in our parts,
Hell in our Principles; Nay, Hell in our prayers: That not our persons only;
but our prayers stand in need of Christ, that if he save not our prayers, as
well as our persons, our Prayers will damn us.

Faith is such a Grace as is raised up, upon the ruins of our selves, not the
Substance, but the Sin; the ruin of our sinful selves: the ruin of our self
of Pride, of Self-confidence, self-sufficiency; all which are thrown down,
before Faith be raised.

As the Shipmans Fatal Star, which they say, is never seen, but before wrack,
and death: so Faith is never seen, but before the wrack and death of sinful
nature, which has one wrack by Faith, but the Universal wrack by death. And
this is the first work, and the mighty work of Faith, which must be done,
before we come over to Christ. As the Opinion of something in themselves, was
that which kept off the Jews from coming to Christ; so it does us. And
therefore Faith empties us of this Opinion, makes us poor, that so we may be
fit to receive the Gospel. -- The poor receive the Gospel. The Gospel is but a
merciful Hospital for the relief of the Poor, Blind, Naked, Lame, and lost
sinners. Here Is nothing for those, who are Rich and Full, and think they want
nothing.

Faith empties the Soul of that Opinion of strength to help it self. Though a
man were convinced, he had nothing; yet if he have such a conceit as this,
That he can help himself; that he is able to recover and wind himself out of
that condition wherein he is: he would then stand upon his own bottom; be a
Buckler to himself, and would never come over to Christ.

That which kept the Prodigal from his Father, was not the Opinion of any
worthiness in himself; he saw he was poor and ready to famish; but he
thought he could recover himself, live of himself, without the help of a
Father. And this conceit kept him off.

So the Woman with the Bloody-Issue. It was not her opinion that she had no
need of Christ, which kept her off from coming to Christ, but she thought
she was able to purchase help out of her own store, without going to him: And
even to the last penny she conceited she should have help, when she had
spent all (not before.) Then she came. And, whilst a man has a conceit, that
he is able to work out his own Peace, compass his own happiness; Though he
be poor, yet conceits, he is able to enrich himself. Though naked, yet he is
able to weave a web of Righteousness, to cloth himself. Though in debt, yet
he is able to make payment. Though undone, yet he is able to recover himself.
I say, so long as a man has this conceit; thinks he has any strength of his
own, to wind himself out of the misery, into which he sees himself to be
plunged: so long he will never come over to Christ. This conceitedness will
keep off the Soul from Christ.

Men, you know, will rather make use of their own gold, than of others; of
their own clothes than of others; of their own friends, than of others; of
their own power, than of others. Men will dig to the Clay, (as Pliny says)
before they will go borrow water of their neighbors. Such a spirit there is in
man, that he will sound the bottom, try the utmost what he can do, before
he will call in for another help.

But now, when Faith comes, and discovers us, not only to be miserable, but
unable to extricate our selves out of this misery; not only to be poor, but
unable to enrich our selves; not only under the burden of sin, but unable to
cast off this burden; not only indebted, but unable to pay, in prison, but
unable to come forth: then will the soul hasten, and come over to Christ.

Now this is that which Faith does. It does not only empty a man of all opinion
of Righteousness in the discovery of his misery; but also it empties a man of
all that opinion of strength, to help himself out of this misery. 1 Neither do.
2 Nor suffer.

That he can neither do nor suffer any thing to relieve himself. That all his
doings and sufferings are too short to help him.

That the state of nature is not only a state of misery, but a state of
impotency, and utter disability to do any thing to help it self. Hence the
Apostle says, Romans 5.6, 8. -- That we were not only sinners, but -- without
strength; not able to help our selves out of this condition of sin. -- We were
dead in trespasses and sins. So that we were unable to do; or (if any thing)
yet dead works, such as set us further in debt, but wipe off no score. Hence
Christ says -- Without me ye can do nothing. All our actions are so many
Ciphers, so many Nothings.

1. We can do nothing to please God: our best works, but (...): The Gift of an
Enemy: The Sacrifice of Fools. -- They, that are in the flesh, cannot please
God.

2. We can do nothing, which is truly, really, and substantially Good. What
Nathaniel spoke doubtingly concerning Christ, Joh. 1.46. -- Can there any good
thing come out of Nazaret? may preremptorily be here affirmed. No good can
come out of an evil heart. No good fruit from a bad root. -- Do men gather
Grapes of Thorns? or Figs of Thistles? -- Who can bring a clean thing out of an
unclean? It Is impossible.

3. We can do nothing to settle a sound and substantial Peace in our
Consciences: though we skin them over for a time, calm and still them for a
time; yet we cannot work a sound cure, nor settle a substantial Peace there.

4. We can do nothing, which may purchase any blessing or favor from God. Non
ex merito operis; sed ex largitate donantis.
Though God reward the works of wicked men sometimes, as he did Ahab, Jehu,
Nebuchadnezzar: yet it is not That the works deserve a reward, but because he
is a plentiful rewarder?

Thus Faith discovers the impotency and utter dis-ability to help our selves.
Hence we are said

1. Not to be able to think a good thought.

2. Cor. 3.5. -- Not that we are sufficient of our selves, to think any thing,
as of our selves. All our sufficiency is of God.

2. Not to be able to understand, 1 Cor. 2.14. -- The natural man receives
not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him: nor can
he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

3. Not able to will any thing that is good, Phil. 2.13. -- God works the
will and the deed of his own good pleasure.

4. Not able to begin a good work, Phil 1.6. -- Being confident of this very
thing; that he that has begun a good work in you, will perform it until the
day of Jesus Christ.

5. Not able to perfect it, when it is begun to our hands, -- Isa. 26.12. --
Lord, thou have wrought all our works in us, or for us. So Romans 7.18. -- To
will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good, I find not.

There is a partial impotency in the hearts of the best; and this is more or
less according to the vigor and power of corruption in us. As you see in Romans
7.18. For I know, that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwells no good thing, for
to will is present, but not to perform.

But there is a total universal impotency in unregenerate men -- Every
Imagination, motion, figment of his heart being evil, only evil, every day.

But admit we could do any thing; could make as many prayers, as stars in
Heaven; weep as many tears, as the Sea holds drops; Nay could we do as much as
the tallest Angel in Heaven: all this would be too short to wind us out of our
misery, that sin casts us into.

2. We are not able to suffer, and by our sufferings to help our selves out of
this. If we should macerate and afflict our bodies; suffer all the miseries in
the world in way of satisfaction for the least sin: Alas! all would be too
little, too short, would not amount and come up to the least debt.

But what do I speak of this? If we could suffer as many thousand millions of
years torments in hell, as the World has stood minutes from the Creation: Nay,
and God should widen the capacities of the Soul; make a man more strong and
able to bear more wrath, make a man a larger vessel, to receive more torments,
that so in time, the springs of his Justice may be drawn dry, the treasures of
his wrath might be expended, and a full satisfaction be made; yet there would
be no time, no eternity of torment, wherein there would be enough endured, as
a full satisfaction for the least sin, for the least oath, thou have ever
sworn; for the least idle thought thou have ever conceived, etc. The reason is;
all this is but finite, and therefore cannot come up to satisfy for an offense
of infinite demerit.

Thus Faith empties a man, not only of opinion of Righteousness in himself, but
of opinion of helping himself by any strength of his own, out of this. Faith
will tell thee, There is an eternal Law violated, and thou can not make up
that: there is guilt of sin, and thou art not able to satisfy for that; God is
an enemy, and thou art unable to make him thy friend: God is angry, and thou
art unable to appease him: thou art liable to wrath, and not able to avoid it:
thou art under the Curse, and art unable to undergo it: art cast into debt, and
art unable to make payment.

All which being discovered to the soul, the soul falls down at Gods feet, and
says not with him in the Gospel -- Have patience with me, and I will pay thee
all: But -- Have mercy upon me, for I am unable to pay. -- God be merciful to
me a sinner.

Oh! This will make a soul fall down at the feet of God, and implore that mercy
of God, that he would cancel all the obligations; reverse all his Proceedings,
cross all Books; pardon all debts, between him and the soul.

Fourteenth Royalty. 14. Royalty of Faith. Its an Heart-inriching-Grace.
14 Faith is an Heart-inriching, and filling-Grace.
When Faith has once emptied a man of himself, makes him a fit receptacle:
then it fills his soul with Christ: when it has stripped a man of his own rags;
then it puts on the Garments of Christ: when it has made a man poor in
himself, it inriches the soul with Christ? when we are nothing in our selves,
then Christ is made all to us. Cor humile, est vacuum spirituale.
-- Wisdom, Justification, Sanctification and Redemption, 1 Cor. 1.30.

An humble empty heart is the vessel of all Grace. So much Emptiness, so much
Grace: Because humility does empty the heart for God to fill it. If the heart
be emptied once, it must needs be filled. Non datur vacuum.
Nature abhors emptiness, Grace much more.

Faith does enrich the soul with all the merits of Christ, with the Spirit of
Christ, Christ imputed, Christ imparted, Christ infused: with the Righteousness
of Christ for Justification: with the Holiness of Christ for Sanctification.
Faith will not want it, if Christ have it: Faith will not be poor, if Christ
be rich, will not be empty, if Christ be full. Ego non sum meriti inops,
quamdiu ille non est inops miserationum. Bernard.
-- I cannot be poor (says Bernard) so long as God is rich: his Riches are
mine: Of his fullness I receive Grace for Grace.

Christ indeed is a Fountain, but he is a Fountain sealed up: He is a
Treasure, but he is a Treasure locked up to an unbeleeving heart. Faith is the
Key that unlocks this Treasure, opening the Treasuries of Heaven, making an
inlet of all the Glory of Christ. Faith gives the soul communion with all the
Riches of Christ. So far as it is possible for Christ to be communicated; he
is made ours by Faith; by it there is a conveyance made of all the great
revenues of Christ. The great stock, which Christ did purchase by his Blood, is
passed over to the believing soul. There is a Deed of Gift made to such;
wherein I say, Not the whole Righteousness of the Mediator; Non tota Justitia
Mediatoris, sed Justitia tota Mediatoria.
his essential and incommunicable Righteousness: but his whole Mediatory
Righteousness; that Righteousness which Christ purchased for us as Mediator,
the Righteousness of his active and passive obedience; by the one doing our
services, by the other bearing our scourges; by the one as was said before,
answering Gods commanding Justice, by the other answering Gods condemning
Justice: the one in Praemium, to free us from wrath: the other in Pretium, to
entitle us to Glory: all this is made ours.

As Boaz said to his Kinsman -- Marry the Woman, and the Field is thine: So
when once by Faith we are married to Christ, his Blood is ours, his merits
ours, his Spirit ours: all are ours: Faith gives us a propriety in all. Tu vita
mea; ego mors tua. Tu coelum meum; ego gehenna tua. Tu Justitia mea; ego
p^ccatum tuum. Tu divitiae meae; ego paupertas tua.
So that Faith may break forth into this rapture with that Father. -- Lord, I
am thy death; thou art my life; I am thy Hell; thou art my Heaven; I am thy
sin, thou art my Righteousness; I am thy poverty, thou art my Riches. And all
the Riches which Christ did purchase with his Blood (and sit down and think
what the Blood of Christ, the Blood of God (as the Apostle calls it, by
communication of Properties) what this might buy out, at the hands of a Father)
why all this is made thine by Faith.

So that you see, Faith is a Soul-inriching-Grace. It gives a man not only
Title, and interest into a Soul-inriching-God, a Soul-inriching-Christ, a
Soul-inriching-Treasure: but gives the soul the possession and injoymnet of all
this. By Faith we possess God; enjoy God, and by no other way, but by Faith in
Christ.

Though Faith be poor in it self, the poorest Grace of all, as having nothing
of its own; such a Grace as lives all upon another stock, is fed with another
food; rich by another riches; as the Apostle said of himself -- He was poor,
yet making many rich; having nothing, yet possessing all things: so I may say
of Faith. Though it be poor in it self, yet it makes us rich, does enrich us
with all the riches of Christ, though it has nothing in it self; yet it
possesses all things, it possesses Christ, which is all.

Oh! If you be rich in Faith, you cannot be poor in Grace, Quantum credimus,
Tantum amamus, Quantum credimus, Tantum speramus. Says Aug.
poor in Holiness: Faith sanctifies. So much Faith, so much Grace; so much
Faith, so much Love: so much Faith, so much Hope; so much Faith, so much
Humility; so much brokenness of spirit for sin; so much Patience, Zeal, etc.
Never was it known a strong Believer to be a weak Christian. So much Faith
write down, so much Grace. Little in Faith, and little in Grace; little in
love, etc. Grace is still proportionable to the measure and degrees of Faith,
like the fountain and the flood. Hence Faith is called the Mother-Grace, 2.
Pet. 1.2, 3. -- Grace and Peace be multiplied on you by the Knowledge of God:
(...): By the acknowledgement; that is, by Faith. The augmentation of Faith
does cause the multiplication of Grace; not in the kinds only, but in the
degrees. The more Faith in degrees, the more Grace. Grow in Faith, and you grow
in all Grace. Decrease in Faith, and all the Graces of God decrease in thee.
There is decay of Love, of Joy, of Patience. The ground of all decays, is the
decay of Faith.

Well then. To draw to a conclusion of this; you see Faith is an
inriching-Grace.

1. It inricheth the understanding with knowledge, with heavenly wisdom, which
is better than gold. It makes the Head a storehouse of divine knowledge.

There is some Knowledge before Faith. Scientia Principiorum; the Knowledge of
Principles. But the best Knowledge is after Believing. -- We believe and know,
says John. First believe, and then know. Creed, ut intelligas: believe, that
thou may understand. Hence David, Psalm. 119. -- Teach me good Judgment,
for I have believed thy Word. Not that I may believe: but -- for I have
believed.

Non possunt discere, qui nolunt credere. Addiscentem oportet credere.
Hence Augustine, upon Heb. 4.2. ( -- The Word did not profit them, because it
was not mixed with Faith in them, that heard it) says, -- They cannot learn;
because they will not believe. He that would learn, must believe.

As Knowledge of things revealed goes before Faith; so Faith goes before the
exact understanding, and clear apprehensions of them. How shall a man be able
to understand these heavenly Mysteries in the Word; all which are far above
Reason. The Mystery of the Trinity, the Mystery of Christ, in whom there is
nothing but Mysteries.

His Person a Mystery; his Nature; his Works; all Mysteries, 1 Timothy 3.16. --
Without Controversy great is the Mystery of godliness; God manifested in the
flesh; justified in the spirit; seen of Angels; preached unto the Gentiles;
believed on in the World; received up into Glory. That he should be God-Man;
mortal, and immortal: That there should be such greatness, and such baseness:
such infiniteness, and yet such finiteness in one person. These are all
Mysteries.

Hence Christ is called ( Isa. 9.6.) Wonderful; because all is wonderful in
Christ; he is wonderful in his Person, in his Nature, in his offices, in the
managing of them. A chain of wonders.

So the Creation a Mystery, Resurrection a Mystery. Christian Religion is
nothing else but a bundle of holy Mysteries.

Which, how shall any man understand, until first he believe: He that seeks
to know before he believe, shall never know.

The best way to know, is to shut your eyes, captivate Reason, and Believe: and
then you shall see and know.

Thus you see, Faith inricheth with Spiritual Knowledge.

2. As Faith inriches the Understanding, the Head with Knowledge; so it
inriches the Heart with Grace. It makes the Heart a Treasury of divine and holy
Graces. The least of which are worth all the Riches of the World.

Divines set down four invaluable things.

1. The Favor of God in Christ. 2. The Souls of Men. 3. The Spirit. 4. The
Graces of the Spirit.
1. The Favor of God; That Is invaluable, Psalm. 63.3. -- Thy loving kindness is
better than Life. And Life is the most precious thing a man has in the World
-- Skin for Skin, and all a man has will he give for his life. The Devil was
right there. Now Gods loving kindness is better than Life.

2. The Souls of Men. -- What will it profit a man to gain the whole World, and
lose his Soul? Christ sets the gain of the whole World against the loss of one
Soul. He puts one Soul in one Balance, and the whole World in another. And one
Soul weighs down all. -- What will it profit? its too light. All that gain
cannot make up this loss. It is an incomparable loss, because an irrecoverable
loss; once lost, lost for ever. There Is no recovery of a lost soul. Though a
man may lose other things, yet may he recover them again: Man may lose Riches,
etc. but not his Soul, when once lost for want of believing.

3. The third invaluable, is the Spirit: not to be -- bought with silver or
gold. Hence Peter told Simon-Magus, when he would have bought the Spirit. --
Thy money perish with thee. Think thou the Gift of God may be bought with
money?

4. The Graces of the Spirit. The least of which does weigh down all the World.
The least grain of Grace, of Love, of Repentance, of godly sorrow, Humility, is
worth ten thousand Worlds. -- Faith is more precious than gold, says Peter.
Now these are the Riches, that Faith does possess the Soul of, the invaluable
Riches of Grace.

Other Riches God deals out promiscuously, and -- No man knows either love or
hatred, by any thing before him. A man may do wickedly and prosper, as it was
said of Antiochus Epiphanes. Dan. 8.24, ^5.
These Riches Gods enemies do share in, as well as his friends. Nay, and have
often the greatest share, the greatest portion, Job 21.7. Jer. 12.1. Dives may
have more wealth; Saul more command; Agrippa more gorgious apparel, than the
dearest of Gods Saints.

But now these are such Riches as God bestows upon none but Believers, --
Abraham gave portions to the Sons of the Concubines, and sent them away: but
unto Isaac he gave all he had. Rex honores dignis.


Other Riches may be taken away. A man may be rich to day, and poor to
morrow. -- The Lord has given, Dominus dedit; Dominus abstulit.
the Lord has taken away. Both with one breath. Hence the wise man. -- Riches
make themselves wings, and fly away. But these are abiding Treasure: A
Treasure, whose spring is in Heaven; whose Foundation is in Christ. -- Our life
is hid with Christ in God: not only hid for secrecy: but hid for safety. It is
a safe life, an abiding life.

Nay, but if they should continue: yet will they do us no good in the day of
trouble. They cannot save our souls from, nor in the day of wrath. They cannot
save us from sickness, nor from death; not from Hell. Nor are they able to
mitigate our Torments, to purchase one drop of water in that lake of fire. What
profit had Ahab of his Vineyard? Baltazar of his cups? Dives of his wealth?
Judas of his thirty-pence? Agrippa of his gay apparel? The rich fool of his
full barns? All these would do them no good. Neither quench, nor bribe these
flames; but rather afford Oil to increase them.

But now Grace; that riches, which Faith does enrich us withal; it is such as
will uphold us in sickness, be a choice cordial in that bitter potion; it will
deliver us in death, save us in the day of wrath, and enable us to lift up our
heads with joy and boldness in the day of Judgment, that terrible day of the
Lord, when the wicked shall tremble before the Judge, and call upon the
Mountains to fall upon them, and the Hills to cover them from the presence of
him that sits on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.

Have thou other riches, and want thou Faith? Have thou Mountains of Gold,
Rocks of Diamonds, shores of Rubies? And want thou Faith? want thou
Grace? Oh! thou art a poor man.

Thus you see, Faith is an Heart-inriching-Grace. A Believer has title to all.

A Believer is the poorest and the richest man in the World. As none is poorer
than a godly man in himself; so none is richer than a Believer in Christ. --
He is as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. Christ is the Heir of
all things. All are yours, if you be Christ's. No sooner can the soul say --
Christ is mine; but he may say -- His Blood is mine, his Spirit mine; his
Glory mine; all is mine.

Christ and all his are conveyed and made over by the same Deed of Gift. Hence
the Apostle says -- We are made partakers of Christ: Not of some part: but of
Christ; all Christ; not of Justification only; but say Christ, and there is all.

Fifteenth Royalty. 15. Royalty. Faith is an Heart-raising-Grace.
15. Faith is an Heart-raising-Grace.
There is a threefold Death, that Faith does raise up the soul from.

1. The Death of Sin. 2. The Death of inward Trouble. 3. The Death of outward
Trouble.
1. Faith raises up the soul from the Death of Sin. We are all of us -- Dead
(by nature) in trespasses and sins, Ephesians. 2.1. Dead-Born. And as dead men, so
we have no notion to spiritual things, no motion, no strength to any good; no
sense, being insensible of the weight of sin, insensible of mercies and
judgments: we have no desires after any thing good, no affection to them.

And a Death it is, not only Privative, A mere absence and privation of
spiritual life; but a Positive Death, wherein there is an Introduction of a
Positive vicious Habit. As in Natural Death, there is not only a Privation of
Life, of the former form: but the Position of another form: there is another
form left in the body. So in Spiritual Death, there is not only a mere Absence,
a bare Privation of Life: But there is a Positive Evil, and Vicious Habit left
in the soul. Hence, Heb. 9.14. The works of natural men are called -- Dead
works. There would be a contradiction in calling them Dead works, if
unregenerate men were only deprived of spiritual life, and had not another
positive evil form in them.

Thus dead we are then, not only Privatively, but Positively.

And it is Faith which does raise up the Soul from the Death of Sin, to the
Life of Grace. Faith is the Resurrection of the Soul from under the spiritual
death, the Death of Sin.

The first rise of the Soul from the Death of Sin, is by believing. Vita sancta
a^ fide sumit initium.

(...). Chrysostom. (...).

Fide regeneramut. Calv. Resipiscentia non modo fidem subsequitur; sed ex ea
noscitur. Calv. ibid.

(...).

Fides justificationem praecipit; sanctificationem efficit. Tilen.


An holy life has its rise from Faith. The Fountain of all our spiritual
Graces. The worker of all good things: That which begets Love, Fear,
Repentance. Hence Calvin says, Faith regenerates.

Repentance does not only follow Faith; but does arise from Faith. Hence
Clemens Alexandrinus. -- Faith is the first awakening, the first inclination of
the Soul to Christ.

Hence by some, Faith, and the New Creation: Faith, and Sanctification do
differ as much as the Cause and the Effect. -- Faith is the Instrument of
Justification: but the efficient of Sanctification.

They, who distinguish Regeneration, which is part of our Vocation, and
Sanctification, do make Faith and Sanctification differ as much as Cause, and
Effect. Vocation (say they) produces Faith, and Faith being begotten produces
Sanctification both habitual and ^ctual: Hence it is called the Mother-Grace.

But they (who make Vocation and Sanctification all one, and both to be
nothing else but our inherent Righteousness; or those Habits, that frame of
Grace implanted in the Soul, (whereof Faith is a part) they do say; Faith does
not produce the Cause of the Habits of Graces: but Faith produces the acts of
Grace, of Love, Repentance, etc. Faith does not produce the Habits, but the
acts of Grace.

For the clearing of this. Sanctification may be considered as it is either,
In actu primo, vel secundo.
1. Habitual. Or 2. Actual.


1. For our Habitual Sanctification, There we say, the Spirit of God is the
only Cause; and Faith is an Effect as well as others: Faith is a part of our
inherent Sanctification.

2. For our Actual Sanctification, or as those Habits do act and exercise; and
there we say, Faith does help to produce the acts of Grace, of Love, of
Repentance, 1 Timothy 1.5. -- Love out of a pure heart, and a good Conscience, and
of Faith unfeigned. Faith does not only lend an hand to its Fellow-Graces, for
the perfecting of Grace; but Faith does help to produce the Acts of Grace; the
Acts of Love, of Repentance, Zeal, Patience, etc.

Though at the same time they be all implanted, yet in Nature Faith has the
precedence, and helps to produce the Acts of all the rest.

As God the Father is before the Son in Nature, yet not in Time. He is not a
Father till he have a Son. So is it to be understood concerning Faith, and
all other Graces.

2. Faith raises us up from the Death of inward Troubles. As the sense of Gods
Love, the apprehension of his favor is the life of the Soul, Psalm. 30.5. -- In
his favor is Life. So the sense of Gods Displeasure is the Death of the Soul,
Psalm. 88.10. Shall the Dead arise to praise thee? He speaks of that spiritual
Desertion in which he was, laboring under the sense of Gods wrath and
displeasure; which he calls the Death of the Soul. -- Shall the Dead arise to
praise thee? Shall my Soul, dead and sunk with discouragements, and
apprehensions of thy wrath; Shall it arise to praise thee? So that this is the
Death of the Soul.

Now, Faith does raise the Soul up from this Death. When the Soul seems to be
sunk and buried under the apprehensions of Gods displeasure, is slain with
discouragements, lies gasping and breathing for comfort. The least touch of the
Promise by Faith does raise up and revive the Soul, and fetches a man to life
again.

All the while that sense works, a man sinks deeper and deeper into this sad
condition. But let sense sit still, and Faith come in, and act its part; and
the Soul cannot lie so low in Trouble, but it will raise it up, Psalm. 77.10. --
I said, this is my Death; yet will I remember the years of the right hand of
the most high, etc.

What a precious thing is Faith? It is called precious Faith. And so it is
indeed; that is able to work such wonders in the Soul, in an instant.

What a Cordial is this! when a man is in swounding, and fainting-fits, that
one taste of the Promise by Faith, will fetch him to life again, when the soul
lies in the dust, under sad apprehensions, heavy Agonies, sinking and dying;
one dram, one grain of Faith, will fetch him to life again, set him on his feet
again, walking and leaping, and praising God. This is precious Faith indeed.

Now, for the manner how Faith does work for the raising up of the Soul from
under these spiritual Troubles, we will only add these particulars.

1. Faith does in this condition look back upon soul-raising-Experiences. It
causes a man to consider the days of old, the years of ancient time; as David
did, in the same condition, Psalm. 77.5.

It makes a man revive those former experiences of Gods Love; those former
workings; those fore-past evidences; those broken Rings, Pledges, Love Tokens,
which have passed betwixt God, and the Soul.

Such a time he took me up into his Chariot, and spoke friendly to me: Such
a time, I sat down under his shadow, and his Banner over me was love: Such a
time he took me down into his Winecellar, stayed me with Flaggons: Such a
time he brake into my soul, discovered himself to me a Reconciled God; gave
me an earnest of his love, a testimony that he manifested himself to me;
came and supped with me; gave me the White stone, the Hidden Manna, the New
Name, etc.

This is the Act of Faith. Thus does it produce the former evidences and
experiences of Love; and from these does take up arguments to raise the Soul,
in this dark condition.

Why, will Faith say? Once a Father, and ever a Father. Once a Friend, and
never an Enemy. Though we change, yet God does not change -- With him there is
no variableness, nor shadow of change. His carriage may alter, his heart
cannot. His expression may vary, his Affections cannot. God has spoken Peace,
and he will never unsay what he has said. He has given me sure evidences,
and he will never take them away again, though he may withhold the comfort of
them. He that has been gracious, will be gracious. Men shut their hands,
because they have opened them: but because he has once opened his hands, he
will never shut them.

2. Faith looks upon Soul-raising-Promises. Such as are not only made for
support, but for deliverance. -- I will not contend for ever, nor will I be
always wroth, least the Spirit which I have made should fail before me, and
the Soul which I have created. I was angry with him, I hid my face from him.
But I will heal him, I will lead him also, and restore comfort to him, and to
his mourners, Isa. 57.16, 17, 18. For a moment I have forsaken thee; but with
everlasting kindness have I had compassion on thee, says the Lord thy
Redeemer, etc. Isa. 54.8, 9, 10, 11. -- Zion said, the Lord has forsaken me:
My God has forgotten me! Can a Woman forget her child, that she should not
have compassion on the Son of her womb? Yea they may: but I will never forget
thee. Behold, I have Graven thee upon the Palms of my hands: thy ways are ever
in my sight.

These and such like promises Faith looks upon. It does not so much look at the
Face of God; Gods outward carriage and expression in the condition, as at the
Heart of God, and his inward affection, which lies in the Promise.

Full well Faith knows, The Ground of Comfort does not lie in the Face of God,
the aspects of God. If so, then our comforts could not be stable. This alters,
as we alter, changes, as we change: But the ground of Faiths comfort lies in
the Promises: and thither it has recourse, when from Outward appearance it can
get no comfort.

Sense looks upon the face of God only, upon his outward presence: But Faith
looks upon the Heart of God in the Promise, where it sees a Calmy heart under a
Stormy countenance; inward Smiles, though outward frowns, Inward Affections of
Love, under Outward expressions of displeasure.

As Joseph had the affections of a brother, under the expressions of an Enemy.
He could put on expressions of an enemy; An angry countenance: but yet not put
off Affections of a brother; A loving heart: so is it often with God.

And therefore Faith does view him in The Promise, has recourse thither; as
you see poor David had, in the like case, Psalm. 77. to the tenth verse. He was
in sad Conditions, and nothing could raise him. God absented himself from him:
He fell to Praying, to Complaining: but yet no comfort came. -- He complained
and his spirit was overwhelmed. He was so far from Ease by this, that his
Spirit was more oppressed. Nay -- He called to remembrance times past. All this
why comfort came not in. At last he betakes himself to the Promise, has
recourse to the Covenant: and then his Soul revived, ver. 10.

Thus Faith looks upon the firmness of the Covenant, the stability of the
Promise, and is raised, revived. Read Isa. 49.14, 15. Isa. 54. from seven to
eleven, which are Soul-raising-promises.

3 Faith lays hold upon a soul-raising-Christ. Upon whom whosoever does lay
hold, he will pull him out of the deepest waters. If a man under water have
hold of any thing above him, it will pull him out, he shall not sink. So here,
when we are overwhelmed in these deep waters; if, by Faith the Soul lay hold
on Christ, it will bear him up, and bring him forth, John 12.46. -- I am come a
light into the world (says Christ) that whosoever believes in me, should not
abide in darkness. The least touch of Christ by Faith, does raise up and
revive the Soul in this sad Condition.

As the dead man was raised to life, and revived, but by touching the dead
bones of Elisha, 2 King. 13.21. so the Dead Soul, if it do but touch the Dead
and crucified body of Christ by Faith, is raised up and revived, Such a virtue
and influence comes from Christ, as does raise up and comfort the Soul.

Thus Faith does raise the heart by laying hold of Christ. He, who raised up
himself, will raise up all his members. If our head had been still under water,
we had then perished: but he being risen, will raise us up also being his
members.

4 Faith inables a man to put up Soul-raising-prayers; indites
Soul-raising-prayers, strong Prayers, and cries to God. As Prayer helps Faith:
So Faith helps Prayer. It inables a man to wrestle with God, now in the Dark of
desertion, as it did Jacob in the Dark of the Night. Yea, and to wrestle with
him, by his own strength, the strength of his Covenant, of his promise, of his
Christ.

In which Encounter, Faith will take up arguments, 1 From it self. 2 From God.


1 From it self: By presenting its miserable Condition in the absence of God:
That all his own work is ready to sink, and die, to come to nothing; if he help
not. Oh! (will Faith say) Lord, my flesh fails, my heart fails, my strength
fails, my spirit fails. Oh! Come down before I dye: come, strengthen the things
that are ready to dye in me.

This argument David took up, Psalm. 143.7. -- Hear me speedily, O Lord, my
spirit fails. Oh! Hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go
down into the Pit. So Psalm. 39.10, 12, 13. -- Take thy plague from me, I am
consumed by the stroke of thy hand, etc. Hear my prayer, O Lord, hearken to my
cry. Keep not silence at my tears, for I am a stranger with thee; a sojourner
as all my Fathers were -- Oh! spare a little, that I may recover strength
before I go hence, and be no more.

2 Faith will take up arguments from God.

1 From the justice and truth of God, He has promised never to leave nor
forsake his people.

2 From the immutability of God. -- Thou art JEHOVAH, thou changest not:
therefore the Sons of Jacob are not consumed, Mal. 3.6. Thou never repentest of
thine own work. Thou never have wooed my heart, to lose it again. Thou never
tookest my heart, to leave it again, and take thy heart clean away. Thou never
did set thy heart on me, to take it off again.

3 From the power of God. Abraham at a plunge was supported with this strong
staff of Comfort, when though by Gods command he was to sacrifice his Son
Isaac, yet he accounted that God was able to raise him up even from the dead,
Heb. 11.19. Lord, if thou will, thou can, Mat. 8.2.

4 From the mercy of God. Lord, thou art gracious and merciful; ready to
relieve. It Is true, I am a sinner, but thou art a Savior. I am sinful: but
thou art merciful. I am impious; but thou art gracious. I have done that, Ego
admisi unde me damnare potes: Tu non amisisti unde me salvare soles.
for which thou might damn me: but thou have not lost that, by which thou
may save me. True, I am not worthy of a smile from Heaven. I have deserved
to be sent from darkness here, to everlasting darkness hereafter: from this
partial, to total and universal darkness. But Lord, proportion not thy dealings
to me, according to my deservings from thee. Let not the strong God take a
pattern from my weakness, good God, do not ever remember my evil, least thou
forget thine own goodness, thine own mercy. O bone Do-^^ mine, noli recordare
malum moum, ne obliviscaris bonum tuum.
But, thou, who art found of them, who seek thee not; Oh! Be mercifully found
of a soul, who seeks thee.

Thus will Faith work it self out of trouble, and gather arguments to prevail
with God, for deliverance.

It will take up arguments, From Soul-raising-Attributes. From
Soul-raising-Promises. From Soul-raising-Relations. From
Soul-raising-Experiences.


It will incompass God with Gods own strength. And God cannot, because he will
not deny. God will not reject his own strength, not strive against his own
mercy, not resist his own Spirit, not falsify his own Truth; but will raise
up, and revive the Soul.

Thus you see, Faith is a Soul-raising-Grace. Where Unbeleef holds the soul
under water, buries the soul in these sad conditions; Faith raises up and
reviveth it. A believing soul cannot long lie under trouble. If all the Power,
Truth, and Mercy of God will fetch him out, he shall be sure to be
delivered. Faith ingages and sets a work all these to help.

Oh! The Reason, my Brethren why you lie so long in spiritual Agonies, buried
up in spiritual troubles, is, because you let not Faith come in to work for
you; let Faith have her perfect work, and it will raise you.

Sixteenth Royalty. 16. Faith is an Heart-chearing-Grace.
16. Royalty. Faith is an Heart-chearing Grace.
Faith is such a Grace as does cheer and comfort the soul with unexpressible
Consolations: It is such a Grace as makes an inlet of all the Consolations of
God into the Soul.

Faith brings a report to the Soul, that God is his God, Christ is his Christ:
that his Name is written in the Book of Life: his sins are pardoned: his soul
shall be saved. And such news as this must needs fill the soul with
unexpressible Consolations, with joys unspeakable and full of glory.

All other joys are but mad, and disorderly joys. They are carnal, not
spiritual; outward, not inward joys; they are but painted, not true Joys,
imaginary, not real Joys, unsatisfying, not tull Joys; inconstant, not stable
Joys. The best, false Raptures; Anabaptistical Illusions: not true Joys.

But this Joy. The Joy of Faith, it is grounded joy; it is 1. A spiritual Joy,
for the Nature of it. 2. A Hearty Joy, for the Nature of it. 3. A Satisfying
Joy, for the fullness of it. 4. A Constant Permanent Joy, for the duration of
it. -- My Joy shall no man take from you.


Alas! what are all other joys to the Joy of Faith? The least morsel of this
Joy, is worth all the full meals of worldly delights. The least gleaning of
this Joy, is worth the whole Harvest of carnal mirth. The least drop of this,
is worth an Ocean of any other. There is more moisture in one drop of this,
than in a flood of temporal, and carnal delights.

True Joy grows upon the stock of Faith. Where there is no Faith, there is no
true Joy. Faith is the Root, and Joy is the Fruit. It is called, The Joy of
Believers: Believers are the Subjects of it; and a Joy in Believing: Believing
is the Root of it, Romans 5.1.2. -- Being justified by Faith, we have Peace with
God, through our Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also through Faith we have access
into this Grace wherein we stand, rejoicing under the hope of the Glory of
God, Romans 15.13. -- The God of Hope fill you with all Joy and Peace in
Believing. Where there is Faith, there is Joy.

If Faith of Evidence, Ubi Fiducia, ibi Laetitia.
there Joy does naturally result and arise from it: If but Faith of Adherence,
there Joy is hid and secret, though it does not appear. The seed of Joy is hid
as yet under the Clods of Faith; but in time it will break forth and appear.
Joy is there though it be not seen.

There may be a divorce between Faith and actual rejoicing for a time; but
there can be no divorce between Faith, and the Matter, and Ground of
Rejoicing: not between Faith and the Affection of Joy. -- My Joy shall none
take from you.

Thus you see Faith is an Heart-chearing-Grace. It fills the soul with such a
Joy, as nothing is able to bereave the soul thereof. It is not Losses, Crosses,
Poverty, Sickness, Prisons, Persecutions, which are able to take away this Joy
of Faith.

1. Faith will enable a man to rejoice in Bonds, to rejoice in Tribulations and
Sufferings for Christ, as the Apostle says -- As Sufferings abound, the
Consolations shall superabound. As if all the floods of Consolation did issue
from the spring of Sufferings.

2. It will enable a man to rejoice in sickness. Faith will be our best
Cordial, and let in such a beam of Gods love into the Soul, as will cheer and
comfort the heart in this condition: warm and inlighten it: not only inlighten,
but warm the heart in this condition.

3. It will enable a man to Rejoice in Poverty, in Calamity, in Famine. You see
Habakkuks confidence, Hab. 3.17, 18. -- Although the Figtree do not blossom,
nor shall there be fruit in the Vines; though the labor of the Olive shall
fail, and the field shall yield no meat: though the sheep be cut off from the
Fold, and there be no Bullock in the stall; yet I will rejoice in the Lord: I
will joy in the God of my Salvation.

Though the waters of Calamity should rise so high as to drown up all his
comforts: yet he could rejoice in God.

In the absence of all worldly comforts, Faith can let in springs of
Consolation from God, to rejoice the Soul. If God, if Christ, if Glory can
rejoice the heart, Faith will not want matter of Joy in the saddest condition.
It is an Heart-chearing Grace. Faith will present to man
Soul-rejoycing-grounds. There are these five grounds of Rejoicing.

1. Our Election.

Hence Christ says, -- Rejoice that your Names are written in the Book of Life.

2. Our Redemption. 3. Our Justification. 4. Our Sanctification. 5. The
Promises and Hopes of Glorification.
And Faith presents all these grounds of rejoicing. It makes a discovery to the
soul, that we are Gods chosen, such as he has elected; that we are his
Redeemed ones, such as he has purchased, that we are his Justified ones,
such as he has pardoned: that we are his holy ones, such as he has
sanctified: and shall be hereafther glorified.

And; when such a report is made to the soul, from Heaven; when Faith has been
in Heaven, and brings this news down to the soul; how can it be but the Soul
must rejoice, and be filled with all Consolations?

Object. But alas! you will say, Who are more sad? who are more disconsolate
than Believers are? And therefore, how is Faith an Heart-chearing-Grace?

Ans. 1. Believers may rejoice, and thou not discern it.

It is a Joy which is not known but by experience. Hence the Apostle says, --
It is a Joy that passes all understanding. None know it, but they who feel it.
-- A stranger does not intermeddle with this Joy. As they cannot feel it, so
they cannot see it: and therefore are no Competent Judges, whether Gods people
are joyful, or whether they be sorrowful.

2. But to answer further. You say, Believers are sad and disconsolate people.

1. All Believers are not so. They are such as are 1. Under some present cross
and affliction. Gods hand is gone out against them; though for good. -- For all
things work together for good to them that love God, and are chosen according
to his purpose. But I say, some present evil is upon them; and this may sadden
the spirits of the best for a time, though this may be their infirmity.

Paul had learned in all estates therein to be content; and if to be content,
then to rejoice, unless it were Contentation by force; sure not well pleasing
to God.

If indeed their comfort did lie in the presence and enjoyment of these outward
things, then no marvel, if in the absence of them, they were cast down. I say,
If the floods of their comfort were maintained by such springs as these, then
no marvel, if these being taken away, they be bereave of their Joy.

But seeing these things are too short either to breed, or feed: either to
beget, or fuel a Christians Joy: why should the deprival of them so much affect
the heart, as to take away their Joy?

Have you not still the ground of Joy? you have lost your goods, but not your
God. You are deprived of your Comforts, not of your Christ. And therefore
except you do make Gods of the Creature, prize them too highly in your
Judgment, engage your hearts and affections too much to them: why should your
Joy be taken away?

You see Paul had learned in all estates to be content, and the Prophet
Habakkuk before mentioned: and why not you?

2. Such they are, as for the present are under some sad and sore Temptation,
combat with Satan, and for the present their spirits are sadned, and cast down.

3. Such as are in deserted conditions; God having withdrawn himself, and hid
his face from the Soul. Than which there is no sadder condition in the World,
when not a Star, but the Sun it self is rent from the Sky; when not a single
Comfort, but the universal Comfort seems to be gone. This may sadden the
spirit of Gods people for a time.

All Jobs crosses did not so much affect him as this. The loss of his Goods, of
his Possession, of his Children came not so near him, as the apprehension of
the loss of his God. He could lift up his head under all the other: but here
he was ready to sink.

Such a Condition Gods people may be in, which may cause sadness of spirit, as
was David, Heman, Hezekiah, and others.

2. So secondly for those of Gods people, that are thus sad and disconsolate;
it is not as they are Believers, but as they are Doubters. Their Trouble
arises from Doubting, not from Believing. It is not Faith, but the want of
Faith, which is the cause of their uncomfortable walking.

If Gods people would live more out of themselves, and more in Christ: if they
would live more the Life of Faith, and less the Life of Sense: if they would
live more in the Heaven of Promise, they would not be so much cast down. The
more trust, the less Trouble.

Faith would bring Christ into the Soul; and there is cheer enough with Christ.

Faith would bring Heaven into the soul, and there is Comfort enough in Heaven.

Faith would open a way for the Love of God to enter, and that would thrust out
all other grievances.

But I will not go about to excuse uncomfortable walking with God. Why should I
give indulgence to men's Passions. Gods people are to be exceedingly blamed for
their unchearful walking with God.

They are the shame of a good God, and give occasion to men to think he is an
hard and rigid Master.

They wrong a good Cause, and discourage the hearts of others from entering into
the ways of God.

Sure I am, There is no Condition, that Gods people can be in, but they have
always ground, and cause of Rejoicing.

Either, A Rebus exhibitis, from things bestowed,
Or, A Rebus promissis, from things promised.
Either, From things in hand, and possession,
Or, From things in hope, and promise.
And therefore how blameworthy are they, who disquiet themselves with needless
perplexities? and lay the burden of sorrow on themselves, which God does not?

Let us examine the grounds of these sorrows, and arraign them before the Bar
of right Reason. What is it that troubles thee?

1. Is it thy former sins? why should these trouble thee? God has pardoned
them. And will thou bring the old guilt upon thy conscience again, which God
has cleared and pardoned? will thou bind, when God has loosed? condemn, when
he has absolved?

2. Is it thy present Corruption? God has promised to subdue it. -- Sin shall
have no more dominion over you. He has promised to purge, to purify: He
came with Refiners fire, and Fullers soap, Mal. 3.3.

3. Is it thy Imperfections? That there is so much formality, so little power?
so much coldness, so little heat, etc? why God has promised to pass by
infirmities, to hide and cover imperfections.

4. Is it, because thou art in some present Afflictions? why, he has
promised, that All things shall work together for good to them that love God,
and are chosen according to his purpose.

5. Is it, because thou art under some present Temptations? why St. James says
-- Count it exceeding joy, great joy, when ye fall into diverse temptations.

There is matter of Joy as well as of Sorrow, if by Faith thou would but see
what God aims at.

1. It may be, for trial of Grace; as in Abraham's and Jobs case; whose
temptation was of purpose to try and justify his Graces.

2. It may be, For exercise of Grace, of Faith, of Patience, etc.

3. It may be, for discovery of sin, nay for destruction of sin.

4. It may be, to make us more humble, as Paul: more prayerful, etc.

6. Is it because thou art under some present Desertion? Yet if by Faith thou
look upon the firmness of the Promise, the stability of the Covenant; in the
absence of sense, thou shall find matter of Comfort.

Thus you see David did, Psalm. 77.10. He was in a great Desertion; he cries
and prays: He prays and cries: He renews his former evidences and
experiences; yet gets he no comfort. At last, By Faith he looks upon the
truth of Gods Promise, and the stability of the Covenant. And then his soul
revived. I remembered the days of old, the years of ancient times. I called to
mind my songs in the night; I communed with my own heart; my soul made
diligent search. Will the Lord absent himself for ever, etc? And I said, this
is my infirmity. Yet I will remember the years of the right hand of the most
High, etc.

Do but in this sad condition, behold these dealings of God, as the ways of a
Father to thee; which are always of Love, of Mercy and Truth, to them that
keep his Covenant and his Testament.

Whether Gods end be for Chastisement, as it was in David; Or for Trial, as it
was in Job; Or whether it be for Prevention, as it was in Paul; lest he
should be puffed up; yet all is in love, and therefore cause of rejoicing.

So that there is no condition so sad, but Gods people have still cause of
rejoicing in it. Thou can think of nothing, if thou be a Believer, that can
minister just cause of trouble to thee. And therefore why art thou so cast down?

If there were more Trust, there would be less Trouble. I dare be bold to
say, that all the troubles, all the disquiets of Gods people do arise from want
of Faith. Were there more Faith, there would be more Comfort. And therefore as
David physicked his soul, when it was cast down and discouraged -- Why art thou
cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? Trust in God: So
let us exercise our Trust, and all our Troubles will vanish, all our disquiets
will dis-appear and be gone.

Let Faith come in, and discover the Promises of God, made to thee in this thy
sad condition.

He has promised it shall not be too great, 1 Cor. 10.18. There has no
temptation taken you but what is humane: and God is faithful, and will not
suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able; but will with the temptation
give an issue, that you may be able to bear it. He has promised it shall not
be too long, Romans 16.20. -- The God of Peace shall tread Satan under you feet
shortly. -- He will not contend for ever. He has promised to deliver us,
when in the day of trouble we call upon him. Psalm. 50.

Seventeenth Royalty. 17. Royalty of Faith. Its an Heart guiding-Grace.
17. Faith is an Heart-guiding-Grace.
Faith is the eye of the soul, to direct and guide us. Faith is to the soul as
the Pole Star to the Mariner, to direct the Mariner which way to steer his
course. And the soul is like the Needle in the Compass, which ever looks
toward God for direction. It is as it were the Pillar of fire to us, in the
Wilderness of this World, to direct our steps to our Heavenly Canaan.

Our life is called a Way. And not only a strait Way, but a difficult Way. We
shall meet with many turnings in this Way. And if Faith does not guide us, we
shall either stand still, and not go forward: or we shall go into wrong ways,
the way to Death.

My Brethren; we shall meet with many exigents in our way to Heaven. And, if
Faith do not guide, we are sure to go amiss.

You see what an Exigent Esther was put unto: Either to neglect duty, or to
endanger her life. She put her life in her hand, for the good of the Church of
God. If she had now consulted with flesh and blood; if she had followed the
guidance of Reason, she had been misled.

No doubt but sense and Reason would have told her, that it had been best, not
to hazard her self, and put her life in jeopardy: but consulting with Faith,
and following the guidance thereof, she was resolved to do the duty, though see
perished in the doing thereof: And it was her safety.

The like in Abraham. You see what an Exigent he was put unto. He was to part
with his Son, his only Son, the Son of his Love, the Son of his old age; a Son
of so many Prayers, and so many Promises.

No doubt, if he had consulted with flesh and blood, and carnal reason, they
would have bid him to spare his Son: but following the guidance of Faith, he
was willing to sacrifice his Son, Heb. 11.17. -- By Faith Abraham, when he was
tried, offered up his Son Isaac: of whom it was said, that in Isaac shall thy
seed be called. Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the
dead, etc.

So it was Faith whic guided Moses to leave the pomp and glory of Pharaohs
Court, and to choose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to
enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ
greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt, Heb. 11.24. If he had followed
the guidance of Reason, or sense, he had miscarryed. That would have told him,
that he was to regard himself, and his present happiness, and not throw
himself out of all. But then he had been misled. But following the guidance
of Faith he forsakes all.

This Guidance of Faith they wanted, Joh. 12.42. Who durst not confess
Christi, for fear of being thrown out of the Synagogue. If they had had Faith,
it would have guided them to Jesus Christ; be the Issue what it will.

The like of the Young Man. He went far, but when it was put to him, to leave
all, to follow Christ; to sell all: it is said -- He went away sorrowful. He
consulted with Sense and Reason; he wanted the Guidance of Faith, which would
have directed him to part with all, to cast away all, rather than to leave
Christ.

The like of Balaam. Either he must forsake the wages of Unrighteousness, or
curse the People: but he had more desire of man's reward, than he had Faith to
expect God, and so he miscarryed.

And, my Brethren, such like straits we may meet withal in our way to Heaven.
And, if we follow not the Guidance of Faith, we are sure to be misled.

It has been the ordinary choice that the Saints have been put to, Either
forsake thy God, or forsake thy Goods: Either leave Christ, or leave thy
Comforts: Either renounce Christ, or lose thy Friends, thy Father, thy Mother;
nay, thy liberty, thy life. To these exigencies and straits Gods people have
been driven. And had they not had Faith, they had surely been misled: but
having Faith, it guided them to suffer loss of friends, loss of goods, loss of
liberty, loss of life it self for Christ: as you see up and down, in Abraham,
in Moses, in Jeremy, in Paul, and the rest of the Apostles; who accounted not
their lives dear to them, for Christ.

And it was the usual speech of the Primitive Martyrs, when they were persuaded
to leave Christ, rather than to suffer. Parce precot Imperator, tu Carcerem;
ille Gehennam.
-- Spare good Emperor; thou can but cast into prison: God into Hell.

The like of Cyprian, of Policarp.

The like of Frederick the Elector of Saxony; who was prisoner to Charles the
fifth; and was promised enlargement and restitution to his former dignity; If
he would come to Mass. It was Faith guided him to return this answer. -- In
earthly things I am ready to yield to Caesar. In heavenly, only to Christ. And
Christ is more welcome to me in Bonds, than Caesar's Court without Christ.

Thus I might run down in particular examples in all ages, and show you how
Faith has guided men in these straits: which had they followed the direction
of Reason and Sense, they had been lost for ever.

It is Faith which guides the heart, in these difficult cases. It is an
Heart-guiding-Grace. And this is the way.

Faith does reject the wisdom of the flesh, and goes by Gods light, It shuts
our eyes, and walks by Gods light. It follows God, as the blind man follows
his Guide, all his days. He who makes Gods Word all his Reason, shall have
God a Counselor. Faith will not own the wisdom of the flesh. -- the carnal
mind is enmity to God. It will not be subject. It is full of contumacy and
stoutness against God and his ways.

Faith will neither own the Flesh, as a King, nor as a Counselor. As it will
not obey the commands of the flesh, so it will not follow the counsels of the
flesh.

Peter would not consult with flesh and blood, but was obedient to the heavenly
vision: where is implied, if he had hearkened to flesh and blood, he had been
disobedient to the heavenly vision.

But Faith makes God its guide, Psalm. 48.14. -- This God is our God for ever:
he shall be our guide unto death. Faith seeks direction from God, who is the
Counselor, the God of all wisdom. And the Soul, that leans upon God for
wisdom, shall not want it. He who trusts in the God of wisdom shall not want
direction. I say, he, who shuts his own eyes, and sincerely falls down at the
feet of God for counsel, shall have direction from him.

If indeed, we seek as Balaam, with a double heart, or as the Children of
Israel did, Jer. 42. who asked counsel, but were resolved of their way; we
then may miscarry. But he who seeks with an humble and upright heart, that
asks the way to Sion, with his face thitherward, resolved to go, as God
directs, Such will God direct in his way: such he will guide in all the ways
of Judgment.

As the Moon by darting her beams and influence into the Sea, does move that
great body backward and forward; which they say, is the cause of the ebbings
and flowings of the Sea: so God does in difficult cases, dart such a beam of
light into the Soul, such strong influences into the Spirit, as does carry the
soul the way it should go.

A man may follow his own wisdom and miscarry: but he that shuts his eyes and
follows God, is sure not to be misled. He, who rejects the counsel of the
flesh, and is resolved to walk by the direction of the Spirit, though never so
unlikely to flesh and blood, is sure to go right.

You see an example of this in Balaam; in Saul sparing of Agag, and the best of
the flock: in sacrificing before Samuel came to him. But I Will name but one.

Jer. 41.10. to the end of the Chapter. Johanan, who was the Captain of the
Residue of the Jews left in Jerusalem, desired Jeremy (though with a double and
deceitful heart) to enquire of the Lord, whether he should go down to Egypt,
or abide at Jerusalem: And bound himself with a vow, that -- Whatever the Lord
said, he would do it.

Jeremy comes, and tells him, he must abide at Jerusalem, and God would
preserve him. But Johanan wanted Faith to believe there was safety, where was
no means of safety. And therefore he chose rarher to go down to Egypt, than to
abide at Jerusalem. And if that man's reason might direct it, 'twas the
likeliest way: for in Jerusalem was nothing but Penury, Want, Famine and War:
In Egypt there was Plenty, Peace, and all abundance.

But now observe. Though the way were never so likely, yet following his own
wisdom, and rejecting the counsel of God: I say, following his own wisdom and
counsel, and neglecting the direction of God; he ran upon his own ruin; it
was his utter undoing. You see there, the thing he thought he should avoid,
he fell into: He thought to have avoided the Sword, Famine, and Pestilence:
but all these followed him. God would make him know, it was better to follow
the guidance of Faith, though the way were never so dangerous, unlikely, to
carnal wisdom, than to be led by his own wisdom, though 'twere never so
likely. Men that would avoid danger out of Gods way, do surely run into it. He
that will follow his own wisdom, not Gods, shall run into mischief.

You see this in Jeroboam. It was a likely project in carnal reason, in man's
way; To continue his Throne and Kingdom, by making of Calves; that so the
people might be kept from Jerusalem, and might not revolt back to Judah. But
in Gods way; it was the way to his ruin, the overthrow of him, and all his
house.

Eighteenth Royalty. 18. Faith is an Heart-establishing-Grace. 18. Royalty.
Faith is an Heart-establishing-Grace.

It settles a man upon such a Foundation, as nothing can unsettle him, Psalm.
125.1. -- They who trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Sion, which cannot be
removed, but abides for ever. Such a man is Homo quadratus. Fall he which way
he will, he lights upon his square, Psalm. 112. -- His heart is fixed,
trusting in the Lord; his heart is established; he will not fear.

Whereas, Unbeleef does unsettle the soul; fills a man with unsufferable
perplexities; sets a man upon the rack of fears. It is that which keeps a man
in fears, and that which causes a fresh return of doubts and fears. -- If you
do not believe, ye shall not be established. And Unbeleeving man is an house
without a foundation; a man without a bottom, like a ship unballassed in a
Tempest, tossed hither and thither.

Faith on the contrary does make a man a rock in a storm, does stablish and
settle the heart in the greatest Tempest.

The less Faith, the more Fear, the more Unsettledness. The more Faith, the
less Fear, the more Stability.

Faith does unburden our hearts of all our fears, and all our cares. When a man
believes not, all the burden lies upon a man's self. But when we believe, we
cast all the burden upon the Lord.

We are troubled, and afraid what shall become of our souls, what of our
bodies, what of our Children. But Faith does unburden the soul of these cares
and thoughts: it does quit and discharge the soul of these fears. Faith casts
the whole burden upon the Lord: makes God to bear all the burden: not only the
burden of sins, but the burden of cares and fears; coming to him weary and
heavy laden, and by Faith casting our burden upon him, he bears all, Pro.
16.2. -- Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be
established, Psalm. 55.22. -- Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall
sustain thee.

There are two things Faith establishes the soul against, 1. Against Fears. 2.
Against Falling.


1. Faith establishes the heart against fears. When a man believes not, he is
nothing but fears and scruples: But, when once Faith comes, it does answer all
cases; silences all doubts; stablisheth the heart against all fears.

There are five Fears which Faith does establish the heart against, 1. The Fear
of Men. 2. The Fear of Want. 3. The Fear of Death. 4. The Fear of Hell. 5. The
Fear of Judgment.


1. Faith establishes the heart against humane Fears, the fear of men. Faith
will banish these unlawful and tyrannical fears. It will not suffer them to
enter the Throne, and take possession of the heart, Psalm. 27.1.3. -- The Lord
is my light and my Salvation. There was his Faith -- Whom then shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength of my life, Of whom then shall I be afraid? Though
an host should incamp against me, my heart shall not fear: in another Psalm.
-- God is our hope and strength, a help in trouble ready to be found.
Therefore will not we fear, though the Earth be moved, though the Mountains
be hurled into the midst of the Sea, Psalm. 46.1, 2.

2. Faith does establish us against the Fear of Want. Many there are that fear
to outlive their labors, to outlive their Riches, their Comforts. Oh! say
they, I shall one day want, and be in misery.

Now Faith settles the soul against these fears. Why, will Faith say, has not
God said, -- The Lions shall hunger and suffer want. (That is, as the
Septuagint read it) the mighty Nimrods, the great ones of the World, who have
their baggs full: They shall sooner want, than they that fear the Lord, shall
want any thing that is good. Why will Faith say, -- Does God cloathe the
Lillies, feed the Ravens; and will he not take care for thee? Mat. 6.24. to
the 34. -- what? has not God engaged himself to bear thy charges to Heaven?
Has he not promised to give thee all things necessary both for life and
godliness? not only for Godliness, for Spirituals: but for Life too, for
Temporals?

Has not Godliness the promise of this Life, that now is, and of that, that is
to come?

Does God take care for Ravens, for the Beasts of the field? Does he feed his
Enemies? and will he forget his friends? Has he given thee a Christ? and
doubtest thou he will give thee a crumb? will he not give us all things, who
has not withheld himself from us? Thus the Apostle does reason, Nonne dabit
sua, qui non d^tinuit se?
Romans 8.32. -- He that spared not his own Son, but freely gave him for us: how
shall he not with him, freely also give us all things?

Sure he, who trusts God for his soul, will trust God for his Body. Faith does
not single and choose out its Object; to believe this, not that, but all coming
from the same Truth, Fides non eligit Objectum.
the same God; it believes one as well as another. He who depends on God for
the many, will depend on him for the less: He who trusts God for pounds, will
trust him also for pence. -- If I tell you earthly things (says Christ to
Nicodemus) and you believe not: how will you believe, if I tell you heavenly
things? So, if you will not believe God for earthly things; how can you believe
him for heavenly things? If not for sustentation: how then for salvation?

3. Faith does stablish the heart against the Fear of Death; the King of Fears,
as Job calls it: And of all terribles, the most terrible, as the Philosopher
speaks. Unbeleef does slay the heart with fears. A man, that knows not what
shall become of his soul to all eternity: no marvel if he be afraid to dye.

When a man shall lie upon his death bed, and knows not whither he shall go.
Quo vadam nescio. As it was said of Aristotle. I go I know not whither: Or,
when a man shall look upon death, and Hell behind it: upon the Pale Horse, and
Hell behind, as we have it, Rev. 6. no marvel if he be afraid to dye.

But when by Faith we can look upon God a Father: Christ a Savior; and can
say, -- God is my God; Christ is my Christ; Heaven is my Inheritance; Glory is
my portion: no marvel then, if death be not terrible, no marvel then if he
be ready to meet death, and say with Simeon -- Lord, now let thou thy
Servant depart in Peace. Or with Paul, sigh out, Cupio dissolvi: I desire to
be dissolved, and to be with Christ.

Men that have not assurance of a better life, it is no wonder if they be
loath to leave this: they know not where to mend themselves. Earth in
Possession, is better than Heaven in Reversion.

But when God has given a man the assurance of a better life; when a man has
his hope in his hand, his evidences sealed; Oh! then death is not terrible:
There will be a willing Resignation of the soul into Gods hands.

I'ts true, in some case, He that believes makes not haste, but here, the
more we believe, the more haste we make to be with God.

4. Faith Stablisheth the heart against the Fear of Hell. Faith knows who was
in pretium, as well as in premium, and beholds Christ not only in Premium, to
entitle us to Heaven; but in pretium, as the price of our Redemption, to free
us from Hell. As by his Active Obedience he answered Gods commanding and
remunerative Justice: So by his Passive Obedience he answered Gods condemning
and vindictive Justice, freeing us from that wrath and misery, which otherwise
we should unavoidably have fallen into.

5. Faith does establish the heart against the Fear of Judgment. -- There
shall be no condemnation to such as are in Christ Jesus; such as are
Believers. The Judge is our Advocate, our Savior; He, to whom we are to
answer, has answered for us: He, to whom we are to give satisfaction, has
satisfied for us: He is our Redeemer, who has laid down his life for us.
Faith knows Christ will be All, in All to the soul, not only in life to
preserve it, but in death to comfort, and in Judgment to absolve thee, and
save thee.

2. Faith does establish the heart against falling, 1. Against Total Apostasy.
2. Against Final Apostasy.


1. Against Total. There is not a Total Apostasy. Though the Saints fall sadly,
yet not Totally.

1. A Child of God may lose all the comforts of spiritual life: yet not
spiritual life it self. He may bring himself into such a sad condition by sin,
that he may sin away all the comforts of this life. Thus David, Psalm. 51. --
Restore to me the joy of thy Salvation. He had not lost life, but the
comforts of it; and desires they may be restored. A man may outlive the
comforts of life: this is a sad thing to outlive comforts here, but Faith, at
least, lays the grounds of those comforts that are endless.

2. A man may lose all the Vigorous and Powerful Operations of Grace, and Life:
yet not life it self. It may be with a Child of God, as with a man in a dead
Swoon; though there be life in him; yet the operations of life are but little
discerned. It Is not with him, as it was wont to be. He thinks to go out (as
sometimes Sampson) in prayer, etc. but his strength is gone from him, as his
was. But his life is hid with Christ in God, as the Apostle has it, Col. 3.3.

3. A man may lose some measures and degrees of spiritual life: yet not life it
self. He may suffer a great decay in his Faith, a great abatement in his Love,
and Zeal, etc. and yet life is not lost. Thus it was with the Church of
Ephesus, Rev. 2.5. -- Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do
thy first Works. -- We are not to think that the Church was fallen from Grace:
but only from some measures and degrees of Grace. And concerning the same
Church Rev. 2.4. when it is said, -- She had lost her first love: it is not
meant, that she had lost the Grace of Charity: you see the fruits of it in the
second and third verses:

But she had lost the degrees. It was not extinguished, but cooled only. The
word is [(...).] which signifies, not that she did altogether [Amittere] lose
it: but somewhat [Remittere] remit and abate of the fervency of it. As one
says of Peter. Motum fuit i^ co spiritualis vitae robu^; non amotum; con
cussum, non excussum. Gratiam fidei remisit, Actum intermisit; Habitum non
amisit.
-- The strength of spiritual life was moved in him; but not removed; shaken
'twas, but not shaken off. He remitted the Grace of Faith, intermitted the act
of Faith, but lost not the Habit.

Isa. 6.13. -- He shall be like an Oak, whose substance is in him, when it
casts its leaves: so the Holy seed shall be the substance thereof. Like to
that, is that of 1 John 3.9. -- Whosoever is born of God sins not; for his
seed remains in him: neither can he sin; because he is born of God. It may
be with him, as 'twas with Nebuchadnezzar. The Tree may be hewn down, but the
stump is bound with a bond of Iron.

2 Faith establishes the heart against final Apostasy. Though they fall
foulely, yet not finally. They have the Prayer and Intercession of Christ; the
Power of Christ; the Merit of Christ; the Promise of Christ. Faith produces
all these.

We are said to be established by Faith; to live by Faith, to stand by Faith;
to be preserved by Faith as with a guard, 1 Pet. 1.5. -- We are kept by the
Power of God, through Faith unto salvation. By Faith we are said to subdue the
flesh; to have victory over the World; to quench the fiery darts of Satan; to
be saved by Faith, etc.

Indeed all ages give reports to us of many, who have been eminent in
Profession, and yet have come to naught. Some fallen from Grace to baseness;
some fallen from Grace to bitterness; some from Grace to vitiousness; some
from Grace to malitiousness: But these were never true Believers. A Star fallen
is not a Star. Stella caden^ non est Stella.
-- They went out from us, because they were not of us: for had they been of
us, they would have continued with us, 1 John 2.19. It is the evil heart of
Unbelief that causes them to depart from the living God, Heb 3.12.

Where there is true Faith, there is stability. Faith does establish the heart
from falling.

1. Faith sets a man upon a Soul-establishing-bottome, upon a sure Foundation,
upon Christ: and he is sure who is built there: as the house on the Rock; so
the soul on Christ is safe. Time was, a man was his own Foundation, but it was
a sandy one: but now his Foundation is Christ, a Rock of ages.

2. Faith does interest a man in a Soul-establishing-Covenant: not a Covenant
of Works, but of Grace, Jer. 32.40. -- I will make an everlasting Covenant with
them, that I will never turn from them to do them good: But I will put my fear
in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me, Isa. 54.9, 10. -- This is
as the Waters of Noah unto me; for as I have sworn, that the Waters of Noah
shall no more go over the Earth: so have I sworn that I will not be angry with
thee, nor rebuke thee.

3. Faith does beget in a man Soul-establishing-Principles. The Principles of
Grace and Holiness: The Graces of God, which are ((...)) Without Repentance: i.
e. God does never behave himself to those upon whom he has bestowed these
Graces, Sine mutatione stabiliter fixa. So Aug. renders it, and hence he says
on that place. Nec quae illuminavit obcaecat, nec quae aedificavit destruit,
nec quae plantavit avellit.
as though he repented of the bestowing of them. Whom he has enlightened,
he does not blind; whom he builds, he does not destroy; and whom he
plants, he does not pull up.

And Faith has a great influence into this, to preserve and establish the
heart from falling. It is said, -- We are kept by the Power of God, through
Faith to Salvation, 1 Pet. 1.5.

1. Faith does ingraft us, and unite us to Christ, makes us Members of Christ,
the Spouse of Christ; and Christ will not lose either his Spouse, or the least
of his Members.

2. Faith does keep out the grand Enemy to this, standing thus steadfastly, and
that is Hypocrisy. If a man's heart be unsound, let his show and appearance be
what it will be, all will come to naught* as in Herod, Judas, etc. If an Apple
be corrupt and rotten at heart, though the rind, and outside be never so
lovely and specious, 'twill not long last: the corrupt inside will mar the fine
outside in the end.

An Hypocrite is but an Apostata cased; and an Apostata is but an Hypocrite
uncased.

3. Faith establishes the heart against fears of men; the frowns and menaces of
men.

4. Faith will keep the heart constant to duty, to the use of the Ordinances,
which are strong means to hold up the soul in Gods way.

5. Faith makes a man jealous and watchful over his own heart, of Declinings
either in Action, or in Affection. It will not suffer a man to give way to the
least coldness in love, lukewarmnesse in zeal, remisness in duty. If any steal
upon his heart, he is never quiet till he have recovered his former heat.

6. Faith does maintain in the heart an holy fear of falling; which is a great
means to preserve from falling, Jer. 32. I will put my fear in their hearts,
that they shall not depart from me. Such a Fear it keeps as may curb and keep
under the flesh: but not discourage and weaken the Spirit. An industrious fear,
not a discouraging fear: a faithful fear, not a despairing fear. A fear joined
with Faith, and a Faith mingled with fear. A man may be fearful, and faithful.
Fearful in himself, faithful in Christ: weak in himself, strong in Christ.

There are four fears which Faith casts out, 1. A servile, and legal Fear. 2. A
distrustful Fear. 3. A despairing and discouraging Fear. 4. A careless Fear.


As security is fearless, so sometimes Fear is careless, if it be excessive.

There are also four Fears which Faith retains.

1. An aweful Fear. Such a Fear as restrains from adventuring on occasions of
sinning. It is as bad Divinity to grant the occasion, and deny the sin, as it
is Logic, to grant the Premises, and deny the conclusion.

The Nazarite was forbidden Wine; and withal that he must not taste the Kernel
of the Grape, least that might be an occasion to draw on the other. We have a
sad example in Monicha, Augustines Mother. She looked on the Wine in the Cup;
from looking, she fell to liking; from liking, to tasting; from tasting, to
sipping; from that to drinking, and so to Excess. Sins in Divinity are like
absurdities in Philosophy. Uno absurdo dato multa sequuntur.
One absurdity granted, multitudes follow.

2. Such a Fear as makes us to go out of our selves, and lean and rely wholly
on Christ. A Fear of our selves, of our own strength, etc.

Alas! What are we to Adam? to David? to Solomon? to Hezekiah? Peter? men of
sweet and familiar acquaintance with God. Yet see what Testimonies of men's
frailties they left behind them. And all this to teach us to maintain an holy
Fear and Jelousy over our own selves; that we might go out of our selves, and
lean all upon Christ, without whom we cannot be sure.

3. An Industrious Fear. Such a Fear as puts us upon all holy duties, and means
for our establishment to preserve us. God promised to add fifteen years to
Hezekiahs life; yet he was to preserve this life, and uphold it, with food and
diet, and other necessaries for life: so God promised we shall not fall: yet
we must be conscionable in the use of all good means, whereby we may stand;
otherwise we tempt God: and just it is with God to let us fall, if we neglect
Prayer, and the rest of his Ordinances appointed by him for our perseverane.

4. A Jealous Fear over our own hearts. They are deceitful, and we had need to
be jealous over them, and watch. Think not thy self so far at distance from
any sin, but thou may fall into it, if God keep thee not.

Who could be further from Drunkenness than Noah? who was the only sober man,
in the drunken old World. Who from Incest than Lot? the only chaste man in
Sodom. Who from Murder, than David? Whose heart smote him for but cutting off
the lap of Saul's garment. Who from denying of Christ, than was Peter? who had
rather dye with him, than forsake him. And therefore we had need to be
jealous, and watch over our own hearts.

There is no place so good, but we may offend in it. As the Angels in Heaven,
Adam in Paradise. There is no company so good, but we may sin in it. As did
Sarah in the Angels company, Judas in Christ's.

Thus let us maintain these holy Fears in our hearts, and by that be kept from
falling.

Use of Examination.
Let this then put us upon the Trial, whether or no we have Faith.

You see the Necessity of Faith in respect, Of Justification. Of
Sanctification. Of Salvation.


I have showed you, it was the great thing, which God required to Justification
and Salvation of a sinner. And you have seen the Excellency of this Grace laid
down in many Glorious Privileges and Royalties. You have seen that God has
poured more honor upon the head of Faith, than upon any other Grace. Let all
this persuade with us, to put our selves upon the search and trial, whether we
have Faith or no.

Put such a question as this to thy own soul. Am I a Believer, yea or no? Have
I Faith, yea or no?

It was a duty which the Apostle did commend to the Corinthians, 2 Cor. 13.5.
-- Examine your selves, whether ye be in the Faith; prove your own selves.
And it is that, which, after this long discourse of Faith I would commend to
you all. That you would put your selves to the Trial. Examine whether you have
Faith or no. Therefore has God given us a faculty different from all
Creatures, whereby we may reflect upon our selves. Many there are, who will
winnow others, but not sift themselves: spel others, but not read themselves:
searching others rather than themselves. But let it be your care every one to
prove and examine himself.

The encouragement to this duty I will take from these two grounds.

1. It is a thing possible to be known, whether you are Believers, yea or no.

2. It is a thing necessary to be known.

1. It is a thing possible to be known. Hence have we so many exhortations;
to examine and search. If it were not possible to be known; in vain were these
exhortations. God does not use to put us upon Impossibilities. Though God in
the Law may require that of a natural man, which is impossible for him to do,
Romans 8.3. because he gave man once ability to do whatever is commanded; yet in
the Gospel Christ does require nothing of the faithful, which by Grace is not
possible to be done. Possible then it is. There is light enough in the Word;
if a man will bring his heart unto it; and deal impartially with himself, in
the search, whether he has Faith or no.

The Papists indeed do say: It is a thing impossible to know, whether he be a
Believer or no. If men did know they did believe, then they might be assured of
their own Salvation. But this (say they) no man can be assured of.

A Position clean against Scripture, Authority, and Reason.

The Scripture is plain; the Precepts of the Scripture plain, 2 Cor. 13.5. Gal.
6.4. -- Let every man prove his own work. -- Let every man examine himself.

They who are commanded to try, may upon Trial, know whether they have Faith or
no.

But every man is commanded to try. God in the Gospel does not put us upon
Impossibilities.

Besides, the examples of Scripture are plain. The Eunuch a new Convert, when
Philip told him, he might be baptized, if he did believe, answered. -- I
believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, Act. 8.37.

The like of the Father of the possessed Child, when, having but a weak Faith,
yet could say, -- Lord, I do believe, Mar. 9.23. So Joh. 6.69. -- We believe
and know, that thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God, Joh. 11.26, 27.
-- Beleevest thou this? says our Savior to Martha there. She answers -- Yea
Lord, I believe thou art that Christ that should come into the World.

Hence says Augustine -- The Believer sees his own Faith whereby he does
believe. Again. -- as soon as Faith is in us, Vide fidelis ipsam fidem suam.

Ipsam fidem quando inest in nobis, videmus in nobis.

Mentis nostrae fides nostra conspicua.


we see it in us.

The mind is not ignorant of its own actions. When it understands, it knows it
self to understand. When it discourses, it knows it self to discourse. When it
desires, it knows it self to desire.

To take away this act of the soul, whereby a man reflecting upon himself and
his own actions, is able to know and judge of them: were to destroy the
Prerogative royal of an intellectual nature.

Now if the naked spirit of a man be able to judge of his own actions here:
how much more the spirit of a man being helped by the Spirit of God, 1 Cor.
2.12.

If Faith it self be a witness ( -- He that believes has the Witness in
himself, 1 John 5.10.) How much more when the Witness of Gods Spirit joins
with us? when the Spirit witnesses, what place is left for doubting?

If Faith it self be a Light. How much more, Quando Spiritus testatur, quaenam
relinquatur ambiguitas? Fides est lumen seipsum visibilem faciens.
when Gods Light comes in with ours? The Light of the Spirit, to the Light of
our Spirit.

Besides; How shall a man receive the comfort of his own Faith, (as Hezekiah
did, Isa. 38.3. and Paul, 2 Cor. 1.12.) if it be not possible for a man to
evidence to himself, that he does believe.

Is it possible for a man to know his vicious actions, to his humiliation: and
not possible to know his virtuous actions, to his consolation? If it be
granted of the one, why should it be denied of the other.

Indeed, I will grant thus much; though it be possible, yet it is exceeding
difficult.

1. In respect of the deceits. 2. In respect of the doubts and mis-givings of
our own hearts.
1. In regard of the deceits of a man's own spirit. -- The heart is deceitful
above measure, who can know it? Jer. 17.9. And -- take heed lest the Light
within you, Or, That Light you think to be within you, prove darkness.

They that are much versed with their own hearts, do find an Hell of deceit in
them. Men's hearts are like some pictures: If you look on one side, there is an
Angel, but on the other, a Devil.

There are depths of deceit in the hearts of men, which makes the work
exceeding difficult. -- Every way of man is good in his own eyes. -- There is a
Generation of men (says Agur) who are pure in their own eyes; and yet are not
washed from their filthiness.

Such deceits there are in the heart, that if a man will take all of trust,
which comes up; he will surely be deceived.

You see this in the Children of Israel, Deuteronomy. 5.27, 28. They said -- Whatever
the Lord said unto them, they would do it. It is like, they spoke as they
meant, at that time. But he that searched the heart saw deeper into them, than
themselves into themselves. He espied deceits to lie low, which they were not
perhaps aware of. And therefore says -- Oh! That there were such a heart in
them, that they might keep my Commandments always. He saw, they wanted yet the
Heart. This was but self-deceiving.

I might instance also in Hazael; when the Prophet told him what beastly
cruelty he should exercise toward the Children of Israel. -- What! (says he)
Is thy servant a Dog, that he should do such belluine and beastly cruelty? It
may be he spoke what was uppermost: he spoke as he meant for the time: he
was not aware, nor did he discern the deceit of his heart: he thought his
heart to be far from that now, which afterward he fell into.

The like of the Israelites, Jer. 42. throughout. So that you see, it is a
matter of some difficulty. And therefore the Apostle, 2 Cor. 13.5. Bids us not
only examine; but prove. Not only to examine, and take the first evidence the
heart gives in, but to prove whether the evidence given in, be true. It may
be you have examined your selves, by the rules of the Word. Your heart has
given in an evidence for you. Why, but prove, if this evidence be true: see an
evidence of that evidence.

As in Solomon's Temple, there was Light set against Light: so here you must set
Light against Light. As for example. Inquiry is made, whether I have Faith or
no. Answer is given in upon the scrutiny; That I have Faith. It is well. But
now prove this. Why how? Set Light against Light. See an evidence of that
evidence. The Word says -- Faith purifies the heart, Act. 15.9. Faith
sanctifies the heart. Faith works by Love, Gal. 5.6.

Now then. Is thy heart cleansed from filthiness? Art thou sanctified, etc.

The like in another. Inquiry is made, whether a man love God, yea or no. It
may be the heart gives up this answer, that he does love God. Why, but now
prove it. -- He that loves God, keeps his Commandments, Joh. 14.15. He that
loves God will obey him; will not displease him. He who loves God will not sin.

And so in any other. Thus you see, though it be possible, yet it is a matter
of difficulty, in regard of the deceits of our hearts. And therefore we are to
take the more pains.

2. It is difficult in regard of the doubts and mis-givings of our hearts. And
this at all times; if Gods Spirit come not to witness with our spirits; our own
spirits will be born down with doubts and mis-givings of our unbeleeving
hearts; and we shall never know what our condition is.

Hence we have these phrases, Romans 8.16. -- The Spirit does witness with our
spirits, that we are the Children of God. I'ts not the witness of our own
spirit, that will answer all the doubts and objections of our hearts. If Gods
Spirit strike not in too, and bear witness with us.

The like we have, 1 John 5, 6, 7, 8. And other places; especially that of 1
Cor. 2. from 9. to the 13. verse, where you shall see, that it is a work of
Gods own Spirit, to settle the soul in the assurance of his good condition.

And, as at all times, so especially at three times. It is exceeding difficult.

1. In times of Humiliation. 2. In times of Temptation. 3. In times of
Desertion.
1. In times of Humiliation. As some call evil good: so thou calls good evil.
Now, As some take the shadow for the substance* so thou the substance for the
shadow. As some depend on false grounds: so thou denyest the true. As some
feed, and cherish matter of false comfort: so thou feedest on matter of
discouragement. Some heat themselves by a painted fire, Isa. 50.11. and thou
quenchest the sparks of Gods own kindling, if the Spirit of God break not in at
that time.

2. In times of Temptation; when Satan assaults a man, tells him, that all his
Graces are false and counterfeit; that he is an Hypocrite. And presents an
Army of confirmations at once, in an instant, and so manages them, that
whatever evidences a man can think of to the contrary, they are either taken
away, or seemingly confuted, as fast as they are thought on.

In this case a man may be ignorant of his Faith and Graces. At such a time,
if a man inquire; either the spirit of a man will be silent, and return no
answer; Or, if it do return any, it is a disturbed one. If a man reflect back
at such a time as this, he shall find nothing, but of Satan's party to return
him an answer.

3. In time of Desertion; when it may be, our Evidences be hid in the dark;
the soul is in a mist, and cannot read its own Faith. The Glass can give no
reflex, except the Sun give light: Nor a man's Graces appear to comfort him;
except God shine upon them. As the Moon and Stars, so our Graces do shine with
a borrowed Light. And unless God do shine secretly into our hearts; irradiate,
and give light unto our Graces: though they be in esse; in being in the heart:
yet not in cognosci, in the apprehension they will not appear at all to comfort
us.

In these cases, the work is Difficult. But what then! Things must not be left
for Difficulties; because they be beset with Difficulties. Difficulties must
not put us off from Trial, but put us on to try more thoroughly. He who says,
there is a Lion in the way, is not fit for Heaven. They that feared the Giants
were not fit for Canaan. It is a sign of a base and degenerate spirit to desist
in the pursuit of a good way, because of Difficulties. Though it be difficult,
yet it is possible. A thing it is that has been attained in all ages of the
World. Others of Gods people have known, and so may thou.

2. It is not any possible, but necessary that you should know whether you be
Believers or no. It is Necessary, 1. In respect of your Comforts. 2. In respect
of your more lively Obedience.


1. Its necessary in respect of your Comforts. What comfort can a soul have in
this, That Christ is a Savior, if he know not, he is his Savior? And how
shall he know this, except he know that he does believe? -- he is the
Savior of them that believe, only.

What comfort is it to know there is pardon of sins, if we do not know that our
sins be pardoned? And how shall we know this, except we do know that we
believe. -- They only that believe, have their sins pardoned.

What comfort can we have in the Merits, Death, and Blood of Christ? what
comfort, in the Promises of the Gospel, till we know we are Believers? such
to whom Christ and the Promises belong?

If a man did but once clear this. How might he run down all the Promises, and
fetch in comfort from them all? why, (might the soul say) Christ is mine: his
Blood is mine: his Spirit is mine: his Merits are mine: his Righteousness is
mine, to justify me. His Holiness is mine, to sanctify me. His Mercy is
mine to save me. All is mine; if I be a Believer.

Oh! Thou do not know what wrong thou do to thy soul, in neglecting to
clear and evidence this to thy self.

Why, you will live without Comfort: you will dye without Comfort.

My Brethren. If you would not live without Comfort, if you would not dye
without Comfort, labor to evidence this to your souls, that you are Believers.

Oh! It would add much to your Joy and Comfort to know this. Many there are
who live without comfort; who lie upon the rack of fears and discouragements,
are in unsufferable troubles all their days.

Many, who for want of clearing this to their souls, that they are Believers,
go with a spark in stead of a flame.

And as you live: so you will dye without Comfort, if you do not take care to
evidence this to your souls.

And this were a sad condition. Whatever a man has in this life; yet when he
comes to dye, he would willingly have all the Comfort possible. Though a man
may be content to go Quarter-sail, and Quarter-wind, here in this life: yet
when he comes to dye, he would willingly go Full-sail to Heaven.

Less Comfort may serve a man to live by, than to dye by: because, whiles a
man lives, other things come in, to make up the want of Comfort: every thing
casts in something, to make the soul a stock of Comfort. But if this will not
do; if a man cannot piece up his Comforts with other things: yet, whiles a man
lives, there is hope and expectation still of more Comfort.

But, when a man comes to dye, that hope is gone. There Is no hope then of ever
getting more. And this is a sad condition.

And, My Brethren, It is a thing which God does often deny at death: because
we have been no more solicitous to clear our Evidences in our life. I say, God
does now withhold the Comfort of Faith; because we have neglected to clear our
Evidence of Faith; which is a sad condition. Though the condition of the soul
be never the less safe: yet the condition is less comfortable to our souls.

2. It Is necessary in respect of our more lively obedience. The knowledge of
this, will make us lay out our selves for God. It will make us industrious and
active, in all holy Obedience. It will make us burn out, not smother out: wear
out, not rust out. It will make a man a Volunteer in Gods work: to sweat and
take pains in the Vineyard of the Lord.

It Is false what the Popish Doctors say. That the knowledge of our good
condition should slack the hand, make a man Supine and remiss in holy
Obedience. As much as it will make a Travailer slack his pace, because he
knows he is in his way, and that by making speed in it, he shall come to
the end of his journey.

Oh then! Is it a thing possible to be attained? Is it necessary? why then are
we so injurious to our selves, to rob our selves of that Comfort, which the
Knowledge of our Faith would contribute to our souls afterward.

Do you delight to know all things else? and be ignorant of your selves? will
you prove all things else? and not your selves? you will prove your Gold; you
will prove your Silver; you will prove your Evidences, and will you not prove
your selves? There Is nothing of worth that a man will take upon trust, without
trial.

Do you delight to be kept upon the rack of fears, and perplexities of spirit?
do you delight to hang between Heaven and Hell? As Absalom between Earth and
Heaven? and not know what shall become of your eternal souls to all eternity?

Why, if you do not thus, then take some pains in the search and examination of
your selves. -- Prove your selves whether you are in the Faith or no?

Thus having premised this, upon which I have on purpose insisted the more
largely; in respect of the Necessity of this duty of Self-Examination; we will
now come to lay down some Rules, whereby we may discover to them, who are
willing to take pains in the search of their own hearts, whether they have
Faith, or no.

In the laying down of which, that I may not err, I shall desire to go by
these two Rules.

1. The grand Rule is, the Word of God. The Book shall try you. That Book that
shall save or damn you at the last day; shall try you now whether you have
Faith or no.

And I hope, if the Word convince you, that you have not Faith; you will
subscribe to the conviction. If the Word say it, I hope you will conclude it.
But, whether you will or no, That which the Word says is true. That conviction
which the Word does fasten upon you, shall lie upon you at the great day, if
now you get it not off.

2. The Second Rule I shall desire to go by, is this, to lay down such
Evidences as are universal; and belong to all Believers, weak, as well as
strong; the least degree of saving Faith, as well as the highest measure of it.
I shall desire so to comfort the strong, as not to discourage the weak: so to
satisfy the strong, as I may also establish the weak. For

I conceive, There Is a great Error committed in the laying down of Evidences,
to take an Evidence from the highest degree of Faith.

As when we should lay down an Evidence of Faith, we take our Evidence from
Assurance. This is a great Error. By this means we shall cast out many
thousands, who are true Believers, and yet want Assurance.

And yet my care shall be, as not to quench the smoking flax; so not to
cherish a false flame: as not to discourage the meanest; so not to encourage
the strongest, if false: as not to discountenance a true, so not to countenance
a false. But that the false may have no Comfort; the true no discouragement.

Now the Method, that I will observe, to evince this to your souls, whether you
have Faith or no, shall be some Evidences taken,

1. From the usual manner of Gods working of this Grace of Faith, in the hearts
of Unbeleeving men.

2. From the Grace it self wrought in the soul.

1. From the manner of Gods working this Grace, which is this.

1. God does use to discover sin to the soul; Awakens a man's conscience; makes
a man to see his sin, and his misery by reason of sin; that he lies under the
wrath of God by reason of sin; and that there is an utter impossibility in him,
to wind or free himself out of this condition.

This is the first work. Men will not believe, nor come over to Christ, till
they first be humbled, till they see and feel the want of Christ.

This you see in the Prodigal: in the Woman with the Bloody Issue. It was
Misery brought them home. Men must be cut off their own stock, before they can
be ingrafted upon another. Thrown off their own bottom, before they can cast
themselves on Christ, the true Foundation.

The Terms of Mercy are too hard; the Yoke of Christ is too strait for such
men, who were never humbled. What! To deny themselves! to cut off their right
hand! to forsake their beloved sins! But Mercy upon any Terms to the humbled
is desirable. No Potion can be too bitter for the Recovery of a dying man: No
hard hold too sharp for a drowning man, to take hold of. So no Terms too hard
for an humbled sinner.

Whereas, before a man be humbled, the Proposition of Mercy and Pardon is but
all lost labor. He makes Light of Mercy, Light of Christ, Light of a Pardon,
as they did, that were invited to the Supper. It Is said -- They made Light of
it.

Men will not seek after the Physician, before they feel themselves to be
sick: for ease, till they be pressed with burdens: for a Plaster, before they
be wounded: for heavenly Riches, before sense of their spiritual beggary: for
enlargement, and pardon, before they be in Prison: for Mercy, before they
smart under the sense of Misery: Nor for a Christ, till the soul do find a
necessity in the want of Christ.

Hence the Law is said to be our Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ. And it is
upon this ground, among others; because it does discover sin to us; and lash
us, and humble us for it. And then we are ready to go from Sinai to Sion: from
the Law of Moses accusing, to the Gospel of Christ excusing: from the Law
condemning, to the Gospel absolving.

2. God does discover to the soul the fullness and al-sufficiency of Christ. --
Who is able to save to the uttermost, them that come to God by him; and Heb.
7.25. That there is enough in him to justify and save so vile a sinner, as thou
have been. Christ his Righteousness is an everlasting Righteousness; such as an
eternity of sinning is never able to expend and draw dry.

As our Faith can never out-grow the Righteousness of Christ, so neither can
our sins, Romans 1.17. It is said to be [A Righteousness revealed from Faith to
Faith.] The more Faith, not the less, but the more Righteousness is revealed.
The broader the Eye of Faith, the wider the Righteousness beheld.

As all the Faith in the World could never over-clasp the Righteousness of
Christ: So all the sins in the World are not able to nonplus, or pose it.

As it cannot be over-lookt, or comprehended, by any Faith: So it cannot be
exhausted by any sins.

Both of these we have set down, Joh. 16.8, 9, 10. -- I will send the Spirit;
and he shall convince the World of sin. There is Humiliation. -- Of
Righteousness. That is, that there is A complete and All-sufficient
Righteousness in me. That I am able to save to the utmost; to pardon sin.

This God discovers. Faith must have a bottom to rest on: An All-sufficient
Savior. No man will throw his soul away.

3. With the fullness, God discovers the freeness of this Righteousness to all
comers: How willing God is to bestow Christ on you; and how willing Christ is
to bestow himself upon you.

Hence we have such invitations -- Ho! Every one that thirsts, come ye to
the Waters, Isa. 55.1. -- And -- Let him that is a thirst, come, Rev. 22.17.
And -- Come to me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, Matthew. 11.28. And
-- Him, that comes to me, I will by no means cast out, Joh. 6.37.

4. God stirs up the soul to pursue Christ, with enlarged desires, and earnest
prayers; kindles desires in the soul after him -- Oh! That God would bestow
Christ on me! I see I am in misery. I see I am a sinner. Oh! That thou
would bestow Jesus Christ upon my poor soul! As the poor pursued Heart does
pant after the Brooks of water: So pants such a soul after the Lord Jesus.
Now Christ upon any terms is desirable.

5. Now God works the Grace of Faith in the soul, whereby the soul does draw
nigh to Christ, and throws it self into the arms of Christ, embraces him with
all his might; casts it self wholly on him for Life, and Salvation.

Have you not seen how a tender Infant, in the apprehension of danger, runs
into the arms of the Parent for succor? so does the soul pursued by the Law,
and affrighted by the apprehensions of Gods wrath, fly into the bosom and
arms of Christ for succor; bespeaking him with all the terms of Love, and
Confidence. -- My Lord; My God; My Hope; My Fortress; My Strength; My Redeemer,
save me, else I perish. Hide me in the clefts of this Rock. Pity me.
Succor me. Thou who art a Savior, Lord save me. Thou, that art Mercy, show
me Mercy.

And here now begins the Life of a Christian, though as yet he feel little
motion. Strong is he now in desiring, though feeble in performing. Resolved
he is, by any means to stick to Christ; yet not sensible of any union with
him. He admires the brightness of the Beams of his Mercy shining in the
Gospel; but feels little warmth of joy and comfort in his heart. He hungers
after the Word; but feels little nourishment. Here is the beginning of true
Faith.

Now then, would you know whether you have Faith? try your selves. Have you
found, that God has thus wrought in you? what? have thou been thus humbled in
the sight and sense of sin? deeply affected with the fullness and freeness of
the Grace of God in Christ, so as to raise up in thee those earnest longings
and pantings after him, so as thus to cast and venture thy soul upon him, this
uses to be the manner and way of Gods working Faith in us; by which we may
come to know whether this Faith be wrought in us, or no.

2. Some Evidences are taken from the Grace it self. In which, because Faith
does admit of degrees; some having stronger Faith, some weaker. Though all of
us have (as it is in 2 Pet. 1.1.) -- The like precious Faith, the same Faith
for kind: yet all have not the same Faith for degrees. In some it is strong, in
some it is weak: Sincere in all. All men are not of like age: all Trees not of
the like growth. We read of a little Faith. -- Oh ye of little Faith! Faith,
though little. We read of a great Faith. -- Oh Woman! great is thy Faith. All
Believers are not of the like stature in Christ. Some are but Babes, and some
are grown men; there is a little Faith comparatively: and there is a great Faith.
Therefore lest I should unsure the weak in satisfying the strong, I will here
give you 1. Some Evidences of a weak Faith. 2. Some Evidences of a strong Faith.


1. The Evidences of true Faith, though weak.

1. The weakest Faith has strong desires to close with Christ in the Terms of
the Gospel: Is willing to take Christ in the whole latitude and extent of
Christ: not only totum Christum: but totum Christi: Christ in all his Offices:
not only as a Priest, but as a King; to whom the soul is as willing to yield
Subjection, as to have Salvation from him; as desirous to submit to his
services, as to enjoy his Privileges; to do duty, as to partake of his bounty;
to throw it self at the feet of Christ, with strong desires, though (it may be
for the present) but with weak assurance of Mercy from him.

Quest. But who does not thus desire Christ? who is not willing to accept of
Christ?

Answ. It is impossible that any Unbeleeving man should desire Christ, in the
latitude and extent of Christ. He may desire him for Salvation, but not for
Sanctification: as a Priest, but not as a King, to rule and govern him; to
bring every thought into subjection to himself: for happiness, but not for
holiness. Such a one cares but to have a pardon from him: but not purging:
Glory, but not Grace. Such a one can say with David thus far -- Hide thy face
from my sins. But -- Create in me a clean heart, There he leaves him. He
desires the end of a Christian, but not his beginnings. Extrem^ Christianorum
desiderat, non exordia.


2. The desires of a wicked man, of an Unbeleeving man after Christ, they are
transient, not permanent desires: which may be in times of trouble, in a
storm; cares not if he have him as a shelter, under some rack of conscience,
when he lies on his sickbed. But these continue not. No sooner the storm is
blown over, but the desire is gone. Or in a passion, when he is in a good
mood, as Balaam desired to dye the death of the Righteous: so he, after a
Sermon, etc.

3 The desires of an Unbeleeving man are faint, not strong and earnest desires:
They are but slight and superficial desires, such as are put off with every
thing. They are not vehement and strong desires, such as will not be put off
with any thing, but with the thing desired; like the desires of David after the
Wells of Bethlehem. -- Oh! That some? would give me to drink of the Waters of
Bethlehem, etc. Like the desires of Christ, Luke 22.15. -- With desire have I
desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. That is -- with strong
desires: not a single, but a double Desire: a desiring Desire.

Such may have some slight and superficial Desires, but they are put off with
every thing. As the Mother puts a toy into the Child's hand, and the desire to
the breast is gone: So here. The Devil he puts a matter of profit, or pleasure
into their hands, and then all their desire is lost.

True Desire is strong Desire, that will not be satisfied, but with the thing
desired: as Rachel for Children. -- Give me Children, or else I dye: so here.
-- Give me Christ, or else I dye. The soul is ready to faint and mis-carry,
with the longings it has after Christ.

4. They are idle, not industrious Desires. The Desires of the sluggard, who
will not put his hand to the use of the means for obtaining of his Desire: who
will not Hear, Read, Pray, etc.

Where on the contrary, a vehement intention after Christ, is joined with a
vehement intention after the use of means for the getting of Christ. True
Desires after Christ, are ever joined with honest endeavors for Christ. He,
who desires with an honest heart, will labor with an industrious spirit.

2. Weak Faith, though it cannot close with the Promise, yet will it close with
the Precept. Though not with the Privileges of a Christian, yet with the
services of a Christian. Though it cannot share in the Comforts, yet it will
side with the Duties of a Christian. Though it cannot clear it, whether God
has given Christ to him; yet it will yield up the soul to him. Though it know
not whether he will receive it when it comes, yet it will come. Though with
Mary, it cannot say; -- My Savior, yet, with Thomas, it will say, -- My Lord.
It wants strength to throw it self into the arms of Christ, to save it. Oh! but
yet it will cast it self at the feet of Christ to serve him. Though it want the
Light of Comfort and Consolation; yet it will walk in the Light of command and
Direction.

There Is not one duty through the latitude and extent of a Christians walking,
but the soul desires and endeavors to walk in it.

3 Weak Faith is joined with mourning and sorrow for the weakness of it. What
it wants in Apprehension, it makes up in Humiliation. There is want of Sense,
but not of Sighs; like the man in the Gospel. It Is said -- He spoke with
tears; Lord, I believe, Help my unbelief. Lord, I cannot lay hold on thee: Oh!
That thou would lay hold on me! I cannot apprehend thee: do thou apprehend
me: Fold me up in the arms of that mercy, that never unfolds: close me up in
the arms of that love, that shall never unclose.

An humble wanter, is better than a proud injoyer. An humble craver, than a
proud haver.

4. Weak Faith is an unfeigned Faith, 1 Timothy 1.5. Not a Counterfeit; and
Hypocritical Faith: Such an one as never comes to God for Love: but in a Storm
for shelter, Psalm. 78.34, 35, 36, 37. -- When he slew them, then they sought
him, and inquired early after God. They remembered God was their strength, and
the most High God their Redeemer. -- But they flattered him with their mouth,
and d ssembled with him, with their Tongue: for their heart was not upright
with him, nor were they steadfast in his Covenant. But such a one as comes to
him out of Love, desires nothing more than to enjoy him: to enjoy Him, rather
than His.

5. Weak Faith is an holy Faith, Jude verse. 20. Build up one another in your
holy Faith, etc. Such a Faith as is accompanied 1. With Holiness of Heart. 2.
With Holiness in Life.


1. With Holiness of the Heart. The soul is universally sanctified. Quantum
credimus, Tantum amamus, Tantum speramus.
There Is a Treasury of Grace. There are all Graces, though as yet in weakness.
So much Faith as there is: so much Love, so much Hope, so much sorrow for sin.
They are like the Fountain, and the Flood, whereof the one arises no higher
than the other. Thus where there is Faith, there is Sanctification. Though
Sanctification be no Ingredient to Justification: yet Faith and
Sanctification; Faith and the new Creature never went asunder. There is a new
Judgment of things: a new Will to things: New Desires and Affections: New
Principles: New Purposes: New Practices. -- Old things are past away: behold,
All things are become new.

2. With Holiness in Life. Though it cannot bring forth as strong fruits of
Holiness: yet it will bring forth fruits according to its strength. A little
Tree, a young Tree may bring forth some good fruits, though not in equal
quantity to another of greater growth. So he that has the meanest Faith, he
lives an holy Life; brings forth some good fruits, though not so plentiful in
good works, as they, whose Faith is come to a more perfect growth.

6. Weak Faith does not rest in weakness: but labors after strength. Weak
Faith is a growing Faith. Though it begins in weakness, yet it grows to
strength; which growth is a character of all true Grace. And therefore does it
thirst after the Ordinances, as a new born Babe, that it may grow thereby. As
the Word was the Breeder of it: so it thirsts after it to be the Feeder. As
it was the Begetter of it: (for true Faith is the Daughter of the Ministry --
Faith comes by hearing, Romans 10.) so it thirsts after it for nourishment.

7. Weak Faith will cleave to Christ: will not forgo nor forsake Christ for any
thing. What it wants in Apprehension, it has in Adhesion: what it wants in
Evidence, it has in Adherence.

Ask any, who are weakest in Faith: whether they would sell their part in
Christ for a World: whether they would deny Christ to gain a World? and they
will quickly answer it, with an earnest Negative, as Naboth did Ahab when he
would have bought of him his Vineyard, 1 King. 21.2, 3.

Whereas a temporizing Faith does hold to Christ for want of a temptation, as
the Weathercock, that stands this way for want of another wind: A true Faith,
though weak, will hold to Christ, out of Love; nothing shall take it away, in
the midst of all temptations. It is of the Nature of true Faith, though never
so weak, to adhere and cleave to Christ, Romans 3.8. -- Thou have but a little
strength: yet thou have kept my Word, and have not denied my name.

A little Strength, a little Faith will hold to Christ, will not give up
Christ. I say not, but Gods people may fall, and in some respect forsake
Christ, as Peter did. But this may arise from the violence of temptation; the
strength of corruption, which over-powers Faith. It is (as said) of the Nature
of Faith, to cleave to Christ.

Well then (to conclude with a word to them that are weak) you that can clear
this to your own hearts, that You have Faith, though it be weak: Be not ye
discouraged: be not troubled though it be weak. Consider

1. That the smallest degree of Faith is true; is saving Faith, as well as the
greatest. A sparkle of fire is as true fire as any is in the Element of fire. A
drop of water is as true water as any is in the Ocean. So the least grain of
Faith is as true Faith, and as saving, as the greatest Faith in the World.

2. Though it be weak: yet it is a growing Faith. As all the works: so all the
Graces of God begin in weakness. The tallest Cedar was at first but a sprig.
The strongest Oak at first was an Acorn. The greatest fire at first was a
spark: so the greatest measure of Faith at the first was but as a little seed.
It had a beginning.

Those things God intended not for growth, he made perfect at first; as the
Sun, the Moon, etc. But those he intended for growth, he at first makes
imperfect; as Men, Beasts, Plants, etc.

Christ compares Faith to a grain of Mustard Seed. Not to a stone, but to a
seed. Stones are not capable of growth, but seeds are. He compares it to a
Mustard Seed: which, though it be the least of seeds, yet grows up highest.
And such a seed is thy Faith. Though it be small, though weak; be not
discouraged; the Mustard Seed will grow.

3. The weakest Faith does give the Soul Union with the strong Redeemer; as
well as the strongest. The smallest measure of Faith, if never so little, if it
bring but the soul over to Christ, it ingrafts thee into him, as well as the
stronger; makes thee a Member of this Body; a Branch in this Vine.

4. The weakest measure of Faith gives thee Communion with Christ, as well as
the strongest.

We know the least bud draws sap from the Root as well as the greatest bough:
so the weakest measure of Faith, does as truly ingraft thee into Christ; and by
that draw life from Christ, as well as the strongest. The weakest Faith has
communion with the Merits and Blood of Christ, as well as the strongest: has
communion with the Spirit of Christ, the Graces of Christ, as well as the
strongest.

Though thou art weak, Christ is strong. His strength is thine, as well as the
strongest. Thou art impure, Christ is pure. His Purity is thine as well as
others. Thou art ignorant, Christ is wise. His wisdom is thine. Thus the soul
has a communion with Christ, in all his Graces.

The least Faith marries the soul to Christ. And where there is this union,
there is a communion also with all of Christ.

The least Faith ingrafts into Christ; and being once ingrafted, the soul draws
sap and spiritual life, sense and motion from Christ.

5. Aeque licet non aequaliter.
The weakest Faith has as equal share in Gods Love as the strongest. We are
beloved in Christ. And the least measure of Faith makes us members of Christ.
The least Faith has equal right to the Promises, as the strongest. And
therefore let not our souls be troubled, discouraged for weakness.

There is difference betwixt Want, and Weakness; can thou clear this to thy
soul, That thou have Faith, though it be a weak Faith? Yet therein rejoice and
be comforted.

The least Faith sets as wide a difference between thee and unbeleevers, as is
between Heaven and Hell. And therefore study to be thankful for the least
degree of Faith; if it be true Faith. Do not so much look, as to overlook. So
look for more, as to overlook what thou have received. Neglect not that
Comfort your present Faith affords, by reaching after more.

Now having thus laid down the Evidences of a weak Faith, we shall now proceed
to lay down the Evidences of a strong Faith. Now where there is a strong Faith,
there is

1. An high prizing of Christ (which yet a weak Faith partakes of,) 1 Pet. 2.7.
-- Unto you that believe, he is precious. The soul does rate and value Christ
above all the Comforts and contentments, Riches, and Happiness in Heaven, and
Earth. Thus you see David, Psalm. 73. -- Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and
there is none in the Earth that I esteem in comparison of thee. Though he
esteemed of other things, yet Christ was the first figure. The estimate which
his soul set on Christ, did infinitely exceed the rate which he set upon any
thing besides Christ. As Paul said -- They were all but dross and dung, in
comparison with Christ. The most excellent things were loss and vile in respect
of Christ.

There are two things which make Christ precious to a man.

1. The Knowledge of Christ. 2. The Apprehension of our Interest in him.
1. The Knowledge of Christ, and that 1. Of the Want of Christ. 2. Of the Worth
of Christ.


1. The Want of Christ. When the soul apprehends the Necessity of Christ, in
respect of Pardon, Purging, Grace, Glory. When the soul sees he is under the
guilt of sin, and stands in need of Christ for Justification: He is under the
filth of sin, and stands in need of Christ for Sanctification. He is under the
power of sin, and stands in need of Christ, for the subduing and mortification
of sin. His person and performances are unclean and filthy, and stands in need
of Christ, to wash and sprinkle him: This makes Christ precious; sets a rate
upon Christ.

2. The Knowledge of the Worth of Christ. It is not the worth of things, that
makes things precious to us: but our Knowledge of the worth of them.

What is it that does commend the Jewel to the Lapidary: but his knowledge of
the worth of it. By others, that know it not, it is not valued nor esteemed. So
that which does commend Christ, the worth and preciousness of Christ to the
soul, it is this, our Knowledge of the Worth of Christ. By others, who know him
not, he is a disallowed stone, not worth the owning, 1 Pet. 2.8.

2. The second thing which does commend Christ to a soul, is The Apprehension
of the souls Interest in him. When the soul can look upon Christ, as his own,
then he esteems him; when he knows he has a Propriety in Christ, a part in
Christ.

Now a strong Belee^^r, he

1. Knows the Want of Christ. He sees he cannot live without Christ. The more
Faith, the more apprehension and sense of our wants.

2. Knows and sees the worth of Christ. He sees those excellencies and
beauties in him, which to others lie hid, and are not discovered. To others he
is an Orient Pearl in an heap of Sand: a Mine of Gold covered over with rubbish
and earth. They are not able to behold his beauties.

2. He sees and apprehends his own interest in him. And this makes the soul to
prize him. He can say, Christ is mine. His Righteousness mine, to justify
me: His Holiness mine, to Sanctify me: His Sufferings mine, to save me. And
upon this there arises an high prizing of Christ.

Quest. But you will say. Does not every man prize Christ? who does not value
and esteem of Christ?

Ans. You may say, you do so. But there is no such matter. If Christ were
precious in thy eyes, then

1. Thou would not care what pains thou tookest for the compassing of Christ.
You see a worldly man, to whom the World is precious, what pains he takes for
the attaining of the things of the World, Eccles. 4.8. the like and greater
pains would thou take for the things of Christ, if he were to thee alike
precious.

2. Thou would not care what thou partest withal for the compassing of
Christ. Thou would count Christ thy greatest gain, and all loss in
comparison of him, Phil. 3.7, 8. He is not valued at all, it he be not
valued above all.

3. Were Christ precious to thee, thou would never think thy self to have
enough of Christ. Drink, yea drink abundantly, O Beloved! Cant. 5. the more the
soul tastes and drinks, the more it thirsts, till it drink it new in the
Kingdom of Heaven.

Thus, where Christ is precious, there would be actions suitable to that rate
and esteem, the soul sets on him.

Now, when you will take no pains for the getting of Christ; when you will part
with nothing for the keeping of Christ; when you will not heap up in most
abundance whatever Christ is to others, write upon it, to you it is not
precious.

4. Where Christ is precious indeed, all of Christ is precious. He is not only
precious in his Person, in his Natures, in his Benefits: but all of Christ is
precious.

Christ in his Holiness, Christ in his Laws, Christ in his Government, Christ
in his Truth. The soul looks upon all these as prizes of Christ. He who
prizeth of Christ, does prize of all these.

As we say of Faith; It does not eligere Objectum; it does not choose its
Object; single out what it will believe, and what it will not believe; but
believes all, that God says: So I may say of this prizing of Christ. True
prizing of Christ does not single out its Object. Thus much of Christ I will
prize, and thus much not: But there is a full prizing of all Christ. Christ in
his Holiness, Laws, Government, Truth, All.

All which are parts of Christ; and are all to be prized, if ever you would
clear this, that you prize of Christ truly.

And without question, Gods people have seen so much Beauty in the Laws,
Government and Holiness of Christ, that they have lost all, rather than they
would lose their Obedience. And it was said of Christ. Vitam perdidit, ne
Obedientiam perderet: He lost his Life, rather than he would lose his
Obedience: so may it be said of them, They have taken up naked Obedience with
the loss of all. They have seen so much beauty in a Truth, that they have
hazarded and lost all, rather than they would lose a Truth. They have made this
brave adventure, to lose themselves, to save a Truth; as you see in Queen
Mary's days, in point of Transubstantiation.

In these particulars a weak Faith shareth stakes with a strong: But for what
is more peculiar to a strong Faith.

1. Strong in Faith, and strong in Grace. According to the proportion of Faith,
such is the measure of all Gods Graces in us. As weak in Faith, weak in Grace.
So strong in Faith, strong in Grace. So much Faith, so much Love, so much Hope,
so much Patience; so much Humility. We will single out some.

1. Strong in Faith, and strong in Affection and Love to Christ.

There are two things which make the soul to love Christ.

1. The discovery of the Beauties, and excellencies of Christ.

2. The Apprehension the soul has in the interest it has in this Christ.

Now both these are in a strong Faith.

1. There is a full discovery of the Beauties and Excellencies of Christ. The
Beauties of his Person, the Beauties of his Nature, etc. And that in a larger
measure, than is made known to a weak Believer.

A weak Faith sees the Excellencies of Christ in puncto: in a narrow room: as
we see the World in a Map: But a strong Faith it sees all the Excellencies of
Christ, in circumferentia: He sees a larger, and fuller draught, has a fuller
discovery of it to his soul.

And who can see it, but he must needs love him, who is all lovely; who has
all Beauties?

That Eye of Faith, which beholds the Beauties and Excellencies of Christ, will
be a Burning-Glass to the heart, to set the heart on fire, and kindle strong
affections there.

2. There is (in a strong Faith) a strong apprehension of the souls interest in
Christ. That Christ is his, and he is Christ's: His Blood and Merits his, for
Pardon, for Justification: His Grace and Holiness his, for Sanctification: His
Wisdom* his, for Direction; And therefore the soul must needs love him.

Propriety we see in things makes us love them. We love our own Husbands, our
own Wives, our own Children. The ground is this; the propriety we have in them.

So when the soul once sees Christ made over to him; that he has a propriety
in him, an interest in him; needs must the soul love him.

So you see then; where there is a strong Faith, there is a strong Affection to
Christ, strong Love to Christ: Such a love as no duty is too hard to undertake
for Christ, no task too great to pose his love to Christ.

It was said of Jacob, that he endured many years servitude for Rachel: yet
he thought the time short, all was nothing, because he loved her. So all we
can do for Christ, all will be nothing, if we once love him.

Nay; not only all we can do; but all we can suffer will be nothing to the
soul that loves him. -- Love is as strong as Death. You see it in the Apostles,
They counted not their lives too dear to give to death, for the Love of Christ.

It is not the Blood which is in the veins, the spirits, which are in the
arteries, the Life, in the Body, which will be too dear.

There is a kind of unquenchablenesse in Love, like the stone in Thracia,
which burns in the Water. -- Much Water cannot quench Love.

1. Much Afflictions from God cannot quench our Affections to God. As all our
dealings to God does not alter Gods affections to us: so all Gods dealings to
us, will not alter our affections to God -- Si diligis, Domine, fac quicquid
vis, was the speech of Calvin: Lord, if thou love me, do what thou will. And
Jobs -- Though thou kill me; yet I will still trust in thee. And the Church
professes the like, Psalm. 44.17, 18, 19. -- All this is come upon us, yet do
we not forget thee, nor have we dealt falsely in thy Covenant. Our heart is
not turned back; nor have our steps gone out of thy paths: Though thou have
sore broken us in the place of Dragons, and covered us with the shadow of
death, etc.

2. Much afflictions for God shall not cool our affections to God. We shall
be ready to go through a Sea, through a Wilderness, through the sharpest
incounters for Christ. Nothing shall pose a strong Believer.

When once the soul is persuaded of the Love of God by Faith, then there
follows abundance of love to God again, 1 John 4. from 15. to 19. -- Whosoever
confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, in him dwells God, and he in God.
And we have known and believed the Love that God has to us. God is Love; and
he that dwells in love, dwells in God, and God in him. etc. we love him,
because he loved us first. And that of Mary. -- Much was forgiven her, and
therefore she loved much.

Whiles a man looks upon God as an enemy, who hates him; he can never love
him; But, when once the soul by Faith does apprehend Gods love to him; then
does the soul love God again. The love of God begets love in the soul to God.
Amor Dei amorem animae parit.
No man's heart is warmed with the sense of Gods love, but it is inflamed with
love to God again.

As the Sun beams shining upon a Glass, begets a reflection of the Beams upon
the Wall: So the Love of God shed abroad in our hearts, breeds a reflection of
love back again to God.

2. Strong in Faith, and strong in Hope, and expectations of the thing
believed: which is that which holds up our head, and keeps the soul from
sinking, in the midst of all these worldly troubles.

3. Strong Faith, and strong Patience. A strong Faith will bear strong
Afflictions, with strong Patience. Faith does strengthen a man's shoulders to
bear evils and troubles with Patience.

A weak Tree is blown down with that which moves not a stronger Tree. Weak
shoulders sink under that burden, which a strong one will bear away. So a weak
Faith would sink with that trial, which a strong Faith is able to undergo, with
strength of Patience. And therefore it is Gods goodness still to proportion
the Trial to the strength.

A strong Faith can receive a mercy and be thankful; and can render a mercy,
and be patient.

A strong Faith can enjoy a blessing, and be cheerful; and can lose it, and
be contented.

Hence says Paul. -- I have learned in all estates, therewith to be content.
I know how to abound, and how to suffer want, etc. He was a man strong in
Faith.

And the ground of all is this, because a strong Faith having dear evidence and
apprehensions that God is a Father, does conclude that all his dealings are for
good. -- All things shall work together for good, to them that love God. And
he has said, -- He will never depart from us, from doing us good.

Faith, like the Philosophers stone, turns all into Gold; sees all Gods
dealings to be for good.

If God then afflict a man; why, will Faith say, It Is for good. I have need of
such Afflictions, to work out such a strong corruption.

Are the Afflictions many? why, will Faith say, I have need of many
Afflictions, because I have many corruptions.

Are they long? why, I have need of that too: because sin and I are so hardly
parted: It is so hard to make a divorce betwixt sin and my soul; and therefore
the afflictions had need to continue long.

Faith sees that God aims at this, to wean us from the World, to win us closer
to him, to exercise and increase our Graces, to weaken sin and corruption, to
make us more fruitful. Therefore does he prune us, that we might grow more.
If a man lop Trees at sometimes, they will wither and dye: but if at other
times, they will be made more fruitful. God uses to afflict the wicked at such
time. But the Saints, when they may grow the more. Therefore God winnows us,
fannes us, to blow away the chaff: Therefore he puts us as Gold into the fire,
that we may come out much more pure.

Strong Faith, and strong Obedience. Obedience is proportionable to our Faith.
The greater the Faith, the more the Obedience. A little Tree, a young Tree may
bring forth good fruit, as well as a greater: but not in equal quantity to the
greater: so he that has the least degree of true Faith, lives a godly life,
brings forth some fruits of Obedience: but they are not so plentiful in good
works, as those, whose Faith is come to an higher degree.

Weak Faith does obey; and this Obedience is a willing, a cheerful, a fruitful,
a constant, an universal Obedience, both, 1. In respect of the Subject; The
whole Man; and 2. In respect of the Object; The whole Law.


There is a willing yielding of the soul up to God, to walk in every way of
God. As David, Lord, I am thine; or as the Prophet Isaiah. -- One shall say, I
am the Lords. Otherwise it were not true Obedience.

But they are not able to act so much as the stronger. They are as large in
desires, in affections to obey: but not in expressions of Obedience.

But the stronger the Faith, the stronger is the Obedience, the stronger the
Will, the stronger the Affections, and the spirit in his Obedience.

A Child may do actions as well as a Man; but not with that strength, as a man
does them: he cannot do them so strongly, so vigorously.

A weak Believer may pray, hear, etc. but not pray so strongly, so powerfully;
as others, who have more Faith.

So that you see, where there is strong Faith, there is strong Obedience. A
strong Faith will follow God fully in every way. In losing ways, as well as in
gaining ways: In suffering ways, as well as in doing ways: In
discountenanced ways, as well as in such as the World does countenance: In
strait ways, as well as in broad ways: in rugged ways, as well as in plain
smooth ways: In difficult, as well as in easy ways.

You see this in Abraham concerning the sacrificing of his son: In which act
he might seem to disobey in his Obedience: And the dutiful yielding to it,
might seem to contradict duty.

There seemed not only Nature and reason to cry down this act of Obedience: but
even the word too.

The yielding of Obedience did seem to justle against the Precept of Obedience.
Yet you see, he obeyed God. It is said -- By Faith Abraham obeyed God. By
Faith indeed. It was a strong Faith.

That strong Faith that believed he should have a Son, did now obey God, in
offering of his Son. Strong Obedience proceeded from his strong Faith. Strong
Faith produces strong Obedience.

1. Strong for Active, 2. Strong for Passive Obedience.
The same Faith does supply the soul with Active strength, for doing duties:
and with Passive strength for suffering duties.

1. A strong Faith is strong to bear Reproaches for Christ. As Moses, He
esteemed the Reproach of Christ greater riches than the Treasures of Egypt,
Heb. 11.26. And Paul -- Therefore we labor, and suffer Reproach, because we
trust in the living God, 1 Timothy 4.10.

2. A strong Faith is strong to bear losses for Christ. As they, Heb. 10.34.
Who took joyfully the spoiling of their goods: as if the enemy had done them a
great courtesy.

A strong Faith is strong to bear Persecutions, Scourges, Death it self for
Christ. You see what the Apostles endured, what Stephen endured. Why, says the
Text -- He was a man full of Faith, Act. 5.8. Strong Faith did enable them to
suffer, and bear, and to go through difficulties, prisons, persecutions,
scourgings, etc. for Christ.

A strong Believer does rejoice if he can hold up God (as it were) though
himself be down: if he can raise up Gods Glory, though it be by the ruin of
himself: save his honor, by loss of himself.

What Epaminondas said: (who having resolved concerning his Buckler, either to
defend it, or to dye for it; being wounded to death, brake forth into these
words -- Number salvus est Clypeus meus? Is my Buckler safe? If that be safe, I
am well.) So the Believer, in the midst of all his sufferings; if he can keep
his Buckler safe, hold up God, and his Glory: All is well.

3. A strong Faith will believe nothing contrary to his belief. All the
temptations of Satan, all the arguments of men shall never be able to reason
him out of his Faith.

A weak Faith is quickly brought to deny his conclusion, to yield up the cause:
Satan may make a man unsay, what formerly he has said. But a strong Faith
will hold the conclusion against all Satan's sophistry. His Faith has been
gotten up by many invincible experiences; from Gods behavior to him, as a
Father; from the souls behavior to him, as a Child. And all that Satan can do,
shall not out-reason his Faith. What a man says by feeling; a temptation may
make him unsay: but what a man says by Faith, nothing can make him unsay.

If Satan do assault such a man, and tell him, God does not love him; God is
not his Father: yet will the soul bind it self to this Mast, and hold his
conclusion against all, with the Church, Isa. 63.16. -- Doubtless thou art our
Father: thou Lord art our Father, our Redeemer.

Say, Satan takes up arguments from Gods, 1. Inward, Or 2. Outward dealings
with us.


1. From his Inward dealings. May be, a man is in some present Desertion, and
wants the clear Evidences, which formerly he had; and Satan from thence does
argue, That God is not our God; he is not our Father: yet will not a strong
Faith be reasoned out of his Faith.

The soul will yet conclude it, though it cannot clear it, and believe it, when
it cannot see it. The strong Christian lives by Faith, not by feeling; and
knows God may be His God, though by sense it be not discerned, but that God
is not his God. You see this, in Psalm. 22.1. -- My God! My God! There Is Faith.
Why have thou forsaken me! There Is sense. Faith held the conclusion against
sense. That God was his God: though sense could not apprehend, but that he was
forsaken of God.

And therefore, when the eye of Sense and Evidence is put out; yet he has the
eyes of Faith, to see and believe. And -- Blessed is the man (says our Savior
to Thomas) who believes, and sees not, Joh. 20.29. A strong Faith will trust
God further than he sees him. Faith is the Evidence of things not seen, Heb.
11.1. Faith will trust upon the Promise of Mercy, in the want of Sense of
Mercy. Our Faith is not begotten by sense and feelings: but by the Promise: and
therefore in the want of sense and feelings, the soul may believe, Isa. 50.10.
Though a man walk in darkness, and sees no light, yet may he trust in the
Lord, and lean upon his God.

A weak Faith if it want feeling, it is gone, but the strong Faith will -- Hope
against Hope; Believe against Sense, Reason, and present Evidence, and can say,
God is mine; though it want the present Sense and Evidence of it. It will trust
in God a Father, when his dealings seem to argue him an Enemy. Faith will read
Love in his angry looks; and look through the mist of Desertion, and see the
affections of a Father, under the expressions of an Enemy. Thus did Job by
Faith -- Though thou kill me: yet will I trust in thee. Full well it knows,
Though God hide his face, yet he cannot deny himself.

2. Say he takes an argument from Gods outward dealings in chastising and
afflicting of us, and say; If God loved thee, he would not so afflict thee: If
God were thy Father, he would not so chastise thee. However the weak Faith may
be born down with such a temptation as this; yet the strong Faith is not moved
with such a temptation: it is able to retort on Satan; because God loves me,
therefore he scourges me, that I might not be condemned with the World.
That I might not love the World, therefore he suffers the World to frown on
me. That I might be crucified to the World; therefore he suffers me to be
crucified in the World. Because I am a Child, therefore he afflicts me. --
He scourges every Son, whom he receives, Romans 12.6, 7, 8.9, etc.

God takes liberty to chastise our bodies, to save our souls. And God loves
tenderly, when he corrects severely, Job 5.17. Pro. 3.11.

Thus does a strong Faith hold up the conclusion of Faith against all the
Reasonings of Satan against it. Let him produce never so many Evidences to the
contrary, yet will he not be born down in it. It Is a maxim of Faith; he
will hold to against all opposition whatsoever.

You see it was thus in Job. -- When God had taken away his goods; when his
hand was upon his body, and upon his spirit too, not only withdrawing himself
from him; but positively inflicting of his displeasure upon his soul: yet all
that Satan could do by himself, all that he could do by his friends, who
joined with Satan in the battle, could not make him unsay, what his heart and
the Spirit of God had so often said; nothing shall make him to eat his own
words. Nothing shall cause him to deny his integrity. The root of the matter
was still in him: and he will live and dye with this in his heart; with this
in his mouth; that notwithstanding all this; God is his God, God is his Father:
his heart has been sincere before him. And this was a strong Faith that would
be thus resolute in believing, when he had so much reason on the other side
to bear him down.

4. A strong Faith will trust in God in difficulties; in difficult cases; in
exigents. Here is the trial of Trust. It will trust in God, 1. With small
means. 2. Without means. 3. Against means.


1. With small means. Strong Believers know full well, be the means never so
small; if God bid them to be effectual, they shall do the work. As Jeremy was
drawn out of the Dungeon with old rotten Rags: so God can make use of weak and
contemptible means, to effect his own purposes, to draw thee out of the Dungeon
of affliction.

Faith knows God can help with few, as well as with many; with a small hand, as
well as with a great; all is one to him. It was that that Asa said to God, when
Zera the Ethyopian came against him, with such a great host, that he seemed
to be but a Centry in the midst of a large circumference, 2 Chronicles. 14.11. --
Lord, it is nothing with thee to help with many, or with few. Help us, Lord;
for we trust upon thee; and in thy name we go out against this great
multitude, And the day was theirs. But in another he was overthrown, when the
difficulty was less; because he trusted not on the Lord. The like we read of
Jehoshaphat, 2 Chronicles. 20.1, 2, 3, 4. and many others.

2. Strong Faith will trust in God without means.

Zeph. 3.12. -- I will leave in the midst of thee, an afflicted and poor people
(a people stripped of all means) and they shall trust in the name of the Lord.
So 2 Cor. 1.10, 11. -- We had the sentence of death in our selves: we saw no
help, no means, and all this was -- That we should not trust in our selves,
but in God, which raises the dead, 1 Timothy 5.5. -- She that is a Widow in
deed, and desolate, Trusts in God, etc.

Thus you see strong Faith will trust in God, in the absence of means, when all
means are wanting. It knows, God is able to do his purpose without, as well as
with means. A strong Faith makes God all its confidence. And therefore when all
means fail, when all props are taken away: yet confidence is not.

Unbelief will trust God no further than it sees means to bring about the thing
it desires.

You see the unbeleeving Noble Man, when the Prophet Elisha told him in that
great famine, that the next day there should be such great plenty. What! says
he, If God could open the windows of Heaven, how could this be? Though there
were a famine on earth, he had no reason to think there was a dearth in
Heaven: God was able to do it; his hand was not shortened. But here it was. He
saw no means whereby this might be effected; and therefore he could not
believe it.

God may work wonders, and yet in an ordinary way. You see here in this Famine.
A wonder it was, that they should have such plenty, in so short a time. And it
was too big for the noble man's Faith to believe. But yet you see it was a
wonder wrought in an ordinary way.

The like you see in the Israelites, Psalm. 78.19, 20. -- Can God furnish a
Table in the Wilderness? Indeed he smote the Rock, and the waters gushed out.
But can he provide flesh for his people also? One would have thought that the
former experience of Gods power should have satisfied them in this: that they
that granted the one, could not have denied the other; that God was able to do
that also. But the former was over, and here was a new strait they were in; and
they saw no means how it should be effected; therefore they could not believe
it.

The like of Ahaz, Isa. 7.11, 12. God told him that his enemies that were come
against him, should not prevail against him: God would fight for him. And that
he might be certain of this, he bids him -- Ask a sign in Heaven, or in the
deep, for the confirmation of his Faith. But says Ahaz -- I will not tempt
God. What Is that? I will provide for my self. I will not trust in the want of
means. I should tempt God in so doing.

And many such Ahazes we have in the World. They think, to trust in God in the
absence of means, is to tempt God. What, say they, does God work wonders, that
he should do this without means? Why God can do wonders, and yet in an
ordinary way.

Thus strong Faith will trust without means. God is not trusted at all, if not
trusted alone. If we take in any thing with God, in our trust, we trust not
God at all, as we ought.

When men are brought to the lowest strait, they are nearest to the highest
God. And then will Faith work best, when it works alone; and then is God
nearest to help, when man's strength is small. Man's extremity is Gods
opportunity.

The ancient Tragedians, when things were brought to that pass; that they saw
no possibility of humane help, they used to bring down some of their Gods.
Hence that Proverb. (...). Not much unlike that Proverb among the Jews. -- In
the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen.

3. A strong Faith will trust against means, in the opposition of all means.
Such know, that he that can help without means, can help, if he please
against all means, -- Is any thing too hard for the Lord?

Thus Moses trusted in God. when the Red Sea was before them, the Egyptians
behind them, and the Mountains on each side of them -- Fear not, stand still,
behold the salvation of the Lord, etc.

Thus David, when the people would have stoned him. The Text says. David
comforted himself in the Lord his God. Thus Daniel, and the Three Children.
Abraham also both in the receiving and offering of his Son Isaac.

5. Strong Faith is accompanied 1. With much Peace. 2. With much Joy.


1. With much Peace. Strong Faith lives in the upper Region above all storms.
There Is much variety of weather here below; now calms, now storms: but if a man
were above, there is a continual serenity, and clearness. Strong Faith lives in
Heaven above all storms; and therefore there is nothing but calmness and quiet,
Romans 5.1. -- Being justified by Faith, we have Peace with God, Isa. 26.3. --
Thou will preserve him in perfect Peace, whose mind is stated on thee, Romans
15.13. -- The God of all Consolation, fill you with all Joy and Peace in
believing.

Such a man, he has Peace above him. Peace with God. He has Peace within
him; a peaceable conscience; not a dead Peace, a sleepiness of Conscience; like
unto the calmness of the dead Sea, whose calmness is not of Nature, but from a
curse: But a sound Peace, a spiritual Peace, a Peace after War, a Peace joined
with War, and Conflict; the surest Peace of all.

2. With much Joy. So much Faith, so much Joy, Romans 15.13. -- 1 Pet. 1.8. In
whom believing, ye rejoice with Joy unspeakable, and full of Gl^ry. There Is
attending a strong Faith, a full Joy, an Harvest-Joy: Such a Joy as will hold
out in troubles; Joy that is Persecution-Proof, Prison-Proof, Tribulation-Proof,
Romans 5.3. -- We joy in Tribulations. Other men may joy in Prosperity, in
Abundance: But this is a Joy that out-lasts Riches, out-lasts Comforts; a Joy
which nothing can quench.

6. Strong Faith will subdue strong corruptions; strong sins, strong lusts;
those Sons of Zerviah, that are too hard for us.

Faith makes use of Sin-subduing Promises: of a Sin-subduing Christ. And the
more Faith, the more Strength is conveyed from Christ to us.

Faith sets the Power of Christ against the power of lust: the strength of
Christ against the strength of corruption; who is able to subdue all things
unto himself, and to conquer the most untamed corruptions.

7. Strong Faith will overcome strong Temptations. Temptations from the World,
Temptations from Satan. Strong Faith subdues, where weak Faith is blown down
with every blast of Temptation, not being able to stand out against the
assaults of Satan.

Strong Faith overcomes the allurements and threats of the World: it overcomes
all. This is our victory, whereby we overcome the World, even our Faith.

8. Strong Faith overcomes strong doubts; answers strong Objections in the
soul. Such doubts and objections move not them, that are ready to overwhelm a
weak Faith. It will fly away with such twigs as will hinder the flight of
weaker Christians.

There are doubts in the best Believers. So long as there is flesh, Fides non
omnem dubitationem expellit, sed vincet.
so long there will be doubts: but strong Believers are not overcome with
doubts; but will overcome doubts. Though Faith does not expel, yet it conquers
doubts, Romans 4.20. -- Abraham staggered not through unbelief; but being strong
in Faith, gave Glory to God. That is, though there might be some doubts, yet
they prevailed not to the staggering of his Faith. His Faith overcame his
doubtings. A weaker Faith is full of doubts, making the soul like a pare of
Balances, the scales whereof are wavering sometimes this way, sometimes that.
The mind has now its assenting, and by and by its dissenting: Now it says,
God is my God. Christ is my Christ; and anon it fears, Christ is not his. God
is not his. Now it hopes its sins are pardoned, anon it fears; its sins are not
pardoned.

Now the soul thrusts out for Comfort; and by and by draws back with
discouragement. On this side it sees ground why it should believe it shall be
saved: yet on the other side sees ground, whereby to fear it shall be damned.

But a strong Faith overcomes all these doubts: having strong persuasions of
its interest in Christ. It says, Christ is mine: and nothing shall make it
unsay, Christ is not mine. It is able to answer all.

9. Strong Faith, and strong Prayers.

1. Strong to wrestle with God. 2. Strong to prevail with God.
1. Such are strong to wrestle with God. Faith does furnish a man with a deep
sense of his wants; with strong affections, with strong Promises to wrestle
with God, to have those wants supplied. Jacobs Prayer was called a wrestling
with God. It was a wrestling-prayer, such an one as proceeded from a strong
Faith; as you may read in the story, Genesis 32.24. to the 30. where he
incounters God, with Gods own strength; the strength of his Promise, the
strength of his Covenant. -- O God of my Fathers, Abraham, Isaac: Thou have
said, thou will bless me; thou badst me return into my own Country, and thou
would deal well with me. Deliver me now, then I beseech thee, from the
hand of my Brother, etc.

Moses Prayer was a wrestling-Prayer, Exodus 32.10. to the 16. where he was so
strong as to stop the proceedings of God, against a rebellious people: insomuch
that God bids him -- let me alone. It was a Beleeving-Prayer.

So may it be said of Hezekiahs Prayer, Daniels Prayer: They were
wrestling-Prayers, strong-Prayers.

I will instance but in one. The Woman of Canaan, Mat. 15.22. to the 28. where
you see how she wrestled with Christ. Her case was doubtful for a long time;
she went through great temptations: she is reported to be a Woman great in
Faith.

1. There was Tentatio Taciturnitatis. There was the trial of silence. She
prays, and Christ answers her not a word. Here was a great trial; when God
shall hide himself in a Cloud, and not answer her prayers.

2. There was Tentatio Particularitatis: first nothing, then worse than
nothing, verse. 24. -- I am not sent, but to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel. As if he had said, -- Thou do not belong to the election of Grace:
thou art not in Covenant: I came only to mine own; not to thee: therefore I
will not help thee.

3. There was Tentatio Indignitatis. The trial of Indignity, verse. 26. -- It is
not meet to take the Childrens bread, and cast it unto Dogs.

Yet see the strength of her Faith, how it enabled her to out-wrestle these
temptations; how it enabled her to follow God. -- True Lord; but yet the Dogs
may eat the crumbs. Be it, that I am but a Dog; yet thy Dog. And if thou will
not give me leave to eat of Childrens morsels: deny me not Childrens crumbs,
such as fall from their Table; such as they have no need of.

Thus you see, strong Faith produces strong Prayers; strong to wrestle with God
himself.

2. Strong to prevail with God. They are not only wrestling, but
prevailing-Prayers.

Jacob wrestled; and Jacob prevailed: Moses wrestled; and Moses prevailed.
David wrestled, and he prevailed: The Woman of Canaan wrestled; and she
prevailed, verse. 28. -- Oh Woman! great is thy Faith: Be it unto thee, even as
thou will. So the Church for Peter: and they brake open the Prison doors, and
set him free.

They are called availing Prayers, Jam. 5.19. -- The effectual fervent Prayer
of a Righteous man avails much. Thus strong Faith has strong Prayers.

And let me add this more.

A strong Faith does not only make strong Prayers: But a strong Faith can take
1. Long Delays, 2. Strong Denyals, well at Gods hand.


1. A strong Faith can take long Delays well at Gods hand. -- He that
believes, makes not haste. Such a man can wait upon Gods time, for the
bestowing of a Mercy. Such a man knows that God has a fullness of time to
bestow mercy in.

And as it was said of the sending of Christ (that universal Mercy, that summum
genus of Mercy) when the fullness of time was come, God sent his Son: So when
the fullness of time is come, God will send us our desires; bestow the Mercy.
And therefore he can wait.

A weak Faith is quickly worn out, it cannot wait; if God come not presently,
it is cast down, and can wait no longer. You see this in the Two Disciples
going to Emmaus. -- We hoped that this should have been he that should have
delivered Israel; but he is dead: and this is the third day. They might have
waited a little longer; they were too quick and hasty: what though the third
was come, it was not yet expired: great things might have been done yet before
night. But weak Faith is impatient of delays. -- This evil proceeds from the
Lord: shall I wait on him any longer? was the voice of that wicked King, 2
King. 6.33. -- Every vision fails, Ezekiel. 12.22. so they, and too often many
better than they.

But now a strong Faith will hold out in delays; yea, and pray more earnestly.
As you see David did: who though -- his Eyes failed, his Flesh failed, though
his Heart failed, yet he renewed his supplication from day to day. The like in
Daniel; in the Woman of Canaan; in Hannah; and in the Blind man, he was blamed
for his importunity; and was yet the more importunate.

Such a man knows, that he who has any thing from God must continue in
Prayer. Jacob, all night. David, day and night. Jonah, three days and nights.
Daniel, one and twenty days and nights. Moses, forty days, and forty nights.
God often defers his people, to inhance, and raise up the price of mercy, to
make them more fit for mercy, more thankful for mercy. And therefore he can
wait.

2. Strong Faith cannot only take long delays; But denyals well. It can submit
to denials, as well as to grants. You see it in David. He had strong desires
for the continuance of the life of his Child. God denied it. See how calm, how
submissive he was, in the denial; insomuch that he was a wonder to all his
servants.

A weak Faith does faint and is discouraged at the denyals of requests. It
cannot tell how to take a denial of God: but a strong Faith can take denyals as
well as grants.

A strong Faith is clear in this, that God is a Father, and therefore his
denyals are in mercy: all is for good: he knows, if God hear him not according
to his will, Etsi non ad voluntatem, tamen ad sanitatem.
yet according to his good.

A strong Faith submits to Gods wisdom, and Gods will, who is the only Wise.
We may desire a thing at Gods hand, and in our wisdom may judge it to be
good: But God in his Wisdom, who knows the issue of things, sees it will be
for our hurt; and therefore denies it. And Faith submits to his wisdom, and
follows him; as a blind man his guide.

We may ask some things too earnestly, which are more profitably denied, then
granted. As Solomon said of Adonijahs request, so I may say of many of ours:
We ask our lives, we desire our Bane, such things as would hurt us, and undo
us. And are not those things mercifully denied, which without hurt cannot be
granted? This is to cross us with a Mercy. A child desires a knife of the
Father, The Child sees no hurt in it: but the Father does. And shall we not
then submit to the Wisdom of our Father?

A man may desire this evil to be taken away; this cross, this affliction to
be removed; this temptation, this corruption to be taken away. God denies it,
seeing it best for a man to be exercised with them. And Faith will submit.

Again, a man desires this outward mercy; it may be Riches, may be Honors,
the great things of the World: And thinks (it may be) if God did raise him,
he would raise God: if God would make him great, he would make God great.

But now God denies this. God sees it is better that thou want them, than enjoy
them. And Faith submits to Gods Wisdom, Voluntas Dei optima; and si optima,
optima vult.
and to Gods Will in it. Gods Will is his will: and says, Not my will, but thy
will be done. Gods will is the best, and being best, wills what is the Best
both for his own glory, and our good.

Again; thou desire some spiritual mercy from God. Perhaps thou desire
Perfection of Grace in this life: and God sees it is better that corruptions
should dwell in thee, as the Lees among the Wine, to keep the Wine sweet, to
humble thee; or that they might be as pricks in thy eyes, and goads in thy
sides, to make thee more forward and fervent in holy performances.

Perhaps thou desire a great deal of Knowledge with Saul, to be higher by
the head and shoulders, than thy fellow Christians: Or with David, to be wiser
than thy Teachers: God denies it; and Faith takes the denial: knowing all is
for the best. It may be, it might beget pride; this would puff up; it would
be too great a sail for so small a Boat; and rather over-turn thee, than set
thee forward.

Perhaps thou desire to enjoy the continual light of Gods countenance; to be
like the Island of Rhodes, in perpetuo Sole: in continual Sunshine. But God
denies it, thou art sometimes in the valley of tears, as well as sometimes in
the Mountain of Joy. Thou have cloudy and clear days, calmy and stormy
seasons. And Faith submits to this denial. It sees all is for the best. That
we should not have our Heaven upon Earth. This might occ^sion spiritual Pride,
as you see in Paul. It might occasion a common esteem of so great a mercy. And
therefore submits.

Thus you see how a strong Faith is strong in Prayers, can take long delays,
and submit to denyals too from God.

My Brethren; this is the strength of Faith that can be so strong in Desires,
so patient in Delays, so submissive in Denyals. Here is strong Faith.

10. Strong Faith has strong desires to go to Christ by death; and that Christ
should come to him by Judgment.

1. To go to Christ by death. A Believer has Vitam in Patientia, Mortem in
Desiderio: He has Life in Patience, Death in Desire. Life is his Sea, where
he meets with nothing but storms: Death is his Harbor.

Life is his way, his Inn at the best. But Heaven is his Home, There his best
Friends are: there his chief business lies: there is his abiding-place; and
thither he desires to go.

A weak Faith is loath to dye: is afraid of death: he has not yet gotten his
Evidence sealed, his hope in his hand. But when this is done, then with Paul, I
desire to be dissolved. Or with Simeon, when he had once gotten Christ into
his arms -- Lord, Now let thou thy servant depart in Peace; for my eyes
have seen thy salvation. You hear how David cries, Psalm. 42.1, 2. As the Heart
pants for the Waterbrooks, so pants my soul after thee, O Lord. My soul
thirsts for God; when shall I come and appear before God!

2. Strong Faith has strong desires that Christ would come to Judgment. It is
not well contented there should be a distance betwixt Christ and it. And
therefore cries with the Spouse, Cant. 8.14. -- Make haste, my Beloved. -- Why
are the Chariots so long in coming?

Though in another case it be true, that the Prophet says, -- He that
believes makes not haste: yet in this case, He that believes most, makes most
haste.

Here are but some broken Rings passing betwixt Christ and us, Here is but the
contract and espousals made betwixt Christ and the soul. But the day of
Judgment is the great solemnization of the marriage. As the espoused Bride
longs for the marriage day: so the soul that is espoused to Christ, longs for
the consummation of this blessed marriage.

Weak Faith desires the coming of Christ; but yet would fain be fitter and
readier for him: as the Wife desires the presence of her Husband: but yet would
have her house in order, before he come: so they.

But a strong Faith has all in readiness, and desires nothing more than a
consummation of these days of sin, and the eternal fruition and enjoyment of
her best Husband.

Use of Exhort.
We are now fallen (at last) upon the last use; the Use of Exhortation, wherein
I shall exhort you, 1. To get Faith. 2. To exercise Faith. 3. To grow in Faith.


1. Let me exhort you to labor to get Faith. Let the chief of your pains, and
choice of your endeavors be for the getting of Faith. It is a thing to be
lamented, how men do labor and toil for earthly things, and how they neglect
Heavenly. Oh! That men should rise up early, and go to bed late; and eat the
bread of carefulness, for the compassing of earthly things! But in the mean
time, the things of Heaven are neglected! no man labors for them. Faith and
Grace are the great druggs of the World; they lie upon our hands, they will not
off; no man bids money for them, no man endeavors the compassing of them.

Oh! that men should care for the Body, and neglect the Soul! feed the Body,
and starve the Soul! cloathe the Body, and the Soul go naked! That men should
labor after other things, and never set themselves to the endeavor and
compassing of this one thing necessary! Shall I urge some motives?

1. Consider the greatness of this sin of Unbelief. 2. The Necessity of Faith.
3. The Excellency of it.
1. Consider the greatness of the sin of Unbelief. It is such a sin as offers
injury and wrong to All-God. It wrongs all the attributes of God. As Faith does
honor all Gods attributes: It is said of Abraham, that -- He gave glory to
God by believing, Romans 4.20. He honored his Mercy, his Wisdom, his Power,
etc. So on the contrary, unbeleif is such a sin, as wrongs all: The Wisdom,
Power, Mercy, Truth and Justice of God.

1. You wrong the Wisdom of God: you slight and undervalue the Glorious
thoughts of his Wisdom, -- Rejecting the Counsel of God against your selves,
Luke 7.30.

2. You wrong the Mercy and Love of God; even the most precious thoughts of
Mercy, that ever his breast did conceive toward sinful men: the most glorious
expression of love: Angels wonder.

3. You wrong the Power of God: you straiten and limit his Power, Psalm. 78.41.
-- They tempted God, and limited the holy one of Israel in the wilderness, by
their Unbelief. So we read in the Gospel, Mark 6.5. -- Christ could not do any
miracles in that place, because of their Unbelief.

4. You wrong his Truth. As -- He that believes has put to his seal, that God
is true; that his Word is true, his Promise true; he will save sinners: so on
the contrary, He that believes not, makes God a Liar, 1 John 5.10. Indeed God
is true; and whether we believe, or believe not, God is faithful, as the
Apostle has it, 2 Timothy 2.13.

But inasmuch as in us lies, we make God untrue, make him a Liar. Our unbelief
does give God the real lie in all.

And of what a fearful nature then is Unbelief! God has promised the pardon of
sin, and has annexed his Oath to his Promise, and his Seal to his Oath: and if
we believe not, Uae nobis, si nec juranti Deo credimus.
we make him untrue in his Promise, his Oath, his Covenant, etc.

2. Unbelief is a Mother-sin; it is a Root-sin; the summum genus of sin; such a
sin as has all sins folded up in the bowels of it; a catholic sin. And
therefore the Apostle expresses sinners of all sorts under this general
(Children of Unbelief) which is as much as Children of all ungodliness, such as
had all sin in them.

Unbelief is the Womb of sin. If you could rip up Unbelief, you shall find all
sin in the bowels of it. There is Pride, Profaneness, Rebellion, contempt of
God, contempt of his Word, hardness of Heart, love of the World, Covetousness;
There is all, all sins lie in the belly of this monster Unbelief.

An unbeleeving man is a proud Person; an unbeleever is an hard-hearted person:
an unbeleeving person is a profane spirited person, a rebellious man: he is
all.

Unbelief is both the Entertainer, and Maintainer of sin. It is not only the
Mother, but the Nurse of sin. Every sin does suck the dug of Unbelief. It is a
sin-succouring, a sin-nourishing sin. Not only the Breeder, but the Feeder of
sin. Not only the Begetter, but the Nourisher of sin. It is such a Root as does
nourish and succor all the branches of sin.

There is nothing holds up the Kingdom of sin, but Unbelief. If men would
believe, the Kingdom of sin would totter and come down. But whiles men believe
not, the hands of sin are strengthened, the kingdom of sin is held up in us.

Sin goes to Unbelief for protection, and there it has it. Unbelief will be a
shield to keep off any blow that is given to sin.

Sin goes to Unbelief for security; and unbelief secures and warrants sin: sin
dwells where unbelief keeps the house; sin sits down securely under the
shadow of unbelief. Let curse and Hell be threatened against sin, yet unbelief
will secure it. It makes but childes-play of all the threats of God. Sin keeps
the house, and unbelief bars the door, and keeps out all that would endanger
sin: It will secure it.

Sin goes to unbelief, not only for defense, but for maintenance: and unbelief
will maintain sin: it will fetch in provision for lust. It is not only the
Entertainer, but the Maintainer of sin. It shall want no morsels: unbelief will
furnish it.

3. Unbelief is a soul-killing-sin, a Soul-damning-sin. It is a controversy
among many, Whether Negative unbelief damn men.

But we will not enter on the controversy. For Positive unbelief, of which
nature ours is now under the light of the Gospel, It is agreed upon all sides,
that this is damning. -- He that believes shall be saved: but he that
believes not, shall be damned. Mercy it self says so: He that you look to
be saved by, says it, Mark 16.16.

Nay, not only damned, but the sorest damnation of all; the deepest Cellars of
Hell, the lowest Vaults of Hell are reserved for such, who are Unbeleevers now
under the Gospel. -- This is condemnation, (that is, the sorest condemnation)
That Light is come into the World: (that a Christ is tendered to you, a Christ
is offered to you) and men love darkness rather than light: yet men will not
believe, John 3.19.

There is no fall into Hell, like such an one as is taken at a stumble at
Christ: No damnation like that, which is pronounced in the Court of Mercy. An
Unbeleever is condemned in the Court of Mercy. And when Mercy it self condemns,
as it shows the offense to be heinous: so it makes the condemnation the more
heavy.

As the sowrest Vinegar comes from the sweetest Wine, so out of the sweetest
Mercy, the sorest condemnation. It will be ten thousand times easier for
those, who are condemned under the Law; their torments will not be so heavy,
Hell will not be so hot to them, as to such who are now condemned under the
Gospel.

It had been better for you, that you had been born Turks and Heathens, such as
never heard of Christ, than Christians, if you live and dye in an unbeleeving
condition.

Thus you see, Unbelief is a remediless sin. Such a sin as there is no remedy
for it, no plaster for it.

All other sins have a Remedy, and Christ is the Remedy: But unbelief denies
the Remedy. There is a plaster for Drunkenness, for Swearing, for Murder, etc.
All other sins have a Plaster, and Christ is that Plaster: But Unbelief
denies the Plaster.

God gives the Mercy of the Book to all other sins; if sinned against the Law,
and condemned by the Law: yet he tenders the Mercy of the Book. -- He that
believes shall be saved. But Unbelief rejects this Mercy: It will not read.

If the Law condemn us, we are suffered to appeal to the Gospel: If Justice
condemn us, we are suffered to appeal to Mercy. As you see the Publican, who
was arraigned, sentenced, and condemned by the Law: But he appeals to the
Court of Mercy. -- God be merciful to me a sinner. And you see the Sentence
took no hold on him.

But now, If Mercy condemn us, if the Gospel condemn us, whither shall we
appeal? whither shall we go? Now it is Mercy that condemns unbeleeving men:
they are condemned in the Court of Mercy. Hence one, There is no sin that does
peremptorily, Non filios Diaboli faciunt quaecunque peccata: Filios Diaboli
infidelitas facit.
(and Quoad eventum) damn us, but unbeleeving. There is no sin that does (de
facto) bring death, but unbeleeving. Other sins do create a merit of death: but
unbelief does actually bring death upon the soul. While a man believes not, he
is under the Covenant of Works; and there sin does de facto bring death: it
binds all sin upon the conscience, makes a man to stand out, to answer for his
own guilt, bear his own curse; and therefore it is said, Joh. 3.18. -- He that
believes not, is condemned already: He is condemned in all Courts.

1. In the Court of Justice. The Law condemns him. -- Cursed is every man that
continues not in every thing that is written in the Law, to do the same, Gal.
3.10.

2. In the Court of Mercy. That condemns him. This is the sentence there -- He
that believes not, shall be damned, Mark 16.16.

3. In the Court of Conscience. He is self-condemned; and has a beginning of
the execution.

Thus then you see of what a fearful nature is this sin of unbelief. It is the
greatest damning sin now under the Gospel.

2 Motives from the necessity of Faith.

1. In respect of our Persons. 2. In respect of our Performances.
1. Faith is needful, in respect of our Persons. Our Persons are.

1. Under the guilt of sin, of many thousand sins. And without Faith, there is
no Justification.

2. Under the power of sin, of lust. And without Faith, no subduing.

3. Under the pollution and filth of sin. And we had need of Faith for the
purifying of our hearts.

So that Faith is needful for the justifying of our Persons, the subduing of
our lusts, the purifying of our hearts.

2. Faith is needful, in respect of our Performances. Faith is necessary to
every work of a Christian: needful to every Ordinance.

We must pray in Faith; hear in Faith; receive in Faith; do all things in
Faith. Faith must incorporate it self with every duty. -- Whatever is not of
Faith, is sin, Romans 14.23. Whatever is before Faith is only the issue of a
corrupt nature, and of a corrupt conscience; and therefore it cannot please
God, Tit. 1.15. Romans 10.14.

Faith is the salt, which seasons and sweetens every duty. It is the life, and
soul of every performance; without which all are but dead, and stinking works;
and cannot please God. Faith is to duty, as the Soul is to the Body.

When you go to Prayer, you had need of Faith, whereby you may -- Cry Abba,
Father; without which Prayer is but the complaint of Nature; or the cry of a
hopeless and desperate heart.

When you go to hear, you had need of Faith, to incorporate it self with the
word heard; without which the word will not profit us: nor the word Promising,
nor the word threatening, the one to humble us, the other to raise us, and
comfort us.

When you go to receive, you had need of Faith. He goes to work without
tools, that goes to any Ordinance without Faith.

You have need of Faith to give you admission into Gods Presence. -- Draw near
with a true heart in assurance of Faith, Heb. 10.22.

You have need of Faith to give you acceptance in the work.

You have need of Faith to procure a blessing, when all is done.

Faith is the great Grace, that is to be employed in all the Ordinances of
God. This must run through every Ordinance, if you would profit by them. The
word must be mingled with Faith, Prayer with Faith, etc.

Unbelief makes every Ordinance of God unprofitable to us. What is the reason
that men hear the Word, and get no more benefit; but because they believe not?
Heb. 4.2. The Word preached did not profit them, because it was not mingled
with Faith in them that heard it.

Do you think the word of Threatening could be heard, and you not be humbled,
if you did believe the Truth of all? who were able to lift up his head, nay to
stand under the threats of the great God of Heaven and Earth, if he did
believe? It is said -- The Devils believe and tremble, Jam. 2. And had you but
as much Faith as they to believe the truth of what God threatens against sin,
it would make the stoutest sinner of you all to tremble.

And do you think the word Promising, Beseeching, Entreating could be so
unprofitable, if you had Faith to mingle with it, to apply it to your selves?

It is, because you bring no Faith to the Word, that the Word of God is not a
raising, a quickening, a comforting word to your souls: That it is not an
inlightening, a convincing, a converting, and a reforming word.

So for the Sacraments. Could these be so unprofitable? could you live under
them, and get no further victory of lust? no more increase of Grace, if you did
bring and exercise Faith here, to fetch from this treasure opened.

It is necessary to every Ordinance, necessary to your Callings; necessary to
every condition. We had need of Faith to go through all the conditions of this
life: Through Prosperity, Adversity, Sickness, Health: Losses and Enjoyments.
As the Apostle said of Patience, the Daughter, so I say of Faith the Mother. --
You have need of Faith, that after ye have suffered the Will of God, ye might
inherit the Promise, Heb. 10.36.

If our condition be prosperous, we had need of Faith, to see all is for
good, and need of Faith, to enable us to make a good use of it.

1. You had need of Faith, to see the Tenor of your enjoyments; That you enjoy
them, not only out of leave, but out of Love: not only from a general
Providence; but from a particular Promise.

2. You had need of Faith, to see further than your present Estates: to look
upon these pence, and farthings as earnests of better things: as something in
hand for those things in hope.

3. You had need of Faith, to see the heart of the giver in the gifts; his
Affection, in the expression; the God of Mercy, in the enjoyment of Mercy; to
taste the fountain in the stream.

An unbeleeving man he is not able to clear this; He may have prosperity in
Judgment, and heap up Riches to his own destruction; All his Wealth may be
but fuel to that fire, to make Hell hotter; as Oil to kindle the flame of
lust, so fuel to increase the fire of torment hereafter.

So if our condition be troublesome and afflicted, we had need of Faith to
see all is for the best, and need we had of Faith, to make the best use of it,
to humble us, wean us, win us, etc. Faith can see good in all; making all
good to him, though in themselves never so evil.

3. There are Motives drawn from the excellency of Faith. I shall say no more
of it, but what I have already said, and you may read in these several
Royalties of Faith already laid down.

The second branch of the Exhortation is to you that have Faith.

Let me exhort you to exercise your Faith.

1. In matter of Justification under the guilt of sin. Trust in God for Pardon,
for Justification. What though thy sins be never so great, Iniquity,
Transgression, and sin? sins of Nature? sins of Course? sins of Custom? what
though they be bloody and crimson sins? yet he can pardon, he can forgive
them.

Thy sins are great: his Mercy is greater. Thy sins are many: His Mercies are
more. Thy sins have abounded: His Mercy superabounds. As thou have been
plentiful in sinning; so he is in Mercy for pardoning sin, Isa. 1.18. Though
your sins were as crimson, they shall be made white as Snow: though as red as
Scarlet, they shall be as Wool, Isa. 55.7. Let him return to the Lord, and
he will have mercy upon him; and to our God: for he will multiply pardons.

Though thy sins have weakened the Law, and made that unable to save thee, or
do thee good, Romans 8 3. yet they have not weakened Christ and Grace. -- Christ
is able to save to the utmost, even to the utmost of your sins, the utmost of
your doubts and fears.

Non datur summum malum.
There is neither quality nor quantity of sins, that can pose the fullness of
Christ. There is not so much evil in sin, in all thy sins -- as there is Mercy
in him. -- If thou can believe, -- all things are possible to the Believer.
They are Christ's own words, Mark. 9.23. It is possible for thy greatest
rebellions to pass away as a cloud, and to be dispelled and scattered, as a
mist, if thou can believe. He can drown Mountains, as well as Molehils.

2. Trust in him for Sanctification. Christ is full of all Grace and Truth,
Joh. 1.14. he is able to fill a World of hearts with Grace.

Thou desire more love, brokenness of heart, sincerity, fruitfulness. Christ
is able to afford thee all of all this.

3. Trust in him for mortification of thy lusts and corruptions. Go over to
Christ for power to subdue your lusts and unruly corruptions. If ever you would
make any happy conquest of lust, by Faith, have recourse to Christ: there you
shall have strength against your unruly affections. Christ is as able to
cleanse, as to clear, to purge, to subdue, and take down the power of sin, as
to take away the guilt of sin.

1. We have his Prayer, to subdue and conquer our lusts, to sanctify our
Natures, John 17.17. -- Sanctify them through thy Truth.

2. We have his Promise. -- I will subdue your iniquities, Micah 7.19. -- Sin
shall no more have dominion over you, Romans 6.14.

3. We have his Power, who is able to subdue all things to himself, Phil.
3.21. He will trample Satan under our feet.

4. We have his office and fidelity to appeal unto; where we may complain of
our own flesh. He undertook it, as a part of his business, to purge and
cleanse his people, Tit. 2.14. He came not only to be a Redeemer, but to be
a Refiner, a Purifier. He gave himself for us, to redeem us from all
iniquity, and to cleanse and purify us, to be his peculiar people, zealous
of good works.

5. We have his Merits, as a Sanctuary to fly to; as to a Laver, as to a
Fountain set open to wash us from all sin, filthiness and uncleanness, Zach.
13.1.

4. Exercise Faith, in case of Difficulties.

1. In case of Temptation. Thou art it may be in many Temptations, Exercise
Trust. Thou know who has conquered Death, Hell; who has overcome
Principalities and Powers, all the Powers of Darkness; who has led captivity
captive; and triumphed over all, on the Cross. Trust therefore in him.

1. For support and strength in the Combat: He has promised, -- My Grace
shall be sufficient, 2 Cor. 12.9. -- God is faithful, who will not suffer you
to be tempted above what you are able: But will, with the Temptation give an
issue, that we may be able to bear it, 1 Cor. 10.13.

2. Trust in him for deliverance out of it, and victory over it. That he
should conquer the strong man; and snatch us as brands out of the fire; and --
tread down Satan under our feet, Romans 16.20. -- Deliver us out of Temptations,
2 Pet. 2.9. -- The Lord kn^ws how to deliver his out of temptations.

5. Exercise Trust in case of Desertions. When God seems to hide himself, or
withdraw himself from our souls; withholding either his quickening, or his
comforting Spirit: yet trust still. -- You that walk in darkness and see no
light: Trust in the Name of the Lord, and rest upon your God, Isa. 50.10. Trust
in God in the darkest night of Desertion; cast anchor there, as the Apostle did.

What though the soul were as dark as Hell? yet God can make it as light as
Heaven. That God that caused light to shine out of darkness, can also shine
into our dark hearts.

What though there be nothing within thee, nothing without thee, nothing round
about thee, to comfort thee? yet there is something above thee. Cast anchor in
Heaven: there is an Almighty God, to stay thy soul upon. The Name of the Lord is
a sufficient prop, and rock to rest upon in any condition. -- The Name of the
Lord is a strong Tower; the Righteous fly to it, and is exalted, Prove. 18.10.
or is in safety

There Is safety in the Tower, when all other sorts and Bulwarks are gone; when
Outworks are taken, and Walls are scaled, there is yet safety in the Tower.

So here: when all Outworks are gone, when all our Evidences seem to be gone,
when nothing appears to comfort us; yet the Name of the Lord is a strong Tower
to fly to, a rock to rest on; whereupon being exalted, we are delivered from
danger, and set out of gunshot. Hence we read the Name of the Lord opposed to
all stays and props, which Faith had to rest on, Isa. 50.10. -- He that walks
in darkness, and has no light, let him trust in the Name of the Lord, and stay
upon his God.

Here is such a bottom for Faith to rest upon, that if Faith should fail, All
God would fail with it: His Mercy, His Truth, His Wisdom, His Power, etc.

Let us then cast anchor here, and wait till the time of refreshment come; wait
till all storms and clouds be blown over -- Light is sown for the Righteous,
and joy for the upright in heart. But we must wait with the Husbandman with
patience, till the crop be thoroughly ripe. Thou must not look for clear day,
so soon as thou have taken shelter: nor a calm so soon as thou have cast
anchor: but there thou must abide, ride at anchor; wait till the time of
Refreshment shall come from the Lord.

Godly security, and apprehension of safety do not ever attend the act of Faith
at the heels. To trust is the act of Faith; and apprehended security is the
fruit of believing; and therefore comes not till afterward.

Here is thy comfort as was said before; if thou die whilst thou lie at
anchor, having anchored on this rock, thou dyest in the ship, not in the Sea;
thou dyest in the Covenant, and there is safety, though the storm never cease.
Thy condition is safe, and secure, though thou do not yet apprehend the safety
and security of it.

Never soul miscarried in a trusting way. There is not one example in the Word;
no not one in the World, where ever man trusted in God, and was ashamed, --
Psalm. 22.4, 5. Our Fathers trusted in thee. They trusted, and were delivered.
God has engaged himself; he has not only set the Sun, and the Moon, and
Stars to pawn; not only Heaven and Earth, but even himself too. He has
engaged his Truth, his Mercy, his Promise, his Wisdom; and Power, to save and
keep them who trust in him.

All Heaven would sink, if that soul that truly leans, and trusts in God should
miscarry.

6. In case of outward Calamity; not only Personal, but National. Other Nations
God has dealt withal, as with Jerusalem, -- He turned them upside down, as a
Dish, and wiped them, 2 King. 21.13. Indeed we have enjoyed Peace and Plenty:
Peace with Plenty, and Plenty with Peace. How many ships deep laden with Mercy
has the stream of the Gospel brought to our shore? But yet our sins may give
us occasion to suspect the water heating for us, Rods are preparing for us,
except we return.

Would you then be safe in the evil day? Trust in the Lord. -- He that trusts
in the Lord, Mercy shall compass him about, Psalm. 32.10. He shall be begirt
with Mercy; Mercy shall embrace him on every side.

As Faith does compass Mercy: so Mercy compasses Faith. As the Believer
embraces Mercy: so Mercy embraces him: He shall be begirt with Mercy. And not
Mercy only, but all Gods attributes are for him.

As whilst a man is an Unbeleever, all God is against him; All the Power of
God, the Wisdom of God, the Justice of God is against him: so if one be a
Believer, all is for him. Faith makes all God ours; his Mercy ours, his Power,
his Justice, etc. As Jehoshaphat said to Ahab. -- I am as thou art, and my
people as thy people, 2 Chronicles. 18.3. So God to a believing soul, all he is, or
has, is for its use.

Faith does initiate us into Covenant with God: And there being a Covenant, All
God is for us.

Well then, Let this exhort us all to be resolute and peremptory in believing,
as Esther. -- If I perish, I perish, in a believing way.

3. Let this exhort us to grow up in Trust, to grow to Perfection.

There is a Perfection 1. Of Nature. 2. Of Degrees.


All Believers have the same Perfection of Faith, for kind: but all have not
the same Perfection of degrees. Well then, You have that Perfection in the
kind: labor for this Perfection of degrees also. Grow up from trust of
Affiance, to the trust of Assurance. Let us not ever be staggering and
doubting: but come to some grounded persuasion of Gods Love; labor to be
rooted and grounded in love; labor to work out all doubts and fears, whereby
we dishonor God, wrong our selves.

1. Weakening our Faith. 2. Hindering our growth. 3. Disabling our selves to
work. 4. Discouraging our selves in our Christian way. 5. Gratifying Satan.
And let us labor to grow up to higher measures in Believing. Many
encouragements might be named.

1. The more thou growest in Faith, the more thou growest in the love and
favor of God; the more thou win'st his Love. There is nothing in the World
does so much win Gods favor, as a great degree of Faith; Abraham was therefore
called the friend of God.

And therefore though thou may be saved with a less degree: yet if thou
would grow more in Gods favor, grow more in Faith.

2. The more Faith the more Grace: the more love of God, the more Hope, the
more Patience, the more Courage, Obedience, Repentance, Humility.

Thou weak Christian, if thou desire more brokenness of heart for sin, more
love to God, etc. Why the way is to strengthen thy Faith.

3. The more Faith, the more spiritual Comfort; the more Peace, Joy and
consolation. These are the fruits of Faith.

4. The more Faith, the more strength to prevail with God in Prayer.

And therefore let this put you on to labor for the increase of Faith. Grow
from Faith to Faith.

In Temporals we are ready to look above us, who is higher, richer, not below
us, who is poorer. But in spirituals we look below us, not above us; behind
us, not before us; how many come short of our measure: not how many do
outstrip us. And therefore we content our selves with that we have. But let
us labor to forget all behind, and to press forward to the mark of the Rich
calling of God in Christ Jesus, as the Apostle did. If thy Faith be true, it
is of a growing Nature.

Now to all this I will add some means.

1. To get Faith. 2. To increase Faith.
1. Means for the begetting of Faith.

1. Labor to keep close to Faith-begetting Ordinances. These are 1. The Word.
2. Prayer.


1. Frequent the powerful and sincere preaching of the word of God; a
Faith-begetting-means. Faith comes by hearing, Romans 10.17. True Faith is the
Daughter of Mercy. For this end God has set up this Ordinance in the Church,
that it might be a means for the begetting Faith in the hearts of unbeleeving
men. And God does often in the opening of Scripture, open our understandings,
that we may believe, Luke 24.45. John 20.31.

And in the hearing of the Word, keep thy Ear open, to hear what God says by
his Spirit in the Gospel. Faith comes not by mercy of the Law, but of the
Gospel.

And in the Gospel, dwell upon Faith-breeding-Promises. Indeed, all the
Promises tend to beget Faith: but especially such, wherein the good Will of
God, and the Heart of God is discovered: such wherein the freeness and richness
of Gods Promises are discovered.

Promises are of two sorts.

1. Either such as are conditional; granted upon the performance of some duty
in us. As such as these. -- Believe, and thou shall be saved. -- Repent; and
thy sins shall be forgiven thee.

2. Or such as are made and performed in mere Mercy; such wherein God promises
to give that condition which he requires to the Promise.

We have not only promises of giving pardon, and remission to the believing
sinner: but we have promises of bestowing Faith upon the unbeleeving sinner.

There are some Promises wherein we are to bring Faith to the Promise. As here
-- whoever believes shall be saved, And

There are some Promises that we must go unto for Faith. Some that we must
bring Faith to; and some that we must go to for Faith: as those free and
absolute Promises -- I will take away your stony hearts, and give you hearts of
flesh.

And such wherein he has said, -- He will work all our works in us, and for
us.

Oh! say some; If I had but so much Repentance; so much brokenness of heart; if
but so much love, then I could believe. Alas! we must not bring our penny to
the Promise. We must believe, and then all the rest will come in. The way to
have a broken heart, is to believe, The way to repent, the way to love God.

2. The second Ordinance is Prayer. Though none of this Faith be in Heaven;
yet all Faith comes from Heaven. -- It is the gift of God. And therefore we
are to seek to him for it.

We may join our selves to Faith-begetting-means; But it is God that must make
the means effectual, for the working of Faith.

It is a grace above the power of man; and therefore requires the power of God
to work it. I say

1. It requires the Power of God. Nay, not only the Power; but

2. It requires the greatness of his Power. Nay

3. The excess of greatness of his Power. Nay

4. The mightiness of that excess. Yea and

5. The working of all this mighty Power. As the Apostle shows, Ephesians. 1.19.
where we have all those five particulars set down.

And therefore there is need of calling in for all the help of God, all the
power of God for the working of it.

It is the hardest thing in the World to cast a man out of himself: to cut a
man off his own stock: to throw a man off his own foundation.

And when that is done, it is as hard a work to bring this man over to Christ:
to make a man to lie full and flat upon the promise of Grace, for mercy.

And therefore how much need is there of stirring up our hearts? How much need
of calling in for the strength of God by prayer?

This is the second. Prayer is a fruit of Faith; and yet prayer is a means for
the begetting of Faith. As the Spirit is a fruit of Prayer; so prayer is a
fruit of the Spirit. As you see, Luke 11.13. compared with Romans 8.15. In the
one place the Spirit is said to be the fruit of Prayer. -- He will give his
Spirit to them that ask him. In the other, Prayer is the fruit of the Spirit.
-- You have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby you cry abba, Father.

3. Have much to do with Faith-begetting-Company; Faith-begetting-conference:
Where thou shall hear the discoveries, how God has wrought Faith in them; and
how God does work Faith in the hearts of unbeleeving men. -- Did not our hearts
burn within us, when he talked with us, by the way? and when he opened to us
the Scriptures? said those two Disciples after their conference with Christ,
traveling in company together to Emmaus, Luke 24.32. The like of Aquilla and
Priscilla with Apollo, Act. 18.26.

4. Dwell much upon, and cherish Faith-begetting-considerations, which are 1.
Thoughts of our selves. 2. Thoughts of God.


Thoughts of our emptiness, and thoughts of Gods fullness. Considerations of our
own misery, and thoughts of his love and mercy. Omnes post te currimus,
audientes, quod nullum spernis peccatorem. Bernard.


Think how God has dealt with you, and how God has dealt with other sinners,
who have come to him. Such were Manasses, Mary, Paul, -- We all run after
thee, O Lord, seeing thou despisest no sinners. Thou despisedst not the weeping
Mary, the begging Canaanite, Et si his peccatoribus veniam d^disti, paratus es
and nobis, si modo impetramur.
the entreating Publican, the confessing Thief, the Adulterous Woman, the
denying Disciple, the persecuting Paul. And if thou refused'st not those, thou will not reject me. If thou pardonedst them, thou will pardon me, if I
believe in thee.

But in particular, cherish these three thoughts.

1. The consideration of thy own vileness, and emptiness; thy sin, and misery
by reason of sin. And this will drive thee out of thy self.

2. The consideration of the fullness, riches, and al-sufficiency of Christ: who
has all fullness in him; who is able to save to the utmost: a bottom able to
hold up any weight of sin.

3. The consideration of the freeness of Christ, and the Promise. God keeps
open house; invites, entreats; beseeches us to believe and come in. -- Ho!
Every one that thirsts, come ye to the Waters, come buy ye that have no
silver, and eat. Come buy Wine and Milk without money, etc. Isa. 55 1. And --
He that comes to me (says Christ, Joh. 6.37.) I will by no means cast out.
-- Let him that will come; whoever has a mind, let him come. Be his sins what
they will be for nature, for number, for continuance: yet come and find
acceptance. -- Who is a God like unto thee! That pardonest iniquity, and
passest by the transgressions of the Remnant of thy heritage! Thou reteinest
not anger for ever; for thou delightest to show mercy, Mic. 7.18.

There are two things when men are humbled, which keep them off from believing,
either, 1. A doubt of Gods Power -- Lord if thou can. 2. A doubt of his Will.
-- Lord, if thou will.


1. Some doubt of his Power. Oh! Is God able to pardon such a sinner as I have
been? Can he pardon so great, so bloody, so crimson sins? If they were but
such, or such, I should not doubt* But being so great: how can God pardon!

2. Others doubt of his Will. They will be ready to say. They know there is a
fullness of Power in God: he is able to forgive my sins; let them be what they
will be: he has a Sea of Mercy, able to drown Mountains as well as
Mole-hills. But alas! I doubt of his Will: whether he will show mercy to such
a sinner.

And therefore, if ever you would believe, you must get an heart convinced of
the 1. Fullness and al-sufficiency of Christ to pardon. 2. And of the freeness
and willingness of Christ to show mercy, to such as do believe.

Dwell upon such considerations as these are, being means to beget Faith. When
men are once convinced of the fullness of God, they will come over to him, if
withal they be fully convinced of their own need.

It is possible for a man to believe this fullness in Christ, and yet not be
able to clear his acceptance. We read of the Lepers, who seeing nothing but
death in their condition, 2 King. 7.3, 4, resolved not to stay there, but to go
over to the Camp of the Assyrians. -- If they save us alive (say they) we
shall live: and if they kill us, we can but dye. And there were many reasons,
which might cause them to expect no better, but death from them.

1. They were Jews, and so their enemies.

2. They might be suspected for Spies.

3. If not: yet they were Lepers, good for no service: such as might infect the
whole Camp. Yet seeing their Misery, in want of bread, and knowing that there
was bread to be had: they resolved to adventure.

So, if there were but a through discovery

1. Of our own Misery, a conviction of that.

2. Of the fullness and all sufficiency of Christ; it were possible so far to
prevail with a man, as to throw himself on Christ; though he be not yet able
to clear, whether God will ever accept him.

But when we take that other consideration in, and do think of the sweetness,
and freeness of Gods love and mercy to accept of poor returning sinners: what
should then hinder, but the soul should come over, and believe in him? And
therefore, if ever thou would have Faith, cherish these thoughts, dwell much
upon such considerations as these.

Men say, they would believe; but in the mean time, they never cherish such
thoughts and considerations as may beget Faith.

If there be any thing in the Word which makes against them; this they will
harbor and cherish: they will feed upon the Wormwood, and the Gall: but if
there be any thing to nourish and cherish Faith, this they will suppress.

They have an ear open to hear what the Law, what sin, what Satan says: but
none to hear what God says in the Promise.

They will promote the Devils cause, his arguments, sharpen his weapons against
themselves: But they will silence the pleadings of Gods Spirit in them.

They will look upon the dark side of the Cloud, not the light side. The
threatenings of the Law, they will apply, and set on with all their might: But
if Promises come they find no acceptance with them.

They will nourish considerations of their sins, their guilt, their misery, by
reason of sin; and aggravate it to the utmost: but the thoughts of Gods Love,
of the freeness of his Mercy, of the promises of pardoning sins, these they
reject.

My Brethren; This is not the way to get Faith. If ever you would believe, you
must study the freeness of Gods Mercy in Christ; his willingness to pardon and
forgive poor sinners, if they come over to him.

2. The second means for the strengthening of Faith are these.

1. Make use of the Ordinances.

1. The Word. 2. The Sacraments. 3. Prayer.
1. The Word. We say: The same way things are begotten, the same way they are
nourished. Corpora naturalia, eodem modo, quo generantur, nutriuntur.
Faith is begotten by the Word: and Faith is nourished by the Word. It is both
the Begetter, and the Nourisher: both the Breeder and the Feeder of Faith, Romans
15.4. 1 John 4.

2. The Sacraments, which were instituted and set up for this end, to increase
your Faith. God knew he had to deal with unbeleeving persons; and therefore
he does not only give the Promise, his Covenant, and Oath, for the
confirmation of us: but to all these he annexed his Seal, the Sacraments:
Mountains upon Mountains, to confirm us.

A man would not desire so much of any honest man, as God has here
condiscended to, for the confirmation of our Faith.

One would have thought his bare word had been enough, considering the Truth,
and sufficiency of the Person, that spoke it.

But he has given his Oath. Nay, but he rested not there: but his Seal too:
The Sacraments. And therefore make use of them.

3. Be much in Prayer; that God would strengthen and increase thy Faith.
Prayer is the fuel of Faith; the food of Faith.

A man may as well live without meat, as Faith without Prayer. As the soul
lives by Faith: so Faith lives by Prayer. Faith helps Prayer, and Prayer helps
Faith again.

As there is a Communion among the Ordinances; every Ordinance does help
another. The Word helps Prayer, and Prayer helps the Word: So there is a
Communion between Ordinances and Graces. Faith helps Prayer, and Prayer helps
Faith. Prayer cannot say of Faith -- I have no need of thee: nor Faith of
Prayer -- What need have I of thee?

As there is a mutual dependence of one Christian on another, a means to
nourish Communion, as Christians help one another; One may say -- Help my Zeal,
and I will increase thy knowledge; strengthen my Faith, and I will inflame or
kindle thy affections: so here, There is a mutual dependence between Faith and
Prayer. Faith says to Prayer, Help me to believe, and I will help thee to
pray: And Prayer to Faith, Help me to pray, and I will help thee to believe.

Such a Communion there is. And therefore be much in prayer for strength.

4. Live much in the Heaven of the Promise. Feed upon the freeness, and
sweetness, and fatness of the Promise. Delight your selves in fatness. Let your
way lie much above; live much out of your selves. This is your way. A man shall
never be able to strengthen Faith, that lives in himself.

5. Walk in the Earth of the Law. As Faith strengthens Obedience: so Obedience
strengthens Faith. As Faith multiplies, so let duty multiply. The way to
nourish the one, is the way to increase the other.

6. Make it your chief riches, to be rich in Faith. And then all your designs
and endeavors will be for the increase of it. The wordly man labors, toils,
sweats here for the World: And what is the reason? but because he makes this
his riches; so it is here.

7. Exercise Faith much. And this is the way to increase it. Men that can
employ a greater measure of Faith, shall have it. Be careful that the
exercises of Faith may be proportionable to the measure of Faith received. It
is the way to get it increased.

God will not have the stock lie dead in our hands. He will not give more than
we can employ. The Talents were according to their several abilities. Some had
two, some one, some five. When God sees a man of great layings out, he lays
in mo^e still.

Exercise Grace. For within the compass of the exercise of Grace, lies that
which will nourish and increase Grace.

8. Treasure up sound Evidences of Faith. The stronger our Evidences, the
stronger our Faith. And therefore store up sound Evidences.

One falsehood among thy Evidences staggers thy Faith.

9. Be thankful for the measure thou already have. Thankfulness is a Grace big
with Mercy.

Men are often injurious to the increase of Faith by unthankfulness, for that
measure they have. We are too much like covetous men, looking after further
degrees so much, as to overlook that which God has already bestowed. Our
complaints would be others contents: others would be glad of them.

Therefore let us get an heart enlarged for the measure we have. It is the way
for God to enlarge his hand, to bestow more upon us.

10. Maintain Humility; an humble spirit. God gives Grace, and he gives
increase of Grace to the humble. Humility is the Nurse of Grace. The empty
heart shall be filled. Nature abhors emptiness, Grace much more.

11. Be much in acquaintance with God. Know more of his mind, more of his
heart. Read him as he has discovered himself in the Word, in his Christ.

12. Gather and lay up Faith-strengthening-Experiences. Keep a Catalogue of
holy Experiences of Gods Love and goodness to thee. All these are fuel to
nourish and strengthen Faith.

And now having done with the Doctrine of Faith, I must conclude with a Doctrine
of works. Wherein I shall desire your practice of it; This upon occasion of a
collection for the Poor.
as soon as I have done the preaching of it.

It is very orderly, that works should follow Faith. Your works of Charity, our
Doctrine of Faith.

The Papists do charge us that we cry down works, and preach nothing but
Faith, Faith; making it Titulum, sine Re.

I hope it will be seen at this time, that preaching Faith Formaliter. I
preach works Eminenter.

And I could not possibly have taken up a better ground for works, than to
preach the Doctrine of Faith first.

Indeed we preach Faith without works in Justificationem, as touching
Justification. But we say, Faith and works must go together in our
conversation.

As Faith does Justify our Persons: so works do justify our Faith. And thus
Abraham was justified by works: his works declared him to be just.

Good works are the breath of Faith; as the word in James signifies. (...).
And as the body without breath is dead: so Faith without works is dead also.

Good works are the fruit of Faith: the Children and Issue of Faith. As Rachel
said, -- Give me Children; else I dye: so Faith. Give me Children: give me
works; else I dye: otherwise I have not a living, but a dead Faith.

So you see, we set up works too; though we cry them down in the matter of
Justification.

Are good works good for nothing; because not good to justify? The Sun is not
good to give light to blind men. Is it therefore good for nothing? Gold is not
good to assuage hunger. Is it therefore of no use?

We say works are necessary, 1. In respect of God. 2. In respect of our
selves. 3. In respect of others.


1. In respect of God.

1. To show our Obedience. 2. To glorify his Name. 3. To testify our
Thankfulness. 4. To beautify his Gospel.
2. In respect of our selves.

1. To make our Calling and Election sure. 2. To declare our Sincerity. 3. To
procure Mercy.
3. In respect of others.

1. To refresh the Bowels of the Saints. 2. For example of Virtue. 3. To stop
the mouths of wicked men, who would else take occasion to blaspheme the
Gospel: and speak evil of Profession. 4. To win others; to gain enemies to
the embracing of the Truth.
And therefore seeing good works are thus necessary: be you stirred up to so
concerning a duty. The Apostle says -- Whiles you have opportunity to do good,
do good to all men. Here is now an opportunity: Take it. God honors thee, if
he give thee an heart to do such a good work. Your Bounty is your Honor.

A TREATISE OF THE Slownesse of Heart TO BELIEVE.

BY SAMVEL BOLTON, D. D. And MASTER of C.C.C.

LONDON: Printed by Robert Ibbitson, for Thomas Parkhurst, and are to be sold
at his Shop over against the Great Conduit in Cheapside, 1656.

A TREATISE OF THE SLOWNESSE OF HEART TO BELIEVE
JOHN 1.50. Jesus answered and said unto him, because I said unto thee, I saw
thee under the Fig Tree, beleevest thou? thou shall see greater things than
these.
IN the latter part of this Chapter we see, that goodness is of a diffusive
and spreading nature. If thou be good, thou will desire and endeavor to make
others good: when Christ has once revealed himself to any soul, it will be
very studious to make him known to others. So verse. 35, 36. you read, that God
having revealed Christ to John, he makes him known to his Disciples, one of
whom was Andrew, verse. 40. he could not con^eal the good news, but makes it
known to his Brother Peter, verse. 41. Afterward Christ reveals himself to
Philip, verse. 43. and upon it Philip makes him known to Nathaniel, verse. 45. so
communicative and diffusive is goodness, like the liquid Elements of Air and
Water, which cannot be kept in their own bounds and limits.

From the forty fifth verse, to the end of this Chapter, there is contained a
discourse 1. Between Philip and Nathaniel. And then 2. Between Christ and
Nathaniel. The first between Philip and Nathaniel, is from the 45. to the 47.
verse, where you have

1. Philips discovery of Christ to him, verse. 45. we have found him of whom
Moses and the Prophets did write.

2. Nathaniels harsh entertainment of it, verse. 46. can any good thing come
out, etc.

3. Philips care to resolve him, and to take away this prejudice, in the latter
part of the 46. verse, come and see.

4. Nathaniels desire to be satisfied: he goes out with him, and that is the
sum of the discourse between Philip and Nathaniel.

The second discourse is between Christ and Nathaniel, from verse. 47. ad finem.
In which you have five things observeable.

1. Christ's profession, or commendation of him, verse. 47. Jesus saw Nathaniel
coming to him, and says of him; Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no
guile.

2. Nathaniels reply, ver. 48. Whence know thou me? which may be construed
two ways.

1. Either by way of question, being convinced that he spoke right, and that
he discovered his heart to him, he demands how it came to pass, that he knew
his spirit so right; as though he had said, it is true, I desire to walk
uprightly and sincerely with God, but how can thou tell that? how is this
discovered to thee? art thou able to judge of the heart? none knows that but
God only.

2. Or the words may be conceived as a blunt and more rude reply; whence
know thou me? you never saw me before, nor I you; and how then can you
give so high a commendation of one you are no more acquainted with?

And I take them in this last sense, because he came with such a prejudice
against Christ, ver. 40.

3. Christ's further and clearer manifestation of himself to him, verse. 48.
Jesus answered, before Philip called thee under the Fig Tree I saw thee; as
though he had said, I there saw enough to discothy sincerity. I saw what there
thou did; or because I saw thee, when thou thoughtest none did, thou may
well think I know thy heart.

4. Nathaniels noble confession or profession of Christ, verse 49. Nathaniel
said Rabbi; thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.

5. We have Christ's commendation of this act of his Faith, v. 50. Jesus
answered, because I said I saw thee under the Fig Tree, beleevest thou? with a
promise of future and fuller revelation, thou shall see greater things than
these.

Here you see that Christ passes by his failings; which were

1. His prejudice against Christ, because of the place; can any good thing, etc.

2. His rude reply to Christ, when he discovered himself to him; whence know
thou me; these Christ passes by, and falls into the commendation of his
present act of Faith.

So gracious a Savior we have, that when we present him with our duties, he
will not remember our infirmities. He says, I will remember your sins no
more, viz. to object them against us, to upbraid, much less to condemn us for
them. He did not object against Manasseh, his witchcrafts and idolatries, nor
against David, his Murder and Adultery, nor against Matthew, that he had been
a Publican, and an Oppressor; nor against Zacheus, that he had been an
Extortioner, nor against Mary Magdalen, that she had been an Adulteress, nor
here against Nathaniel his behavior toward him, when once the soul comes in,
he receives it, and remembers its sins no more, but hides and covers them.

In the Text observe three general parts.

1. An open commendation of Nathaniels Faith, because I said, etc.

2. A silent reprehension of others unbelief. Beleevest thou?

3. A gracious promise of future and fuller Revelation, thou shall see greater,
etc.

In the first consider,

1. The Person commending, Christ.

2. The Person commended, Nathaniel.

3. The thing for what; his readiness to believe.

4. The ground of his Faith, because I said, I saw thee under the Fig Tree,
beleevest thou? as if he had said, does so small a thing induce thee to
believe, I have wrought no miracles, raised no dead, etc. I shall do greater
things in the sight of others, heal the sick, give sight to the blind, cleanse
the Lepers, cast out Devils, raise the dead; and yet many of them will not
believe.

For the promise of fuller Revelation; the words are, thou shall see greater
things than these: which is promised,

Either as a reward of his former Faith, or for the increase of his present
Faith, and in these words he points at what after miracles he would do. Thus
you see the parts of the Text laid open to you; but there is one thing yet
which is necessarily to be unfolded in the Text, before we leave the general
view of it, which is the ground of his believing, which was Christ's saying;
that he saw him under the Fig Tree. The question is

Quest. How so small a thing as this, saying, that he saw him under the
Fig Tree, could be likely to produce so noble a confession and profession of
Christ, or make him to believe?

Ans. We will not now speak of Gods working by it, for so we know nothing is
so small, but by his working in, and by it, may prove admirably efficacious; as
on the contrary, if he work not, no thing, though never so great otherwise,
and seemingly promising, will be able to do any thing, as we see in the Jews,
who although they saw his miracles; such as none but a God could do, yet they
believed not.

We will consider the thing in it self, and so I find these two things in it,
which might draw out such a confession, and make him put forth such an act of
Faith. Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the Fig Tree.

1. It may be he was then taken up with the meditation of the Messiah, who
was to come; for at this time their thoughts were all full of it, Luke 2.25.48.
and so God might now suggest to him, that he would reveal him to him.

2. Or it may be out of evidence and conviction of the omnipresence of Christ;
that he could see him under the Fig Tree. Nathaniel thought that he had been
alone, and no eye had seen him; and therefore when such an evidence was brought
to his spirit, that Christ saw him, yea, not only his person, and outward
actions, but his heart also, he was thereupon convinced of the divinity of
Christ, and so cries out, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, etc.

Quest. 2. But you will say, How did this discover that Christ was the Son of
God, or the divinity of Christ?

Ans. He knew that corporally he was not there, and therefore although his
eyes told him, that Christ was a man, yet in that when absent, he could see
him under the Fig Tree, it did discover and declare him to be God. But

2. I think this speech of Christ, which was the ground of Nathaniels Faith;
had not only relation to his seeing of Nathaniels person, but to some special
piece of service which Nathaniel was then upon. Either meditation, prayer, or
the like, which Christ saw, and his heart in it, as if Christ had said, I saw
not only thy person under the Fig Tree, but also the workings of thy spirit
there; I saw in them the uprightness and sincerity of thy heart, and the goings
out of thy soul, when thou were there alone; which brought such a conviction of
the divinity of Christ with it, that it made him cry out, Rabbi, thou art the
Son of God, thou art the King of Israel; thou who know the heart must needs
be God, etc. as if a man should say to his friend, thou art one that art
charitable, mournest for thy sin, and in case he should answer, but how know
you that? he should reply, did I not see such an act of charity which you did?
did I not see you mourn bitterly for sin at such a time, etc? this in some
resemblance comes somewhat near to this instance, but yet falls short,
because we judge of the outward act, Christ here of the inward, which
manifested him to be God omniscient, the searcher of the heart, etc.

Thus I have showed you the coherence with the parts of the Text, and have in
part unfolded what might seem difficult and obscure in it.

Now there are some Doctrines which lie about the verge of the Text; some from
the person commending, some from the person commended, and some from the thing,
for which. But I shall touch only upon those which arise from the main scope of
the Text; and they are two.

Doct. 1. That the eyes of Christ run through the whole World, and behold the
evil and the good. He that saw Nathaniel under the Fig Tree, sees thee in all
places, in all companies, etc. to this purpose read Psalm. 139. Amos 9.2, 3, 4.
He is totus oculus, all eye, to see, and all hand to feel and find out. He
who is to be Judge of all the actions, and ways of men, must necessarily know
them all.

Use 1. Say not then, that God sees not, say not that darkness shall cover
thee, esto quod nemo, non tamen nullus, though no man, yet some eye sees thee.

Use 2. This may be comfort to the Saints. Christ sees you under the Fig Tree,
sees you in a corner, sees your persons, your actions, your spirits: He sees
your prayers, he sees your tears, he sees your afflictions, your pressures,
Exodus 3.7. He hears your groans, etc.

Use 3. This is terror to wicked men, he sees them too, he sees your malice
against his Saints, your vileness and abominable filthiness. I saw you in such
a place, at such a time, in such and such pollutions, in which thou would
have been loath, in which thou would have been confounded, if men should then
have seen thee.

From the commendation of Nathaniels Faith. Observe, Doct. 2. That such is the
goodness of God, that he commends us for that which is his own.

He commends Nathaniel here for that Grace which he had given him. God works
graces in us, and then commends us for them: he gives us money, and then
commends us for our riches; he makes us beautiful, and then commends us for
our beauty, in which he does only beautify his own beauty, and love his own
graces in us. He does here commend Nathaniels Faith, which yet was only the
Faith of his own powerful working. He commends David for his uprightness,
Hezekiah for his perfectness, Moses for his meekness, Cornelius for his
devotion, the Publican for his compunction, the poor Widow for her liberality,
and the Woman of Canaan for her Faith and importunity; all which was only the
work of his own Grace in them. God will find matter of love and liking in us,
from that which is his own; he can pass by ours, and own his. As a Father
loves his child for that which is of his own nature in him, and so does God in
us.

Use 1. Then see what a sweet Savior we have, who will pass by our
imperfections and deformities, and take notice of his own beauties in us.

Use 2. And accordingly we should learn to look upon our selves, as Christ
does, though black in our selves, yet beautiful in Christ; although I would
have you to own, and to blush at your own defo^mities; yet not so as to blind
your eyes from beholding Christ's excellencies, as in himself, so in you by his
grace, take the shame of your own sins, but let God have the honor of his own
Graces; by this you shall nourish your humility, and yet not weaken your Faith,
you shall abhor your selves, and yet extol Gods free Grace.

But these are but by the way, to which many others might be added. I will
fall upon those which the Text does more fully hold out, and they are these.

1. That slowness of Heart to believe, is a temper of spirit very offensive to
God; this is hinted in the implied tacit reprehension of others, whilst he so
commends Nathaniels forwardness.

2. That God takes it well at our hands, or it is very pleasing unto God, when
we will believe in him upon small Revelation.

3. That God will reveal great things to them, who do so believe in him. Thou
shall see greater things than these, it is a promise of future and fuller
manifestation to be vouchsafed to him.

We shall begin with the first, which is Doct. That slowness of heart to
believe, is a temper of spirit very offensive unto God.

I need not stand long to clear the truth of this Doctrine, if you look into
Joh. 1.50. that high commendation of Nathaniels Faith, is a silent upbraiding
of others for their slowness of heart to believe. Because I said, I saw thee
under the Fig Tree, beleevest thou? It is as if he had said, for that without
question is implied; why I have done greater things in the sight of othe^s. I
have healed the sick, opened the eyes of the blind, raised the dead, cast out
Devils, and yet they have not believed. And does so small a manifestation work
on thee. Because I said, I saw thee under the Fig Tree, etc. I have not raised
thee from the dead: implying he had done it to others. And hence he is said
to upbraid those Cities wherein his mighty works had been done, because they
believed not, Mar. 16.14.

And this was a great aggravation of their sin, where so much had been done to
persuade them to believe, yet slow, etc.

The like in Joh. 12.37, 38. But though he had done so many miracles before
them, yet they believed not on him, that the saying of Esaiah might be
fulfilled, who has believed? here was a great aggravation of their sin.

And upon this ground he reproves his Disciples, Luke 24.25, 26. Oh fools and
slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have spoken, ought not Christ to
have suffered these things, and to have entered into his glory, etc?

And how often does he upon the same ground rebuke his Disciples. O ye of
little Faith! Mar. 9.19. O faithless Generation how long shall I be with you?
how long shall I suffer you? Implying, it put Christ to the utmost of his
patience to bear with them in their unbelief.

Which yet if you read the story, you will find it was no small work; it was
because they could not cast out the dumb spirit out of a man possessed; which
yet he himself tells them afterward, verse. 29. that this was the greatest of
difficulties: this kind came forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting, which
shows the work was of more than ordinary difficulty: yet because their Faith
was posed in it, he tells them they were a faithless Generation, and he was
weary of them, it put him to the utmost exercise of his patience to bear with
them.

And you see the like of Peter, whose Faith was so great, as to carry him upon
the waters; to walk upon the waves, upon a bare command and word of Christ; yet
afterward the wind growing strong, and corruption working, he was afraid,
and begins to sink, and then cried, Lord, save me, Mat. 14.30, 31. And how
much was Christ displeased at him, who had put forth so glorious an act of
Faith, as to walk upon the waters upon a bare command, yet because he held not
out, Christ reproved him, Oh thou of little Faith, wherefore did thou doubt!
was this a little Faith? etc.

But we will pass this, and in the prosecution of this Doctrine, we will show
these eight things.

1. That we are slow of heart to believe.

2. What are the grounds that we are slow of heart to believe?

3. What are the reasons why this slowness of heart is so offensive to God?

For the first, that we are slow of heart to believe.

This will be demonstrated to you, if you consider with me these five
particulars.

1. The greatness of that power which God does put forth, in the working Faith
in an unbeleeving heart.

Faith it self is called the work of Gods power, nay, of his almighty power.
The same power which God put forth in the raising of Christ from the dead, even
the same power he does put forth in the working of Faith in an unbeleeving
heart, Ephesians. 1.19, 20.

There are many mighty works of God, which are not saving works. As the works
of Creation, the works of Providence: These are mighty works, but they are not
saving works.

But there are no saving works of God which are not mighty.

Every work of mercy, is a work of might too, every work of grace, is a work of
power too; though every work of power be not a work of grace, yet every work
of grace, is a work of power; And the work of an almighty power. Actus
omnipotentis. Actus omnipotentioe.

Not only an Almighty God does work, but also according to the Almightiness of
God, when he works Faith and Grace in a graceless heart. There are two names
given to this in Scripture, both which speak the greatness of Gods power in the
working of it.

1. It is called a resurrection from death to life, not of a dead body, but a
dead soul, Psalm. 88.10. will thou show wonders to the dead, shall the dead
arise to praise thee? he speaks not there of a natural death, but of the
condition which he was in, lying for the present slain and dead as it were,
under the apprehensions of God wrath. Shall a soul that now lies dead and slain
with the apprehensions of thy wrath and displeasure, arise by Faith to praise
thee? Will thou show wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise to praise thee?
That is, will thou show the greatness of thy power in working Faith in an
unbeleeving soul; this is no less than a resurrection from the dead, the dead
arise, etc. And therefore this must needs require the greatness of Gods power
to effect it.

It is a great work to recover a sick man, but more to restore a dying man; but
to raise a dead man to life, this is the work of God only. Yet all this is
nothing to the resurrection of a dead soul

To raise our bodies when consumed by fire, when vanished into air, when
corrupted in the water, when turned into dust and rottenness, is not so great a
work, as to raise a dead soul, a soul dead in sin, to work Faith in an
unbeleeving heart.

This is the Almighty work of God.

2. And hence, Secondly, It is called a work of Creation, 2 Cor. 5.17. thus in
Christ.

And you know Creation is the work of God only, it is the production of
something out of nothing. Men may produce something out of something, but to
produce something out of nothing is proper to God alone. There is less
distance between the least dust, and the most glorious Angel in Heaven, than
there is between it and nothing.

We say, and its true, inter ens, and non ens, nulla proportio; there is
infinite distance between something and nothing. Such a distance as none but a
God can bring together. Now this work of Faith and Grace in the heart in an
unregenerate and unbeleeving man, is a new Creation. A Creation of light in a
dark heart, of life in a dead heart, of Faith in an unbeleeving heart, of
Grace, in a graceless heart, which is a work which requires the almightiness of
Gods power for the effecting of it. And that is the first demonstration.

2. If you do consider the complaints of Believers, when they first come to
believe.

What sighs, what tears, what groans, what pains, what struglings, with
unbeleef, with doubts, with fears. Crying out with the man in the Gospel. Lord
I do believe, help my unbeleef. It may be now the doubt of Gods power, of
Christ's al-sufficiency to pardon sin, to forgive so great and heinous
wickedness, and say with him, Lord, if thou can do any thing, help, Mark
9.22. or if not so, yet they doubt of his w^ll, whether God will pardon them,
yea, or no, and say with another in the Gospel, Lord, if thou will, thou can
make me clean. Matthew. 8.2.

Every days experience tells us, how hard a thing it is to cast a man out of
himself, and when that is done, Oh how hard a thing is it to bring that soul
over to Christ, and the promise! Now a thousand objections are raised; the soul
is now as full of scruples, of doubts, as the Sun is full of motes.

Oh what swarms of unbeleeving thoughts! what multitudes of doubts, and
objections, that it is beyond the power of any, but of him alone that can deal
with the heart, either to discover them, or answer them, or if answered; yet
the soul is still unsettled, till God come in. This is plain in cast down and
humbled souls.

3. If you look upon the Rhetoric, God uses to bring a poor humbled and cast
down sinner to believe. Read Isa. 40. beginning. Comfort you, comfort ye my
people, says my God. Speak ye comfortably. Say, your warfare is accomplished,
your iniquities are pardoned, etc. But least any should say, alas, tell not me
of this! no comfort belongs to me; he is buried up in troubles; God does not
regard him: why see how he says in verse. 27. Why say thou Oh Jacob, and
speak Oh Israel, my way is hid from the Lord, and my Judgment is passed
over from my God? Have thou not known, have thou not heard, that the
everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth faints not,
neither is weary? he gives power to the faint, etc.

Do you doubt of his power? why he is the everlasting God, the Lord, the
Creator of the ends of the earth; and he can pardon, etc.

What though thy sins be great, yet he tells thee, he will abundantly
pardon, Isa. 55.7, 8, 9. Let the wicked man forsake his ways, and the
unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will
have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon; the word
is, multiply to pardon, as thou have to sin.

But you will say, how can this be? this is far above the thoughts of a
Creature. Why but says he in the next verse, My thoughts are not as your
thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, says the Lord; for as the Heavens
are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my
thoughts than your thoughts. But alas! there are such and such conditions
required. Why but says he, Ho! every one that thirsts, come, Revel. 22.17.

Do you doubt of his will? Why he tells you: It is not the will of your
heavenly Father, that any of these little ones should perish, Matthew. 18.14. You
think it is, but Christ says it is not; he knows the thoughts he thinks to
thee, they are thoughts of peace, and not of evil, etc. Jer. 29.11.

And how does he say. As I live, I do not delight in the death of him that
dies, turn you, turn you, and live; Oh why will ye dye! Ezekiel. 18.31, 32.

And God would have all men saved by coming to the Knowledge, etc. 1 Timothy 2.4.

Yea but this Covenant is not firm, I may sin away mine own mercy. See what God
says, Isa. 54.10. the Mountains shall depart, and the hills shall be removed,
but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the Covenant of my
Peace be removed, says the Lord that has mercy on thee. It is more firm than
the Covenant of the day and night, Jer. 33.20, 21. can a Woman forget her
sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the Son of her womb? yea
they may forget, yet will not I forget thee; Isa. 49.15.

This with abundance such like Rhetoric God uses to draw a poor humbled
doubting sinner to believe, and why should God use such Rhetoric to persuade
with men, if it were so easy a matter, as men make it to believe?

This shows the difficulty of Faith.

4. If you consider the way that God takes to confirm the Covenant of mercy,
and pardon to Believers.

He gives you his Promise, his Oath, his Seal; heaps Mountains upon Mountains,
and all to confirm it; he lays Heaven and Earth at stake, nay he pawns his
Truth, his very being, and all, to persuade with unbeleeving men to believe.

God needed not to do this in respect of himself, his purpose was as good as
his promise, his Promise as good as his oath, his oath as firm as his seal: he
needed not to do this in respect of himself; as if that his oath would bind
him more than his promise.

But God has done this in respect of us, to strengthen our Faith, that we
might be steadfast in God, when we stagger in our selves, that we might be
strong in God, when weak in our selves. As the Apostle in Heb. 6.16, 17, 18.
That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, etc.
God has thus condescended to all this, to beget Faith in unbeleevers, that if
his promise would not persuade with you, then his oath, if not that, yet his
seal: The great Seal of Heaven.

You could not desire more of the most faithless and dishonest man in the
World, than God has condescended to, who is yet the faithful and unchangeable
God. You have a Promise, will not that do? Vae nobis si nec juranti Deo
tredimus.
you would have an Oath, will not that do? you have a Seal, witness, all.

And what does all this, but plainly demonstrate the greatness of the
difficulty to believe? Frustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pauci^ra.
We say, it is in vain to do that by more, which may be as well done by
less. If Promise would have done it, the Oath added had been in vain, but
shall we think that any thing of this was in vain? that we cannot.

Entia non sunt multiplicanda sine necessitate.
And was all this then required? would no less serve the turn?

Tell me then whether this do not fully enough demonstrate the difficulty of
Faith?

Thou that think Faith so easy, thou that never found the difficulty of it,
may well think thou have no Faith. In this God shows the difficulty of
believing, that his Promise, his Oath, etc. are all engaged to work and confirm
it.

5. If you consider the complaint of the Preacher. You hear Isaiah complaining,
Isa. 53.1. Who has believed our report? or our Doctrine, as the word (...) may
import. And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

And Christ complains of the same, Joh. 12.37, 38. Though he had done so many
miracles before them, yet they believed not on him, that the saying of the
Prophet might be fulfilled. viz. who has believed our report?

And Paul he takes up the same complaint, as you see at large, Romans 10.16, 17,
18, etc.

And we our selves may take up the same complaint. We have spent our strength
in vain, and our labor for naught.

Though we have declared the wonderful things of the Gospel, the freeness,
vastness, greatness of the love of Christ, the preciousness of Promises, yet
men believe not. Oh that I could not complain of those, etc! how many offers of
Christ have you had? how many tenders of mercy?

How often has Christ unbowel'd himself to your souls in the Promise! how
often has God invited, entreated, beseeched, called, Hoe every one that
thirsts come!

But yet senseless people do not thirst, and thirsty people do not come, etc.
Oh! here is enough to demonstrate that we are slow of heart to believe.

2. We come to the second. What are the grounds, etc.

And we will reduce them to these three general heads.

1. There are some grounds from Satan.

2. Some from our selves.

3. Some which are taken from others, which do foreslow the heart from
believing in the Promise.

You must know, I speak of men awakened, and convinced of their miserable
condition, not such as go on with a high hand in their sins. I speak of men
humbled.

1. Then the reasons or grounds why we are so slow, etc. From Satan, are the
delusions and false suggestions of Satan.

You must know there are two main stratagems which hold up Satan's Kingdom in
the World.

1. Is to keep presumptuous sinners from being humbled.

2. The other is to keep humbled sinners from believing.

The first of these is by keeping of presumptuous sinners from being humbled;
which he does these ways.

1. Either by persuading them they are no sins they live in, and here he tells
the Prodigal he is but liberal, the drunkard he is but sociable, the
covetous person he is but frugal, the proud person, he is but comely, and
handsome, etc. we say, nullam vitium sine patrocinio.

Saul's Covetousness in sparing the best of the flock; it was his devotion, 'twas
his zeal to Sacrifice; the Pharisees Covetousness had an act of devotion to
patronize or set it off with. So Jezabel paints her face, to make it seem
comely.

2. Or else if he cannot persuade them to that, that they are no sins, but
conscience is enlightened and quickened, and checks him for them, he cannot
stand against his own light, nor under his own reproofs.

Then he persuades them they are but venial, and small sins, or if great, yet
pardonable, nay, and that at any time, as the Thief upon the Cross, what? says
he, God is merciful, and if but at the last thou can say, God be merciful
to me, Lord have mercy upon me, why then all is well, there is no doubt of
mercy.

And because men are better versed in the Service Book, than in the Scripture,
perhaps he will cite a Text out there.

At what time soever a sinner, etc.

This is the first stratagem, to keep presumptuous sinners from being humbled.
And if he prevail not then, but that notwithstanding all these good words, a
soul is convinced of sin, and humbled for it; then he has a second.

2. A second Stratagem, and that is to keep humbled sinners from believing; and
that he does these ways.

1. He labors to have them despair of a pardon, and that upon one of these
two grounds.

1. He will now tell you, either that your sins are greater than can be
pardoned. As Cain, Genesis 4.13.

So it is in the Original, my sins are greater than can be pardoned.

He will so aggravate men's sins, and heighten men's trespasses, and so lessen
and streighten Gods mercy, that he will endeavor to persuade their sins are
above a pardon, they are greater than Gods mercy to pardon; and that is the
first way which he deals with ignorant consciences in trouble.

2. Or if he cannot persuade in that, then he has another way to bring men
to despair, and that is from the will of God.

Why will he say, though thy sins are not greater than God can pardon, yet
they are greater than God will pardon: he will never be merciful to such a
wretch as thou have been; do thou think God will ever show mercy to such a
vile sinner as thou have been? what, one who has sinned against such a light,
such means, such mercies, and committed so horrible sins, and continued in
them. And thus he aggravates sin.

As before he lessened sin all he could to keep men from being humbled; so
now he aggravates sin, all he can, to keep men from believing. As before he
enlarged Gods mercy above the bounds of the Law, now he inlargeth Gods Justice
above the bounds of the Gospel.

Before he presented to you, Gods mercy in a false glass, to make you presume.
And now he presents Gods Justice to you in a false glass, to make you despair.

And indeed of the two, he is better able to set out Gods Justice, than his
Mercy, because he feels the one, and knows what it is, but he shall never
taste of the other; he can therefore better present Gods Justice as it is,
than Gods Mercy as it is.

2. Or if he cannot bring men to despair upon these grounds, yet another
stratagem he has to keep men from believing.

3. And that is thirdly, by telling them they are not disposed and fitted for
mercy, you are not broken for sin, you do not love God, etc.

And in this stratagem he labors to hinder us, by telling us we want such
dispositions, as follow believing, more than such as go before Faith; yet he
oftentimes uses the other, and tells men, they are not humbled enough, not
broken enough; before they were humbled, then any thing would serve the turn to
dispose and fit them for Mercy; and now they are humbled, he tells them, they
are never humbled enough.

Before, a sigh in a good mood was enough to qualify them for Mercy, and the
Promise. Now sighs, groans, tears, daily breakings under the burden of sin is
all nothing, all is too little.

Indeed he fain would have thee to lie in Hell, and stay there, or if he does
not object against thy soul the want of humiliation. Why then he will tell
thee, thou wants Faith; if thou had Faith, then thou might go over to the
promise, but thou wants Faith; and what does he mean by that, why that is,
thou wants assurance; he would put men to assurance, before they do believe;
he would put them to the evidence, Christ is their Savior, before he suffer
them to rest upon Christ as a Savior. Or if not this; yet he will tell thee,
thou want such and such dispositions before thou can believe; he would fain
have men either to bring something of their own to the Promise, or he would
have men to expect these things before they go to the Promise, when indeed
these things follow upon the souls closing with the Promise.

Thus does Satan keep many poor souls in a hoodwinkt condition, and hinders
them from going over to Christ and the Promise.

And that is the first.

2. The second ground why men are so slow to believe, and that is taken from
themselves.

1. It does arise from their ignorance, they know not the tenor of the
Covenant, the terms of Mercy. Men brought out of a sinful condition, once
awakened to see their sins, can think of nothing but working themselves to
life, licking themselves whole, therefore they fall upon prayers, duties (as I
have sometimes told you) as so many bribes for a pardon, as so many pennies
laid out for the purchase of Mercy.

We run naturally to the Covenant of works, but we must be drawn before we
can go to the Covenant of Grace. No man can come except, etc. Joh. 6.44. A
convinced man runs to the Covenant of works, but he must be a converted man,
that goes truly to the Covenant of Grace.

2. It does arise from our pride often, that we will not take Mercy gratis,
we will not deny our selves, and close with Mercy as God tenders it.

You have a strange phrase in Rom, 10.3. they would not submit to the
Righteousness of Faith; here are proud hearts indeed, that it should be matter
of submission for a condemned man to take a pardon, a wounded man to take a
plaster, a sick man a cordial, a naked man clothing, a lost sinner a
Savior. One would think this is strange, that it should be a matter of
submission to accept of the Righteousness of Christ to be saved.

But we like well of the Spiders motto, mihi solo debeo; I owe all to my self,
and would be content to climb to Heaven by a thread of our own spinning.

God is willing to give, and we would deserve, he would have all of Grace,
and we would have all of debt. We would fain bring our penny to the Promise;
yea when we are nothing, we would bring our own nothingness. So hard it is to
make a soul empty, and when that is done to bring that empty soul over to the
Promise.

3. A third ground from our selves, which makes men humbled so slow to believe.
It may be too much tenderness, they are afraid of abusing Gods Justice in
their closes with his Mercy; Oh say they! I am afraid of presuming of Mercy.
It was their fault before to presume the fear of it, their fault now. I say to
presume of Mercy was their fault before, and the fear of presuming is their
fault now.

One would think this to carry a fair forehead, they dare not believe say they,
and why so? because they are afraid to presume; is not this a good pretense?

But ah! here is the Prince of darkness, like the Angel of light; let us
examine it, thou say thou dare not believe, because thou art afraid to
presume. And why do thou fear to presume?

It is presumption to believe Mercy, and yet continue in a way of sin; and it
is presumption to expect Mercy in a way of unbelief, but it is no presumption
to believe. Why do thou fear thou shall presume? thou can not say, thou
takes that which does not belong to thee, for it belongs to whoever can take
it: But it may be thou say thou art not fitted for Mercy, thou art then fit
for Mercy, when thou art made willing to close with Mercy in the terms of
Mercy, that is to take Mercy, as to render up thy self to duty, as to give up
thy self to obey.

But thou say thou shall presume, for thou art not worthy of Mercy.

And would thou be worthy of Mercy? do thou know what thou say?
would thou deserve Mercy? where then were Grace? This overthrows the
Covenant of Grace? it cannot be a Covenant of Grace, if there should be any
thing of thy bringing, which is not of Gods bestowing.

May we not say to thee truly what Eliab, David's Brother falsely said to him,
when he told him he came out for Gods Glory. He tells him no, it was the
pride of his heart, 1 Samuel 17.28. So thou pretends Gods Glory, thou say
because thou would not wrong Gods Justice, and make Gods Mercy a sinful
mercy, therefore thou do not believe; but take heed it be not the pride of
thy heart.

If the time would permit, I would put something to thee. 1. By way of
Question. 2. By way of Supposal.

1. That which I should have put to thee by way of question should have been.
1. Could thou not have believed God would be merciful unto thee, if thou
were not so sinful? 2. If thou were more humble, if thou had more Grace,
could thou not be content to penance thy self for a time, for thy former
sin; were not this good, and what were this but to make thy humiliation a step
to Mercy, to a pardon?

2. That which I would put by way of supposal. Suppose thou had been a
Traitor, and thy Prince should offer thee a pardon for all thy treason, upon
condition of acceptance, and rendering up thy self to him for service. And thou
should refuse a pardon because thou art a Rebel or Traitor, or because thou
doubt'st of the truth and reality of thy Princes tender? or else because thou
think thou art not able to do him service for future, therefore wilt not
accept of a pardon for present; what should we think of this? Or suppose a
Creditor should tell thee, if thou would but bring thy books, come to him,
and reckon with him, and acknowledge thy debt, he would pardon thy debt. And
the debtor should now refuse to come.

1. Either because he is not able to pay. 2. Or because he thinks he shall
be able to discharge all himself in time. 3. Or else because he doubts of the
truth of his intention, in stead of bringing him to reckon that he might
pardon him; he intends to arrest him, and cast him into prison. Is not here a
great deal of pride, and unbeleef, and wronging of love?

And how shall we interpret this standing off? is not the case alike. God
tenders mercy to thee, as a Prince, a pardon, and thou refusest, why? either
thou beleevest not the truth of this, that God offers pardon upon believing, or
else thou thinks to deserve thine own pardon.

So God offers thee an acquittance, if thou will bring thy book, and come and
reckon with him, confess sin, acknowledge Mercy; but thou come not, and what
is the reason? either thou beleevest not the truth of this; this is too good
news to be true; thou think it is but to take advantage against thee.

You think when you go to God in confession, you go as a debtor into the hands
of a hard Creditor, who does but wait to arrest him. You cannot believe the
truth of this offer, or else you think you shall be able to pay your own debt
in time.

4. Another ground from our selves, why we are so slow to believe; is, that
we doubt of Gods will, we doubt whether God will have mercy on us, yea or no.

It is with us as with a Prince or Creditor, as before: were we but well
settled in the Major of the Gospel, in these truths.

1. That God sent his Son for this end, into the World to save poor sinners.

2. That Christ was able to save to the utmost.

3. And that Christ was as willing as he is powerful; we should not be so
slow of heart to believe.

My Brethren, what can God do more to persuade you of his willingness? nay
more, what could Christ do more than is done?

Will you go by his revealed will? and that you shall be judged by at the last
day, why there you see nothing but willingness of God and Christ to accept of
them who come.

If you should go by the revealed will of man, you may be deceived, they may
speak one thing and intend another.

But if you go by the revealed will of God, you cannot miscarry, because Gods
heart is really the same that his word is, he speaks not a syllable more than
he will make good.

Men speak often more than their hearts, or they may speak contrary to their
hearts, but God does not, he really intends what he speaks

And his revealed will tells thee, that he would have thee saved by coming,
etc. that if thou will believe, thou shall be saved. That if thou confess,
etc. therefore no cause to doubt of Gods will.

5. A fifth ground of our slowness to believe. It may be you find some rest
to your souls on this side Christ.

It may be you have been troubled for sin, have been in anguish of conscience,
and you have prayed, you have mourned, and thereupon have gotten some peace,
and quiet in your souls, and you seek no further.

This is to lick your selves whole.

And how often, how ordinarily does these things stand between us and Christ,
between us and the Promise; if we found no peace nor satisfaction in these,
then we should go over to Christ, but finding this on this side Christ,
therefore are we slow of heart to believe.

Now to take away this, you must know that that peace which is not settled upon
the heart by a promise, by believing; that peace will never do you good, a true
trouble were better.

It is not works, but Christ, not praying, but believing, not the Law, but the
Gospel; Christ the Promise, that brings true peace into the soul.

Indeed the other may give a man some ease for the time, but this will never
work a sound and substantial peace.

You read in the Wilderness there was no plaster for the stung Israelite, but
looking up to the brazen Serpent.

So there is no remedy for a stung sinner, of which the former was a type, both
in the malady, and in the remedy, but looking up unto Christ, believing in him.

And you see how Christ does parallel them in Joh. 3.14, 15. As Moses lift up
the Serpent in the Wilderness, etc.

If the stung Israelite had made a confection of the best herbs in the
Wilderness; a plaster of all the sovereign ingredients in the World, and
applied with it Mountains of Prayers, Seas of tears; yet this would not have
helped him, if with all he had not looked upon the brazen Serpent.

God had set up that way, and nothing else should do the cure. So let the stung
sinner make what plaster he will of duty, of prayers, for the salving of
conscience, the healing of the wound, yet if he do not look up, believe never,
healed never.

I grant it (to prevent an objection) that these duties may do something for
the stay of a man's spirit, and the quieting of conscience for a time, because
being such things as God has commanded, and in Gods way, they may have some
influence into a man's conscience, for the quieting and stilling of it for
present.

But these are all too short to bring a sound and substantial peace into the
soul; it is not working, but believing, not duty, but Christ that must do that.

If God had intended this for thy cure, if these had been sufficient, what need
had he to have sent Christ into the World? what need had Christ to have dyed
and shed his blood? God might have given man ability to have performed duty,
and all had then been done.

But the sending of Christ into the World, and the shedding of his blood, shows
it was a greater work to redeem souls.

Indeed these things are subservient to the plaster, to the cure; but these
things are not the plaster, not the cure.

By Prayer we seek and beg for a plaster in a wounded condition; and by
Prayer we praise God when the plaster has been applied, but this is not the
cure, this is not the plaster, God never intended that.

So by hearing we have discovered to us where the plaster is to be had, and
by hearing afterward, we do but discover our willingness to know more of Gods
will, that we might obey him, but this is not the plaster.

So by works and obedience before healing, we do but carry our selves in such
a deportment and demeanure, as they should do, who wait for such a mercy from
God; and by works and obedience afterward we do but declare our thankfulness
to God when the cure is wrought, but this is not the cure, being justified we
work, we do not work that we may be justified.

And therefore though you should get some obvious refreshment by the
performance of duties in the pursuit of Christ, yet let not this slacken, but
quicken you in your way; be thankful for it, quickened by it, and still
remember to arise, this is not your rest.

He who rests on this side Christ, will rest on this side Heaven. All your
duties will be but ropes of sand, like chains of glass, too brickle to draw
your souls to Heaven. Though natural conscience may get some satisfaction from
these springs, the performance of duties, yet these are too shallow to satisfy
the thirst of a gracious heart.

They are neither full, nor are they pure, nor are they permanent and lasting
springs. As I might show you; not full, because wrought out of our selves, not
pure, because mingled with our imperfections, muddy springs; our justifying
righteousness is perfect, but our sanctifying righteousness is imperfect, nor
are they constant. Drought will come, the time will come, when these will be
too short to reach comfort into thy soul, that if God lead thee not to a
spring, at last thou art undone.

The Brook Cherith did supply Elijah for a time, but at last it dried up, and
could afford him no Water, and had not God brought him then unto a spring he
had perished.

So there are many, who lie a long time by the springs of duty, the streams of
performances, and they get some refreshment there which keep them off from
going to Christ; but the time will come that these waters will fail, and if
then thou have not a fountain, a Christ to go to, thou will perish for all this.

Where on the contrary, here in the greatest drought thou shall find waters
enough, Jer. 17.7, 8. Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, and whose
hope the Lord is, for he shall be as a tree planted by waters, and shall not
see when drought comes; his leaf shall be green, and he shall not be
careful in the years of drought.

Years of drought he shall never see, never be sensible when heat comes;
his leaf shall be green. And thus much for the second ground, why we are so
slow of heart to believe.

3. Ground why we are so slow of heart to believe, is taken from others, 1.
Their heights. 2. Their depths.


1. We look upon the heights of others. We see others of the Saint^ eminent in
Grace, shining with holiness, adorned with gifts and gracious indowments, they
can pray, they can command their passions. And then reflecting upon our selves,
and seeing our own imperfections; our frowardness of spirit, our untowardness
of heart, our weakness, and deadness, we are thereupon discouraged, and kept
off from the Promise of life, etc.

I told you the last day, that we look upon the best of others, and the worst
of our selves; upon the best, not the worst of others. You look upon their
inlargements, not their straits; their graces, not their corruptions; their
heights, not their depths; their comforts, not their troubles; their victories,
not their foils.

This is the difference between you and wicked men, they look upon the worst of
the Saints, and by that draw encouragements to sin, or if not, yet make use of
their imperfections to countenance their deadness, but you look upon the best
of others; and because you fall short of that eminency in them, you are
thereupon d^^couraged and wounded in your comforts.

But admit that others of the Saints were as excellent as thou see them, as
thou apprehends them, and grant it that thou were weak and full of many
imperfections. Yet why should this keep thee off from Christ and the Promise.
It is strange that that which should draw thee to the promise, should drive
thee from the Promi^e; will a man refuse physic, because he is sick; a
cordial, because he is faint; meat, because he is hungry; money, because he
is poor; clothing, because naked; you would think this to be unreasonable,
and why not the other?

Assure your selves that is not a good sight of imperfection, that shall either
blind, or bleer the eye of Faith, and hinder us from beholding Christ and the
Promise, or that shall discourage, and deter us from going over to Christ and
the Promise.

Thou would be as others of the Saints before thou did belee^e; thou must
believe before thou can be as others are, that which put a difference between
thee and him was Faith; there is the same treasury, and the same fullness in
Christ for thee, as for others, if thou get Faith to make use of it.

Besides, why should imperfections keep thee off? What man will reject a
present pardon because he sees himself unable to do the Prince future service?
who will not take it, and be more thankful, and the more admire the Princes
clemency that should accept of him after all his rebellions, when yet he could
have no eye or respect to any future service of advantage he could do the
Prince. And why then should we reject Gods pardon, because we see not our
selves able to do him future service. You should take it and be more
thankful, more admire the riches and freeness of Gods Grace, who justifies the
ungodly.

Ce^t^inly that which gives you the advantage, and puts you into the way of the
admiration of God, serves the end most which God aims at in giving of pardon;
therefore he pardons that you might admire and say, Micah 7.8. Who is a God
like unto thee, pardoning iniquity? but the more sin, the more imperfections,
the more advantage you have to admire the riches and freeness of Gods Grace and
Mercy; therefore why should this discourage you?

Besides, though Princes may pardon former treason, yet they cannot change the
traitorous heart, nor can they enable them, for the future to be loyal and
obedient. But now God can, with the pardon of sin, he can and does change the
heart of the sinner, he sends him away with another heart, with the
forgiveness of former disobedience, he gives strength and ability to obey for
future; and therefore why should either present sense of sin and imperfection,
or the apprehension of the want of future ability, keep us off from closing
with Christ and the Promise; seeing by this the sin is pardoned, the nature is
healed, and the soul enabled to future service.

Indeed the way to do him service is to come in, etc.

2. As we look upon others heights, so we look upon others depths, and by
that keep off from the Promise.

It may be, we see and hear of others of the Saints who have been exercised
with great troubles, terrors, legal breakings, etc. and have been in sad
conditions, it may be, for many months, nay years, and thou reflectest upon
thy self, and see thou was never thus humbled, thou never had experience of
such legal breakings, either none at all, or not in that measure which others
have had; and thereupon thou concludest certainly the Promise does not belong
to me.

And this is another ground which prevails with many, etc.

Now to take off this in a few words.

1. Why should another humiliation be a pattern for thee? when it may be
that which enlarged his troubles were,

1. Some outward cross and affliction which was joined to his inward trouble;
as when the fountains from below, and windows from above were opened, there was
a great flood, a deluge.

So when afflictions from beneath, and troubles from above concur, this is a
deluge of sorrow.

2. Or may be that which enlarged another man's trouble, was some horrible
temptations, injections of Satan, blasphemous bloody thoughts, etc.

3. Or may be some bodily distemper, the predominancy of some humor, as
melancholy, which gives edge and entertainment to terrors, and spiritual
troubles.

4. Or may be his ignorance, in the Covenant of Grace, the terms of Mercy.

5. Or may be the long concealing of his trouble; as you see David, Psalm. 32.

6. Or may be giving credit to the lying suggestions of Satan.

7. Or may be his pride, his unbelief, jealousy, frowardness of spirit, as it
is with such as will nourish themselves in a needless bondage, and will not
hearken after comfort, making their chains heavier than God has made them; who
will not suffer a thought of hope or comfort to enter through the anguish of
their bondage. Like the Children of Israel in Egypt, Exodus 6.9. God sent them
delivery, but they looked not after it, through the extremity of their
bondage. And is there any reason then, that others humiliation should be a
pattern to thee. Thou might as well desire part of their cross, which yet
thou would not do, for a great part of many men's humiliations, is either
their sin, or their cross, etc.

2. Why should other men's humiliations be a pattern for thee; when yet God
does not require the same measure, nor is the same measure alike necessary to
all, neither in respect of God, or of men?

1. Not in respect of man: some need not so much as others.

As some men's flesh is harder to heal than others, so some men's hearts. A
Needle may do that to one, which a lance will not do to another. A frown to
one, which blows will not do to another.

Some men are of crabbed and untoward spirits, and knotty blocks had need of
hard wedges.

2. Some men have longer scores, greater reckonings, have been greater sinners
than others, and though not ever, yet ordinarily God does proportion the sorrow
to the sin.

3. Some men of greater parts, of greater places, who are not so easily
humbled, many things may be in the subject, which may vary the case.

And as the same measure is not necessary in respect of man, so the same is not
necessary in respect of God, his ends are various.

1. Some men he intends to bestow greater measure of grace upon, than upon
others, and he lays a proportionable foundation.

2. Some he intends to use as one of a thousand, to comfort others; therefore
he does exercise them with difficulties, with humiliations, eclipses of his
favor, with temptations, injections of Satan, decays, relapses, that they may
be experimentally able to settle and comfort others 2 Cor. 1.4.

3. Some he intends for great services, great employments, to make them
Champions in his cause. And therefore he does humble them the more at their
bringing in. As you see Paul, Luther, Augustine. All Gods people are Soldiers,
but few are Champions, some he has for lighter skirmishes, and less
humimiliation will serve their turn to prepare them for them.

But such as he intends for the main battle, to be Champions in his cause,
he does usually exercise with greater difficulties, that so they might not
start aside in the day of trial.

4. Some he intends to be patterns and examples of mortification in the
world, and therefore carries them on with troubles of spirit, and lets them lie
longer in them, that being raised up, they may be dead to the World ever after.

Thus you see the like measures are not necessary, neither inrespect of Gods
ends, nor in respect of your selves; and why then should any man's humiliation
be a pattern for thee?

All that can be said in it is this, that so much is required, as to cast us
out of our selves, make us weary of our sins, willing to sell all; cut off
right hands, pull out right eyes, to part with the dearest and beloved sins for
Christ.

We all agree, it is sufficient when it does cast a man out of himself, and
bring him over to Christ; and how much that is who can set down?

A less degree will do that in one, which it will not in another; if the same
measures were alike necessary for all, then it would follow,

1. That every one is so to labor to come to that measure, as to receive no
comfort in the Promise till he have attained it.

2. And it would follow, that what comfort any may have gotten in the Promise,
they are to yield up, if they have not had the like measures that others have
attained to; and what perplexities, fears, doubts, would so be left in the
consciences of men, so that they would never find a bottom to stand on.

As in Grace, a man would never have comfort, if his comfort were to arise from
the measures, and not from the truth. So in humiliation, many poor souls in
taking others for a pattern, have lost the rule, and put themselves into a
greater in capacity to close with the Promise, at a greater distance from
Christ than they were before; and have made themselves miserable for the
present, and for the future, and so have gone drooping even to their graves.
And it had been better for many speakers and hearers too; if this Doctrine had
been pressed more before. How many have had their heads broken in pieces with
it, and it is easier for these troubles to break the head, than to break the
heart.

But thus much for the second.

Thus you see we have finished the two generals. That we are slow of heart to
believe.

What are the grounds that men are slow of heart to believe?

3. We come to the next, what are the reasons that this temper of spirit is so
offensive unto God? I have given you many reasons in my Sabbath days discourse
on the third of John. Why God was so severe against unbeleef.

All which would serve as so many demonstrations of this point, we will at
this time add but these three more.

Reas. 1. Slowness of heart to believe, is a temper very offensive to God,
because it argues and speaks a corrupt heart.

A heart biased with other respects which hinders from closing with Christ. As
Christ says, Joh. 5.44. How can you believe when you seek honor; when you are
biased with such respects as these?

Such a spirit, either it argues ignorance, or pride, or love of sin, or
jealousy of the truth of God, the goodness of God, and this is very offensive;
jealousy is the rage of a man, etc. which is more provoking, because God has
so far condescended to our weakness for our establishment, that he has not
only given us his Promise, his Covenant, his Oath and Seal; and all to comfort
us. And if notwithstanding all this, we shall nourish a spirit of jealousy,
and cherish our doubts and distrusts; this must needs be very displeasing unto
God. Vae nobis si nec juranti Deo credimus. Aug. If a man should give you his
Promise, and yet to satisfy you to his Promise, he should annex his Oath, and
to his Oath his Seal, etc. If yet notwithstanding you will be jealous and
distrust him, how would this make a man's blood to rise? how would he break
forth into rage? what, will you not believe me? do you think me to be a
Devil? do you think I will be perjured? etc.

And how much more must this provoke God, who is immutably true of his word.
One syllable being a better bottom for a soul to rest upon, than all the
Protestations of men and Angels; men though true, Angels though true, yet they
are not in themselves immutably true, because they are but Creatures, but now
God is, he is truth it self; no shadow of change in him.

Nay, and not only true, but able to make good his Word, what he has
promised. Men may be true, and yet want ability to perform, but what God has
said; he will do, because he is faithful, and he is able to do, because
almighty.

And has God condescended to us so far, as not only to give us his Promise,
his Oath, Covenant and Seal; and are we yet slow of heart to believe? do we
yet nourish jealousies and distrusts? Why then judge if this must not needs be
a high provocation of God.

And that is the first reason, because this sin speaks corruption of heart.

Reas. 2. Because such a spirit what in it lies, makes void and null the great
things of God, I say as much as in thee lies, for thou can not do it. As the
Apostle says, God is faithful whether men believe, or believe not: so God is
merciful, powerful, wise, gracious, true, whether men will believe, or
believe not.

But this I say, as much as in thee lies, thou make void all the great and
stupendous things of God, we will name these seven.

1. Thou make void the great councels of God, all the thoughts of his wisdom
in contriving such a way, to advance his glory in the salvation of men. God had
purposed and contrived from everlasting to make himself glorious, to set up and
advance the glory of his wisdom and grace, and this is the way his wisdom
pitched upon from everlasting, to do all this by sending of Christ into the
World, and thou by standing out, do not only frustrate Gods ends in thy
salvation, but as much as in thee lies, nullest and make void all the
thoughts and contrivings of his wisdom; for all this is to no purpose, while
thou stands out and wilt not believe.

2. Thou make void all the thoughts of his Mercy, in which he desired to set
forth himself, and make himself visible to the lost sons of men, by sending of
Christ into the World.

But now if thou will not believe, to what purpose were all these great things
of God, to what purpose was all this glorious fabric of Gods mercy and
council, which was the greatest thing that ever came upon his heart? Gods
masterpiece, which went to the height of his skill and wisdom, to the height
of his mercy and love. Beyond which there is a non ultra in Gods thoughts,
there was no further or more, God could go no higher than himself, all was
infinite; but thou in standing off do annul, and make void all the thoughts
of his mercy, and his love, if others should do the like, to what purpose then
were all? it would make all this void, and to no purpose: thou do it as much
as in thee lie. If a man should make a curious piece that should publish his
skill, his greatness, wisdom, and a man come and break it all in pieces, would
he not be greatly offended? And what a fearful thing is it, to make void
that wherein God set himself, to make himself glorious? to obscure that in
which God set himself, to make himself visible in? but thou, who art slow of
heart to believe (as far as it lies in thee) do this, and therefore what a
provocation of God must this be?

3. Thou do as much as in thee lies, make void all the purposes of Gods mercy
to thee. The great end which God aimed at in this great work of sending Christ
into the World, was that thou might believe in him, and live. Now if thou
stand out, and will not come in, will not close with him, thou do what lies
in thee, to make void all the purposes of God to thee for good. I say, what
lies in thee, for thou shall never do it; the election shall bring thee in;
Gods purpose shall bring thee to his Promise. Our sins may alter Gods
conditional purposes of temporal mercies; as he tells them, 1 Samuel 2.30. I
said indeed, that thy house, and the house of thy Fathers should walk before
me for ever, but now says the Lord, be it far from me, for they that honor
me, I will honor, etc. But thou shall never be able to make void Gods
eternal purposes of good to thee; but yet take heed of tempting God, provoking
God; God may make thy body smart for it, though he save thy soul at last; make
thee know better, not try conclusions. But I say, what lies in thee thou do
disanul all the purposes of God to thee for good, which is a fearful thing.

4. Thou do what lies in thee, frustrate the expectation of God. You know it
is a great affliction to a man to have his expectation frustrated, and the
greater the good which was expected, the greater the cut and wound to be
disappointed and frustrated. Why I say (may I speak after the manner of men)
thou do what lies in thee, to frustrate all the expectations of God. Why,
what were Gods expectations? but that thou should receive his Son, if he
sent him; that thou should embrace Christ, believe in him. And this seems to
be sweetly insinuated in the parable, Mat. 21.37. Mark. 12.6. Surely they will
reverence my Son, though they had abused the Prophets, etc. yet surely they
will reverence my Son; they owe so much homage to me, or they will look upon
him so great a person, the Son of God; Surely they will reverence my Son. But
however his Person and Parentage should not procure reverence, yet the service
he came about will be a grateful service; he comes to be Savior, he comes to
redeem them from Hell. Certainly he will be a welcome guest to them; Oh how
willing will they be to receive him? how glad to entertain him? with what open
arms will they embrace him? how ready to obey him? Surely they will reverence
my Son. And in reason who would not have thought so? what welcome might not the
King of glory expect, the Prince expect, who came upon such a business? What
might not a Prince expect, who came to loosen the captives, to redeem vassals,
to relieve distressed, break chains? Sure in all reason he should have been
received with all joy, with all acclamations and willing embraces: This God
expected. But now when in stead of receiving, we reject Christ, slight Christ,
undervalue Christ, when we will not close with him, etc. how does this cross
the expectation, and frustrate it.

5. We do what lies in us to make void Gods end in sending Christ. What was the
end which God aimed at in this plot, in contriving such a way, in sending
Christ into the World? this was his end, that we might believe and live, his
glory, in our salvation. Surely the end must needs be glorious, when the means
and work was so glorious; if the foundation of this work were so glorious, what
will the whole structure be? Now this was one part of Gods end in sending of
Christ, that thou should receive Christ, believe in him. And so long as thou
stand out, thou crossest Gods end, frustrates the end of God. And this must
needs be a great provocation of God. If a man did take a great deal of pains in
a work; spent all his time and endeavors for some end, and at last be crossed
in the end; the work is nothing to him. This provokes, etc. Why thou do
frustrate Gods end?

6. Thou do as much as in thee lies, make void the death of Christ, thou
make all his sufferings, and all his blood shed to be to no purpose. What was
the end that Christ shed his blood? what was the end Christ dyed? why it was no
other but this, that we might believe in him, and have a pardon? etc. But now
so long as thou stand out, thou frustratest all this; if all were like thee,
I pray thee, to what purpose were the death of Christ, the expense and shedding
of his blood? And therefore this provokes much; if one of us should suffer much
for the obtaining of such an end, if after he had endured, to be disappointed
of it, this much provokes us.

7. Thou do as much as in thee lies, make void all the Promises of God to
Christ.

God promised and entered into Covenant with Christ; that if he would lay down
his life and blood, he would make him King over Saints; he would give the
Heathen for his inheritance, etc. Isa. 53. He shall see of the travel of his
soul and be satisfied. God promised Christ, that if he would lay down his
life for a people, he should have them; he would give a people to him. And
thy standing out does what lies in thee, to make this Promise void, to make God
a liar to his Son, etc. Thou shall not be able. Christ shall have a people,
God will yet set his King, etc. yet if all were like thee, where were Christ's
people?

Nay, and thou robbest Christ of the reward and fruit of all his death and
sufferings, this was the reward Christ was to have for his death, etc.

If a man had sweat, or shed his blood for such a thing, you would not be so
injurious to him, as to hinder him of the fruit of it, every one would be
ready to cry out, of such an act of injustice.

Why, thou art Christ's reward, he shed his blood, laid down his life for this
end, for this purpose. And by thy standing out, thou do what is in thee to
rob Christ of this his reward, the fruit of his death, and therefore what a
provocation is it?

Reas. 3. Because this temper keeps a man in an unserviceable condition, both
to God and man. And this must needs be very offensive to God.

It was one great end, that God sent Christ into the World for, that we might
be able to do him service; it was the end of our Creation, and of our
redemption too, that being redeemed out of the hands of our enemies we should
serve him, Luke 1.74, 75.

Though our service was not the impulsive cause of Gods redeeming us, though it
was not the motive, which did persuade and prevail with God to send Christ into
the World, to redeem us, yet this was an end, one main end which God aimed at
in sending Christ into the World, that we might be able to serve him without
fear, etc.

Christ did not discharge us from the debt of sin, to free us from the debt of
service; but therefore did he pay the one, that we might be able to return
the other. As the Apostle, Romans 8.12. where having showed that we are
justified, and our sins pardoned, he concludes, therefore Brethren, we are
debtors not to the flesh, etc. Christ has broken the bands of subjection to
others, that we might take upon us the yoke of service to him.

Christ freed us from the curse of the Law, that we might yield obedience to
the Commands of the Law; from the penalties, that we might obey the Precepts;
from the Law, as a Covenant, that we might walk in obedience to the Law as a
Rule. Plane dicimus decessisse legem quod onera, etc. That as the Law was given
with Evangelical purposes, so it might now be kept of us with Evangelical
principles.

So that this was one main end that God aimed at in our redemption, that we
might be able to do him service.

Now therefore that which crosses this great end which God aimed at, and keeps
us in an unserviceable condition to God, must needs be very offensive to God,

But that unbeleeving does. It makes you utterly unserviceable to God.

There is a twofold unbeleef. 1. Reigning. 2. Remaining unbeleef.

For the first, where Un^e^ie^ reigns, that man is altogether dead, and no more
able to do a piece of service to God, than a dead man to perform actions of
life. As Christ says, Joh. 15.5. without me ye can do nothing.

And for the second remaining Unbelief; so far as Unbelief remain^, so far it
^cts, so far as it prevails, so far are you wounded, disabled ^or ser^ice.
Though there be not a total and universal impotency, as ^n the former, yet
there is a partial disabil^ty, and this is more or less, according to the
workings and prevailings of Unbeleef in you.

It is said of Abraham, Heb. 11.8. That by Faith Abraham obeyed God. And it was
a high act of obedience.

It is Faith which does enable us to obey, and quicken us in obedience.

1. It begets Soul-inabling-Principles, such Principles as are suitable to the
command, and thing commanded.

2. Faith supplies a man with Soul-inabling-strength from Christ.

We have not only inherent, but assistant strength, not only operative, but
cooperative, etc. from Christ, and Faith furnishes us with it.

3. Faith does furnish a man with Soul-inabling-considerations, 1. From God. 2.
From the work. 3. From the rewards, etc.

2. It inables the soul to suffer.

1. It puts the soul into a suffering frame.

2. It does furnish the soul with suffering resolutions; Faith cloatheth the
soul with strong resolutions; as in the three Children, Dan. 3.

3. Faith begets suffering graces. Courage, magnanimity, patience, humility,
self-denial, contempt of the World, high prizings of Christ

4. Faith lays in suffering strength, strength from God, from the Promise, etc.

5. It propounds to the soul suffering rewards, for these light afflictions
which are but for a moment, work, etc. 2 Cor. 4.17. All which I might insist
large upon, to show you how Faith does enable the soul, etc. So Unbeleef it
keeps the soul in an unserviceable condition. He that does not yield obedience
to the promise in a way of believing, cannot yield subjection to the Precept in
a way of obeying; men of a bad belief, can never be men of a good life.

Hence we read, that Faith and Obedience, and Unbeleef, and Disobedience are
expressed by the same name, Romans 15.31. which shows how near they are together.
If you be once believers, you will then be obedient, and while you continue
in Unbeleef, you must needs be disobedient.

It is observeable, that God gave the Law four hundred and thirty yea^s after
the P^omi^e, as the Apostle says, Gal. 3.17. which shows, that Faith in the
Promise must be the spring of all our obedience to the Precept.

When God gave the Law, see what a preface there is to obedience; I am the Lord
thy God. As if he had said, here is that which must enable you to obedience.

After Adams fall, God does not then give him any new commands, he puts him
not to work again, but now to believe; he gave the Promise then, and not the
Law, to show that now he must have a new Principle of working, before he
could work, he must now believe, that he might be able to do. Many men think
they can do God better service by doubting, than by believing; by standing off,
than by coming in.

But alas! Satan deludes thee, if he get between thee and the Promise, if he
keep thee off from Christ, he will either dishearten thee from obedience, or
he will discourage and disable thee in thy obedience. Faith is the spring of
action, the rise of all obedience, without Christ we can do nothing, and
without Faith, we must needs be without Christ; for Faith gives the soul
union and communion with him, it implants us into Christ, and then, and not
till then, we bring forth fruit.

It is said of Abraham, Heb. 11.8. That by Faith Abraham obeyed God,; and you
know, it was a high act of Obedience, the sacrificing of his Son, and so is the
sacrificing of our sins. It is Faith alone that does enable the soul to do, to
suffer.

We now come to the Application, wherein I shall be brief, because most of it
I shall refer to the second Doctrine.

Use 1. If so, then see how Satan does delude their souls, whom he persuades
not to believe is a virtue, is a thing pleasing unto God.

Are there not many? who as Jonah said, he did well to be angry. So they say,
they do well not to believe, they do well to stand out, etc.

You shall hear some make it a matter of conscience not to believe; they ought
not to believe; should such sinful creatures, such vile wretches so polluted?
etc.

Should they believe, this were to presume, to sin against Gods Justice in the
closes with his Mercy, this were to give holy things to dogs, etc. Satan
presents sin.

And some there are so witty, as to object against all that can be brought; as
if they took a pride to argue themselves into a condition of misery, setting
the pride of their own carnal reasonings, against the riches and freeness of
the mercy of God; if you bring a promise to them, when cast down for sin, and
endeavor to fasten a promise on them, they can tell you, that this is not the
meaning of the Promise, or certainly this Promise does not belong to me.

Alas will they say! all this is but lost labor; you might as well ca^^y a
cordial to a dead man, as bring a Promise to them; it is a ^^u^tless thing, if
upon examination we shall discover some spots o^ a Child in them, some
undoubted evidences of one whom God ^peaks mercy unto. Yet they will tell you
all these are false, all ^^^se are in Hypocrisy. Its true, if these things were
in truth (...), I could then conceive some hopes of mercy, but I know ^^ey are
all in Hypocrisy; they are all unsound and counterfeit, etc. Ergo no Mercy.

Thus does many a poor soul take pains to reason himself into misery, and side
with Satan, and take part with the corruptions, and unbeleevings of his own
heart against himself.

And what will be the end of it? sure it will breed bitterness in the latter
end; for the present, it is thy sin, and for the future, it will be thy
misery; either it will cause God to withdraw himself from thee, as he tells
them, Deuteronomy. 32.20. Or cause thee to withdraw thy self from God. As the Apostle
speaks, Heb. 3.12. Take heed least there be in you an evil heart of Unbeleef
in departing from the living God. He that withdraws himself from the Promise,
cannot long keep close to the Precept; he that keeps at a distance from Mercy,
will not long walk in the ways of duty.

When the workings of natural conscience are done; when fears are allayed, when
troubles are blown over, then will all service be done too; if not, yet the
continuance of troubles, and fears, will make you cast of all, and say, there
is no hope; or will discourage your hearts in your walking, that your life will
be little better than a martyrdom, with continual racks and troubles. It was
before thy sin not to believe, but now it will be thy misery, before thou
would not, now thou can not. Thou soughtest arguments before to keep thee
off from the Promise, and thou will now seek as many arguments, against such
arguments which might bring thee over to the Promise. And this miserable
unbeleef, is the fruit of sinful unbeleef. This disability to come to the
Promise, is the punishment of thy former slowness to come to the Promise. And
this temper you shall see in many, who have reasoned themselves down, do find
it now a harder work to reason themselves up again.

Who have put themselves into a greater incapacity to close with the Promise by
those ways which they have thought to be helpful to them. It is easier to
give entertainment to carnal reasonings, to the suggestions of Satan, and the
objections of our own fleshy hearts, than to get rid of them again.

Many have given willing entertainment to these at first, who would more gladly
be rid of them afterward if they could.

But the continuance of them is a fruit of your entertainment of them.

If you will entertain doubts and fears, and set up your own carn^l reasonings
against the Promise, then you shall have doubts, and fea^s, and ca^n^l
reasonings when you would not, to keep you from the Promise. As God said in
another case, Hos. 8.11. Because you have made many Altars to sin, th^r^fore
Altars shall be unto you to sin. So here, because you have set up your carnal
reasonings, and your unbeleeving thoughts against the Promise, to hinder you
from closing with the Promise; therefore carnal reasonings, etc. shall be a
hinderance, etc.

Thus is miserable Unbeleef, a fruit of sinful Unbeleef; which the more
miserable, the less sinful; the more seen, the more sorrowed for; the more
lamented and mourned for, the less sinful; while it was your sin it was not
seen, it was not sorrowed for, and now it is, etc. and the more misery, the
less your sin in Gods account. Carnal reasonings were before your pride, now
your grief; you sought them before, you would be rid of them now; they were
your delight before, now they are your trouble, your misery, which is something.

But they had not now continued to be your misery, if they had not before been
entertained as your sin, etc. This is the fruit of slowness of heart to believe.

Use 2. Is of Exhortation. If so then, three things, 1. Be convinced of the
greatness of the sin. 2. Be humbled for it. 3. Be quickened to believe.

1. Be ye convinced of the greatness of the sin, it is a sin whereby you
wrong God, gratify Satan, wrong your own souls.

1. You wrong God in it, you obscure his glory, you limit his power, you
contemn his wisdom, you give a lie to his truth, you abuse his love, you
slight and reject all the precious, and peerlesse thoughts of his Mercy and
Grace.

I told you not long since, that God was more severe against Unbeleef than any
sin, because Unbeleef was most severe to God. No sin was more cruel to God, God
has no greater enemy in the World than Unbeleef. It is an enemy to whatever is
most dear and precious unto God. Therefore is he such an enemy to Unbeleef; if
any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him, Heb. 10.38.

2. You gratify Satan. I believe thou would not willingly (if thou knew it)
gratify Satan for a World.

I tell thee in thy standing off, thou do not only gratify him, but thou
can do Satan no greater a pleasure, no greater a courtesy in the World.

In this Satan has all his desire of thee, that which he desires is to make
void all the great things of God, that which he desires, is to make the death
of Christ in vain; to make the blood of Christ to be shed in vain, to make the
great counsel of God, the great things of his wisdom and mercy to no purpose
in the World; And by this standing off thou do what lies in thee to answer
his desire, and therefore this must needs glad him.

Besides Satan knows full well, if he do not wound thy Faith, thy Faith will
wound him, break the head of the Serpent; and therefore it is that which he
labors after in all his temptations, if he cannot keep thee from believing,
yet to wound and weaken thy Faith, that thou may not wound him.

If he cannot make thee his friend, yet if he can weaken his adversary. If
he cannot take away thy weapon, yet if he can weaken thy arm, or blunt thy
weapon, he is content.

If he cannot destroy thy Faith, yet if he can weaken thy Faith, if not hurt
thy Faith, yet if he can keep thy Faith from hurting him, by weakening of it:
for every act of Faith wounds Satan, binds him in chains, etc.

And therefore if he can prevail to keep thee from believing, or if he can
weaken and wound thy Faith, he is well contented, this gratifieth him.

What can gratify him more, than to make a Pageant of all the great things of
God, than to make all these great things like a dream?

What can gratify him more, than to keep thy soul at a distance from Christ
and the Promise; what can pleasure him more, than to make a soul look upon God,
as a God of terror and wrath?

What more, than to keep the soul upon racks, upon fears, discouragements and
disquiets; this is some of his own spirit of darkness.

Nay, what can gratify him more, than to keep a soul in a dead unserviceable
condition, make a man unfit to live, unfit to dye, unfit for any service to God
and man?

Why, all this does Satan do, if he can but prevail to keep thy soul from
Christ, at distance from the Promise, as I could show you at large, etc. The
way Satan does it, is by setting out sin. Though I would be willing to see
sin, yet I am not willing to see sin in the Devils glass; I am not willing to
see sin, when Satan discovers sin.

Satan has two glasses, wherein he discovers sin.

1. He has a lessening or extenuating glass, wherein he discovers sin to
wicked men, which makes them appear less than they are; great sins, small sins,
infirmities; and lesser sins to be no sins.

2. And Satan has a multiplying or magnifying glass, wherein he discovers sin
to them, when cast down, and extends it, not only above the greatness of sin,
but of mercy also.

As I would have my eyes broad and open, to see sin when God discovers it. So I
would shut mine eyes when Satan discovers sin.

Quest. But how shall I know when God and when Satan discovers sin?

1. When God discovers sin, he keeps up the apprehensions of mercy above the
greatness of sin.

But when Satan discovers sin, he heightens sin above the riches of mercy. As
you see in Cain, (...) my sin is greater than can be pardoned,

2. When God discovers sin, he does not bleere, but rather clear the eye of
Faith to the beholding of Christ, he makes the soul fitter to see Christ; does
not hinder, but helps the soul in sight of Christ.

But when Satan discovers sin, he does ever bleer and blind the eye of Faith,
from the beholding of Mercy; either he discovers the malady, and conceals the
remedy, or he holds the eye of Faith, that it cannot look upon Christ for
mercy.

He puts the soul into a present incapacity to look up to God for mercy; he
stings, but holds not up the brazen Serpent.

3. When God discovers sin, it is to drive us out of our selves, and to draw us
unto Christ and the Promise, makes the Law a Schoolmaster, etc. Gal. 3.24. but
Satan's discoveries of sin, sets us further off from Christ.

4. When God discovers sin, it is to make the soul more in love with Christ, to
prize Christ more, to advance him more, to love him, and desire him more. It is
such a discovery that makes the soul to run to the remedy.

But when Satan discovers sin, it is to make us more afraid of Christ, to fly
from Christ as Adam, never the more to desire him.

5. When God discovers sin, he humbles the soul under the sight of it, he
makes a man to abhor himself, makes sin hateful to him.

But when Satan discovers sin, it is to discourage us, not to humble us: he
may make sin fearful, but never makes it hateful.

Besides, as you may know by the manner and the end of the discovery, whether
Gods or no.

So by the time and temper we are in.

Satan discovers sin, when he has gotten the soul at an advantage; he comes
upon us as Simeon upon the Shechemites when they were sore, Genesis 34. when he
has gotten the hill and the wind on us; when we are in some sad condition,
when in temptation, when in darkness, when in some distresses, when we are
drawn from our succors.

It is a passage of one, that Satan, when he discovers sin, and so he opens
our wound; he gets us into the wilderness, into the cold, from our friends,
succors, etc. But when the Spirit of God opens our wounds, it is by the
fire, friends about us, cordials near us, etc.

But I think the difference is rather to be taken from the manner of the
discovery, than from the end and effects of it.

Well then, that is a sinful looking on sin,

1. Which heightened sin above the riches of mercy.

2. Which bleereth and blinds the eye of Faith from beholding Christ and the
Promise.

3. Which sets the soul at a farther distance from Christ.

4. Which makes the soul afraid of Christ.

5. Which discourageth the soul under sight of it. And he that thus looks upon
sin in Satan's glass, no marvel if he be slow to believe; and to come over to
the Promise.

7. When Satan discovers sin, he rather makes a malady, than discovers a
malady, never discovers one wound, but makes another; never discovers a
sin, but takes a course that that discovery shall be sinful.

3. Thirdly, as you wrong God, and gratify Satan, so you injure your own souls.

1. You rob your selves of comfort, and keep your selves in unnecessary racks
and troubles, and bondage. And this is a great evil. Nature cannot subsist
without comfort; comfort is to the soul, what the soul is to the body; a man
cannot live without it; and it puts grace to it too; though for a time Grace
may live, and act strongly in the want of comfort; yet when troubles continue,
and a man walks long without comfort, it will put Grace to it, to the utmost to
subsist.

Oh what abundance of comfort, what floods of consolation, what peace, what
joy, do thou rob thy self of in thy standing off!

2. You hinder your souls of Grace. Quantum credimus, tantum amamus.
Grace keeps a proportion with Faith. So much Faith, so much Grace, etc. keep
down Faith, and all Grace is kept down; and where Faith stirs, all the wheels
move, its the spring of motion, the Master-wheel. Faith is the stomach which
receives all for the nourishment of the whole. As all the members depend upon
the stomach, so all the Graces upon Faith. It is a Mediator to our Mediator;
it fetches in provision to the soul, all depends upon it. If Grace be weak,
Faith goes over to Christ, etc. for the supply of strength.

3. You make your selves every way unserviceable to God; as I showed you; you
make your selves unable to do, unable to suffer for him. You make your selves
good for nothing, unserviceable to God, to the Church, to his cause, to your
selves too, etc. Many there are that think they can do God better service in
standing off, than in coming in, by Fear, than by Faith.

They think that in nourishing their doubts, and their fears, they do cherish
their care, watchfulness, humility.

And on the contrary, they think, that if once they should come to believe,
then they should be more loose and careless, and take more liberty to
themselves. Indeed, you would have more liberty to service, not to sin. You
would not be tied to service with coards of fear, but with bands of love, your
principle of service, and your manner of service would be changed, where now
you serve nim out of fear; then out of love, now out of convictions of
conscience, then out of propensions of a divine nature; now you serve him as
slaves involuntarily, then as sons with willingness and delight, etc.

Now you do duty as a task, then as your trade. And you will walk in the ways
of duty, though you see no commings in.

As a man that loves his trade, that loves his calling, he will hold it up,
and follow it, though he get nothing by it, though no gain or coming in by
it. So the soul which has a Principle bred in him suitable to the things of
God, which is wrought by Faith, he will hold up to pray and to do duty, though
he find not commings in; there is a natural agreeableness between him and
duty, between his spirit and the work, and though he never get good by it, yet
he will hold up his spirit to the doing of it.

As it is with a man, whose nature is sensualized, that has sinned away the
very common Principles, plucked up the very senses of nature, he will drink,
and be drunk, though he undo himself by it, though he hurt his body,
impoverish his estate, yet he will drink, etc. As Solomon says, a Whore will
bring a man to a morsel of bread, will undo a man, yet he will go on in sin,
he will not leave his sin, though undone by it; he will sin, not only though
he get nothing, but though he get hurt, though he undo himself thereby, yet
he will go on in sin, and the reason is, that universal sutableness that is
between his soul and sin.

So on the other side, a godly man he will serve God, he will hold on in
duty, in obedience, though he find no coming in by it.

There is such a sutableness between the spirit of a believer, and the work,
that though there is no commings in, though he find no peace, no comfort in
the ways of God, yet he will hold up to the work.

Where now an unbeleever, if he do not by these things get peace which is all
he looks after in the doing of it, if he do not get comfort, at last he
throws off all, because there was no Principle of sutableness to hold him to
the duty.

Therefore you see how Satan deludes you. Faith alone is the spring of action,
that which sets us a work, and quicken us in working; if Faith be up, all his
Graces will be so too, and if that be down, all other Graces are weak, and
down with it.

As Parisiensis says, it is the virtue of a Crystal, when the virtues of
other precious stones are extinct, to raise them, and revive them again. So
does Faith with our Graces; when David's heart was down in Psalm. 43.5. you see
he recovers himself by his Faith, no sooner did he exercise his Faith, but
his heart is raised.

That which quickens you to service, and inables you in service, is Faith,
and that which deads your spirit, and makes you unserviceable, is unbeleef, and
therefore be convinced of your sin.

2. Be humbled for it; this is the great sin, the womb of sin, the Mother and
Nurse of sin, as I have showed.

That which holds up Satan's Kingdom in you, is your unbeleef; if this fort
were once taken, all the rest would quickly yield up.

You see when Christ would conquer covetousness, he labors to conquer
unbeleeving, as you see, Mat. 6.25. to the end.

That being overcome, all the rest yield up, and are vanquished. Nay it is a sin
which does not only uphold particular sins, but the state of sin. It is called
a state of unbeleef, we do not say, a state of drunkenness, a state of
swearing, etc. but a state of unbeleef; others are but particular, this an
universal sin. And is there not then cause to be humbled for it? you see what
a sin it is, how you wrong God, how you gratify Satan, how you injure your
selves; and is there not cause then to be humbled for it?

Men are hard to be humbled for this sin, because hard to be convinced either
that they are guilty of it, or that it is a sin.

Profane and wicked men, worldly men, they will not be convinced that they do
not believe. Though there be nothing more plain, if the Devil did not delude
them, for Faith and sin cannot stand together; you can no more separate
Holiness and Faith, than Light and the Sun.

And humbled men they are hard to be convinced that it is a sin.

Though it is easy to convince them that they do not believe, they are sensible
enough of that, yet it is hard to persuade them that it is a sin, not to
believe, that it is their duty to believe; they think they do well in keeping
off from the Promise; they express their tenderness of Gods justice and
holiness, and judge it a great wrong to both, that God should be merciful to
such sinners as they. But I must tell thee, it is a greater sin than all thy
sins; a killing, a murdering, an undoing sin. It is a finishing sin that seals
thee up in a state of sin; and therefore you had need to be convinced of it,
and humbled for it.

3. Be ye quickened to believe.

What shall I do now to persuade with you, who are slow of heart to believe, to
come in and believe? Alas! all that I can say is nothing, if God do not
mightily work upon your hearts, and persuade with you.

Shall I tell you there is an inexhaustible fullness of mercy in God, and merit
in Christ for the greatest sinner among you; and this is something. Shall I say
that God is willing to forgive the greatest sinner of you, if you will now come
in and believe?

If you will go by Gods revealed will, and thou have no other rule to go by,
nor to be judged by, there God tells thee that he keeps open house, he
invites, he excites, he entreats, he beseeches to come; these were something
to persuade with our hearts. But I shall pass them. I will only name these two
to persuade.

1. Consider, God commands thee to believe.

2. Consider, thou can do God no greater pleasure than to come in and believe.

1. Consider, God commands thee to believe, 1 John 3.23. This is his
Commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ.

And what can thy heart now reason against this? will not this be enough to
answer all thy fears and scruples? to beat down all that thy unbeleeving heart
can say against the Promise.

Why God does not only invite thee, but he commands thee to believe.

Gods command is a sufficient warrant to believe, and will be sufficient
security to all them that do believe.

1. I say it is a sufficient warrant to believe. Men may command things, and
tell us that our obedience to them shall be sufficient warrant to us, and yet
they may want power enough to secure us in our obedience to them, but it is not
so with God, his command will be a warrant sufficient to carry out any soul in
his obedience to him. Does Satan say, wherefore do thou believe? thou art a
Reprobate, thou art a cast away, thou have no right to the Promise; but thou
must say then, thou art a Creature, and God commands thee to believe, and in
obedience to Gods command, though thou sees nothing but death for the present,
yet thou will believe.

Does be say, thou have no right to a Promise, not any title to Mercy: yet
may thou say, thou art bound to the Precept; though I cannot clear my right
to the Promise, yet I am sure I am to obey the Precept; I am bound to the
obedience of the command, and God commands me to believe.

Yea, and thou may say thus much, if I am bound to believe (as I am) then I may
be able by my believing to clear my interest in the Promise.

Thou may tell him here is a command for thee, none then for him, he is out
of hope. It is an infinite mercy to stand under the command of believing, the
Devils do not, the damned do not, thou do, which is infinite mercy.

2. As Gods command is a sufficient warrant to believe, so it is sufficient
security if we do believe; there was never a soul that perished in a way of
obedience, in a way of believing.

Does Satan say, thou may venture thy soul if thou will? but thou do but
cast away thy soul, for thou shall never be saved, God will never own thee.

Thou may say again, Gods command is a sufficient warrant for thee to
believe; men may fail us and be men, but God cannot fail us and be God.

But put it to the worst, though thou do not know whether thou shall be saved,
yet this thou know, that God commands thee to believe.

Well then, be peremptory, and resolve in believing; say, if I dye, I will dye
in a way of believing, in a way of obedience to the command, not in a way of
disobedience to it.

This I know, if I believe not, I must perish, he that believes not is
condemned, but if I do believe, if I do go on in a way of obedience, who knows
whether God will be merciful? nay, who knows not but that he will? I must
tell you, this resolution will put the Devil to it, he knows not what to say
to such a man; nay and it puts God to it too, for God cannot reject him, who
will yet go on to serve him, though he should never own him.

2. Consider, you can do God no greater pleasure than to come in and believe.
Thou honor all-God, as I shall show thee in the second Doctrine.

It is a great deal of ease and pleasure for a full and pained breast to be
sucked; the breast of Mercy and Promise is full, yea and in pain too, and thou
shall do God (let me speak after the manner of men) the greatest pleasure thou
can do, to come and suck, Joh. 6.28. when the people asked, what shall we
do, that we may work the works of God? Mark then how Christ answers; why this
is the work of God, that you believe in him. As if he had said, would you do
that which would content God? would you do that which pleases him? why this is
that which does wonderfully content God, this is that does admirably please
God, to believe. I tell thee by this thou make God amends for all the wrong
thou have done him all thy life. Nothing else will; if thou should go about
to redeem every oath with an age of precizeness and exactness; every idle word
and action with an eternity of praises and tears; all thy exactions and
injustice with a treasury of alms; all this were nothing to the making of God
amends. But here do but come over to the Promise, do but close with Christ, and
thou make God amends for all, God will be fully satisfied, not with thy
Faith, but with Christ, not with thy believing, but with Christ, whom thy Faith
holds up. Nay, not only satisfied, but ipse tibi velim and debtor. I would not
only be satisfied, but I would be thy debtor, to give thee eternal life. Oh
then that you who are slow of heart to believe, that you would now come in.
Close with Christ, and then thou may set Christ against all that the Law,
Justice, Sin, Hell, Satan can say against thee. You see the Apostle did so; who
is he that condemns? it is Christ that dyed: He makes a challenge of all;
sets the death of Christ against whatever can be brought; so may thou. Let
us weild this weapon, etc.

1. Does Satan say thou have sinned?

Why, but may the soul say, I have closed with him who has suffered for sin,
what can my debt of sin be, that the payment of his sufferings has not fully
answered.

2. Does he say thou have sinned against the great God of Heaven? yea, but
thou may say, I have an interest in him, whose Righteousness is the
Righteousness of the great God of Heaven. Jehovah our Righteousness, and that
is able to suffice for that.

3. Does he say the glory of the great God is debased by thy sinning? Why, but
thou may say, will not the emptying of his glory, who is the brightness of
his Fathers glory, answer for that?

4. Does he say thou have sinned against knowledge? Why but thou may say,
all that Christ did, and all he suffered, he did with knowledge, Joh. 18.4.
Jesus knowing all things, etc.

5. Does he say thou have sinned with delight? Why, but thou may say,
Christ has suffered with greater delight, than I have sinned. He delighted to
do the will of God, and this was the will of his Father, that he should give
his life for me, Joh. 6. Luke 12.50. And it was said of him, that he was
straightened till the hour came, as men that delight in a work which they long to
be upon.

6. Does he say thy sins lie in thy spirit? Yea, but thou may say, the
chiefest part of his suffering did lie in his spirit; his soul was heavy to
death, Mat. 26.38. when he sweat drops of blood, etc. Luke 22.44.

7. Does he say thou art still full of corruptions? Why, but thou may say,
Christ is full of holiness, and by him, though I be black, yet I am comely. As
I look not to be justified by mine own inherent righteousness, so I shall not
be condemned for this remaining corruption, so long as it is not reigning, so
long as seen and sorrowed for. Though I desire to be acceptable to him in
holiness, yet I do not desire that my holiness should be the ground of my
acceptance.

Thus may a soul which has closed with Christ be able to weild this, to set
Christ against whatever Justice, Law, Sin, Satan brings. Oh! then let us be
stirred up, you that are slow of heart to believe to come over; thou see thou
can do him no greater pleasure. Thou think thou do well in doubting, but
thou do exceedingly offend God; thou can not do him a greater discourtesy,
etc.

Object. But does God command every one to believe pardon?

Ans. God commands every one to do the act of Faith, but not to believe a
pardon till he have done that.

If any shall get hold of the horns of the Altar, and yet rest in sin, God will
deal with him as Joab, etc. 1 King. 2.28, 29. etc.

God commands thee not to believe a pardon, so long as thou purposest to go on
in sin, but yet he always commands thee to believe him, so as to give up thy
self to Christ, etc. that thereby thou may have pardon, and assurance, and
salvation.

A TREATISE OF HYPOCRISY.
ISAIAH 58.2. Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a
Nation, that did Righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God.
They ask of me the Ordinances of Justice; they delight in approaching to God.


A TEXT, which I may tremble to read, and you to hear. Well may we ask that
question, -- Lord, who is it then that shall be saved?

Is it possible to do thus much, and yet miss of Heaven? Lord, who is it then,
that shall be saved?

The whole World may be divided into four ranks of men.

1. Some, that are in the Church visible, but not of the Church invisible. 2.
Some, that are of the Church, but not in the Church. 3. Some, that are both in
the Church, and of the Church. 4. Some, neither in, nor of the Church.
Some, that have both right to, and possession of this great privilege.

Some, that have possession, but not right.

Some, that have right, but not possession.

Some, neither possession, nor right.

But yet to come nearer. Those that are within the pale of the Church, and so
within the bounds of Gods call, we may rank into these three orders of men.

1. Some, who are Atheistical and profane. Such as will do nothing for Heaven:
as Gallio. -- They care for none of these things, Act. 18.17.

2. Some, who are Hypocritical and unsound. That will do something, but as good
as nothing.

3. Some, who are sincere and upright. Who will come up to Gods price, and walk
thoroughly in all the ways of God.

But we shall yet draw them into a narrower compass, viz.

Those, who are pretenders to Heaven. Of which there are but two sorts of
people in the World. For we will cast out the Atheist, the Worldling, the
profane Person, the Drunkard, the Swearer. These are men, upon whose forehead
you may read, They are going to Hell. There are then but two sorts, which are
pretenders for Heaven.

1. The first is, the Formal Christian. 2. The second is, the Upright and
Sincere.
1. The first, He will do something for Heaven: he will bid much for Heaven:
he will walk in the round of duty: he looks to the matter, but neglects the
manner.

2. The second, he will come up to the price; he will do all Gods commands;
looking to the Manner, as well as to the Matter.

The one, he will give God the carcass and body of duty. The other, he will
give God the life and spirit of duty.

Of the first sort we have some in the Text, who went high, to fall short of
Heaven at last. Surely, if we but read the words, and if God had not said,
they had been unsound; we should have judged them of the best of men.

Do but cast your eyes upon the Text, and read over the particulars.

1. They seek God,] and not for a time only, in a storm, in trouble; as many
will do. Believe me, they go further. They seek me daily. They had their
morning and evening Prayers.

2. They delight to know my ways.

1. They knew the ways of God.

2. They delighted to know his ways; which is equivalent to this; they did not
only know the ways of God, but desired to know the ways of God; and for ought
I know, might have some kind of delight in the knowledge of his ways.

3. As a Nation that did Righteousness, and forsook not the Ordinances of their
God.] That is, if you looked upon them, they would seem to be as holy a
people, as any I have in the World. There is none who would judge otherwise of
them by any outward appearance, but that they were as holy, as sincere, as any
in the World. Though they were not a Nation that did Righteousness, yet they
appeared to be so: They were as a Nation, that did Righteousness; not only as
a Nation, who heard, who knew, who spoke Righteousness; but as a Nation that
did Righteousness. They appeared to the judgment of the World to be as exact
as the choicest Saints, which God had in the World.

4. They ask of God the Ordinances of Justice.] They desire and pray that God
would inform them in the ways of Justice; how they should be governed and
ruled in the World: a people which has respect to their civil Laws and
Government, pretending to desire Gods Warrant, Gods Direction, Gods Rule in all
things; As if they would do nothing, even in their civil Affairs, without Gods
special Warrant and Direction.

5. They take delight in approaching to God.] Than which, how can we have an
higher expression? What? do they approach to God? and daily approach to God, as
you see in the beginning? And do they delight in approaching to God? do they
delight in hearing? do they delight in praying? do they delight in approaching
to God, in his Ordinances? Here was a stupendous height, What can we say
more? how can we go any higher* Here we may stand and tremble; stand and be
astonished; stand and be amazed. Lord, who is he that shall be saved!

May men do thus much, and yet fall short of Heaven? what will become of thee,
that do nothing? what will become of thee, thou Drunkard? what will become of
thee, thou Swearer? thou profane Person? Worldling? if it be thus with the
green Tree, what will become of the dry Tree? if it be thus with them that
appear to be good, what will become of them that appear to be evil?

Thus you see the astonishing height, which yet an unsound spirit may reach
unto. How much may be done by a man, and yet be unsound here, and fall short
of Heaven hereafter!

So that now I shall trouble you, but with one Doctrine. (And I believe, before
I have done it, it will trouble you.) And that shall be from the general, the
whole body of the Text together; and it is this.

Doct. It is possible for a man, to do much in the ways of God; even to abound
in all outward Performances, and yet be false at the heart; and yet have an
unsound spirit here, and miss of Heaven hereafter.

This Doctrine you see the Text speaks plainly. To this I will add but one
Instance more, which may prove the whole Doctrine; and that you have, Matthew.
19.16. to 23. You read there of ones coming to Christ. A young man, a rich
man, one, who had great Possessions, and a Ruler too, as Luke expresses it,
Luke 18.18. All which was rare. A young man! a rich man! a Ruler to come to
Christ! you shall read there his business also. He came, not to tempt him, Non
animo tentantis, sed voto discentis
to ensnare him, aothers did: but to learn, and be instructed by him. And the
thing he desires to be instructed in, is not some frivolous trifling matter,
which others came to Christ withal. But that which was the matter of his
inquiry, was a matter of eternal concernment. viz. What he might do, that he
might be saved; that he might inherit everlasting life. Here was something
here in this. A young man; a rich man; a Ruler, to come to Christ with desire
to be instructed, how he should come to eternal life.

You shall now hear Christ's answer, verse. 17. -- If thou will enter into life,
keep the Commandments. There was some special reason, why Christ makes him
such an answer? for in Joh. 6.28, 29. Christ answers the same question in
another manner.

Quaerebat opera, and Christus ostendit mandata.
But Christ did here consider the quality of the Person, who demanded. He was a
Work-monger, and Christ puts him to working. Christ gave him Physic suitable to
his distemper. Christ puts him to the Commandments, that he might convince
him, in that, to be imperfect, wherein he thought himself to be perfect; and
would make that his foil, which he thought to be his greatest glory.

Well, Christ having put him upon the Commandments, the young man demands,
which of the Commandments; as if he had said; -- There is none of them, but I
have already done.

Christ you see puts him to the Moral Law. Seeing he will have Heaven and be
justified by Moses; Moses shall be his Judge; and there rehearses diverse
Precepts of the second Table.

The young man, you see makes answer in verse. 20. -- All these things have I
kept from my youth; what lack I yet? Have thou any more to command? Is there
any more to be done?

This was now much, he said. If we may believe him.

1. He obeyed. He was not only one, who did know the Commandments; but one
who kept the Commandments.

2. He obeyed universally: not some, but all. -- All these things have I kept.]

3. He had obeyed constantly. -- All these things have I kept from my youth.

And sure there was much of truth in what he said. For it is said upon this --
Christ looked upon him, and loved him, as Mark relates, Mark 10.21.

No question he had obeyed the letter of the command: there was none could
detect him, but Christ; however, he failed in the Spirit of the command.

He did not break them in the outward action, though he did not keep them in
the inward affection.

And yet for all this, this man was unsound, as he discovers himself to be
afterward: for all this, this man fell short of Heaven.

And yet alas! How far does this man excel a thousand of us?

So that you see, the Doctrine plain in the gross, in the bulk, scil. That it is
possible for a man to do much in the ways of God, and yet to be unsound at
heart: to abound in all outward Performances, and yet to miss of Heaven in the
end.

But we will come to clear it to you, in the Particulars. And we will follow
this Method; in these four Particulars.

1. We will clear it to you in diverse instances from the word, that it is
possible so to do.

2. We will show how this may stand both 1. With Gods ends. 2. With Satan's
ends. 3. With man's own ends, To do much, to abound in duty, and yet not to be
sincere.


3. We will show you the grounds, whence it arises, that a corrupt heart may
abound in all outward Performances.

4. We Will show you where the fault is; how it comes to pass; that all this may
be done, and yet the heart still remain unsound.

In which I shall desire, that they who are men and women of tender spirits,
would not presently make conclusions against themselves; and by so doing,
gratify Satan, discourage their own souls, grieve Gods Spirit, and wound and
weaken themselves in the ways of Grace. But hear all, (for I cannot say all at
once) and then spare not, but come to conclusions with your selves.

I shall desire so to cast down the unsound, as not to weaken the sincere. And
to bring in those that are without, as not to cast down those that are within.
So to help the one, as that withal I hurt not the other.

1. For the first then. We will clear it in some particulars, that it is
possible for a man to do much, to go far in outward performances of duty, and
yet to be rotten at heart, etc.

1. It is possible for a man to hear the word; nay, and hear it often; nay, and
abound in hearing, time after time, Sabbath after Sabbath. Nay, and yet more,
to hear it with affection too, and yet not to be sincere.

1. That he may hear the Word: This is plain, and needs no proof.

2. That he may hear it often, abound in hearing. This you see here in the
Text; and Ezekiel. 33.31, 32. where the people frequented to hear Ezekiel. They
did not only sometimes, but they heard him often. They did abound in hearing.

3. They may not only hear, and hear often; but hear with affections. We read
of these four Affections, which were stirred in the hearing of the Word; and
that in such, who were unsound.

1. The affection of wonder, and astonishment, which indeed is the Mover of all
the affections, Mat. 7.28. -- When the people heard him, they were astonished
at his Doctrine. The like we read, Mat. 13.54. Mar. 1.22. Mark. 11.18. Luke
4.22. All bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded
out of his mouth. -- All wondered, but All were not savingly wrought upon. That
is the first.

2. They may hear it with affections of fear and trembling. Thus you know
Foelix heard Paul, Act. 24.25. -- When Paul preached of Temperance, and
Righteousness, and Judgment to come, Foel x trembled. It struck dread and fear
into his heart. It set him on trembling.

3. They may hear the word with affections of delight, and some kind of love.
You see in the Text, -- They did delight to know Gods ways, and did delight in
approaching to God. And Ezekiel. 33.31, 32. -- They come and sit before thee, as
my people. They hear thy words, and thou art to them as a very lovely song.
They hear thy words, but they do them not. With their mouth they show much
love, but their heart goes after their Covetousness.

4. They may hear the word, with affection of Joy. It is said of Herod, Mark
6.20. That Herod feared and observed John; and when he heard him, he did many
things, and heard him gladly. The like you have, Matthew. 13.20. -- The stony
ground heard the word, and anon with joy received it: yet wanting root in the
time of Persecution, they fell away.

So you see the first particular cleared. A man may hear the word; he may hear
it often; abound in hearing: He may hear it with affections; and yet his heart
may be unsound.

2. A man may not only hear, but pray too; nay, and make many prayers, abound
in praying. He may pray in public, pray in private, pray in the Church, pray
in his family, pray in his closet, which last comes nearer to sincerity, And
may make strong cries; He may pray with affections, i. e. such affections as
sense stirs up; but not such affections as Faith stirs up; such affections as
are raised up by some present sting and smart, some trouble and pressure of
conscience; though not with such affections as are raised up by Faith, quickened
by Gods sanctifying Spirit. Affections of love and desire.

Nay, and they may join fasting to Prayer: nay, further, add mourning to
fasting. And yet their hearts may be unsound.

I cannot stand to clear all the Particulars. The main I shall make to appear
to you, in two or three places.

Read Isa. 1.15. -- When you stretch forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
from you; yea, when you make many prayers; when you multiply prayer; add
prayer to prayer, as the word imports. -- Yet I will not hear, your hands are
full of blood; i. e. you are unregenerate, you are unsound in your spirits.

So that you see a great deal cleared in this. A man may pray; abound in
praying; multiply prayers, etc. And yet be unsound.

And you may join fasting to prayer; as you see in the next verse to my Text,
and in the example of the Scribes and Pharisees, who prayed often, and fasted
often.

And you may join mourning to fasting, Zach. 7.5. -- When you fasted and
mourned in the fifth month, even these seventy years, did you at all fast to
me? even to me? They served themselves, not God in that action all those
seventy years together, Hos. 7.14. -- and they have not cried to me with their
hearts, when they howled upon their beds; they assemble themselves for Corn and
Wine; (that is the ground of their fasting and howling.) For they rebel against
me.

That Is the second Particular.

3. A man may seem to be humbled, to mourn and weep for sin: and yet be
unsound. A man cannot mourn for sin, as sin, but his heart is sincere: but a
man may seem to mourn for sin, and yet his heart not be sincere. He may mourn
for sin clad with wrath: for sin clothed with Judgment and Displeasure: for
sin, as it smells of Hell, Fire, and Brimstone: for sin, as it appears in its
doomsday attire. So did Ahab, so Judas.

There are Crocodile-tears; There are false tears, as well as false prayers. As
a broken heart does not ever express it self in tears* So tears are not ever
the expression of a broken heart.

There are 1. Lachrymae Indignationis, tears of Anger; as was Esaus. 2.
Lachrymae Desperationis, tears of Desperation; such as of the damned in Hell.
3. Lachrymae Compunctionis, tears of Compassion; such as were Christ's for
Jerusalem. 4. Lachrymae Compunctionis, tears of godly sorrow and Compunction.


Such tears they may express as sense and smart stirs up; but not such as
Faith and Love do raise up in the soul.

4. A man may seem to do much; walk in many ways of duty; go far in the
outward show of obedience, the letter of command: and yet his spirit be
unsound.

A man may do so much, spin a thread so finely, as they, who have the most
discerning spirit, are not able to detect and discover him.

He may deceive the men of the world; he may deceive the Saints; deceive the
Devil; he may deceive himself.

We read of Zeuxes the Painter. He drew Grapes so to the life, that he
deceived the Birds; they would come flying to them, as though they had been
real Grapes.

Dedalus, he made an Image by art, that moved of it self; insomuch that men
believed it had been alive.

But Pigmalion made an Image so lively, that he deceived himself, and taking
the Picture for a Person, fell in love with his own Picture.

So there are some, who can spin so fine a thread, limb out the picture of
godliness so to the life; that not only the men of the World, but even the
Saints, who are of most discerning spirits; nay, and themselves may be
deceived and deluded.

5. A man may cast up his vomit, disgorge himself of all his former ways, his
old lusts and sins; he may be washed, that is, outwardly reformed in every
thing; he may leave many sins, and yet be unsound.

You see this plain, in 2 Pet. 2.20, 21, 22. And there is nothing more plain,
than that a man may leave sin, and yet not hate sin.

He may leave sin either 1. Ex timore mali alicujus.
1. Out of fear of evil. 2. Ex taedio.
2. Out of weariness of it. 3. Ex amore mali alicujus oppositi.
3. Out of love of some contrary sin. 4. Ex deficientia organotum.
4. Out of want of fit instrument and means, to compass his sin.


6. A man may accompany himself with the People of God. Saul may be among the
Prophets: Judas, Demas, Simon-Magus, among the Disciples and Apostles. A man
may get on Sheeps-cloathing, accompany, go in and out with the Sheep; be
folded with the Sheep; and yet be no better than a Ravenous Wolf.

There are Tares as well as Wheat in Gods Field; there is Chaff as well as Corn
in Gods Floar, bad Fishes as well as good in Gods net. And unsound as well as
sound Gospellers in the Church of God.

7. Nay, A man may not only do, but suffer too, and yet be unsound. He may
suffer in his Goods, He may suffer in his Good-name, He may be nicknamed as
others are, he may suffer in his Body: An evil heart may suffer in a good
cause. Every one that bears Christ's Cross upon his shoulders, does not
consequently bear him in his heart. Wolves may suffer in Sheeps-cloathing.
Sufferings may overtake them, that have nothing but the cloak of profession. As
Jehoshaphat was taken for Ahab: So may an Ahab be taken for a Jehoshaphat.
Times may come, that it may cost a man as dearly for wearing the Livery of
Christ, as for wearing Christ himself: for unsound profession of Christ, as for
the sincere.

To sum up all, Though an unsound spirit be not able to do any thing, which
is essential to a Christian, as a Christian: Though he cannot do any of those
works which are good propter fieri, in regard of the act; the goodness whereof
does adhere intrinsecally, and cleave to the thing done: as to Love God, fear
God, trust in God: Yet all these works, the goodness whereof does more consist
in the Manner, than in the Matter, or thing done, viz. to pray, read, hear,
etc. In all these they may abound.

And this seems to be implied in the Apostles phrase, 2 Timothy 3.5. -- Having a
form of godliness, yet denying the power: From such turn away. Where, by the
form of godliness, which the Apostle grants they may have; there are two things
which are implied.

1. That no unsound spirit has any thing in it, which is essential to a
Christian, as a Christian; or which makes a Christian, a Christian. As a Form
and Picture has nothing in it, which is de Essentia Hominis: nothing which is
essential to a man. There is no Reason, no Understanding, no Life in it: So an
Hypocrite, he has nothing that is Essential to a Christian, as a Christian.
He has nothing which does constitute and make a Christian a Christian.

As we say of God; He has his communicable and incommunicable Attributes;
something which is in himself only, as his Infinitness, his Omnipresence, etc.
and something whereof there is a Resemblance, some footsteps in the Creatures:
so the Saints, they have something which is communicable; something whereof
there is some resemblance in others, and which others do as well as they;
though not in the same Manner. And there is something incommunicable to any but
to Saints; such things as are proper and Peculiar to the Saints only. And they
are such things as are Essential to a Christian, as a Christian. And that is
the first thing implied in the word [Form.]

2. A second thing, which is implied in it is, That a false Professor may have
a complete Resemblance of a Christian in all those things, which are not
essential to a Christian, as a Christian. He may have a form of godliness]
that is, all the outward lineaments of godliness: He may be a complete
Picture of a Christian from top to toe; in every member, every limb, every duty
for the outward of it. This is implied in the word (Form.)

As a Picture, if it were not perfect in every limb, if there wanted any
member, as an Hand, an Eye, nay but a Finger, it could not be said to be a
complete Picture: so is it here. If there be a want in any thing, even in the
least duty, for the outward part of Religion; if he do not all for the
Externals, which a Christian does; he cannot be said to be a complete Form,
a complete Picture of a godly man. And therefore these two things are implied
in the word (Form.)

1. That no Hypocrite has any thing in him essential to a Christian; no more
than a Picture, that which is essential to a man.

2. That there is a complete Resemblance of a Christian in all the outward
lineaments of Godliness.

He may be able to do all the outward: every duty for the externals, which
lies within the latitude and compass of a Christians walking with God.

Thus the first thing is cleared to you. Now we come to the second thing
propounded.

2. How it may stand with 1. Gods ends. 2. Satan's ends. 3. A man's own ends, to
abound in duty, and yet not be sincere?


1. It may stand with Gods ends, both 1. Toward the Good; and they are
merciful ends. 2. Toward the Bad; and they are partly merciful, and partly
judicial.


1. It may stand with Gods ends toward the good, and those are merciful ends.
That God may serve his own Glory by them, for the bringing in, and building up
of the godly.

God makes use of the parts and abilities of some, whose persons he will not
own, for the advancement of the work of grace, in the hearts of his people.

The Raven was an unclean Creature under the Law: yet God made use of the
Raven, to bring flesh and food to Elijah. Though the Raven was not good meat,
yet it was good meat which the Raven brought.

So God does oftentimes make use of such, who are in themselves unclean, for
the feeding and nourishing of his people. The food may be good, though the
person that brings it may be naught.

This is that Christ told the people, Matthew. 23.2, 3. The Scribes and
Pharisees, they sit in Moses chair: and therefore whatever they bid you
observe, that observe and do: but do ye not after their works: for they say,
but do not. As if Christ had said. They are set up, and furnished with
abilities, to do you good; though they are naught themselves: Therefore let
their Doctrine build you up, for it is of God: and let not their practice throw
you down, for that is of the Devil, and themselves.

The Pearl in the Toads head may be useful and good, though the Body be
poison. And the abilities of such men may be serviceable to you, though their
persons be unclean.

Thus may it stand with Gods ends toward the good, that corrupt hearts should
abound in all the ways of duty. And this is one end, for the advancement of
the work of Grace, in the hearts of his people.

Though this be not their aim; though it be not their end; yet it is Gods
end. They have theirs, and God has his end.

As it is said of the King of Assyria, Isa. 10.5, 6, 7. God used him for a rod
and scourge to punish his people. God had his end, and he had his. It was Gods
end, that he should spoil and punish them for their sin: but his, to enrich
himself by the spoil; as the Text tells us. Howbeit, Though I send him, to
punish them for their sins (says God) yet he, the King of Assyria, means
not so, nor does his heart think so: it is in his heart to cut off, and destroy
Nations, not a few. Though he served his own ends, yet Gods end went forward
also.

The like of Jehu, he served his own ends, in the destruction of Ahabs house.
Though he cries out, Come see my Zeal for the Lord. However Gods ends were
brought about also, in the ruin of Ahabs posterity, as he had threatened.

So here. Though it be not the end of corrupt hearts, in the doing of holy
actions, Prayer, Preaching, Exhortation, etc. to bring God any Glory, to do
good to others: they have their own ends. Yet still Gods work goes forward in
it. God has his ends, as well as they theirs. God gets Glory, as well as they
credit. God makes sin, the Devil himself, to serve his Glory. Otherwise he
would not suffer nor Devil, nor Sin, to be in the World. So that he makes
them, in aiming at themselves, to bring about his Glory.

As an unsound spirit does serve his turn of God: so God again serves his turn
of them: he is even with them.

God oftentimes uses such to be instruments to do others good, who are bad
themselves: to work upon others, though they themselves remain unwrought upon:
to be a Bridge to help others over.

To hold out the Lantern to others, and go in the dark themselves. As it
often fares with them, who hold the Lantern; they go most in the dark
themselves, they serve others, direct and guide others in the night with their
light, not themselves. So if God do not bring light into their hearts: there
are none, who are more in darkness, than such as hold out the light to others:
yet

Another may receive good, by that Sermon, which the Preacher himself is never
the better for: another, warmth by that prayer, whereby he himself that
prays, is never the hotter. And so in the rest. And therefore it may stand
with Gods ends, that corrupt hearts should abound in duties.

2. God suffers corrupt hearts to abound in duties, to maintain an holy
jealousy and watchfulness in the hearts of his own people. Why (will they
reason) if men may do thus much, and yet be unsound; what need have we then
to be jealous over our own hearts, watchful over our spirits in the midst of
our performances?

Oh! this will make a man jealous of himself, with a godly jealousy: not to
trust too much to himself, when he is at best, when he does most abound in
duties. And this holy jealousy is of special use to keep us humble, to make us
watchful, exact in our ways, to fense our hearts against Hypocrisy. It was
never known that a jealous heart was a false heart. An holy jealousy over a
man's spirit was never accompanied with an unsound spirit.

3. A third End. It is, to make us see there is something in duty, more than
duty, which sets a value upon duty, and makes it of worth.

If all were sound, who did duty, we should then think duty it self to be
all; whereas now it makes us look after something else, above duty.

This will make a man look to the Manner, as well as to the Matter, when we
see the Matter is nothing worth, without the right Manner do accompany it.

This will force a man's heart above duty. God never made Duty the end of Duty.
If all were sound that did Duty, we should rest upon a bare performance of
Duty, and look no higher.

But now, seeing it is possible for a man to abound in Duty, and yet be
unsound; this will force a man's heart above the Duty.

4. To tell us, that there are other things to be done of a Christian, than
merely to pray, hear, etc.

If a man may do all, and sink into Hell, when he has done: then sure there
is more required of those that must be saved.

All Religion does not lie in a few Prayers, Hearing of Sermons. Though this
must be done, they have not so much as a show of goodness, who neglect these:
yet there are other things to be done too, if ever we would come to Heaven.

5. God suffers corrupt hearts to abound in duty, to make his people more
sollicitous after surer, more stable, and proving evidences, than these are.

If these anchors should always hold, men would never labor to cast out
better. If all, that did duty, nay, that did abound in duty had been sound,
we should never have sought out for better evidences than these are.

Whereas, this being discovered, that a man may abound in duty, and yet for all
this be unsound: this will make a man to look out for better evidences.

A man that is bent for Heaven indeed, will never suffer his soul to rest, till
he has gotten some such evidences, as are incompatible to a man out of Christ.

Why, will he say, May a man hear, and go to Hell? pray, and perish? do duty,
and yet be damned at last? Then these are not sufficient bottomes for me, to
build the weight of my everlasting soul upon. I must either get a better
bottom, surer evidences than these, or both I and my prayers may sink together
at last.

Whatever another man may do, or have, and yet be unsound, will not be
sufficient to him, to clear, that he doing, or having that, is sound.

And this now fires them out of their formalities; makes them look out for such
evidences as do accompany salvation; As the Apostle says, Heb. 6.9.

2. As it may stand with Gods ends to the good: so it may stand with Gods ends
to the bad.

1. His Merciful ends. 2. His Judicial ends.
His Merciful ends, to bring in those who belong to the Election of Grace:
making them often serviceable to these purposes.

His Judicial ends, toward such as are Cast-awayes; and that for the further
strengthening of the prejudice, and rooted dislike, that wicked men have
against the ways of God.

Why, will wicked men say? others, who have been as forward in profession, as
great Prayers, and as great Hearers as you are, they have proved unsound,
discovered themselves to be Hypocrites, and so are you, and all the rest of
you.

And thus you see it turns to them, as an occasion of offense; and further
strengthening of their dislike of the ways and people of God. Men, whose
hearts are set against the ways of God, shall be furnished with matter enough
to bring them into further dislike daily.

If you desire to have arguments against Gods ways, you shall have enough of
them to your cost. You shall be furnished with them; but to your further
hardening. If you will keep a rooted dislike of the ways of God, you shall
find enough in the World to nourish it. If you be willing to be offended,
you shall have offenses enough to your further hardening. If you be willing to
stumble at the ways of God, you shall have stumbling stones enough.

Christ himself, who was the Corner stone, Elect, Precious; yet to the
Disobedient he was a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense. A stone as
well for the Fall, as for the rising of many in Israel, 1 Pet. 2.8. Isa. 8.14.
Romans 9.33. Luke 2.34.

Men that are willing to take offenses, shall have them. Those who will be
blind, shall be blinded. They, who will be hardened, shall have hardening
enough. If the Word do not teach you; works do blind you. If the Word do not
soften you, works do harden you. If you stumble at the Word, you will fall at
works.

Indeed, Men first stumble at the Word, before they stumble at Works: They
first take offense at duties the Word commands, and then strengthen that
offense, by the failings of those, who walk in those ways.

Works do but strengthen your dislike of things in the Word. The failings of
persons, that walk in this way, do but further strengthen your dislike of the
things commanded in the Word. This the Apostle shows, 1 Pet. 2.8. Christ was a
stone of stumbling. But to whom? why to those, who stumbled at the Word first.
After they have stumbled at the Word, then they stumble at Christ. So when you
have stumbled, and taken offense against these duties, which the Word commands;
no marvel if you stumble here; and by the failings of those, who walk in the
way of life, gather arguments to strengthen your dislike of the way it self.

This is thy spirit; though thou see it not. Thy heart is opposite to the ways
of God, praying, hearing, fasting; and thou furnishest thy self with instances
of some, who have proved unsound in the way, that so thou may strengthen thy
heart more with dislike against it.

And thus it proves an occasion of further blinding, of further hardening to
thee.

Thus you see the first, How it may stand with Gods ends, that corrupt hearts
should abound in duty.

2, It may stand also with Satan's ends.

1. It may stand with Satan's ends, toward the good. 2. It may stand with
Satan's ends, toward the World. 3. It may stand with Satan's ends, toward
themselves.
1. It may stand with Satan's ends, toward the good; and therefore he will not
disturb these men in their way, but lets them go on.

1. Hereby Satan does labor to cause Gods People to throw off the work; to
desist in their way. Why, will Satan say, what do you macerate and afflict your
selves in a way, wherein is no more good? What can you do more than others have
done? They have prayed, and they have prayed often, and made many Prayers. They
have heard, and heard often; yea and heard with affection, with fear, with joy,
and delight, etc. They have fasted, and have joined mourning with fasting. They
have forsaken their evil ways, wherein they have formerly walked; and have
entered upon Gods ways, joined themselves to the Ordinances, to the People of
God. And yet, for all this, these people have come to naught. For all this,
their hearts were unsound here, and they have perished after all. And therefore
(will Satan say) If a man may pray, and perish; do duties, and be damned;
hear, and get to Hell at last; why do thou then thus trouble thy self, and
afflict thy self in this way? Thou see there is no hope of doing good in it.
And therefore, why will thou abridge thy self of those pleasures, those
comforts, which others have in the World? why will thou go on to macerate and
afflict thy self in these ways? were it not better for thee to throw off all,
and betake thy self to the World, to profits, to pleasures, and enjoy thy
hearts content as well as others?

Thus you see Satan is furnished with a dangerous argument against Gods People,
which he could not have had, if unsound hearts did not abound in duty, etc.

2. If he cannot prevail with Gods people hereby, to throw off the work; but
that notwithstanding all this, they are resolved to pray, though they perish;
to believe, to obey, though God should never reward their obedience; yet he
has a second End.

He labors to discourage Gods People hereby in the work, and to make them
drive heavily in their way to Heaven. Satan knows full well, that if their
heart be discouraged in the work, their hands will be weakened for the work.
And therefore he labors, by such presidents as these are, who have done so
much in the ways of God, and yet are unsound; to make men sit down
discouraged, and despair of ever doing good in these ways.

Why, will Satan say, How can thou do more, than such and such have done?
Can thou pray more Prayers? hear more Sermons? do more Duties? keep more
Days? engage thy self more deeply in the Cause of God, than others have done?
who have yet come to naught.

It may be he will tell thee. Thou art weak, thou want those parts, those
abilities, that strength, that power to do God that service, which others have
done. And therefore e'ne cast off all, or else despair of ever doing good, in
this way, wherein others have outstript thee; and yet were unsound.

Thus does Satan make use of this argument, if not to prevail with men; to cast
off the work, yet to discourage them in the work. And therefore it may stand
with his ends, that unsound hearts may thus abound in performance of duties.

3. A third end which Satan has toward the godly, is, that if he cannot
prevail to make Gods people throw off the work; nor yet discourage them in the
work; yet he labors by these men to scandalize the godly, to bring evil
reports upon all that walk in the way of life.

It is Satan's desire to make the Persons that walk in the way of life, and the
way of life it self as odious as he can, in the eyes of the World. And this is
one way, whereby he labors to bring it about, and finds successful in the
hearts of many: even the failings of such as have made profession of the Truth.

Indeed the Cause of God, and the People of God have suffered much thereby.

You know how wicked men argue.

1. Either from Particulars to Generals: from the failings of some, they fall
to censuring of all. There is one (say they) who has made profession, and has
proved naught. Therefore all are so: all alike: none better than other.

Which yet is an uncharitable and false reasoning. If the Saints should argue
so of you: There was one unregenerate man a Murderer, a Traitor, a Thief:
Therefore all that are unregenerate are Traitors, Murderers, Thieves: you would
think this to be uncharitable and false reasoning. Yet yours is the same.

2. Or secondly, By the failing of the Person, they take up arguments to charge
and condemn the Cause: not only Professors, but Profession it self; casting
filth and dirt upon the pure face of Religion, and the ways of God hereby.

And Satan knows well enough, that the Cause of God loses more by one man's
unsoundness, than it can gain and recover again by the sincerity of many. It
loses more in the hearts of wicked men, by the falls of some, than it can
gain again by the standing of thousands.

David's fall, though he rose again, caused Religion, and the Ways of God to
be blasphemed by wicked men. It opened the mouths of wicked men to blaspheme
the ways of God; as the Prophet told him.

And indeed, God was more dishonored by David's uncleanness, than he was by
all the filth of Sodom. And therefore seeing Satan gets such advantage both
against the Persons, and against the Cause of God, by the unsoundness of men,
that walk in the Ways of God: therefore may it stand with Satan's ends to
suffer unsound hearts, to abound in duty, without disturbing of them. And as it
may stand with Satan's ends, in respect of the godly; So

2. It may stand with his Ends, in respect of the World.

1. To keep them off, from entering upon the way of life.

Men will be afraid to engage themselves in such a way, wherein there stand
up such sad Presidents, as these are. If men may do much, and yet fall off, be
unsound, and fall short of Heaven at last, this will discourage and dis-hearten
them, from coming in.

Men are naturally afraid, when they are to run hazards and dangers: to take a
great deal of pains in such a way, wherein there are so many hazards and
dangers to be run.

2. To strengthen the prejudice of wicked men against the ways and people of
God.

Wicked men are naturally prejudiced against the ways and people of God. They
think them all to be no better than others, however they make a show to be
better. And when they see this prejudice of theirs confirmed by the example of
any one, who has walked in the way, and yet has been unsound: This is a
matter laid up for ever, here they hug themselves, and rejoice in such an
example: and so their prejudice against Gods ways and people is hereby more
strengthened.

3. A third End, which Satan has toward wicked men, is, hereby to harden
them, and confirm and strengthen them in a way of sin.

When they see no better fruit of so much praying, hearing, etc. They are
hardened in their way of sin, and persuaded to go on in their old way, their
common road still.

Thus you see, how it may stand with Satan's ends toward the good, and toward
the bad.

3. Now thirdly, How it may stand with Satan's ends toward themselves, that
thus abound in duty, and yet are unsound.

1. To aggravate their condemnation. Such men's sins they are great. Duty
doubles sin. A duty upon the head of a sin makes sin exceeding heinous. And as
the sin, so the condemnation is aggravated hereby.

The darkest and hottest places in Hell, are reserved for such, whose hearts
are unsound in the ways of God. Such would wish to change places with Turks
and Heathens; all their duties are but so much fuel to make the fire of Hell
the hotter for them.

By how much such men are lifted up higher than others in appearance; by so
much they shall be thrown down lower than others in truth and reality of
torments.

2. Because such men are surest his, of any, upon two grounds.

1. If he stand in that condition, he thinks he is sure enough his. What can
rob him of such a man? can Prayer? can Hearing? Indeed these might deprive him
of others: but this man he dares trust any where, upon any duty: He dares
venture him any where: He knows his heart is Prayer-Proof, Sermon-Proof. All
these are not strong enough to take him away from him.

Indeed, he is afraid of others, though never so wicked. He fears he may
loose him at every Sermon, he may be robbed of him, at every prayer: And
therefore labors all he can to keep such men off from the work.

But now this man he dares adventure to the most powerful and prevailing
ordinances: He has long experience, his heart has stood firm to him in all.

Though sometimes he has had some stings and troubles of conscience, as
certainly it fares often with unsound hearts, who have to do with duties: yet
he can let him alone; he knows he will come to his old temper, and return to
himself again.

As hot water will return to its own coldness, because there is a quality in
it, which resists heat, and inclines to cold; so if at any time such a man be
troubled, Satan will let him alone, he knows there is a Principle in him,
which will cause him to return to his wonted temper.

2. If he fall, he thinks him sure enough his.

Such men's falls are for the most part desperate and unrecoverable. You know,
the greater the height, from which a man falls, the more desperate and
irrecoverable is his fall.

Now there can be no greater an height in the World, from which to fall, than
for a man to fall from the Hills of duty, the Mountains of Prayer, the top of
profession. This may prove the irrecoverable downfall.

All thy Duty, all thy Prayers, if thy heart be unsound, are but something
laid in, to make that sin. All these do but ripen and prepare for, and nimble
thee, to commit that sin, if thy heart be unsound in them.

But if the fall be not desperate, yet it is dangerous: though not
irrecoverable, yet hard to be recovered.

There are many and fearful aggravations of your sins, all which Satan now
uses, and sets on with all his might, to bring you to despair. And great is
the hazard, hard is the recovery.

It has been often known, a sincere heart has recovered and gotten ground and
strength by his fall. But seldom or never that an unsound heart got up again
after his Fall; never came to his heights; but rather wallows in mischief.
David fell and recovered, but Judas fell, and rose no more.

But however, the hazard is great, in regard there are so many fearful
aggravations of sin.

Their sins are sins against Knowledge, Light, Illumination, which puts much
weight to sin.

Sins of ignorance plead for a pardon, though great. What greater than the
killing of Christ? yet -- Father forgive them, for they know not what they do?
But sins against Knowledge do exceedingly aggravate sin, and makes sin
exceeding sinful.

There is more sin, more guilt formerly considered, in a sinful thought
against Knowledge, than there is in an open gross sin of Ignorance. Why; their
sins are sins against Knowledge, against Conscience, against Profession,
Practice, Prayers, Duties; and therefore great.

All their Duties and Prayers that they have done should be now comforts; but
they are burdens, because they are done with unsound hearts; and they come in
as so many aggravations of sin against them.

Whilst a man holds up his head in the World, though he be but poor, it may
be his Creditors will let him alone; but if once a man be arrested, every one
then comes with his action upon him; may be, those he thought his best
friends, come then, and lay greatest burdens upon him.

Whilst an unsound man walks in way of duty, and does not fall into the
commission of some gross sin, so long it may be, he has quiet. Satan,
Conscience, nothing troubles him. But when once he is down, then all comes
upon him: nay his very Duties themselves (which he thought to have most good
from, and to be his best friends) they come in too, to lay more weight, more
guilt, more burden on him. Every Prayer, every Duty, which he has done with
an unsound heart, is now a burden, a weight, upon his spirit; yea, and weighes
heavier than all the rest.

Here is trouble out of expected comfort, which is the greatest trouble. And
take this with you, and remember it.

Whatever you do in the ways of God, if comfort flow not from it, trouble will
one day rise out of it. If it be not a bottom for Faith, Satan will use it as
an argument for Despair, when time serves. I say, that duty that is done, and
cannot minister comfort, by the sincerity of the heart, in doing of it, will
one day create discouragement, and strengthen Despair. Despair arises from
that, where comfort should, but does not arise.

But I am too long upon this. This is the second ground, why Satan does not
disturb such men.

3. It may stand yet further with Satan's ends; and therefore he does not
disturb them; because he hopes to have some further good of them another day.
He knows full well, that they, who will serve God for their own ends, will
serve the Devil for their own ends too, when he once out-bids God, and exceeds
him in his tenders. It is an easy thing to make him the Devils Priest, who is,
Mammons Chaplain. You see Demas, he was unsound, served God for By-ends, for
worldly respects. And the Devil does but out-bid God, tender more for his
service; and he presently forsakes God, and cleaves to the World. He forsook
the Faith of Christ, and turned to be an Idol-Priest at Thessalonica, as
Dorotheus reports of him.

This is a sure Rule. He who serves God for the World, will serve the Devil
for the World. He who serves God for little, will serve the Devil for more;
he will easily be brought upon higher tenders, to change his Master.

I say, men, that have no mind to the Work, nor love to the Master, but the
eye is only to the wages; such men will quickly be drawn upon greater offers,
to forsake their Master, and their Work too, and to join themselves to any,
where better wages may be found.

And you must know. There are no men, whose service the Devil does more desire,
than the service of such, who have made profession. And that upon diverse
reasons.

1. He knows, They will be the surest, and most trusty servants to him of
any. None are more trusty soldiers, than such, who have forsaken the colors
of the Lord, and fled over to the Tents of Satan. Such men he never fears to
loose again: their Ears are boared, in token of eternal subjection to this
black Prince of darkness.

As we say of the Angels. If once they turn, they never return. There is no
possibility of their repenting. And this is one ground; because their will has
sinned against such excellent, clear and eminent light, that they can never
return again; if all that light would not keep their desperate hearts from
sinning, it shall never prevail with them for returning, when once they have
sinned. And God will never give a fuller, a greater light, and therefore they
must needs be fixed in their condition of sin.

So I may say of these in some degree. They have sinned against so clear light,
such manifest evidence, that if they turn, sin wilfully: Hardly do they return
again. It is no more but what the Apostle says, in that sixth and tenth to the
Hebrews. And therefore these must needs be trusty servants to the Devil, they
are sure his.

They are his by choice. And none surer his, than they, who are his by choice.
Now such men, they have chosen him; nay and not only chosen him, but they have
chosen him upon experience and dislike of their former Master.

If indeed a man should have chosen Satan, before ever he had tried God, then
were there some hopes that his mind might be altered, he might repent of his
choice. But when a man has had a trial of God, and upon experience and dislike
of God, and his ways, chooses Satan and the world; these are sure.

Besides, these men have sold themselves over to Satan. Now none are more sure
his, than they, who sell themselves over to him.

Indeed, we are all sold in Adam, as the Apostle says. -- sold to sin. But
now when a man shall come, and not only ratify the bargain, but make a new
sale of himself; This man is sure his. It is not so much what the Father has
done, but when the Son comes to age, and shall ratify what the Father has
done, and make a new Sale: Nay, Satan does not only know they are sure his; but
he knows they will be most useful Instruments for him, and by these things
are they strengthened and prepared for his service: and therefore he will not
disturb them. He knows they will by this, be made better Engineers to work
for him. They will be active instruments, full of malice against God, and his
cause.

Who of all the Emperors was more mischievous than Julian? who had once made
profession of Christ. Such men as these are set on fire of Hell.

We have a Proverb. An English man Italianate,

Is a Devil Incarnate.

I may say the same; A Professor Apostate,

Turns a Devil Incarnate.

There are none in the World have more of the Infernal Nature, than they. Their
Head poisons, their Heart poisons. And the venom of Aspes is under their
Tongue. They are full of Hell.

There is some ingenuity in Nature fallen, though never so bad. But Nature once
raised, and after Devilized: such men are all fury. These are Satan's Mogols,
Satan's Champions, the chiefest of that black band of Darkness: Such men as
these, they have sinned away Light, Conscience, all natural remorse and
tenderness. And what can be expected from them? there is no man's sword more
sharp and keen than theirs, who have sharpened it upon the threshold of God. No
man's pen writes so bitterly against God, his Cause and People, than theirs, who
have dipped their pen in the Blood of Conscience. No man fails more desperately
to Hell, than such a man, who has made Shipwreck of Conscience.

And therefore, seeing such men are so trusty, so sure, so active, so malicious
instruments, when they are brought over to him, and it is so easy a thing to
bring them about; no marvel if Satan will not disturb such men for a time, but
lets them go on, till they be fit for his work. It will stand with the designs
of his own Kingdom.

Thus I have showed two things, how it may stand, 1. With Gods, 2. With Satan's
ends.

3. Now thirdly, How it may stand with their own ends, who having corrupt
hearts, yet should notwithstanding abound in duty.

1. To answer the calls of Conscience.

Every man has a Conscience. And every man's Conscience does call upon him for
the performance of something. And the further conscience is enlightened, the
further work it calls him out upon. A man enlightened cannot serve God so
cheaply, with quiet of Conscience, as others, who are not, can.

Now there are some, who are far convinced, some, who are further enlightened
than others. And conscience calls out upon them, for more work to be done. And
to answer the mere calls of Conscience, a man far enlightened may do much in
the ways of God; and yet his spirit be unsound.

2. To pacify the quarrels, to satisfy the gripes and gnawings of conscience.

It is usual with men under the pangs and stings of conscience, To run to the
springs of duty, to the plasters of prayers, merely for this end, To get
present ease, and quiet to their burdened Consciences. And they often compass
their end by this means, and get some present ease; though not a settled and
substantial Peace. Such as their disturbance is, such is their Peace. As their
disturbance was not spiritual for sin: so their Peace, it is not spiritual
arising from a cure. As conscience was wounded by walking to that common light,
and natural Principles in it: So is it put in joint again, by walking
answerable to them; which works, though but common and general, yet being all
their light discovers; they may, by the performance of them, get some present
ease, though not a sound and settled Peace.

We read, The Heathens had stings of Conscience, when they sinned notoriously
against the Light and Principles of Nature. And we read, they had Peace and
quiet, when they observed those things, which their light discovered to them.

As their Terrors did arise from Convictions of Conscience, upon the doing of
such things as were contrary to the Principles of Nature: so their Peace did
arise from the observance of such things as were agreeable to that common Light
and Principles they had. So it is here. Their Conviction does arise from some
Common, not saving Light.

1. Because it discovers gross sins, not secret sins.

2. It discovers open sins, not spiritual sins.

3. It discovers no sin, as sin, in the Nature of it. Some sins it discovers
not at all.

And so their Peace does arise from some common Performances, some general
works, not special and saving. And this is one end, why some may abound in
outward Performances, to make themselves a Plaster of the ingredients of
Prayers and Duties, to heal their wound^d consciences.

I have sometimes thought that Conscience in this case, is something like to
the disease which they call the Wolf in the body. If you feed not it, they are
wont to say, It will feed upon you. And therefore in this case it is said, they
used to give it flesh, that so, by feeding on that, it might not gnaw upon
them, and by that means have some present ease, though the cure be not wrought.

So it is with Conscience. When once the mouth of Conscience is opened, if a
man do not feed it, it will devour him. And therefore men in this case do feed
Conscience with duty, which for present, procures them ease, though the cure
be not wrought.

And indeed (to speak truth) such men do not desire the cure. They desire ease,
but not the cure; Peace, not Purging; Quiet, not Healing. They would willingly
be rid of the pain, but keep the Tooth: of Trouble, but keep the sin: of the
evil caused, not of the evil causing. The cure would be as deadly to them as
the wound; to part with the sin, as to endure the smart.

And therefore, seeing there is a middle-way to be gone, that they may procure
their present Peace, and yet keep their sin: They will go that way, and labor
to still the clamours of Conscience, by bribing it with Duty, feeding it with
Prayers; that so they may procure Peace, and yet keep their sins.

Other ends there are, which are more low than the former.

1. For Ostentation and Pride of Gifts.

A corrupt heart may have the Gift of Prayer, though not the Grace of Prayer;
yea, and be more eminent therein, than they, who have the Grace of Prayer.
They may exceed others in expressions, who yet do exceed them in affections.
And for Pride, Ostentation in Gifts, A corrupt heart may abound in duties and
performances.

2. For Affection, Credit, esteem of the World. That they may be accounted
holy men; to have a Name, they are living, when yet they are dead men.

3. For the advancement of their worldly designs. By this craft they have all
their gain. It may be this fills their shops, fills their houses, Quantas
nobis divitias.
etc. Godliness is great gain: and some make a gain of godliness.

Now there are vile wretches, who make God, Religion, holy duties, to serve
their own base ends; who make them but a stalking-horse, the better to pursue
their own game, their own gain. Like Watermen, who row one way, but look
another. They row toward Heaven in outward works, with the Oar of Religion;
but they look toward the World, their own ends, in heart. Their eyes are after
their gain. -- Who will show them any good? Their feet are going toward Zoar,
with Lots Wife; but their heart toward Sodom. They serve God with their
bodies, but Mammon with their spirits.

4. That by this means, They might procure Gods blessing on them in this life.
Oh! think they, if I do not pray, God will not bless me in my shop to day,
etc. And therefore do it, to procure Wealth.

We read the Sadduces, (who denied that there was any Angel, or Spirit, or
Resurrection; and so by consequent, all reward of any service after this life)
being thereupon demanded, why they did then keep the Commandments; they
answered. -- That it might go well with them in this life.

So there are some, whose thoughts go no higher, than that God would bless
them, God would bestow upon them these belly-blessings. As they sell God for
gain, so they serve God for gain.

With these, many other ends might be laid down, why a corrupt heart may
abound in outward performances. But thus much be said for the second.

We have two other things to do more, before we come to Application.

1. To show you, what are the grounds, that a corrupt heart may so abound in
outward performance.

2. Where the fault is. Or how it comes to pass, that a man may do thus much in
the ways of God, and yet be unsound; yet miss of Heaven at last. We will
begin with the first of these two, which is the third thing propounded.

3. What the grounds are, whence it arises, that a corrupt heart may abound in
outward Performances.

1. The first ground is, Natural Conscience, or that Inbred Light, which is in
the conscience of men by nature.

Every man has a Conscience in him, and this Conscience does acknowledge, that
there is a God, one, who is Being of Beings, Cause of Causes: and not only so,
but thereupon, that this God is to be worshipped and served by the Creature.

Though Conscience cannot discover the True God, or the True Worship; yet it
does conclude, there is a God; and that this God is to be worshipped.

Atheists in practice we have many; every Parish is full of them. Such as the
Apostle speaks of, Tit. 1.16. -- Who profess they know God, but yet in works
they deny him. But Atheists in Judgment none can be. Hence Tully the Heathen
could say. -- I have known men without King, Laws, Government, Clothes; but
none so savage, but have a God.

Many have endeavored to blow out that light, but never could. We read of
Caligula, who labored all he could to blow out this Candle, and to strengthen
his Atheism by Arguments and Reasons; yet when it thundered, he ran under a
Bed; his fears and guilty conscience telling him of some divine Power, which
he could not withstand.

Another, who labored the like; and though he had wrought out all Faith, yet
he had not wrought out all Fears. He still feared (as he would say) that
there was a God; -- And, what if there should prove to be a God, at last!

Now then, there being such light in Conscience, as to discover there is a God:
and conscience thereupon concluding, this God must be worshipped; by the help
of further light, the Light of the Word, the Light of the Works, the Light of
good Example, the Light of good Education, together with the implantation of
some common and general Principles, whereby conscience is strengthened from
above: A man may be enabled to do much in the ways of godliness, and yet his
heart continue unsound, without any spiritual Principle of Grace wrought in him.

2. A second ground is, some present distress and trouble upon the Conscience,
or upon the Bodies of men; upon the spirit or flesh of men.

1. Some present distress upon the spirit of a man. It may be Conscience is
now for present, upon the rack. God has let in a beam of light into the
conscience, by the Law, and discovered a man's sin. And with that light has let
fall a spark of his wrath due to sin, upon the conscience; which has, for
present, filled the soul of man with horrors and fears, with sad and black
thoughts and apprehensions of death and Hell. Which may put a man upon Prayers,
and Performances, upon doing much in the ways of God.

We read that Absalom sent for Joab to come to him, but he came not. He sent
again, yet he comes not. At last Absalom sets fire upon Joabs corn; and then
he came amain, but with no better heart: it is likely more unwillingly than
before: so God does often call upon men in the ministry of the Word; But men
will not come. At last God sets fire on the conscience, lets some spark of Hell
fall upon them. And then they run to Duties, to Prayers, to do something.
Though perhaps as unwillingly as before. All this does force them, but yet not
persuade them willingly to come in.

As the satisfying of conscience troubled, may be an end of the performance of
many duties: so the trouble it self may be a ground to put them upon
performance. As Peace is the end of the Plaster, so the wound is the ground of
it. As Peace is the end of undertaking of duties; so the wound is the ground
wherefore they are undertaken.

2. Outward Pressures upon the bodies of men may be another ground to prevail
with unsound hearts, to do much in outward service, Psalm. 78.34, 35, 36. --
When the Lord slew them, then they sought him, and they returned, and inquired
early after God. And they remembered that God was their Rock; and the most High
God their Redeemer. Here was much.

They return to God;] That is, in all outward appearance. They sought him, they
inquired early after him. And the ground of this was Gods hand upon them; when
the Lord slew them] says the Text.

And you see what was the frame of their spirit in all. -- Nevertheless they
did but flatter him; their hearts were not upright with him: they were unsound.

The like we read, Jer. 2.27. They gave God their backs, and not their faces;
yet in the time of their trouble, then who but God with them. -- In the time of
their trouble, then they cry, arise and save us.

This was like the Samaritans Devotion. When the Lions slew them, then they
inquired after the worship of God, when God sent Lions among them.

And many there are of their spirit. Good under the Rod. Whiles the Rod is on
their backs, the Book is in their hands; then nothing but read and pray. But no
sooner does God slacken the cords or take them off the rack, deliver them out
of their present distress and trouble, but they return again to folly.

This is just Mariners Devotion. Whilst the Storm lasts, then they cry and
pray; but no sooner is the storm blown over, but they are as vile as ever. They
had not so many Prayers before, as Oaths now.

And do we not see it thus with many? who will not own God in a Calm. Then
their hearts say -- depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
Yet in a Storm they will fly to him -- thou art our Father, our God. But this
not for Love, but for shelter.

As many a man may be glad of a place for shelter in a Storm, which they could
never brook to live in after the storm is over. So they will own God a Tower, a
place of shelter in time of trouble; but not an habitation, a place of abode,
in times of Peace. Thus you see the third thing. The grounds, that a corrupt
heart may so abound in outward Performance.

The fourth remains, which is

4. Where is the fault. Or how comes it to pass, that a man may do thus much in
the ways of God, and yet be unsound, yet miss of Heaven. Where lies the fault?

I conceive, though the work it self be faulty: (for how can a good work come
from a bad heart?) Yet the great crack lies more in the Workman, than in the
work. Duties are good, Prayer is good, Hearing good. The fault does mainly lie
in the Person that does these. Their spirits are unsound in these holy ways.

I will lay down the maim, the fault under these five or six Heads.

1. He fails, or is faulty in the latitude and extent of his Obedience. His
Obedience is a limited and stinted Obedience.

1. Either limited to some commands, which are most suitable to him. He does
not apply himself to the Obedience of all the commands of God. There are some
duties he will not do, and some corruptions he has no heart to leave.

2. Or secondly, It is limited to the flesh, to the outer part of the Command,
and does not extend it self to the Spirit, and extremities of the Command of
God.

You must know, there is an Extra, and an Intra; an Outside, and an Inside in
every Command of God: some part of it binding the Flesh, another part injoyning
the Spirit. Many keep the Letter of the Law, which yet never care for the
Spirit of the Law.

Both these you shall see in the Scribes and Pharisees.

1. They did something, yea they did much. They fasted, they prayed, they paid
Tithes of all that they had, etc. But they did not all* There were other
Commands, which they gave liberty to themselves in. They could oppress,
defraud, be unjust. And they failed in the

Second too, That their Obedience did not extend it self to the spiritualness
of any command. As you see Christ charge them, Matthew. 5.21. They did not
Murder; they did not commit Adultery; but they gave way to Unjust Anger, to
Adulterous Thoughts, Unchaste Glances, Contemplative Wickedness, Speculative
Uncleanness, etc. And so in all the rest. This is the first maim in his
Obedience.

2. He is faulty in the Manner of his Obedience. Though for the Matter of his
Obedience, he do not fail; He does Pray, Hear, do Duties which others do, yet
he is faulty in the Manner of his Obedience. He does not pray in Faith, pray
with affections. He confesses sin; but a broken spirit does not run through
the confession of sin: His heart is never touched with sin. He prays for
Grace, but his spirit is never touched with the Beauties of Grace, nor carried
after it with desires for it. He looks perhaps to the Matter, but neglects the
Manner. He looks after the substance, but neglects the Circumstances.

This is the difference between the gross Hypocrite, and the close Hypocrite.

The gross Hypocrite looks after the Circumstance, not after the Substance.
Though indeed they are not such Circumstances as these are: they are but
outward, not inward.

The close Hypocrite, he looks after the Substance, but neglects the
Circumstances. He prays, but never minds to pray in Faith.

If a man pray, and pray not fervently; if he hear, and hear not faithfully;
if he obey, and obey not willingly; if he show Mercy, and not cheerfully; if
he keep the Sabbath, and not with delight; all his services are nothing worth.

3. He is faulty in his Aims and Ends: His Ends are corrupt. His Aim is as
his own Ends, his own Profit, Gain, Pride. Ostentation. Himself is the end of
his Obedience, some way or other.

A man never wrought out of himself, must needs work to himself. And obedience
which arises from a man's self, is terminated in a man's self again. It must be
a Principle from Christ, which carries the soul to Christ. A man can go no
higher than his Principle. And therefore having Principles no higher than
himself, his Obedience must needs be terminated in himself.

As all Rivers, they run to the Sea. They came from the Sea, and therefore
return back again to the Sea; so all those duties which arise from a man's self,
must needs be finished in himself.

Such a man, he is the God himself whom he serves. He makes himself the end
of all his service: though he look as far as the end, even to Heaven in his
service.

Here then is the third thing wherein he is faulty. He makes himself the end
of all his Obedience. He has not a single Eye to the Glory of God. His
service is neither begun in God, nor wrought by God, nor finished to God.
Neither begun by his Grace, nor finished to his Glory.

4. He is faulty in this, that he rests upon what he does, and looks no
higher. He looks upon all he does as upon so many bribes for a pardon, as so
much good moneys laid out for Heaven. He weaves a web of Righteousness to
cloathe himself withal. He never looks out for another Righteousness, to be
justified by; but rests upon that which he himself has wrought. Which being
not only imperfect, but impure; a rag, and a filthy rag: he must needs
miscarry in it.

If this had been enough to have brought men to Heaven, God might have spared a
great deal of labor, Christ a great deal of blood, by giving man ability to do
duties; and then all had been done.

But there was an infinite wrath to be born; an infinite justice to be
satisfied; which none but Christ can do.

And here you see the Scribes and Pharisees failed also. They did much, but
they looked out for no other Righteousness than their own; In this they rested
for Life and Justification.

5. They make duty it self their Obedience, which should quicken their
Obedience. They rest upon the bare performance of the duty, and never look to
the end of Duty. So they rest upon the bridge, and never go over.

Duty serves an unsound spirit for Obedience. But Duty does but quicken, and
strengthen, and enable a godly man to Obedience.

6. But the sixth, and the main Crack is here. These spiritual Performances do
not arise from spiritual Principles; from an heart principled from above; from
an heart universally sanctified. Here is the Bane of all. Here are new works,
but an old heart. New Practices; but a man's old Principles.

You see this, Isa. 1.10. to 16. But I will now instance in the fifteenth only.
-- When you spread forth your hands to Heaven, I will hide my eyes; and when
you make many Prayers; when you abound in duty, adding Prayer to Prayer (as the
Word is) -- I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood. They were
unregenerate, unsanctified. They were new practices, but the old heart still.

The like you see of the Scribes and Pharisees. They fasted, prayed, did much
in the ways of God. But their hearts were not changed, they were unregenerate
still, were not principled from above.

This you see plain, Joh. 3. where Nicodemus, one of the chief of the Pharisees
knew not yet what Regeneration meant. Christ tells him of Regeneration; and he
replies, How is it possible that a man should be born again, when he is old?
Can he enter into his Mothers womb again? By which you see, though he did all
those things reported of the Pharisees, as Fasting, Praying, Tithing, etc. yet
^^s he a stranger to this great work of Regeneration, change of Nature; he
knew not what it meant.

So that you see, here is the great fault of all. A man walks in new Practices
with an old Heart, an Heart never truly, thoroughly, spiritually changed.

There is a fourefold Change.

1. A change from good to evil. This is a fearful change. 2. A change from
evil to good. This is a blessed change. 3. A change from evil to evil; from one
to another. 4. A change from some evil, to some good.
I will express it in these four words. There is 1. A Moral Change. 2. A
Partial Change. 3. A Formal Change. 4. A Spiritual Change.


1. There is a mere Moral Change. When a man changes from sinful notorious
ways, to Morality, Temperance, Justice, Equity, Patience, Contentation. And
sticks there, and goes no further. And here thousands, who lie in the bosom of
the Church, stick and perish.

2. There is a Partial Change; wherein men leave some particular sins, and
practice some particular duties. This is a particular Conversion. When men were
Drunkards, Swearers, unclean persons, etc. And now are persuaded to leave these
particular sins, and betake themselves to some general and common duties of a
Christian.

And there are many men, who are mended thus. They will hear a Sermon, and do
some outward duties, But they are not new made. And this is but like the
putting of a new piece of cloth into an old garment; the rent will be made
worse. Christ sets this down in the parable. The unclean spirit is cast out for
a time, but afterward returns with seven spirits worse than himself, and so
his last end proves worse than his beginning, Mat. 12.43, etc.

3. There is a Formal Change, when men, in outward appearance do seem to walk
in all duties of holiness, and to forbear the commission of any gross sin. And
yet never had their hearts wrought upon. All this while it is but their
practices, not their Principles that are truly changed. And these are the men
that do so much.

Of these St. Paul speaks, 2 Timothy 3.5. Having a form of godliness, yet denying
the Power: From such turn away. By which phrase, I told you, was implied, that
though an Hypocrite has nothing in him, which is essential to a Christian, as
a Christian; yet may he be the complete Resemblance of a Christian, in all
those things which are not essential to him. He may be the complete picture
of a godly man, from top, to toe; in every member, every limb, every duty, for
the externals of it.

4. There is a Spiritual Change; wherein the frame and constitution of the
inward man is changed; and all is made new.

1. Not new, for substance of soul and body.

2. Not new, for faculties of soul and body.

As new understanding, new will, etc. Here a man's new Practices flow from new
Principles. Here are not only new Ways, but here is a new Heart. He has a
new Life in him, a new Spirit in him, by which he is moved, And the want of
this is the great Crack, the great Fault, the Ground, why a man may do much in
the ways of God, and yet miscarry at last.

But there will be one great Objection, which seems to throw down all this.
The Objection is this.

Object. Nature cannot act, ultra Sphaeram, above it self. Nature cannot go any
further than Nature. As we say of the Water. Quantum descendit, tantum
ascendit. Water can rise no higher than it falls. So may it be said of Nature:
Nature cannot act above Nature: cannot act above her Principle.

But to do these things is above the power of Nature. Therefore, he who does
these duties, is above a state of Nature.

Answ. For answer of this. We say it is true in the Main. A man that has no
more than mere Nature in him, cannot act above mere Nature.

But Nature may be strengthened from above. There may be higher Principles
set in Nature, which may enable a man to go higher than common Nature, though
not yet above one in state of Nature.

A man may be enabled to act above Nature: yet the Principle is not so high,
as to enable a man to act above a man in the State of Nature.

For the better clearing of this. We may consider Nature in diverse forms or
ranks.

1. There is mere Nature; with those relics (as some say) But rather (I say)
restored Principles, which God gave to man, after he had lost all; that he
might be a Man, not a Devil. For when by sin, we had lost all, if God had
not, out of pity to mankind, restored something, we should have been as bad
as Devils in the world; one devour, murder, commit all outrage upon another.
Now in this state, something may be done, not much.

2. There is nature civilized, and moralized. Nature refined by moral
Principles, which whether they be in nature before, and so but husbanded and
improved; or whether they were some common gifts of the Spirit, we will not
now dispute, but conclude this latter.

Now by these a man may be enabled to do above the common sort of men, he
having higher Principles than mere nature fallen, and therefore is able to do
more, in all the works of morality, works of Justice, Righteousness, Charity,
etc.

This you see in the Heathens, who far excelled the common sort of men; their
Principles being far higher.

3. There is Nature sublimated, and raised yet higher by implantation of higher
Principles than these are, by the help of which, a man may be enabled to do
above the purest natures of the Heathens; and yet but Nature.

The knowledge of God, of Christ, of Sin, of Grace, Heaven, Hell, together with
the implantation of some general Principles, common gifts and graces of the
Spirit may so sublimate a man, that by the help of these, a man may not only
be wrought up to do more than mere Nature fallen, but more than Nature
strengthened with moral Principles, is able to do.

You see this in Judas, Demas, Herod, etc. whose actions were above mere
Nature, as coming from higher Principles; but yet not above men in the state
of Nature.

This work upon men, though not so much as spiritual; yet it is more than mere
Moral. Though he have not so high a Principle as a spiritual man, yet is his
Principle higher than a mere moral man's. And by the help of that common
Illumination, general workings of the Spirit, broken workings of humiliation,
he may be enabled to pray, hear, read, confer, fast, profess, and what not,
for all outward? and yet want the Sanctifying Spirit of Christ.

There may be a supernatural work of the Spirit, upon some men, whereby nature
may be strengthened from above; and yet they may want the saving work of the
Spirit.

You see then distinguished, Heb. 6.4. There were some, who were enlightened,
and had tasted of the Heavenly gift. This was a Supernatural work: but yet this
was not a Saving work, verse. 9. -- I am persuaded better things of you, and
such as accompany salvation, though I thus speak.

Thus you see the Objection cleared. And the fourth thing laid open (viz.)
Where the fault is, that a man may do thus much, and yet be unsound. I add
but thus much to it more.

1. He is a man, who was never humbled for sins. And this is a sure Rule. The
heart never broken, was yet never sound.

2. He is a man, that was never truly cast out of himself; and therefore can
go no higher than himself, in all he does.

3. He is a man, was never fully changed; he walks in new ways, with an old
heart.

4. He is a man, who is carried upon holy works with a slavish spirit. He
would sin, but dares not. He does Duty, but has no mind to do it.

What the Apostle says of himself -- the good I would do, I do not; and the
evil I would not do, that do I: He, on the contrary, must say, if he speak
truth. -- The good I would not do, I do; and the evil I would do, that I do
not, I dare not.

He is a man, who has no principle of spiritual life in him; He is moved,
but does not move; he is carried about with weights, as a Clock or Watch; he
has no inward Principle of life to move him.

A Clock you know does move (or rather is moved) but it is not from any
Principle of Life. It is the weights which carry it about. Take off them, and
the Clock stands still: so here. They are moved, but not by any Principle of
Life within. There are two great weights which carry him about.

1. Fear of Hell. 2. A Hope of Heaven. Which weights if you take off, then he
stands still.
Thus I have at last done with the Doctrinal part. That it is possible for a
man to do much in the ways of God, and yet have an unsound spirit, and fall
short of Heaven at last.

I come now to Application.

1. Use.
If a man may do thus much, and yet fall short of Heaven. What then shall
become of them, who do nothing? If a man may pray and perish; hear, and go to
Hell; do duty, and be damned; then what shall become of them, who swear, and
blaspheme?

I know it is the ordinary vaunt of carnal and unregenerate men, who have no
taste nor savor of the things of God. They will say,

I thank God, though I pray not so many Prayers, nor hear so many Sermons, as
others do; yet my heart is as sincere as the best of them all.

Alas! poor man! Though it be possible for a man to do all this, and yet not
be sincere; yet it is impossible a man should be sincere, if he do them not.
These things may be done without sincerity; but sincerity cannot be without
these.

Sincerity lies in laboring, not in loitering; in working, not in lazying.
Where the heart is sincere, it will put a man upon working, and will make a man
to work with all his strength, to abound in the work of the Lord; to eye the
Manner, as well as the Matter; the Circumstance, as well as the Substance. It
will put a man upon Prayer, and make a man pray fervently, faithfully, humbly.
It will put a man upon hearing. etc.

And therefore thou art mistaken. Though a man may do these duties, and not be
sincere; yet thou can not be sincere, if thou do them not. Though he may
do these things and perish, yet thou must pray, hear, do duty: Otherwise thou
shall perish. These things are Necessary.

1. Necessitate Praecepti; God has commanded them. 2. Necessitate Medii; they
are the way to life.
You must not look to come to the end, if you do not walk in the way.

Object. But you will say, This discourageth us. If a man may do thus much; and
yet fall short of Heaven; then it is as good to sit still, and do nothing.

Ans. I must tell you; this is a sign of a low spirit, to argue after this
manner. We should argue thus. -- Because I may do all this, and yet not be
sincere: Therefore I will labor to be sincere in the doing of them. These
things must be done, though all that did them fell short of Heaven. God
commands these things to be done, and his will must stand out against all. If
all that hear, read, pray, etc. do fall short of Heaven, yet thou must hear,
read, pray, upon account of obedience to God.

The fault, it lies in the Persons, not in the Duties; in the Workmen, not in
the Work. The fault is not in the Matter, but in the Men, and the Manner of
performance. And man's fault must not cause us to neglect our duty.

We have an expression, Micah 1.7. -- Is the Spirit of the Lord streightened?
do not my words do good to them, who walk uprightly? As if the Prophet had said
-- The fault is not in the Word, but in you, who are the hearers of it. You
hear, and hear; and yet get no good by hearing. And will you charge God with
that? will you blame the Word? Others get good; and Gods Spirit is not
straightened to you more than to others. You would find good as well as others,
if you came with honest hearts. -- Do not my words do good to them, who walk
uprightly?

And what we say of this, we say of other Ordinances. The fault is not in
Prayer, nor in Fasting: but it is in you. You walk with corrupt hearts in Gods
ways: And therefore you get no good by them.

You have a sad place, but full for this purpose, Hos. 14. verse last, the last
words of the book; he shuts up the Prophesy with it. -- Whosoever is wise shall
know these things; for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk
in them; but the transgressors shall fall therein. A good heart shall stand,
and walk in holy ways: but a bad heart, a corrupt heart, shall fall and perish
in them. An unsound spirit shall fall in the ways of duty, in the ways of
prayer, in the ways of profession.

2. Use.
If it be possible for a man to do much in the ways of God, and yet be
unsound, yet miss of Heaven: Then this may discover to us the sandiness and
unsafeness of these bottomes, to rest a man's soul upon.

How many thousands, who have no better evidences for Heaven, than the bare
performance of duties? They come to Church; they hear the Word; they pray, etc.
And therefore they hope all is well.

My Brethren, It is true, If the bare performance of duties were sufficient
evidences to conclude our good condition: then whoever did abound most in these
things: they had the surest bottomes to rest upon.

But (alas!) You see it is possible for a man to abound in duty, and yet his
heart be unsound. And therefore the doing of these things will not be
sufficient to evidence to your selves, that your condition is good.

If these Anchors should ever hold, you need not to beat out any better Anchors
for your souls. But seeing these do not hold out ever, you had need seek out
for better. Else you may miscarry at last.

These may hold in a Calm, when they are put to no stress; but will be sure to
break in a storm. You see the house built upon the Sand, it stood well enough,
and the structure was fair, the sandiness of the foundation was not discovered,
whiles there was a Calm. But (says Christ) When the Rain fell, and the Winds
blew, and the Waves did beat, when the Storm arose, then was the sandiness of
the foundation discovered -- the house fell, for it was built upon the Sand.

So here. While you have a Calm, while you are in health, enjoy peace, etc.
These bottomes seem firm enough; you do not discover the sandiness of these
foundations. But a Storm does arise, when you come upon your sick-beds, when
you come to the day of death, then you shall see the unsoundness of your
bottomes. All your buildings, your fair structures, all your works and walkings
upon this foundation will be surely blown down; they will never abide the
trial.

And therefore let me stir you up; you, who are resolved for God; you, who,
are bound for Heaven, that you would get better evidences, than the bare and
naked performance of duties, will afford you. All which may be done, and thou
sink into Hell at the last. Nay, get better evidences than duty it self
performed at the best, is able to afford unto you.

1. Because evidences of this kind are obscure, full of ambiguity, full of
intricate disputes and controversies. There will be Objection upon Objection;
and controversy upon controversy will arise. And all must be cleared, and all
Objections answered, before ever we can conclude our estates by them.

I say, Evidences of this kind, they must be put in suit, and pass a long
scrutiny and trial, where there must be Evidences upon Evidences, and no end
of them, before ever we can have any comfort in them.

You will find, that the clearing of the truth of these Evidences will be as
difficult, if not more, than the compassing of the Evidences themselves.

2. We are to seek out for better Evidences than duty performed at the best
can afford us, because these kind of Evidences are not only obscure, full of
ambiguity, and so uncertain: But because these kind of Evidences, they are
unconstant, they are instable, they may appear to day, and vanish to morrow.

You know, my Brethren, that a man is not always in the same temper of spirit:
his spirit is subject to varying and alteration, in the performance of duties.
And therefore though a man may fetch an Evidence out of the Court of duty, at
this time, yet it may be at another time, the Court will not afford it. A man
may be cleared to day by duty, and condemned to morrow: This day he may
thence have an evidence, and he may be cast in the same Court to morrow. Our
comforts fetched hence are liable to change: They vary, as we vary; change as
we change.

This is certain, That the Peace which is wrought out of our selves, is again
lost by our selves. And the comfort gotten by duty at one time, is lost by duty
at another time. Well then, I call you out, to seek out for better evidences,
Such as will afford you more fullness of peace, and will minister to you more
stability of comfort, than these can do.

Fetch your Evidences from your Justification, your interest in Christ, in the
Covenant. You will find an emptiness in all; only a fullness here. Draw your
waters of comfort from the highest springs, the springs of Justification. These
are 1. The clearest. 2. The purest. 3. The most satisfying. 4. The most
constant Evidences.


1. These are the clearest Evidences. They are fetched from the Spring. Other
waters are muddy and disturbed: but Spring-waters are clear. So Evidences taken
from other things often run muddy, and are disturbed: but those from
Justification are the cleanest, and run the clearest.

Though these kind of Evidences are hardest to clear: It will cost a man
something before he reach to these Evidences, before he can make out these
Evidences to himself: yet they are the most perspicuous, being cleared.

The Testimony of blood is the hardest and darkest Testimony to make out: but
none is more clear than that, when once you have made it out to your souls. So
that it is worth all your labor and pains you take in the clearing of it.

Other Evidences are liable to dispute. But what can Satan dispute against
this? Does he say, Thou art a sinner? Yea, but may thou say, God justifies
sinners, he justifies the ungodly. Though sin has weakened the Law, and made
that unable to do us good: yet it has not weakened Christ, and Free Grace; nor
should it weaken our Faith, if now we be returning sinners.

If Sin it self were a just Obstacle, then there could never be any, who could
be Justified, or fetch comfort from their Justification: because all were
sinners. I am a sinner, so was Abraham, the Father of the Faithful: so the best
of Gods worthies.

Does he say, our sins are great? Yet we may say; they are not greater than
God can pardon. They are not greater than 1. The Mercy of God, to pardon them,
or 2. The Righteousness of Christ, to cover them.


1. For the Mercy of God; The Apostle tells us, there was more than enough to
pardon him, who was the greatest of sinners, 1 Timothy 1.13, 14, 15, 16. -- The
Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant. The word in the Original is (...).
Did superabound; was more than enough; more than might serve the turn for him,
who was the greatest of sinners.

2. And for the Righteousness of Christ, it is said to be an everlasting
Righteousness: more than eternity of sinning is able to expend, and draw dry.
It is a Righteousness, which as it cannot be overclasped by any Faith; So can
it not be posed, non-plust by any sin.

You see, Romans 1.17. It is a Righteousness revealed from Faith, to Faith. The
more Faith, not the less, but the more Righteousness is discovered. And as it
cannot be over-clasped by any Faith; so it cannot be exceeded by any sin.

Thus you see Evidences from our Justification, they are the clearest
Evidences; the freest from disputes: and if any Objections do arise, they may
be the more quickly laid.

But now it is not so with other kind of Evidences. If a man take an Evidence
from Duty, there will be controversies: Objection upon Objection will arise:
and there must be Evidence upon that Evidence, before ever a man can make out
the truth of them. Nay, though Evidences be taken from Graces themselves, yet
you will scarce find a bottom without much search.

Suppose a man come to bring in his Love to Christ for an Evidence; yet this is
liable to dispute. You know, there is a False-Love, as well as a True, a
counterfeit, as well as a sound. And therefore this must be examined by the
Nature of your Love, the workings of your Love toward Christ; the expressions
of your Love in all the ways of Obedience.

And I must tell you of great latitude and extent in this trial. There will be
long debates, before you come to the utmost. And the like I may say of any
Grace besides. Therefore these from Justification are the clearest Evidences
from disputes and controversies.

2. These are the purest Evidences. Spring-waters are the purest waters: so
these Evidences fetched from the Spring; scil. from your Justification, and
interest in Christ; these are the purest. I say, these kind of Evidences are
the purest, and most unmixed Evidences.

You shall see, all other kind of Evidences, they are not so pure; they have
mixtures in them.

1. Are they taken from Prayer? yea, and Prayer at the best? yet these are not
pure; they have mixtures in them. Our best Duties are mingled with
imperfections. They have a tang and taste of the flesh in them.

You know, there is much deadness with our chiefest Life, much formality in our
best Power; much coldness with our heats: much of the flesh in all the
employments of the spirit.

2. Or are they taken from hearing? and that at the best? your own hearts can
tell; There is much mixture in that Duty. Oh! what abundance of the Week is in
the Sabbath! how much of the Shop in the Church? what distractions, in your
best attentions? what carnal hearts, in your spiritual employments? what Pride?
what Prejudice? what Infidelity? what Dullness does attend all your hearing?

3. Nay yet further. Are your evidences taken from Graces themselves? yet these
are not pure. There is much mixture in them* Our Graces themselves are full of
Imperfections. You know, there is much blindeness with your Light; much enmity
with your Love; much hardness of heart with your mourning for sin, yea, and
much mud, much worldly sorrow, in your purest tears; much Pride with your
humility; much murmuring with your patience; As we might show at large, if
need were.

But now these Evidences which are taken from our Justification, they are pure,
without mixture. Though the Faith which justifies us is imperfect, yet the
Grace which justifies us is perfect.

I say, these Evidences are pure, without mixture, because they are such, as
have nothing of our own in them: had they any thing of ours, they would be
imperfect and impure: but having nothing of ours, but all Christ's, they are
altogether perfect and pure. Christ is all fair, all perfect, all pure.

Our sanctifying Righteousness is stained, imperfect, impure; but our
justifying Righteousness is pure and perfect. If there were any stain or any
imperfection in that, it could not justify, it could not save us; we should
be undone for ever. But that is pure, that is perfect, and we in it. As the
Apostle says, Col. 2.10. -- In him we are complete. Complete in him, though
imperfect in our selves.

3. These are the most satisfying Evidences. Other Evidences admit of much
questionings. Though taken from Duties, yea Graces themselves; yet they admit
of long disputes, sharp incounters and assaults. And, when all is done, yet
they bring not such fullness of satisfaction to the soul. But now Evidences
taken from our Justification, these are soul satisfying Evidences, because the
satisfaction of Christ is in them. These Evidences are not fetched from any
thing in us, or any thing done by us; but from the satisfaction which Christ
himself has wrought for us. And if there be any dispute against this, then
may we much more dispute against the other.

If Christ be not a complete Satisfier of Gods Wrath and Justice for our sins,
then these Evidences from the Satisfaction of Christ would do me no good. As
the Apostle said of the Resurrection of Christ, which was the declaration of
that full satisfaction Christ had wrought. -- If Christ be not risen; then our
faith is in vain; our hope in vain: so here: -- If Christ have not fully
satisfied Gods Justice; if he has not paid all the Debt; answered all bills of
Inditements against me; then my Faith is in vain; then these Evidences can do
my soul no good. But if Christ has fully satisfied Gods Justice; then am I
sure; for this satisfaction is mine.

So that you see, these are such Evidences, as do not only quiet, but satisfy
conscience to the full. Such as silence all doubts; answer all scruples and
objections, that do arise.

Other Evidences; they are not so full, not so satisfactory. They may afford a
man some obvious Refreshment, for a time, to hold up the head from sinking; but
they bring not fullness of satisfaction into the soul.

But now this does; because you see it is taken from such things wherein God
himself is satisfied; and therefore no reason but we should be satisfied. If
the Creditor say enough, shall not the Debtor be satisfied?

4. These are the most constant Evidences. Floods and Rivers may fail, but
Springs are constant. Such Evidences as are taken from any thing within us, or
any thing done by us, may (at least, as to evidence) fail us.

But such Evidences as are taken from without us, as, etc.

These are permanent and constant. In the greatest drought here will be Water
enough, Jer. 17.7, 8. -- Blessed is the man that trusts in the Lord, and
whose hope the Lord is; for he shall be as a Tree planted by the Rivers of
Waters, and that spreads out her roots, and shall not see when heat comes;
but her leaf shall be green, and shall not be careful in the year of drought,
neither shall cease from yielding fruit.

Other Evidences are unconstant; they may be clear to day, and be clouded to
morrow: the heart is not ever in the same frame. But now these are permanent,
abiding Evidences: they are as sure as the Oaths, Promise, Covenant of God,
though not ever to sense, yet they are ever sure to Faith, though not ever to
apprehension, yet ever in truth. We may ever conclude them, though we cannot
ever clear them. Conclude them we may by Faith, though we cannot clear them
to sense.

I might enlarge my self, and go yet further to tell you these are the
sweetest, the most refreshing and comforting evidences.

But to conclude this use. If ever you would have strong consolation, if ever
you would have a full and settled peace and comfort, then hence draw your
Evidences, fetch your Evidences from Justification.

I know, that which keeps you upon the racks of fears, that which continues you
in doubts and jealousies, is this. You take your Evidences too low, either from
something in you, or something done by you, and so you are forced to answer a
multitude of Objections and reasons, before ever you can find a bottom to
rest upon.

That which does raise up new doubts and objections in your spirits, and which
causes a fresh return of fears upon you, is because you do not take your
Evidences high enough.

You take them from Duties, Prayers, Dispositions, present Affections. And so
upon every failing you are cast, and all thrown down again, new fears arise, as
if you never had any Evidence.

Were an Evidence sealed in the higher Court, what Court shall dispute against
it, what can overthrow it?

But now if all this will not persuade you to fetch your Evidences higher, but
that you will still lie by these waters for comfort, you will still fetch your
Comforts and Evidences from Duties, yet let me thus far persuade with you,
that you would labor to clear the sincerity of your heart in these duties.
Otherwise all this something will be nothing to you; no bottom of Comfort.

They are but uncertain bottomes at the best, but without sincerity to
accompany them they will be no bottomes, an house not built on the Sand, but
built in the Air, no foundation.

And this is the next use we will come unto.

3. Use
If it be possible for a man to do thus much, and yet be unsound; Then what
care ought there to be to clear the soundness of our spirits in our
performances.

You pray, you hear, you do much; but ask the question to your selves. Is my
heart sound in all these performances? is it sound in prayer? in hearing? if
not, all this something is nothing.

If you break the string that goes through a set of Beads, they all fall to the
ground. Sincerity is the string which goes through all our Prayers, our Duties
and Graces; if that be broken, all is broken.

Sincerity is the Evidence of all our Evidences taken from below.

It is that which makes every duty glorious, every breathing of the spirit
sweet, every groan weighty, every drop of tears a pearl, and precious in Gods
esteem.

Sincerity is all in all. It is all, in all our Prayers; all, in all our tears;
all, in all our services. It is all to God; that which God accounts all.
Sincerity is Gospel perfection. And perfection is all.

Let us then examine our hearts; you that abound most in all outward
performances, clear the soundness and sincerity of your hearts in them.

1. Clear the sincerity of your hearts in your obedience in general.

2. Clear the sincerity of your hearts, in your performances in particular.

We shall now insist upon the last first, And that is, Clear the sincerity of
your hearts in your performances in particular.

We will instance in these three especially which we single out.

First in your Hearing. Secondly in your Praying. Thirdly in your Mourning for
sin.
1. Clear the sincerity of your hearts in hearing the Word.

We will give you these characters of a sincere heart in hearing the Word.

1. A sincere heart desires sincere preaching. Such preaching wherein his heart
is ripped up; his corruptions discovered; the most quickening and
soul-searching ministry; such a ministry as does most unravel his heart, and
rip up his soul.

You see this, 1 Pet. 2.2. As new born babes desire the sincere milk of the
Word, the preaching of the Word, and the sincere preaching of the Word, not the
Word as it is sophisticated, poisoned, adulterated by man's invention. As the
Apostles phrase is, but the Word as it comes sincerely from the Fountain.

Such a man he desires killing, as well as comforting truths, searching, as
well as healing truths; breaking, as well as binding. And indeed, he desires
no comforting, but in killing; no comforting of his soul, but in killing of his
sins; no healing, but in searching; no binding, but in breaking.

An unsound heart, if he desire to hear, yet it should be such as would
preach placentia, speak peace, daube with untempered Mortar.

And if a Minister do once preach to the quick. If he once enter upon the
discovery of them, their hearts rise against the truth; they rebel against the
Word; and such are no Ministers for them. They will find out one that they can
live in sin, and yet live in peace under his Ministry.

We read in the 42. of Jer. read it throughout, (the Chapter is worth your
taking notice of.) Let me entreat you to read it when you come home, you shall
see there the depth of a self-deceiving spirit.

You shall read there, the Children of Israel desired Jeremy to inquire of the
Lord what they should do, and they would assuredly do it; but their hearts
deceived them. You see there that they thought Jeremy would have brought them
an answer from God agreeable to their own spirits.

They did not think that their will must have come up to Gods will, but that
Gods will would have come down to their will.

Well, Jeremy goes to God, and he brings them a message from God which was
clean cross to their lusts. And then the venom of their spirits which before
lay hid, appeared, they brake out into open rebellion against the Word of the
Lord, and spoke plain. We will not hear the Word of the Lord which thou have
told us.

So it is with many unsound spirits, self-deceiving spirits; before a Minister
come into a Parish. Oh then say they! let us have a good Minister, one that may
do our souls good, one that may bring a message to us from the Lord, discover
to us Gods will. And few there are but do thus far agree; but if once a
Minister rip up their sins, search their wounds, that they may be healed of
them: if once he come to discover their corruptions, and endeavor to take
them off their unsound bottomes; whereon if they live and dye, they will
perish. Then they fly out against the light, and him that holds it forth to
them. Away with such a man from the earth. We will not hear the Word of the
Lord spoken.

Whereas a sincere heart does side with the Word, with light, to fight against
and destroy his corruptions.

These men they side with their corruptions and lusts, to fight against the
truth, to blow out the light, and oppose the preaching of the Word.

A sincere heart does hold up the Law against his lust. Let my lusts perish,
rather than thy Law be destroyed. But a corrupt heart does hold up his lust
against the Law. And says in his heart, Let the Law rather than my lust be
destroyed.

There is not one corruption which thou keep with love and liking, but thou
wishest in thy heart, that there were no such Law against it. The Drunkard
wishes there were no such Law against his Drunkenness. The unclean person
would be glad there were no Law against his uncleanness, rather part with so
much of Gods Nature, which the Law is a beam of, than part with his lust.

Hence it is truly said, peccatum est Dei Cidium; sin is Gods slaughter,
because sin strikes against the very being of God; the purity and holiness of
God.

He that would not be as God is, would he glad if God were as he is. That
is a certain rule, that he that will favor himself in any corruption, would
be glad if God would favor him too. That there were no Law against it, or
that there were a Law to countenance it, or no Law to punish it. That God were
not against it, that God were of his mind, or that there were no God, or no God
to punish it, etc.

2. A sincere heart in hearing the Word* 1. Is willing to receive the truth of
God. 2. Is willing to receive every truth of God. 3. Is willing to receive it
as the truth of God.


1. He receives the truth not into his head only, his understanding to know
it, but into his heart, his affections to love it.

He does not imprison it in the head, but lets it go down into the heart. And
the whole soul is made the residence and place of truth. Lord how I love thy
Law contrary hereto is that, 2 These. 2.10.

2. He is willing to receive every truth: Speak Lord, for thy Servant hears.
He looks upon every word of God as good, every truth of God, as coming in the
image of God, and coming with the authority of God, and there is ready
entertainment for all; as well those which make against him, as those which
make for him; though a truth appear never so formidable that the receiving may
cost a man death.

2. He is willing to receive truth, as the truth; that is, in the Power,
Majesty and Authority of Truth, And sets it up as King in his spirit. To which
he desires to yield subjection and obedience in all.

He lets it come in, in its inlightening, in its convincing power; in its
humbling and awakening power, as well as in its quickening and comforting power.

Every truth shall be received as the truth of God.

But now an unsound spirit

He is not willing to receive the truth; some truth he dare not own, least
they should disturb him in a way of sin. As the Apostle, 2 Pet. 3.5. Of this
they are willingly ignorant; they have no desire to know this. They desire to
shut out the light, that their corruptions may not be disquieted, Mat. 13.15.
They wink with their eyes, that they might not understand.

2. They receive not every Truth. It may be such as are notional they will, or
such as may stand with their lusts and present advantages; not such as are
practical, and cross them in their corrupt ends and practices.

They look upon some truths, as an ignis fatuus, that if they should entertain
them, and follow them, they would lead them into danger.

It was the speech of a King of France, that he would lanch no further into
the deep, than he might come safely to shore. That is, he would follow Truth
no further, than he may preserve himself and his own. If those be hazarded,
he will forsake the Truth.

3. They receive it not as Truth.

1. Not for it self. 2. Not to be King over them.

1. Not for it self, but for other private and personal respects. Either for
their gain, their advantage, or for fear and danger, or out of respects to the
greatness, or quality of the persons, who do entertain a Truth.

Whereas a godly man does love the person for the Truths sake. As St. John
writing to the Elect Lady, whom he said he loved for the Truths sake, 2 John
1.2.

They that love the Truth for the persons sake, may say they love the Truth for
the Ladies sake. The one the person for the Truths sake, the other the truth
for the persons sake.

So you see they receive it not as Truth for it self.

2. They receive it not as Truth to be Lord and King over them. To which they
yield obedience and subjection in all things.

Many men would govern Truth, but they will not suffer Truth to govern them.
They would keep Truth, though but in prison, for all their keeping is but
imprisoning, but they will not suffer Truth to keep them, though the Truth
would make them free. Corrupt spirits they receive Truth as a Servant, not as a
King. And before they receive it, they will ask what it can do for them; what
service, what advantage can it bring them? If none, Truth shall not be
entertained of them.

3. A sincere heart in hearing the Word, is an honest heart: and there is the
sum of all.

This Christ expresses in the Parable of the Sower and the Seed, Luke 8.15.
the sincere spirit received the Word with an honest and good heart.

Now the honesty of a man's spirit in hearing, or an honest heart in hearing, is
such as

1. Hears the Word, as Gods Word, be the instrument never so weak and
despicable, yet it shall prevail with an honest heart, because it is Gods Word.
You have an expression in Isa. 11.6. A little Child shall lead him.

Whoever comes with a message from God, whoever brings a word, he shall
prevail and persuade with him.

An honest servant will take notice of his Masters mind, though a Child be the
messenger; he looks not on the person that brings it, but on the message
brought. So though the person be never so weak, if he bring a word from God,
an honest heart will vail to it.

2. An honest heart sides with the Word of God against himself, he takes part
with a truth against himself.

Whereas an unsound heart sides with his corruption against the Word, fights
against that which fights against it; but an honest heart sides with the Word
against his corruption.

3. An honest heart desires to profit by the Word, 1 Pet. 2.2. As new born
Babes desire the sincere Milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby. He is a
man that is resolved to practice whatever God reveals. He has no exceptions
or reservations to himself, but is bent to practice every Truth God reveals to
him. He asks the way to Sion with his face thitherward, as one resolved to
go the way that God shall reveal.

This was that which Paul said, Lord, what will thou have me to do? They were
not verba expostulantis, but verba submittentis. He was not only desirous to
know, but resolved to do whatever God did reveal to him.

An honest heart desires every Truth to be made his own. And that there may
be Principles bred in the spirit suitable to the Truths revealed to him. He
is desirous that every degree of illumination may be a further degree of
sanctification. That his heart may be transformed into the nature of truths
revealed.

It does not content him to have truths in the head, and a lie in the heart:
Truth in the head, and error in the spirit: Light in the head, and darkness in
the heart, but he desires the whole man may be digested into the nature of
truths. Truth formed in his soul.

4. An honest heart, he hears the word with reflection. As in reading the
word, he reads himself with it. So in hearing the word, he does peruse
himself with it. He hears with reflection, he hears with application,
charging and clearing his heart, according to the evidence which conscience
gives in upon hearing of the Word.

2. Clear the sincerity of your hearts in matter of praying. I told you in the
beginning that it was possible for a man to pray, nay and make many prayers, to
abound in praying; he may pray in public, pray in private, pray in the
Church, and pray in his closet, he may multiply to pray, as the word
imports, Isa. 1.15. And yet his heart be unsound. And therefore, you, who do
abound much in prayer, labor to clear the sincerity of your hearts in this
duty.

We will give you these Characters of an heart sincere in Prayer.

1. Character.
Where the heart is sincere in Prayer, there is a doing of the duty with all
our strength. There will be a laying out of all the strength and powers within
us. The strength of our Judgment, the strength of our will, and our
affections; the strength of the whole soul in the work. Prayer when sincere, is
a wrestling work. Jacob wrestled with God; that is, he wept and prayed, Hos.
12.4. Prayer is the souls contention, the souls struggling with God.

It is a sweating work. It is the sweat and blood of the soul. A sincere heart
lays out its strength in prayer.

Though a man's strength be but weakness, yet if a man's strength be in the
work, it is sufficient to evidence a man's sincerity. Indeed if a man had a Male
in his flock, and should offer to the Lord a female. If ^^ee had a better, and
should give God a worse. If he had strength, and yet served the Lord with
weakness; this would declare the heart to be unsound.

But when a man's strength is in the work, though that strength be but
weakness, yet it will evidence the sincerity of the heart. And there is no
reason that you should look upon those Prayers as cast, as lost Prayers, where
your strength is in them.

When thou have been with God, and performed a duty, although but weakly, many
imperfections in it, much unbeleef, much hardness, much deadness and coldness;
yet if your strength have been in the duty, you may rise up without confusion
and shame, upon this ground, your strength has been in it, your heart does not
condemn you, you are able to clear this to your spirit; your strength has been
in the work.

But now such are here condemned, and cast, who have a Male in their flock, and
offer to the Lord a Female. God curses such. Cursed, etc. Mal. 1.14. When you
have strength, and serve God with weakness; when you will turn off God with
your cold, your lazy, sleepy, and formal devotions, and will not take any pains
with your own hearts in these holy works. This discovers your spirits to be
unsound, and false to God.

2. Character.
Where the heart is sincere in Prayer, there is no rest or content to the soul,
till the heart be wrought into the work.

A sincere heart in Prayer, is an heart-sincerity in Prayer, not a tongue in
Prayer, not an head in Prayer, but an heart in Prayer.

Prayer is not lip-work, or head work, but heart work. And where the heart is
sincere, he is not content till the heart be in the work. He is not content
to be down on his knees, if his heart be not up. To have an hand in the work;
if his heart be not also in it.

A sincere heart labors to get his heart into the work. He prays in prayer,
Jam. 5.17. There is an affective collation with the duty. If he confesses
sins, he desires to get affections suitable to the confession of sin. An heart
wounded and broken under the sight and sense of sin.

If he prays for pardon, he labors to get an heart apprehensive of the
want, and also of the worth of mercy; and seeks a mercy, as a condemned man a
pardon.

If he pray for Grace, or the subduing of lusts, still he labors to get an
heart suitable to the things he wants, and that which he does desire.

It was the speech of Bradford, that he would never leave a duty till he had
brought his heart into the frame of the duty. He would not leave confession of
sin, till his heart was broken for sin. He would not leave petitioning for
Grace, till his heart was quickened in desire. He would not leave gratulation,
till his heart was enlarged with the sense of the mercies he enjoyed, and
quickened in the return of praise.

But now an unsound heart, if he can but post over a duty. If but say his
prayers, though he have never labored to get his heart into them, yet he is
well enough.

This is to draw near with our lips, when yet our hearts are far from God, This
is to offer God a bulk and carcass of duty, without the life and spirit of
duty, and so it is abominable to God.

A body without a soul stinks; so here, your Confessions of sins, are
Commissions of sins, Iterations of sins, when your hearts are not sensible and
affected with sins you confess. He that remembers sin with delight, does
commit the sin again.

He that remembers sin without sorrow, does but revive his former guilt, he
removes it not; A man may displease a man as much with the Confession of a
fault, as in the Commission of the fault.

If a man had offended you, and should come in a slight way to confess his
fault, you would be more offended at him for his confession, than for his fault.

So when you shall come before God and confess your sins, without any
compunction for your sins, without any sense of sin, or sorrow for it, you do
aggravate your sins, and increase guilt, instead of removing guilt from your
souls.

An hard heart, and a dry eye in the confession of sin, is an aggravation of
your sins.

3. Character.
An heart sincere in Prayer, does thirst after Communion with God in Prayer.

If a duty leaves the soul on this side God, unless it have carried the soul
over to God, and brought a man to some further Communion with him, with his
mercy, his love, his grace, his Spirit, the soul is not content with duty.

Others they make duty the end of duty, prayer the end of prayer; And therefore
if they can but rid their hands of a duty, though they had no communion with
God in it, yet they are well enough.

But now a sincere heart, he looks above a duty, he looks upon duty but as a
bridge to convey him over to God; as a means to bring God and his soul into
nearer communion, and if ye have not seen God, and found God in a duty, if his
spirit has not conversed with God as a Father, as a friend, as a child with
his father, as a man with his friend, he has no content in duty.

Obj. But you will say, how shall a man know when he has Communion with God in
duty?

Answ. For the answer of this, I must first tell you, that there is a great
mistake among men and women, of a tender spirit about this point, that they
think they have no communion with God, unles they have met with God in an
heart-chearing, and an heart-comforting way, when God comes in with joy, with
comfort, with chearings and inlargements. Then they are willing to grant you,
they have had communion with God.

But if God have come in, in an heart breaking, humbling, and casting down
their souls in the sight and sense of their sins, and imperfections, They do
not think they have Communion with God.

And therefore I must tell you first in the general; That you may have
Communion with God, as well in an heart humbling, as an heart reviving, an
heart Comforting way.

In the life to come in heaven, all our Communion with God is with Comfort,
with fullness of joy, At his right hand is fullness, etc. Psalm. 16.11. with thee
there is a fountain of joy. Then all tears shall be wiped away from our eyes.

But in this life on earth, we have mixed communion; and have communion with
God, as well in humblings, as in comfortings.

You go upon a duty, and you think to meet God one way, and he comes in
another way.

Sometimes you expect God in a comforting, and God comes in, in a quickening way.

Sometimes thou expects God in an heart breaking way, and God comes in, in a
comforting way.

As the wind, sometimes it blows up rain, sometimes it blows away rain.

So the Spirit of God, which blows where, and when, and how it lists;
sometimes blows up rain, comes into the soul in an heart humbling and breaking
way; And sometimes it blows away rain, and comes into the soul in a cheering,
and heart comforting way.

In both these the soul has communion with God, in joys, and tears, in
mournings, as well as comfortings.

And that in the general to answer the mistake of weaker Christians.

Quest. And now to the answer of the question, How a man shall know when he
has had communion with God in a duty?

1 I Answer, 1 In general, then thou meetest with God, and have communion with
God in duty, when God has enabled thee to act grace in a duty.

An unregenerate man may act parts, and gifts in a duty, but he cannot act
grace, he has none to act.

If then God do enable thee to act grace in a duty, to act thy faith to close
with promises, to act thy repentance for sin, to act love to God; All or any
of these graces, thy soul has then communion with God in duty.

2 Again, When the performance of a duty does lead the soul in better frame, a
more humble frame, or in a more watchful frame, when the heart is more
quickened, or more broken.

When the heart is farther set against sin; more resolved to walk with God, and
obey him, when the frame of a man's spirit is changed, or bettered in any of
these ways, it is a sign that thou have had communion with God in duty, though
God has not come in with fullness of comfort, with chearings or joys.

In this life, most of our communion lies in quickening grace.

In the life to come, our communion is risen up to full comfort, our life then
is all joy.

And so much shall serve for the third Character, and the answer to the
Objection.

4. Character.
A heart sincere in Prayer, does rise up praying from Prayer, he goes away
with the affections of, and affections to prayer, after the Prayer is done.

The Duties of an unsound heart, they come but from a cistern, his devotion is
a stinted devotion; When the Prayer is done, his affections are done also, the
water is all run out, his affections are then done also, perhaps before.

But the Duties of a godly man, they arise from a spring, a fountain, and his
heart is not run out with his Prayer, he has affections of Prayer when the
Prayer is done, he rises up praying from Prayer. The much he has done, is
but a little of that which his soul desires to do.

An unsound man's actions are as big as his heart, perhaps larger; but for a
sincere spirit; the heart is still bigger then the action, all he does is but a
little of that he desires to do. I say where there is sincerity, there is a
desire of more, all is but a little of that abundance that is in his heart.
When he has mourned for sin, he wishes still he could mourn more. He
has an affection of sorrow within him, larger than any expression of sorrow
he can show. So you see David, Rivers of tears run down mine eyes because
men keep not thy law. Not that David had so much moisture within him as to
swell a river, poor man! he had not so much moisture in him; but he had such
an affection of sorrow, that if he had had as many tears as would have swelled
a River, made a Sea, they should all have been laid out for sin.

And indeed if a man had wept a sea of tears, and his affections of mourning,
did end with his expressions of sorrow, he had not yet wept at all, nor shed
one true tear of godly sorrow for sin.

So again, when he has prayed, still his heart is above his action, and he
rises up praying from prayer, with a praying spirit, affections, when the
Prayer is done.

This was that which made Christ commend the poor Widows charity; she gave
but two mites, and yet he says, she had given more than all the rest. Her
heart was bigger than her action, her affections, than her expressions of
charity. Others they gave, but their purses were larger than their hearts, they
emptied their hearts, but not their purses. She, her heart was bigger than her
purse, she emptied her purse, but not her heart, thus she gave more.

So this is the fourth; a sincere heart is larger than his duty, he rises up
praying from Prayer, all he does is but a little of that he desires to do,
but a little of that abundance that is in his heart. Others, their actions are
as large, nay larger than their hearts, they have little heart to the duty, and
their heart is gone, has done, before the duty be done. A wicked man does sin
out of the abundance of his heart; as Christ says, out of the abundance of the
heart, come, etc. Mat. 12.34. He is never weary of sinning, he has a
fountain for that; but though he sin out of the abundance of his heart, yet
he does not pray out of the abundance of his heart; his heart ^s done, before
his Prayer is done, if not, they end together. Well, think of it, he who yet
has not this Principle which I speak of, has not yet a Gospel Principle,
though he do never so much, he is not yet under the conditions of Grace and
Mercy. These are the lowest terms of the Gospel.

5. Character.
A heart sincere in Prayer does eye it self in Prayer; it is a heart that
diligently observes it self in the duty; views all the workings of the soul,
and takes notice of all the imperfections of the spirit in duty. As to gather
comfort, and praise God if right, so to be humbled and afflicted, if amiss.

And indeed our sincerity is as much discovered in lamenting the imperfections
of a work, as in the most perfect performance of it. Where then the heart is
sincere, the soul takes notice of the imperfections that do accompany it, and
when the duty is done, falls a lamenting the imperfections of its Faith, of its
sorrows, the deadness of its desires. Ah! it now laments that he has beheld
so much sin with no more sorrow, looked upon so many abominations with no more
mourning. That he has had no more Faith to close with the Promises of pardon,
of Grace, of purging. That he has had so barren, so shallow, so slight
thoughts of Gods love. That he has been so cold in his affections again
toward God. That he has had so slight conceptions of sin, and no more sorrow
for it. That his heart has been no more affected with the miseries of others,
nor no more enlarged to seek God for them. That there has been so much earth
in Heaven, so many carnal thoughts, so much distractions in his spiritual
imploiment. Ah! my Brethren, a good heart sits down when duty is done, and goes
and mourns over all his Prayers, weeps over all his tears, confesses all his
confessions, and prays over all his Prayers. And he makes up the want of a
duty with sighs, the imperfection of a duty with tears.

Assure you selves, God is as much honored in your mourning for imperfections
of a duty, as he is by your most perfect performance of it. Blushing in Gods
account is perfect beauty. When a soul can blush and be ashamed for the
blemishes which are in its spiritual beauty; God looks upon this soul as
beautiful. This is all we can do, to desire and mourn, to aim at the highest
in our desires, and to mourn when we fall short of what we desire. A
Christian is made up of these two things, desires, and mournings. Desires, Oh
that my heart were directed! Oh that I could believe more, love more, prize
more! Oh that I were more agreeable to Gods Nature and Will, etc. and then
comes in mournings, O miserable man that I am! etc. Oh that my heart should be
so hard, my spirit so dead, my soul so cold in holy exercises! And here is
sincerity, yea and here is the utmost we can reach, when we come unto the
utmost we can attain in this life; Vintores, non Comprehensores.
here we are but travailers toward our home, not yet at home, in our way, not
come to our rest. And we may well say it with our fellow travelers, while
Augustine cries out, I hate that which I am, Odi quod sum, non sum quod amo,
etc.
and love and desire that which I am not. Oh wretched man that I am! in whom
the Cross of Christ has not yet eaten out the poisonous and bit^^^ taste of
the first tree: Another he says, Lord, I see, and yet am blind, I will, and
yet rebel, I hate, and yet I love, I follow, and yet I fall, I press forward,
yet I faint, I wrestle, yet I halt.

Well then, let us make up the want of our beauty with a blush, the
imperfections of our duties with sighs and tears, and then cast them all into
the arms of Christ for acceptance.

If you convey a duty to him with tears, he will present it to his Father with
blood, he will sprinkle it with his own blood, mingle it with his own merits,
perfume it with his own odors, as you read, Revel. 8.4. Whatever is offered by
the spirit of Christ, shall be presented with the merits of Christ, and though
never so weak, in him it shall find acceptance; he has made us accepted in
the beloved. He has life enough to mingle with a dead Prayer, he has warmth
enough to add to a cold Prayer, he has holiness sufficient to add to a duty
full of sin. Though as they come from us, our duties smell rank of the flesh of
sin and corruption, yet being mingled with his odours, with his incense, they
shall smell sweet in the nostrils of God. This is one part of Christ's
mediation, to put life to dead Prayers, to purchase acceptance for
performances, which are but mean. If we and our duties were perfect, we did
not stand in need of a Mediator; Christ would lose one part of his office. And
therefore when the duty is done, show the sincerity of your hearts in mourning
for the imperfections, and cast all into the arms of Christ, and live by Faith
in confidence of acceptance; Who has made us accepted in the beloved, not our
persons only, but our Prayers too.

6. Character.
A heart sincere in Prayer, is a praying heart. That is, a heart carried out
with desire of the thing it prays for. Prayer is nothing else but an
exposition of the soul, or the soul in paraphrase; the soul expressed, the
inside of the soul turned outward.

It is said of Hanna's Prayer, 1 Samuel 1.15. that she poured forth her soul,
she expressed what her soul desired, showed the desires of her soul.

True Prayer is an earnest and enlarged desire for the obtaining and enjoying
of the things we pray for.

Object. But you will say then, all our hearts are sincere, for who is it that
does not desire the things he prays for?

Answ. But my Brethren, give me leave a little, and I shall show you this is
not so strange a thing as you seem to make it. I shall show you, that it is
possible for a man to pray, and not desire the things he prays for. I will
evidence this unto you in these three great Requests. 1. In the desire of
Grace. 2. In the desire of subduing lusts. 3. In the desire of Heaven.

1. Grace.
1. Thou prayest for Grace, but thou do not desire Grace in the beauty and
extent of it. Thou may desire common Graces, as many Parents for their
Children: God give them Grace, say th^^ but by that they mean no more than
common graces, that they may be honest, no Whores, no Thieves, etc. for if
once God change them, and work Grace indeed in them, there is none more
hateful to them of all their Children, than such are. I have heard of a
desperate wretch, that when he came to dye, he gave good portions to all his
Children save one, and to him he would give no more but twelve pence; and
being demanded what was the reason, he made answer he was a Puritan; I have
heard him say, says this wretch, that he had a Promise to live on, let us now
see whether a Promise will maintain him.

Thus you may desire Grace common, and general grace, as many desire for their
Children, but spiritual and saving grace thou can not desire, thou have no
heart to that.

You shall hear what St. Augustine said of himself in his confessions after his
conversion. I prayed says he in my unregeneracy that God would give me
grace. Da mihi continentiam. Noli mudo.
Lord, says he, give me chastity, but says he, my heart said, not yet
Lord, not yet. For I feared lest God would too quickly hear me, and cure me
of my incontinency, which I would rather have fulfilled than extinguished.

And by this you may take the measure of your own spirits, try your selves,
read your own hearts, Grace in the.
the next time you go to prayer. You Pray for grace, but see if you be willing
to have grace, first in the extent of Grace, all grace; 1 Extent.
would the covetous man be liberal? would the Drunkard be sober? would the
unclean person be chaste? would the Proud man be humble, the Contentious man
be peaceable? otherwise thou desires not grace in the extent. 2 Power.
2 Would you have grace 1 In the power of grace, to live precisely and exactly
before God; What not to yield to a word, to a thought of sin? alas! this they
account damnable preciseness, this they cannot close withal. Go thy way, Pray
as often as thou will for grace, assure thy self, thou do not desire grace in
the extent and power of it, if thou favourest any one corruption, if thou will
not live exactly and precisely in the world. Thou would think it no mercy,
if God should grant thee what thou prayest for. Thou prayest for Faith, but
would thou have it? no such matter, why faith purifies the heart, faith
sanctifies the soul; it will not suffer one corruption one lust to be in thy
heart, and now do thou desire faith? no such matter. Assure your selves, if
at any time you desire grace, it is not grace, under a right notion of grace.
It is not grace in the extent of grace, nor grace in the power of grace.

It is again, not a spiritual, but a natural desire of grace, thou desires it
but in some present distress, it may be when thou lie on thy death bed, and
see there is no coming to heaven without it. Thou cannot desire it for it
self.

2 Thou prayest for the subduing of thy lusts, 2 In desire ^^ Power against
lust.
and corruptions, but do thou desire what thou praiest for? would thou
think it, if God should answer thee, to be a mercy? I am confident, that till
thy heart be changed, thou would think the answer of such a request no
mercy; Would the Drunkard think it a mercy to be rid of his cups? The Covetous
man, would he think it a mercy, to be rid of his Mammon of unrighteousness?
No, there is no such matter. I dare be bold to say, there is not that lust
which a wicked man would think it a mercy to be rid of. Alas! Thou do not
desire to be rid of thy lusts, thou can not live without them; thou can not
subsist without them, when thou do pray against them, thou do but dissemble
with God, there is no such matter, thou do not desire it. If at any time thou
do desire it, it is when thou have done with it, or it is in a storm only,
and then not because thou hate it, Non sub in^uitu mali, sed minoris boni.
but because thou dare not keep it, as you know the Merchant casts away his
goods, not because he judges them evil in themselves, but because if he
keeps them, he cannot preserve a greater good, his life. He does not part with
them out of hatred to them, for he even throws over his heart with them, but
because he sees the keeping of them cannot stand with his present safety; for
after the storm and danger is over, he would be glad to get them again, if he
could. There are many who thus part with their sins, as the Merchant with his
wares, only in a storm, when they lie on their sick beds, or under some wrack
of Conscience, for fear of hell, or as Jacob parted with Benjamin, because
otherwise he should starve, necessity drove him to it, or as Phaltiel parted
with Michal, because otherwise he should loose his head, he did not part with
her out of hatred, but out of fear, the King sent for her, and if he had
detained her, it might have cost him his head, therefore (out of fear) he
parted with her, though he wept after her.

3 In desire of heaven. Extrema Christianorum desiderantur, quamvis non Exordia.
3 You Pray for heaven, and one would think you did desire this, we say, the
end of a Christian is desirable, though not the beginning, the rest, though not
the labor; you see Balaam he wished he might dye the death of the righteous,
though he had no heart to live their lives. So that one would think they did
desire heaven.

But indeed as long as thy heart is corrupt and unregenerate, thou do not
desire heaven, if thou know what heaven is. If a man should ask thee, thou
who say, thou desire heaven, what do thou think heaven is, it would I
think, pose thee. But it may be thou will say, thou conceives heaven to be a
place of pleasure and delight, a place free from all miseries and troubles, and
the like. For this is the utmost heaven thou can desire: Thou look on it
and desires it, A place free from paenal not from sinful evils.
as a place of peace and rest, not of grace and holiness. If I should now tell
thee; that heaven is to be rid of all thy lusts and corruptions, I believe
heaven would not be so desirable to thee. Thou desire heaven, but it is under a
false notion, a heaven suitable to thy self, and that's the least of heaven. I
have told you not long ago, abstract and take from heaven, what a corrupt
heart does see, and think to be heaven, and that is heaven indeed to a godly
man. To what I have said of another subject, I will now add this. That did
thou know the company of heaven, Heaven not desirable to corrupt hearts for its
1 Company.
the employments of heaven, the enjoyments of heaven, thou can never desire
heaven, thy heart being corrupt.

1 The company of heaven, shall I tell you? there is none of your mind there.
And it is no great happiness to be in such a place, where they are all of
different minds from you. Two cannot walk together, says the Prophet (they
cannot-live together, take delight together) unless they be agreed. Now there
is no agreement between the company of Heaven and thy spirit, as it is corrupt.
See what the company of Heaven is, enquire what they are.

First, There is God, and do you think there is any agreement betwixt God and
you; why, he is holy, and thou art unholy, he is pure, thou art impure, etc.
and without holiness, no man can see God.

Secondly, There is Christ, there are the glorious Angels; all these are thine
enemies, as thou art in a natural condition.

Thirdly, There are the blessed Saints, and those are such as thou have
despised, such as thou have persecuted here in the World, such as thou could
never endure upon Earth, but fly from and avoid, is this company desirable in
Heaven? no such matter. If they be now hateful to thee, while they have
something of thy self in them, (they have corruptions in them, as well as thou,
though not under the power of them as thou) Oh how hateful would they be, when
these corruptions are removed, when they are better, and thou worse! But what is
this to torment thee, in comparison of the presence of God? in them is but the
spark of holiness, in God those eternal fires of holiness, and if the spark be
a torment, what is the fire? As the Prophet speaks, Who shall dwell with
everlasting fires.

2. Look upon the employments of Heaven, 2 Employment.
and see if those be desirable to thee in thy natural estate.

There is keeping of an eternal Sabbath, there is praising and glorifying God
to all eternity, and would not this be a tedious thing to thee? can thou
endure to praise God for ever, when now a staff of a Psalm is burdensome, to
keep an eternal Sabbath, when a duty is tedious to thee?

3. Add to this the enjoyments of Heaven; 3. For its enjoyments.
and here I can name nothing which thou would think it a mercy to enjoy;

Them we branch into four particulars.

1. Shall I say you shall enjoy God there; 1. God.
who though happiness to a gracious heart, yet a torment to a corrupt spirit. I
have read of the Irish Earth, that no venomous creature can endure to live upon
it; that if a man should make a circle of Irish Earth, and put a little English
Earth in the midst of it for a center, if a Toad, or any venomous Creature were
upon the English Earth, it would dye there, rather than come upon the Irish
ground. I tell thee, the Irish Earth will better brook a Toad, than Heaven a
sinner, or a sinner Heaven.

2. You shall enjoy freedom from sin, never sin more. 2. Freedom from sin.
Not to sin is here our Law, hereafter it shall be our Nature. And is this a
mercy to be rid of sin? sin, which is meat and drink now? what, can the
Drunkard be willing to be rid of his cups? the unclean person of his Dalilah?
the covetous man of his bags? can he think an eternal divorce from such
things, he loves so dear, a mercy?

3. You shall enjoy perfection of Grace, to be swallowed up with holiness.

4. An eternal Sabbath.

And these are things which certainly a corrupt heart does not desire.

And so you see, it is possible for a man to pray for those things which he
has no desire, were granted.

Therefore the Character is firm, that it is the sign of a sincere heart in
prayer, when he does truly desire the thing prayed for.

And thus much for the sixth Character.

7. Character.
The seventh and last. A sincere heart in Prayer does not only desire, but
truly endeavor the compassing of the thing prayed for; Oculum ad sidus, manum
ad clavum.
As the wise Mariner, he has not only an eye to the Star, but his hand also
upon the Helm, or as the Plow-men of Sparta, they had one hand up to Ceres,
whom they feigned the Goddess of Corn, and the other upon the stilts of the
Plow; they joined plowing with praying. So here, a sincere heart, he does not
only pray, lift up his heart to Heaven, but he puts also his hand to the work,
to compass what he prays for; does he pray for pardon of sin? he labors
to get his Faith more strengthened in assurance of pardon. Desires he subduing
of corruption? he makes use of Christ, etc. Desires he grace? he is careful
in the use of all means, etc. Psalm. 5. I will direct my Prayer, and look up,
(...) The words are very emphatical, there are two military words used in that
place; the first to set or put an Army in array. So he would order his
Prayers, and then he would look up, and stand sentinel.

Gods power and grace must not exempt us from the use of the means, but make us
more diligent in the use of all means to have our desires accomplished.

Exodus 17.
We read that Joshuahs sword, and Moses prayer were to go together; if the
sword had gone out without Prayer, if they had fought, and had not prayed, they
had not prevailed, for God will not be neglected; if the Prayer had gone up,
and the Sword had not gone out, had they prayed, and not fought, they had not
had success, for God will not be tempted; but both these went together, and
then Gods blessing was on them.

So here, should we endeavor and not pray, we can look for no good, we go
out in our own strength, and cannot prevail; and should we pray, and not
endeavor, we may expect the same success; God will neither be tempted nor
neglected: But if we join them both together, if the hand back the heart,
endeavors second our desires, we may expect Gods blessing on us.

This is the last Character, A sincere heart is conscionable in the use of all
means, for the accomplishing the things prayed for.

3. Part. Clear sincerity in matter of mourning.
There is yet a third Particular, wherein to clear the sincerity of your hearts,
and that is in matter or mourning. I told you, that it was possible for a man,
not only to pray, but to seem to mourn too, and yet his heart be unsound. You
read of the Israelites, they did not only pray, but they joined fasting to
prayer, as you see in the next words to my Text, but more plainly, Zach. 7.5.
When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth Month, did you at all fast to me,
says the Lord? There was fasting, and mourning joined to fasting, yet hearts
unsound. There is false mournings, as well as true; Crocodile tears, false
tears, as well as false prayers. And therefore it behooves us to try the
sincerity of our hearts, in mourning for sin.

We will lay down these Characters of it.

1. Character. Characters of sincere mourning.

A sincere mourning, is a deep mourning; a sad and serious sorrow for sin. Such
a sorrow as does deeply affect the heart, with the thoughts and apprehensions
of the burden and bitterness of sin.

A sincere mourner has sad and deep apprehensions of the nature, demerit and
filthiness of sin; he looks upon sin as an offense against a just, a pure, a
holy God; as the breach of a pure, a holy, and an eternal Law; as a wounding
and crucifying of Christ; as a grieving and sadding of the spirit of Grace, as
a wounding and undoing his own soul for ever. Which deep and inward thoughts of
the nature of sin; work deep, and inward mourning for sin. The heart is
wounded, the soul humbled and grieved, his spirit melted and peirced within him
for sin, which he has committed against God. It is not his tongue only that
repents in expressing and confessing, his eyes in weeping, but his heart in
deep and inward mournings for sin. Another may make more noise, more cryings,
roarings, howlings; but his sorrow is more inward, more secret, more still, and
yet more deep. As you know the deepest waters run the stillest, so the deepest
sorrow makes least noise. So that is the first, a sincere mourning, is a deep
mourning. An Hypocrite, his mournings are but shallow mournings, he has but
shallow and fleeting thoughts of the nature and demerit of sin; he may say
with Pharaoh, I have sinned, or cry out in a strait, Lord have mercy upon me,
or hang down his head like a bulrush for a day, or roar upon the present rack
of trouble for a time, but he never has any deep and serious thoughts of sin,
as sin. His prayers are howlings, and his mournings are roarings. Gods people
they mourn like Doves, wicked men they bellow like Bulls under the apprehension
of sin.

2. Character.
A sincere mourning, is an universal mourning, he mourns for all sins.

A sincere mourning, is an universal mourning, he mourns for all sins.

As he hates all, small and great, so he mourns for all, yea for such sins is
his heart affected, which another man's light does not discover to be sins.
Peccata vastantia conscientiam.
An unsound heart may mourn for some greater sins, such as have made great
wounds and gashes in his conscience: but for sins, quotidiana incursionis, for
omissions and common frailties, wandering of thoughts, imperfections in duty,
deadness, coldness, unbeleef, these gnats can he swallow, his light does not
discover these to be sins.

Nay, yet further, A sincere mourning is not only an universal mourning, that
he mourns for all sins of his own, but he mourns for other men's sins as
well as his own, he has a fountain within him, which runs over to the good
of others. We have read of some who have mourned for their own sins, and yet
have been unsound. You see Pharaoh, Ahab, Judas. But we never read of any who
were grieved with, and have mourned for the sins of others as well as his
own, but their hearts were sound. Lot his righteous soul was grieved for the
sins of Sodom, and ye know his heart was sound, he is called Righteous Lot.
David he mourned for the sins of others, yea such as were his enemies, Ps.
119.139
as he says, Rivers of tears run down mine eyes, because mine enemies keep
not thy Law: And you know David was sincere, God tells us he was a man after
his own heart, and the heart of David was single and sincere with God. The like
I might tell you of Moses, of Samuel, of Daniel, Nehemiah, and others; he that
mourns only in relation to guilt and hell, that man's Cistern runs out only
for his own house. He mourns for sin no farther than it does reflect upon
himself, and so not for sin as sin, but sin as it is evil to him, as it binds
him over to the wrath of God, and eternal damnation.

But he that mourns for sin, in its own nature, as an offense to an holy,
pure, gracious God, his fountain runs over to the use of others, he goes and
mourns over other men's sins as well as his own. We read the Angels, they
rejoice at the conversion of a sinner. What is the ground? do they receive any
further addition of good thereby? no they are full, but therefore do they
rejoice, because God is further glorified. And if joys were capable of sorrows,
heaven of tears, they would upon the same ground mourn for the sins of me,
because thereby God is dishonored. And if we could see God as they do, our
hearts would be filled with grief, our eyes with tears, to see, the God so
great, so gracious, so holy; to be abused and wronged by wicked men, though
we no way guilty of their sin. Thus a sincere heart he mourns for other
men's sins as well as his own, he is grieved when his enemies do break Gods
laws, not so much because they hurt or wound him, but because they dishonor
God and wound their own souls. It troubles him to see men swear and lie, to
join hearts and hands together against God, his cause, his Church, his people,
his Ministers, not because they hurt him, but strike against God, and so but
beat themselves against a rock, and break themselves, do that which will turn
to their own shame, and sorrow at the last, which is the best end that can be
expected of sin.

3. Character.
3 Sincere mourning is a mourning for sin, a sorrow for sin.

Sorrow is like Mercuries influence, good if joined with a good Planet, bad if
it be joined with a bad Planet. It was good in Peter, it was naught in Judas,
good in David naught in Ahab: In the one it was worldly, in the other it was a
godly sorrow, the one was a sorrow for the evil of punishment, the other for
the evil of sin: Flagella dolent quare flagellantur non dolent.
The one roared under present lashes, the judgment and punishment of sin, as
Augustine says, They lament the evil caused, not the evil causing; the evil of
pu^^^hment, the present lashes, not the evil of sin. You shall see the
difference of it in Pharaoh and David. God you see punished Pharaoh for sin,
plague upon plague, judgment upon judgment, and he cries under the lashes,
the present judgment. Oh! take away this plague, take away this death also;
take away these lice, these Caterpillars, etc. but there was not a word of sin.

But I have sinned, says David, 2 Samuel 24. to, 27.
I beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy servant, One would have thought
he should have prayed to have the plague removed, which was then on the
people. But he says take away this sin, not this plague; nay in the 17th
verse. Continue the plague if thou please, against me and my fathers house,
only pardon mine iniquity. Why thus, because he saw sin a greater evil than
the plague, and therefore desires rather to be rid of the sin, than the
punishment of it. Here was now a vast difference between the sorrows of the one
and the other. Take away this plague, says Pharaoh, but continue the sin:
Take away the sin, says David, though thou continue the plague. The one he
mourned under the present lashes, the other under sin. Sincere mourning is a
mourning for sin, and not for sin as clad with wrath, but for sin
abstractly, sin in its own nature, not for sin in its damning, but for sin in
its defiling nature.

4. Character.
4 Sincere mourning is a proportional mourning, there are two proportions of
sin: First, of the measure. Secondly, Of the merit of sin. Where the heart is
sincere it is proportionable.

1. To the measure of Sin. Great sins must have great sorrows, thou have
abounded in sinning, thou must abound in sorrowing. Thus you see it was with
Manasses, he was a great Sinner, and a great sorrower, he was humbled greatly
says the Text. So Mary Magdalen, a great sinner, and she is a great sorrower.

Its true, I grant, Non ex gradu ^t mensura paenitenti^^, etc.
That Sincerity does not lie so much in the measure, as the truth of mourning;
there may be godly sorrow in a drop, in one tear, when there is not godly
sorrow in a Sea of Tears: But this I say withal, that sincere hearts do ever
labor to carry a proportion between their sinnings and their sorrowings,
between their repentings and their revoltings, and though a man may be
justified in heaven, without such a measure of sorrow, yet he will scarce be
justified, or get peace in the court of his own Conscience without it. That's
the first.

2 The second Proportion is, To the merit of Sin. Sincere mourning is
proportionable to the merit of sin; Non actu sed affectu.
as the demerit of sin is infinite, so sorrow for it must be an infinite
sorrow, infinite I say, not in the act and expression, yet in the affection of
the soul. As it is said of a wicked man, if he should live for ever he would
sin for ever, in respect of his desire and will to sin, and therefore
because he sins in aeterno sui, he is punished in eterno Dei.

So I may say of a godly man, if he should live for ever, he would sorrow for
ever. His sorrow is infinite in desire and affection, though finite in the act
and expression of it. And indeed a bounded, a stinted sorrow is no sorrow. He
whose heart and eyes do dry up together, whose expression in tears and
affections of sorrow do end together, though he had wept a sea of tears, he
has not yet mourned for sin. As I told you last day, that a Sincere heart does
rise up praying from Prayer, so he goes away weeping from weeping, with a
weeping heart when his eyes are dry. Godly sorrow has affections of mourning,
when the expressions of mourning cease, because every drop of tears does
arise from a sea of tears within. As every act of faith does arise from a
believing disposition, a habit of faith within: so every expression of sorrow
from an affection of sorrow in the spirit; every drop of tears from a spring
and fountain of tears within the soul. Hence we read, 1 Samuel cap. 7. verse. 6.
where their sorrow is expressed by this phrase, They drew water as out of a
well, as out of a spring, and poured out before the Lord, Their eyes did not
empty so fast as their heart filled. Their eyes could not pour it forth so
fast, as their hearts did yield it up. All their expressions of mourning were
less, than their affections of mourning. And shall I now tell you, though your
sorrow may be sincere, and yet not proportionable to the measure of sin, yet
your sorrow cannot be sincere, if not proportionable to the merit of Sin; if
it be not infinite sorrow, infinite I say, in the desire and affection, though
not in the act and expression.

And alas how few there are Sincere mourners! you that are sturdy Sinners, you
dry eyed Sinners, you hard hearted Sinners, when was the time you have thus
mourned for sin, we see your sinnings every day, but who hears of your
repentings? we hear of your drunkenness, your swearing, your lying, your
gaming, your dicing, and revelling, even till the morning watch upon the Lords
day; but we hear not of your repentings; In stead of that we hear of your new
sinning; you add Sin to Sin, not repenting to sinning. As it was said of
Herod, that he added this to all his wickedness, that he shut up John in
Prison; this was the great aggravation of his sin, this filled his measure, he
added this to all. So there are some who will add this to all their sins, that
add this to all their drunkenness, their swearing, gaming, revelling, to
persecute and evilly entreat those who are Gods messengers to them.

Take heed of thus adding drunkenness to thirst, and malice, and rage to
drunkenness, lest Gods wrath and jealousy smoke against such excesses, Deuteronomy.
29.19, 20.

5 Character.
Sincere mourning is a faithful mourning.

So much faith, so much sincere mourning, so much godly sorrow; They are like
the fountain and the flood, the one arises no higher than the other. In respect
of donation, faith and repentance are infused at the same instant of time;
though in respect of manifestation, repentance goes before faith. Faith being
like the sap, which is hid in the root, more secret in the heart, and
repentance like the bud, which is sooner discerned than faith, both to a man's
own self and others. Yet in respect of the order of nature, faith does
necessarily go before repentance. Nemo pot^st agere paenitentiam, nisi qui
sperat de indulgentia.
As a legal faith, before a legal sorrow, so an evangelicall faith, before an
evangelicall sorrow. No man can truly repent, but he who has some hopes of
pardon.

Well then, sincere Repentance, is a faithful Repentance, such a Repentance as
does arise from Faith; by which I mean not, a legal Faith, whereby a man
believes the threatenings of the Law to be true, and he guilty. This is too
low. This may breed a vexing, tumultuous, turbulent, slavish sorrow, but not a
godly, sweet, evangelical mourning. But I mean here an evangelical Faith, and
yet not the Faith of assurance, or the Faith of evidence; this is too high.
There may be godly sorrow, sincere mourning in that soul, which yet for the
present wants the evidence and assurance of Gods love in Christ. But such a
Faith I mean which is the lowest spring of godly sorrow. Whereby the soul is
persuaded

1. Of the all sufficiency of Gods Mercy, and Christ's Merits for the pardoning
of sin.

2. Of the freeness and willingness of God to pardon sin.

3. And then throws it self upon the Mercy of God; the grace of Christ, for
pardon and forgiveness. Which though it appear to be small, yet it will cost
you something before ever you reach this.

But now the mourning of an Hypocrite does not arise from Faith, but from
sense, either from some present sting, or trouble of conscience, or from some
outward pressures upon the body. And hence it comes to pass that his sorrow is
not a constant sorrow, while the trouble lasts, the weight is upon him, so long
he howles and cries; but if once the trouble be blown over, the Sky clears,
his mourning is done. As Job says of his praying, will he pray always? he
will not. So I may say of his mourning, will he mourn always? he will not.
When conscience wrings him, when the heart is overwhelmed with trouble, then
he falls a howling, and crying, but when the trouble is over, he wipes his
eyes, and mourns no more. But now again, he, whose sorrow does arise from
Faith, he does not only mourn when conscience is troubled, but when conscience
is at peace. Nay, when the heart is fullest of peace and joy, the eyes are
biggest with tears; when the pearl of joy is in the heart, the dew of tears is
in the eyes. I say, when the soul has most assurance of Gods love, then will
Faith produce child-like arguments to raise up the springs of sorrows in us, to
open all the fountains of tears in the soul. Oh will the soul say! has God
been so merciful? and am I so sinful? Has he been so good to me? and I so
evil to him? As the frowns of God do break the heart, so the smiles of God do
melt and dissolve it.

6. Character.
A sincere mourning is a filial mourning.

There are the mournings of a son, and the mournings of a slave; the one does
arise from fear, the other from love; love 1. Of God to the soul. 2. Of the
soul to God.

1. From the consideration of Gods love to the soul. When the soul sits down,
and recounts the immensity, greatness of Gods love to it; when it takes a view
of what God might have done with it, and what God has done with it; how justly
he might have damned the soul, and how mercifully he has saved the soul;
what cost, what care, what pains, what sweat, what blood he has laid out to
save us, and how easily he might have damned us; Oh! this melts and dissolves
the soul; the soul even crumbles into dust, and dissolves into water, under the
thoughts of it. You see this set down in Ezekiel. 36.31. Then shall you remember
your doings. Then, when? when God shall express love, as you see verse. 25, 26.
why th^n will the soul say to it self, as Absalom to Hushi, is this thy
kindness to thy friend? art thou so cruel to him, who has been so kind to
thee? so evil to him, who has been so good to thee? Oh these thoughts do lay a
man in the dust. God has taken such a way to justify and save men, that if
we be but men, it will break our hearts that we have offended him. Who is it
that can read over that place without tears? Isa. 43.24, 25. Thou have bought
me no sweet Cane with money, neither have thou filled me with the fat of thy
sacrifices, but thou have wearied me with thine iniquities; and have made me
serve with thy sins, thou have made my mercy to serve, my patience to serve,
with thy sins, even to look on while thou abusedst me. And what would a man
imagine now would follow after this, Therefore I will plague thee, I will
punish thee. But read and wonder, and read; withhold from tears if thou can,
if any spark of ingenuity be in thee, I, even I, am he who blotteth out thine
iniquities for my own names sake, and will not remember thy sins. Here was the
wonder of mercy.

2. It arises from the love of thy soul to God. The love of the person
offended does cause a godly man to mourn, that he has offended him. You see
David, Psalm. 51. Against thee, against thee, have I sinned; godly sorrow,
sincere mourning is an ingenuous mourning, scarce a thought of Hell and
damnation comes into the mind, if they do; alas! these do not trouble him so
much as his sin; that he has grieved and offended so good a God by Sin. Hence
Zachary has this expression. Zach. 12.10
They shall look upon him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn, etc. In
which there is nothing but pure love; the expression is observable, the Prophet
does not say, they shall mourn as a son for a Father, there may be self-love
in that, a child may see himself undone in the loss of a father; but he says,
they shall mourn as a father for a son, in which there is pure love. But now
with Hypocrites, it is neither the consideration of Gods love to them, nor any
love or good will which they bear to God, that makes them mourn, but indeed
love to themselves, they have Sinned and are afraid God will damn them for Sin,
therefore it is terror, no principle of love to God, which draws them to mourn
for Sin. As they hate Sin only in reference to hell, so they mourn for Sin only
in reference to hell.

What St. Augustine says of fear of sin, I may say of sorrow for Sin. He that
fears sin for Hell, fears not to Sin, but to burn, but he hates sin
indeed, who so hates sin as hell it self. Qui gehennam metuit, non peccare
metuit, sed ardere.
So he who sorrows for Sin for fear of hell and wrath, he is not sorry for
sin, but howles for fear of hell: but he sorrows truly who is more grieved for
sinning, than he is afraid of burning.

7. Character.
Sincere mourning is a friutfull mourning.

There are paenal tears, and fruitful tears, Worldly sorrow that is paenal
sorrow, it is a weeping to weeping, but godly sorrow is a fruitful sorrow, a
weeping to repentance, and amendment, as the Apostle, Godly sorrow, works
repentance, not to be repented of, 2 Cor. 7.10. There is a great deal of
difference between the pains of the gout, and of a woman in travel, the one is
pain to pain, no fruit of the pain, mere torture, the other is pain to ease,
travel to rest, a travel to birth. Other sorrow is a sorrow to sorrow, this is
a sorrow to joy, as Christ expresses it under the parable of a woman in
travel. Sincere mourning is a fruitful mourning, for repentance is like the
waters of jealousy, which either rot or make fruitful.

And first It is a heart humbling sorrow.

2 It is a soul fattening sorrow, by the sadness of the countenance, the heart
is made better.

3 It is a grace strengthening, a grace increasing sorrow. And therefore does
God preserve such springs as these in the hearts of his people, on purpose to
water the seed of holiness, the garden of graces in the hearts of his people.
Every grace within us does look fresh, every disposition within us buds, shoots
forth after a shower of repentant tears, that man who has such springs as
these within him, his graces must needs flourish, they cannot wither nor decay.

Observe it, A mourning Christian is evermore a thriving, a growing Christian.

4 It is a divorcing sorrow, it breaks the league and union between heart and
Sin. There is a league between the heart and sin, they are as near together as
the skin to the flesh, as the flesh to the bones, the bark to the tree: Godly
sorrow does divorce between a man's heart and sin; separates between them, it
sets the soul at a distance with sin; Unsound hearts may mourn, may lament sin,
but leave not Sin, they Sin and Repent, and Repent and Sin; as if their Sinning
did but make matter for repenting, etc.

This is like the Drunken man's round, his drink goes out in tears, and then to
drink again. Pharaoh could say he had sinned, but he left not his Sin, Saul
could say he had Sinned too, yet he retained his sin, Judas said the like,
yet if he had lived, he had been the same, if God had not changed his heart.
No, if a man should have lain as long in flames as Cain has, and should come
out of hell, red hot out of flames, he would be the same man still. All the
terrors of God, all the horrors in the World, all the flames of hell cannot
change the heart. These may dare a man, make a man afraid to sin, but not hate
Sin, this must come from a principle of Grace, a Gospel work. The justice of
God may terrify the heart, the power of God may awe the heart, but it must be
the love and mercy of God, which must thaw the heart, must change the heart.
Now godly sorrow does work a change in the soul; Job 34.32
such a man says with Job; If I have done iniquity I will do it no more, he
lamenteth sin and leaves Sin, he confesses and forsakes Sin, God forgives,
and he also foregoes sin.

Beside these fruits I might name many more, which are the fruits of sincere
mourning. It works peace, our tears end in joy, it works spiritual
tranquillity of Conscience, as it works a change.

And besides these you have seven special and particular fruits, set down (2
Cor. 7.11.) of godly sorrow, on which I want time to insist. But now an
hypocrites sorrow is a sorrow to sorrow, a paenal not a fruitful sorrow, he is
never the better for all his howling, his heart never the more humble, his
spirit never the more broken, his soul never the more set against Sin. These
tears they leave him as they found him, they are not changing and transforming
tears, he is never the more watchful, never the more careful to please God,
he rather grows more secure, takes more heart to sin against God, he thinks
he has done penance and satisfied the Law, he has discharged the former
score by his present roarings, and therefore may begin a new reckoning, a new
score, and sin more freely against God: whereas true mourning makes us
watchful, and so our falls make us secure.

To sum up all in a little.

1 The unsound heart, he mourns for Sin either as clad with punishment, or as
it brings the evil of punishment after it, the first you see in Pharaoh, the
second in Ahab. The other laments Sin as Sin, sin abstracted and separated from
wrath and punishment.

2 The one howls under the present lashes, the evil of punishment, the other
under the evil of sin.

3 Sense does provoke the one to mourning, faith and love do cause the other to
mourn.

4 The ground of the one is self-love, the ground of the other, love to God.

5 The one is slavish, the other childish.

6 The end of the one is peace and joy, of the other, it is discouragement and
despair, as in Cain and Judas, etc.

7 The one breeds a bitterness and turbulency of spirit, the other humility,
mildness, self-denial. Thus I have showed you these three things, and cleared
them.

I believe there is many of you, who do not pray at all, many who are yet to
shed one tear for Sin; Alas! when was the time, thou have entered thy Chamber,
thy closet; and broken thy heart for sin, humbled thy soul for sin? Let me
tell thee thus much, thou have sinned, this sin will have sorrow one time or
other, if not here in fruitful mourning, hereafter in paenal mourning, in
weeping and gnashing of teeth. If thou will not sorrow for a time thou shall
howl for ever; It may be thou thinks no such matter; conscience is now at
peace, Ista tranquill^tas tempestas erit.
it is like a book bound up, if once opened your peace shall end in a storm,
your joy in sorrow; happy thou, if God wound thee, that he may heal thee,
break thee, that he may bind thee, humble thee, that he may comfort thee. It
is better be broken here, than to go whole to hell, better be wounded here,
than to go sound to hell, better to be a sad Saint, than a merry Devil.

What David prayed for his enemies, may we pray for our best friends. Send
them down quick to Hell. Send them down here by humiliation, that they may
avoid eternal damnation hereafter.

We began with the last first, viz. clear your sincerity in your performances
in particular, we named three particulars, in

Hearing. Praying. Mourning.

We come now to the end, which is the first in order of nature, though we
have made it last in time.

Clear sincerity in Obedience in the general.
2. Clear the sincerity of your hearts in Obedience in general. Now to this as
to the former. I will give you some Characters of a sincere Obedience. Sincere
Obedience is 1. A faithful. 2. An universal. 3. A fruitful. 4. A filial
Obedience. We shall only single out some of them, because we are willing to
finish this Doctrine.

1. Character.
Full.
A sincere Obedience is a full Obedience, an universal Obedience.

It is universal, in respect of the subject, the whole man; it is universal, in
respect of the object, the whole Law; it is universal, in respect of durance,
the whole life. He who obeyes sincerely, obeyes universally; his obedience is
not only suitable to the rule, in respect of the nature and quality of it, but
it is proportionable also to the rule, in respect of the latitude and extent of
his obedience. There is no man that serves God truly, who does not endeavor to
serve God fully. Sincerity turns upon the hinges of universality. It is said of
David, that he had respect to all the Commandments of God, and that he hated
every false way. He had not obeyed any, if he had not respected all; nay
which is yet more, Act. 13.22. he fulfilled all the will of God, the words are
in the plural number, (...), all the wills and Commands of God; and of Zachary
and Elizabeth, Luke 1.6. that they walked in all the Commandments of God
blameless, he who obeyes sincerely, endeavors to obey thoroughly. We will
instance in these branches.

1. In suffering as doing.
First, He will obey God in suffering Commands, as well as doing, in losing, as
well as gaining Commands. An unsound spirit may follow God, while he can
follow his own game too, while they can serve God without cost, without pain or
loss, etc. such men love cheap obedience. But when Obedience comes to be
chargeable, when his Obedience to God, may cost him his liberty, his riches,
his estate, then they retire; while Religion and the World do walk in the same
path, there are many who will tread the paths of Religion; but when there comes
a turning, that they must shake hands and part, riches one way, Christ another;
God one way, the World another; then they will forsake Christ. You see it was
so with the young man, he was willing to follow Christ so far as he might be
no loser, so far as to keep his wealth too. But when Christ told him, if he
would follow him, he must sell all, when it comes to this, that either he
must part with his Riches or with Christ, then he falls off, and went away
sorrowing. But he who obeyes sincerely serves God for himself, such a man will
obey God, though to the hazard and loss of all, he will obey God in costly, as
well as cheap; losing, as well as gaining duties. Such a man prizeth more of
one act of Obedience, than he does of all his enjoyments, and will take up
naked Obedience, though with the loss of all. As he will not commit a sin,
though he might gain the World for it, so he will not neglect a duty, though
he lose a World for it. You see this in the three Children, in Daniel, and in
Queen Mary's days, those go in Sheepskins, who might have gone in Silks, etc.

Secondly, He will obey God in relative Commands, as well as absolute.

Sincerity does not only lie in absolute Commands toward God, but in relative
Commands one toward another. And where the heart is sincere, he will not only
hear, and pray, and obey God, but he will walk in all duties of Righteousness,
and charity toward his Brother. He is such a one as makes conscience of every
Command, great or small. Every one comes from the same authority, James 2.11.
For he that says the one, says also the other. And whatever has the stamp
of God, the authority of Heaven upon it, though it seem never so small, he
dare not disobey it; where there is a beam of Gods Majesty sitting upon the
face of a command, he will submit to it. Men you know will not refuse the
Kings Coin, though the piece be never so small; if the Kings impression be on
a penny, it calls for acceptance, as well as a piece; so if the authority of
God be stamped upon the least command; a sincere heart will yield subjection
to it, as well as the greatest, Mat. 5.19. He who breaks the least of these
Commands, shall be the least, etc. He who stands with God for small things,
when he will not forbear an Oath, a cup, a ragge for Christ; how should you
yield to the greater. A man may do the smaller, and yet neglect the greater; As
the Pharisees, who tithed Mint and Cummin, but the great things of the Law,
(...) legis.
the love of God, fear of God, these are not regarded. But he who does the
greater, will not neglect the smaller.

Thirdly, He will obey God in affirmative Commands, as well as negative
Commands.

He does not only look upon what God would not have him do, but he examines
what God would have him do. Dives was cast into Hell, not for oppressing
Lazarus, but for not showing mercy upon Lazarus, not because he took any thing
from, but because he gave nothing to him. There is many a man's Religion lies
merely upon negatives. He is no swearer, no drunkard, no unclean person, as
the Pharisee, he oppresses no man, defrauds no man. But if you ask him for
the affirmative commands, there he is nothing; art thou holy? art thou humble?
art thou a believer? art thou a sanctifier of Gods day? love thou God?
fear thou God? Alas! these sins, because they are minoris infamiae, not so
scandalous as the other are, therefore he makes them nullius culpae, no sins
at all, these gnats he can swallow, without any straining at them, etc.

4. He will obey God in the Spirit of the Command, as well as in the letter of
the Command.

There is an intra and an extra in every Command of God. One part of the Law
binding the flesh, the other part enjoining the spirit. You see how Christ sets
it down, Matthew. 5.21. Thou shall do no Murder, there is the letter of the
Command. Thou shall not be angry with thy Brother without a cause, there is
the Spirit of the Command. Thou shall not commit Adultery, there is the letter
of the Command. Thou shall not look on a woman to lust after her, there is the
Spirit of the Command. An unsound spirit looks no further than the bare letter
of the Command, that part which binds the flesh or outward man only, and if
he do but observe that in the gross, he thinks he has done well; but now a
sincere heart, he looks to the spirit of the Command, and if he do not
observe that, he has no peace; if you keep the whole Law in the letter, and
give way to your selves to fail in any, and do not sincerely endeavor to obey
all according to the spirit, your spirits are unsound. He that will see God
with comfort, must not only obey the letter of the Command, but must bring his
heart to the sincere Obedience of the spirit of the Command.

5. He will not only obey God only in the Matter, but in the Manner, not only
in the substance, but in the circumstance of the Command.

He is not only conscionable to obey God in what he commands, but his heart
is wrought to a conscionableness in the Obedience. An unsound heart looks no
further than the substance of the Command, if he have but prayed, if been at
Church, he thinks all is well, he looks no further. But now a sound spirit,
he looks to the circumstance, as well as the substance, the manner, as well as
the matter of the command. When he prays, he labors to pray fervently,
faithfully. When he hears, he will hear humbly, fruitfully, when he obeyes,
he desires to obey willingly, cheerfully, etc. We say, bonum est ex integra
causa, but malum ex quolibet defectu; Take any action, if either the Principle
whence it does arise be not good, that the action arise from corrupt
Principles, self-love, carnal fears; or if the purposes be not good, that the
aims and ends be carnal, or if the circumstances be not good, it spoils the
action. If we pray, and pray not fervently, if we heat, and hear not
fruitfully, if we obey, and obey not willingly, if we show mercy, and do it
not cheerfully, if you sanctify the Sabbath, and not with delight, all is
worth nothing.

There are some circumstances accessory, some necessary; some wherein the
being, and some wherein but the well-being of a duty does consist. And if you
abstract these from them, the duty it is worth nothing. Take away fervency, and
humility from Prayer, take away faithfulness and fruitfulness from hearing,
take away willingness and delight from Obedience, all is nothing worth. So much
for the first Character of sincere Obedience. Universality.

2. Character.
Sincere Obedience is such an Obedience, Rightness of
which does 1. Come from a right spring. 2. Is wrought by a right Rule. 3. In a
right manner. 4. To a right end. I put all together, that I may not multiply
too much.

1. Sincere Obedience arises from a right spring, 1. Spring.
a sound Obedience arises from sound Principles. A soul renewed, a soul
universally sanctified, and principled from above. Such as the Principle is,
such is a man's Obedience, dead Principles, and but dead Obedience, unsound
Principles, and unsound Obedience. A man's actions can go no higher than his
Principles. There must be a good tree, before good fruit, the person must be
good, before the actions can be good; if there be a crack in the person, all
is naught. Now this sincere Principle which is the spirit of all our Obedience;
it is nothing else but an entire and spiritual frame of Grace and Holiness set
up in the soul, whereby a man is renewed and changed. Which is called in
Scripture, a new Creation, a writing of the Law in the heart, Regeneration,
Renovation, Resurrection from death to life, and a forming Christ in the soul.
As it has a respect to the heart, the seat of these Principles, it borrows
five names.

It is called 1. A sound heart, in opposition to an unsound, a false spirit. 2.
A perfect heart, in opposition to an Hypocritical spirit. 3. And a single
heart, in opposition to a doubleness of spirit. 4. An honest heart, in
opposition to a deceitful heart. 5. A whole heart, in opposition to a half, a
divided spirit which God hates. And where Obedience is sincere, it arises from
such a spirit. A sound, perfect, etc. spirit.

2. As it comes from a right rise, so he walks by a right Rule in his
Obedience, and that is the whole will of God revealed in his Word; if God says,
do, he does; if God says, do not, he will not do. If he have no command
from Heaven, he stands still like a ship becalmed, and wanting a wind, he
will not stir.

Those things which are motives to others move not him. But when a command
comes, his sails are filled, he is carried on with strength in obedience to it.
Col. 4.12. We have the same metaphor; Be filled with all the will of the
Lord, let the will of God, his command, be the only motive, that carries you
on in the service of God. Thus you see it was with David, he had respect to the
Commandments, he had not respect to the world, to men, to his own ends,
advantages, which are the spring of others obedience, but he has respect to
the Command, he eyes that, he will obey if there be a Command.

A Sincere heart does not only do things good in themselves, and such as God
has commanded, but he does them because God has Commanded them; Gods preceps
are the ground of his practice, Psalm. 119.4, 5. Thou have commanded us to keep
thy Precepts. Oh that my ways were directed, etc.

3 He obeys after a right manner, etc.

4 He levels his actions to right ends.

As nothing below God is the spring of his obedience, so nothing below God is
the end of his obedience. Gods grace is the spring, Gods glory is the end of
all his obedience. An unsound heart has base and unsound ends, credit, repute,
profit, esteem or the like. He now makes not the world his end, no not the
world to come; the salvation of his soul, the end of all his obedience. Indeed
this is a secondary, a subservient, a subordinate end, but not the ultimate
end, the primary, the universal end; Gods glory is the Sea, to which all his
actions like so many rivers move and bend. It is true I grant, that other ends
may creep into the performance of good actions, and that not only lower, but
baser ends than this.

But we are to distinguish between a man's settled, and his suggested end, a
man's settled end may be one thing, yet his suggested end be contrary, God
reckons according to the settled end, the universal purpose and frame of his
spirit, and not according to suggested ends. It is in this case as it may be
with a man that shoots at a mark, he aims aright at the mark, but there may
come a jog upon the elbow, which may carry the arrow another way, than he
intended. Or as it is with a man that sets out to go to such a haven, he sets
out aright, and steers aright by his compass, but the winds blow contrary and
carry him whether he would not. But then as the Apostle, If I do the thing I
would not, it is no more I, but sin. It was Bernards case, he had set upon a
good work, and levels his action to the glory of God, that was his aim, his
end, but there were other ends suggested, pride, ostentation, vainglory, which
he observing, encounters them in this manner, Abi hinc, nec propter te incepi,
nec propter te desinam.
Abi hinc, etc. get hence, avoid, you were not the ground of my beginning this
work, nor will I for you conclude this work. And it would be our wisdom, when
a man has set his heart aright in the beginning, when he has set out aright,
if any other ends be suggested, to reject them in the like manner, being
neither the spring of the action, nor the end of the action.

Obj. But you will say further, Is it requisite for the clearing of the
sincerity of our hearts, that we have a continual eye to the glory of God in
every action we do? Is there required such an actual intention of the spirit
in every particular action, etc. that he should aim at Gods glory?

Ans. For the Answer of this, I must lay down this distinction.

There is first an actual.

Secondly, An habitual aim and intention.

For the first of these, An actual intention of the spirit in every particular
action that a man does to the glory of God. It is utterly impossible in the
state and condition of this life, it is possible for Angels and glorified
Saints to do it, for they are in Gods vision, and it is all their work in
heaven, but it is impossible for us to do it here below, no it was not possible
for Adam in his inno^ency to do it.

But now secondly, There is an habitual inclination in us in every action we
do, to aim at Gods glory, though there be not the actual intention of the
spirit in every action we do. It is with us as with a man traveling toward a
town, he thinks in the morning to go to such a town; such a place he aims to
be at, at night; and therefore sets out toward it; and though he does not
think of this every step he takes, yet its his purpose in his journey to rest
there at night. Or as it is with a man who comes to Church, his end is to hear
the word of God, yet in every word he hears spoken, he has not the thought of
his end upon his spirit, but he is there by virtue of his first intention. So
here though in every particular, there be not an intention of spirit to level
this or that to this end; yet it is the drift and habitual scope of the spirit,
that Gods glory may be the end of his actions.

Nay, Thirdly, Though we are not able to do it in the actual intention, yet it
must be our care to renew our habitual intention, and as far as we can, to
draw up these habitual purposes, into actual levellings of these and these
particular actions to the glory of God. There are some go further in this than
others.

Assure your selves, the nearer you come to an actual intention of spirit for
Gods glory in particular acts, the nearer you are the life of heaven. How ever
let us so renew our first thoughts, habitual intentions, as that we may
thereby keep in the right path, the right way, till we come to our journies
end at night. So much intention a Travailer holds up as to keep him in the
right way, to keep him from going into by paths, although not so much as shall
make him in every step he takes to think of his first intention, the end of
his journey. So much for the second Character.

3. Character.
3. Sincere obedience is a fruitful obedience.

It is a growing obedience, he contents not himself with the measures he
has, but labors after perfection, Phil. 3. verse. 12. to the 15. I have not
yet attained, nor am already perfect, etc. A sincere heart he aims at the top
of all, he looks at the work it self, he propounds not to himself a shorter
end than God would have him reach unto, Gods end is his, and that is perfection;
he desires conformity to the pattern in the mount, to be holy as God is holy,
perfect as etc. An unsound heart he bounds and stints himself, at these and
these measures, and desires to go no further; fullness of holiness and
perfection of grace, is not his aim nor desire. He may desire so much, as may
serve his own turns, and ends, no more; so much as may serve his own
advantages, he desires; but cares for no more than he can make use of in the
way. As the Physician who does not desire excellency in the Science, yet he
will take in so much skill, as may serve his turn and practice; but he cares
not for more. The like I might say of any other Artist, whose spirit is not
taken with the beauty of the things themselves, yet he desires so much as may
serve ends.

Even so an unsound spirit; whose heart is nothing taken with the beauties of
holiness, yet he may desire so much as may serve his turns, his secular
advantages, but he will have no more. A Tradesman will take in somewhat, it
may be he will not swear bloody oaths in the face of his customers, this
were to drive men away, this could not stand with his ends; if he were such a
one, men would avoid him; and therefore he will take in so much as will serve
his trade, and no more: these men desire the Talent, not for the masters use,
but for their own use. So in any other. But now it is otherwise with a sincere
heart, his desire is to abound in holiness, he sees so much beauty in God, that
he cannot be at rest till he be swallowed up with God, made all like him, he
sees so much excellency in Grace, that nothing but perfection will satisfy him.
Nay, and he does not only make perfection his utmost end, but he labors after
perfection with his utmost strength and endeavors. And the ground of all this,
is, because a sincere heart looks singly to God, and therefore serves him with
all his might; while a man's heart is divided, his strength is also divided.
That man's strength is not whole for God whose heart is not so, But when God is
made the one of a man's desires, the one of a man's affections, the one of a man's
life and comfort, then will he be the one of a man's endeavors too, and a man
desires to serve God with all his might. Such men, again, give up themselves to
the service of God. Lord I am thine, says David, and therefore will do his
work with all their strength. As there are none more strong in the Devils work,
than such as have sold themselves to it; as it was said of Ahab, he sold
himself, he gave over his whole heart to sin: so there is none more
industrious in Gods work, than such as give themselves up to God, such as pass
over themselves by deed of gift to him. When a man can once say truly with them
in Isa. 44.5. One shall say, I am the Lords, etc. Then is his whole might laid
out in the service of God. Thus a sincere Obedience is a fruitful Obedience, an
abounding Obedience, as God does not stint his mercy to him, so he does not
his service to God. If indeed mercy had been bounded to us, we had been
undone, if he had said, I will pardon some sins, but not all, or if he had
said, I will pardon all, I will justify, but not sanctify; or if he had
said, I will do this, etc. but not, etc. Well, there is the third Character.

4. Character.
A sincere Obedience is a filial Obedience, it is the Obedience of a son, not
of a slave; it is voluntary, evangelical, free, willing Obedience; not a legal,
servile, and forced Obedience.

It is set down as the Character in Psalm. 110.3. Thy people are a willing
people, devoted to his laws and service; they are willing to hear, Speak Lord,
for thy Sevant hears; they are willing to do; Lord, what will thou have me
to do? Hence those breathings and aspirations of soul. Oh! that my ways, etc.
There is no task too hard, no imploiment too great. They are willing to suffer
too, to go through good reports, and bad reports, through a Sea, and through a
Wilderness, through the hottest services, and strongest oppositions for Christ;
it is a cheerful Obedience, he delights in the Law of God. As it was said of
Christ, so it may be said of him in some measure. It was meat and drink to him
to do his Fathers will; duties they are medicines to unsound spirits, but meat
to him. Hence David sets down this for a Character of a godly man, Psalm. 1.2.
His delight is in the Law of God, and Paul speaks of himself, that his delight
was in the Law of God, as concerning the inner man. And David has it up and
down, Psalm. 119. Lord, how I love thy Law! echo like, in Psalm. 40.8. I delight
to do thy will, thy Law is in my heart. There was a Principle within him
agreeable to the Precept without him. As the eye delights in seeing, the ear in
hearing, so the heart in obeying. Actions of nature, you know they are actions
of delight. So of the new nature. But this must be understood, when the
Principle within, which should yield Obedience, is not disturbed, for as it is
in nature, though it be a natural act, and full of delight for the eye to see;
yet if the eye be offended or hurt, it will breed a tediousness in the eye to
do its natural act, and that in which formerly it did take so much delight. So
here, though to obey and walk in Gods ways, be acts most suitable to the new
nature, yet if the spiritual Principles within be wounded and hurt, it may
breed some kind of wearisomeness and unwillingness in the soul to obey for the
time, which may befall the dearest of Gods Children in diverse cases, in these 7.

1. They may be damped with carnal affections. 2. They may be tired with the
difficulty of the work. 3. They may be pulled back with the prevails of
corruption. 4. They may drive heavily under some vexing and last^ng temptation.
5. In case of the spirits withdrawment of himself, which is either probational
or penal. 6. Or in the case of neglects of duty and communion with God. 7. In
case of some dangerous relapse into former sins.
Any of which, may breed a kind of weariness and unwillingness upon the soul;
yet at that time there is some willingness of the spirit, when there is a
reluctance of the flesh. And the soul will do its former works, though not with
so much cheerfulness as formerly, yet with as much Obedience, and serves God
when he hides himself.

And thus much shall now serve for this use of Trial.

We will add another use, and conclude.

Use of Exhortation. Which has four Branches.

1. Branch.
1. Get a sincere heart.

Otherwise all you do is worth nothing: I speak unto you, who do abound most in
duties, in performances; you, who pray, who hear. Oh! do you labor to get a
sincere heart in the midst of your performances? When you do any public work,
look to your hearts, beware of base ends, base aims, least they creep in, and
poison all your works. Beware of a double eye, an eye toward God, and an eye
toward your selves, when in opposition. Let it be said of all you, who put
your hand to any public works in these public times, as it was said of a
Royal Commander, that in all his actions he placed ostentation behind, and
conscience before him, and sought not the reward of a good deed from fame, but
thought the deed it self done a sufficient reward. Oh so do you! And when you
have to do with more private duties, look to your hearts, let your tongue and
heart answer one another; beware least your heart give your tongue the lie, in
speaking that your heart does not desire. I have showed, this may be done. Do
you go labor, that your heart may go with your tongue, your affections may go
hand in hand with all your expressions? Nay, rather let your expressions be
but as so many breathings from the like affections within, so many streams
issuing from a fountain and spring of affections within. My Brethren, this is
the great thing I would press upon you. The power of his Word, and light of his
Truth has brought you I suppose to a form. I hope few are among you, but will
seem to carry the outward face of Religion. Few but will pray, will hear, will
do duty. Many favor Religion, who have no savor of it. It is my desire to
exhort you who do much, that you would not lose what you do, do much; and yet
perish at last. I tell thee, if thou could heap up mountains of prayers, if
weep a Sea of tears, if thou could macerate thy self with fasting, and
humbling thy self, as many thousand years as the World has stood minutes, from
the Creation, yet without sincerity, all this is nothing. What the Apostle
says of charity, I may say of sincerity; if I speak with the tongues, etc. We
read there shall many come to Christ at the last day, and say, have not we
preached? have not we prayed, and prophesied? fasted? etc? They thought they
had great wrong done them, why should not Christ save them as well as any
others? why not accept of their works as well as of others? and meaner than
these too. Why here was the ground and reason, there was a want of sincerity,
they had but served themselves in serving him, and therefore he does not own
them. Oh! then let me exhort you all, who are much in duties, labor to get
sincerity to accompany all. You hear, you pray, etc. get sincere hearts in
hearing, in praying, etc. The rather,

1. Motive.
1. Because sincerity sets a value and price upon the meanest work, it makes
the meanest action acceptable unto God. We read, Cant. 5.1. Christ is said to
drink of the Milk as well as the Wine, to eat of the Honey, etc. That is, to
accept of the meanest work and performance; when there is sincerity to
accompany it, Milk, etc. A sigh, a groan, a tear, a breathing of the spirit
shall find acceptance where the heart is upright, which I told you cannot be,
if there be the love and liking of the least sin. God delights more in the
imperfect breathings of a sincere heart, when there is not strength to bring
forth an expression, than he does in all the flourishes and glorious
expressions of an unsound heart. Sincerity makes the meanest works mighty with
God; it puts weight and value to all. A work does not make up the want of
sincerity, but sincerity will make up the want in a work, as in Asah, 1 King.
15.14. he will own the weakest duty, if sincerity be in it; He will not
refuse our works, as we do gold, not because it wants goodness, but
greatness; he will not reject them for want of grains, if the gold be good.
He has a merciful allowance for such works, where the heart is sincere in
the doing of them, though the things done be attended with many
imperfections. And that is the first Motive.

2. Motive.
2. Because sincerity distinguishes all our works from the works of others.
The day is coming, when the persons and works of men shall be distinguished
one from another. And as you would have your persons distinguished from others
at the great day, when Christ shall come to separate the precious and the
vile, the Sheep from the Goats, the good from the bad: you would then be glad
to have your works distinguished, when all the works of men are to be tried
and burned with fire, to see whether they will endure trial, yea or no; you
would be glad then to have something in your works, to distinguish them from
others that are to perish. Why then, if ever you would have that, labor now to
get Sincerity. Sincerity will do this, it will set such a stamp, such a
Character upon them, as no false coin, no work of any Hypocrite can have, and
therefore labor for it.

3. Motive.
3. Because otherwise all thy prayers, thy tears, thy duties, all is lost, and
that is a sad case. If a man had laid out much pains and cost about a work, he
would be sorry to lose all he had done for want of a little more. You have
done much, it may be, suffered much in the ways of God, would you not now
lose all your former labors, all your prayers, all your tears, your many sad
hours spent in the ways of godliness, would you not lose all in conclusion;
Oh! labor to get a sincere heart: if not, you will assuredly lose the things
you have wrought, God will never own them. Though the things be materially
good in themselves, as what better than praying, hearing? etc. yet if the heart
be not sincere in them, God will never own them. You see it in the first of
Isaiah: the works were good, and such as God had commanded, such as his soul
delighted in, yet wanting this sincerity, all was nothing, etc.

4. Motive.
4. Because sincerity is the chiefest thing God eyes in men, the main thing
which God now desires under the Gospel. God looks not for a legal perfection
from you, in respect of legal, actual, universal, personal Obedience, he
desires sincerity, and that under the Gospel, is perfection.

5. Motive.
5. Sincerity will afford us comfort in the saddest times, of our soul or body,
in our spiritual and temporal sorrows, etc. when other things cannot minister
comfort, when duties and prayers must stand afar off, and are not able to reach
forth any comfort to us, yet sincerity can. In the greatest darkness of the
soul, when the soul is compassed with thick darkness, sincerity will open a
Casement, and thereby let light into the soul, Psalm. 112.4. Unto the upright
there arises light in darkness, in the darkest; whereas Hypocrisy is like
painted windows, keeps out light; Sincerity will be like windows of Glass,
transparent, let in light.

6 Motive.
6 Sincerity does fence the heart against apostasy, Partial and Total.

We will now come to the means to get a sincere heart, Cure Hypocrisy. Which is
in which I shall endeavor to apply my self to the cure of an hypocrite.

But before I come to lay down the means of cure, I must tell you this.

1 It is a difficult cure. 2 A painful cure.
1 A difficult cure. 1 Hard to cure.
It is one of the hardest cures are wrought upon the souls of men. A cure
seldom wrought. We have heard of a bloody and Idolatrous Manasses, an unclean
Mary, an oppressing Publican, a persecuting Paul, and many other fearful, and
great, open, and notorious sinners wrought upon, brought to life. But where
have we read of the return of a Judas, of a Simon Magus? where do we read of
one example of such as have been gross hypocrites, who have afterward been
savingly wrought upon?

I confess it is all one with God, to do the one, as the other, it is as easy
with him to change the heart of an hypocrite, as any other, for infinite power
and grace knows no difference, but it is a thing not so usually done; And
though as easy in respect of God, yet more difficult quoad nos. And so I would
have you understand me, that the difficulty is in respect of us.

1 It is hard to convince such a man that he needs a cure, 1 Hard to Convince.
you see it in Rev. 3. verse. 16, 17. God tells them they were lukewarm, neither
hot nor cold, there was their distemper; and yet you see what thoughts they had
of themselves, in the 17. verse. Thou say, thou art rich, and increased in
goods, and have need of nothing, and know not that thou art wretched, and
miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. So you see it is hard to convince
such a man. Another man is easily convinced, the very lives of them who are
holy, are convictions to his Conscience, and if the word be held out, he is
ready to fall down, as not able to stand up under the light and evidence of it.
In such men we have a friend within them, even their own natural consciences
are on our side, and ready to take part with us against themselves, and fly in
their own faces, telling them such and such things ought not to be done. But
now in the other, neither the examples of holy men, nor precepts of the word,
do so far convince them; for in outward appearance, they walk as blamelesly
as the best. Nay and natural Conscience is also for them, and being satisfied
with some general performances of duty, is ready to take part with them, and to
withstand any conviction that can be alleged. You see this in the Scribes and
Pharisees, they walked blamelesly in the general to the eyes of the world, as
you hearby his confession in opposition to the Publican; and they fasted and
prayed, and did much, and by that the mouth of conscience was stopped, the
quarrels of conscience were answered, and you find how hard it was for Christ
himself to convince them. They were so far from being convinced by his example,
that they thought themselves more strict than he; he did, but they would not
accompany themselves with sinners, and therefore they gave ou^the was a wine
bibber, a glutton, a friend of Publicans; and for his doctrine, this was so
far from convincing them, that they thought their lives more strict than his
precepts; they were followers of the Law, exact and rigid in legal observances,
and thought his doctrine too licentious, too full of liberty for them. So that
is the first, it is hard to convince them.

Hard to humble them.
2 It is hard to humble them. Humiliation follows conviction, if hard to
convince, hard to humble. Do we denounce threatenings against sinners? alas!
they are none of them, these threatenings do not concern them but others, for
their parts they walk unblameably in the world. It is not the mercyes, nor the
judgments, the promises, nor the threatenings, the word, nor the works of God
which humble them. In others there may be some natural tenderness, some remorse
of spirit when they hear of Gods judgments against sin. But for this man; it
is not all the terrors of the Lord, not all the humbling breaking discoverys of
sin, or judgment which fasten upon him to humble him. No man's heart so hard as
the Hypocrites, he has not only a natural hardness, but a contracted
hardness; nay a fortified and strengthened hardness, his heart is fortified
against all reproof, against all the denunciations of wrath and judgment. You
have a taste of it in the Scribes and Pharisees. You know they were Hypocrites,
he who knew their hearts, better than they knew their own, tells them so. And
it was not all the miracles he did in his life, nor all the wonders which he
showed at his death, which could break and humble their hard hearts; you see
the Sun was darkened, the earth quakes and trembles, the vail of the Temple was
rent, the graves open, the rocks cleave asunder, yet all this does not move
their hard hearts.

Hard to reclaim them.
3 It is hard to reclaim them, for

1 The Devil has got greater power in them than in others.

2 The Forts of Sin and Satan are more strengthened in them.

3 The means of reclaiming less efficacious. He is able to sit out Sermons
and duties without any manner of working upon his spirit at all. That which
moves others, moves not him, which works upon the hearts of others, does leave
his heart unwrought upon. He is a man, as I told you, prayer-proof,
Sermon-proof, and Ordinance-proof; no Mercy, no judgment, no promise, no
threatening, no word, no works, no prayer, no Sacraments, no physic, no salve,
no counsel, no advice, no light of nature, no light of example, no private
help, no public exhortation prevails with his heart; he is a man in the
fore-lorn hope; his condition near desperate. Custom in the use of things,
does take away the power of working. You see in your bodies a little thing
works upon the humors, when you are not used to it; whereas if accustomed to
it, a much greater will not stir the humors.

I have read that Mithridates by accustoming himself to eat Poison, at last
durst venture upon poison as meat, nothing did hurt him. The customable use of
things, takes away the power of working. So it is here, the custom of
Ordinances in a formal way, does take away the power of working by them. You
see it in the Sacrament; may be, when you came first to the Sacrament, then
Conscience had some natural tenderness in it, and you came trembling to this
Ordinance, fearing lest you should profane it, and by that eat and drink your
own Condemnation. But now the custom of profanation, has taken away the
terror of profaning this Ordinance; now you come and tremble not. So for the
word, time was, when Conscience was green and tender, that the word came with
more majesty, more authority on your spirits. Every command came with power,
every threat came with trembling; but now you can sit under the most powerful,
quickening, convincing, awaking, dispensations of it, and your souls never
moved. And hence is it, that your custom with the Ordinances in a customary
way, takes off the life, and power, and workings of Ordinances. As custom in
sin does harden the heart, and makes the heart more difficult to be wrought
upon: so custom in duty if it be done in a formal customable way. I would
rather deal, and should have more hopes of doing good to him who is openly
profane, notoriously wicked, than such a man who lies soaking under
Ordinances, and goes on in a formal and customable performance of these dutys,
without any spirit or life in the doing of them. Thus you see the first, it is a
difficult cure.

2 It is a painful cure. It is a painful cure.
It will cost thee much pain, many gripes and greifs, many Prayers and tears,
much humiliation and sorrow before it can be wrought. Nay, it is a cure wrought
by undoing all that thou have done, thou must unravel all, unpray thy prayers
undo thy services. Thou must not go forward in the way wherein thou art, but
must come back all the way thou have gone, and go another way, if ever thou
come to heaven. And this will cost a man some pain. Suppose a man were going to
some place, and had gone much of his journey, were now come, (as he thought)
near his journeys end, and one should come to him, and tell him; Sir you are
clean out of the way, you must go back again, unride all this way you have
come, etc. O! how irksome, how hardly would this down with a man at the end of
his journey? especially the way being pleasant wherein he was, and full of
delight, but the other rough and foul in which he was to go. Alas! would he
say, is there no way but turning back? is it not possible to strike over? this
is irksome. Why so is it with a man here, it may be thou have set out for
heaven, and thou have gone all thy life in a fair smooth way, and art now come,
as thou think; even to the end of thy journey. And will it not be a hard
thing for a man to turn back, to begin in another way, and that a straiter, a
rougher, and a deeper way? Why I tell thee, this must be done before ever thou
come to heaven.

It is with a sound Christian and an Hypocrite, as it is with two men, at the
top of two houses in a narrow street, one would think that they could easily
come to one another, easily reach, but the truth is, he must come down the
height where he is, before he can go up to him: A gross and open sinner, is
nearer to him, than a formal hypocrite. As Christ says, Easier for Publicans
and Harlots, etc.

And now judge, is it not a very hard thing and difficult, for a man to undo
all he has done, to give up all for lost, to come down from the height to
which he has attained, not without much pains. To turn back that way, wherein
he has ridden with much difficulty. This is a hard thing, etc. what flesh and
blood can bear this.

So that it is not only a difficult, but a painful cure.

1 In respect of the medicines that are to be applied; hard physic, humbling,
lancing, cutting, dismembring, cutting off right hands, etc.

2 In respect of the distemper wherewith these medicines are to encounter.

3 In respect of the pains, gripes, griefs, you must endure in the cure.

But this I cannot insist upon. The truth is, the cure is so painful, that
your spirits would rather continue the disease, than submit to the plaster.
But now though the cure be difficult, it is possible, it is easy with God, though
hard to us. And if God have given thee a heart to desire a cure, and a spirit
willing to submit to any means may be used, it is a fair way toward the cure.
Well then to come to the cure it self. Having searched thy spirit, and upon
diligent search discovered Hypocrisy.

Means of cure.
1. Labor to convince thy heart of the evil and mischief of an unsound spirit.
It is a thing which makes thy person, thy performance odious unto God, he
hates thy person, he hates thy prayers, as you see, Isa. 1.14. Your new Moons,
and your Sabbaths, and your appointed feasts, my soul hates them; which yet
were high extraordinary services. And now judge what a fearful thing it is to
stand under the hatred of the great God of Heaven and Earth. What do thou
think will be the end of thee? why you shall see, Matthew. 24. and the last.
Thou shall be cast into the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, and not
only cast in, but into the hottest place, where there shall not be a drop of
water to a lake of fire. For it is said of all other sinners, that they shall
have their portion with Hypocrites. The Hypocrite shall have the largest
portion, he is the top of that black crew of damned souls. For the present
thou losest all the good in Earth which others do enjoy, and for the future
thou losest all the good in Heaven, which others shall enjoy. Nay, and thou
gainest sorer, sharper, more unsupportable damnation, than others shall have.
Thy duties, thy prayers, thy hearings which would have ministered comfort to
thee, if they had been right; do now aggravate and increase thy torment, being
unsound. Every Sermon, Prayer, Duty, is but as another stick carried to that
structure of fire, to make it hotter, and greater for thee, because done with
an unsound spirit.

2. Consider there is a God. 2. Means.
Atheism is a great ground of Hypocrisy, and there is no man more an Atheist,
than an Hypocrite. Well then, think there is a God. I tell thee, the very
belief of this would strike down many base ends, which thou have in thy service
of him. And think him to be such a God as he is. That this God is an
all-seeing God, one who searches the heart, who tries the reins. One who
knows the secret turnings and windings of thy deceitful soul. Though thou
may dissemble it with men, be one thing upon the stage, another thing in
the tyring house; one thing in action, another thing in heart and affection.
Yet thou can not dissemble with God, before whom thou lie open, cut up to
the back bone, anatomized, all thy internals are seen, as the Word signifies in
Heb. 4.13.

This thought brought home, and suffered to lie upon thy spirit in serious
consideration, would e'ne half work the cure, it would cure all gross
Hypocrisy; strike down all by-ends, and base ends, which thy spirit aims at in
the doing of holy duties, and would do much in the cure of close Hypocrites,
in the mending of false Principles; an honest heart would not be false to
God, though God should not see him, he loves God, he is the friend of God,
and you know a friend will be true to his friend, as well absent from him
as present with him, when he sees him not, as well as when his eyes are on
him. But I am not now to deal with a true sincere heart. I am laying down
means for the cure of a false heart, and a great one this is. Think and believe
there is a God, and this God an all-seeing God, who knovvs thy heart and
spirit. And as he is all eye to see, so he is all hand to punish thee, if thy
heart be not sound with him.

3. Means.
3. Means of cure is; Thou must be new made, the way to mend thee, is to new
make thee; thou must be all undone again; taken in pieces, and made up again,
before ever thou can be better. Some peecing and patching up will not serve
the turn, but thou must have a new making, before thou be better. There is no
mending the stream, till there be an healing of the fountain. The fountain and
spring within thee is infected and corrupted, the heart is unsound, and what
can be expected from an unclean heart, but unclean acts? from an unsound
spirit, but unsound services? and therefore this must be made new before ever
you be cured. Thou must have a new Judgment, for thou see by a false light.
Thou must have a new will, for this is corrupt. Thou must have a new heart, for
this is desperately wicked. I tell thee, there is no mending thee, but by new
making thee. You may go and patch up your selves, but it is but like the
putting of a new piece of cloth into an old garment, it breaks out again, and
the rent will be made worse.

4. Means.
4. Is Prayer, which is instar omnium. Oh! desire God with David, to make thy
heart sound in his Statutes, sound in Prayer, sound in hearing, sound in
obedience. That all thou do may arise from right Principles, have a right
rise, go by a right rule, and be directed to a right end. Pray that God would
give thee sound Principles, and sound purposes. That that little measure of
Grace he implanteth in thee, may be accompanied with abundance of sincerity
and truth of heart.

And having gotten a sincere heart, let it be your care to fence and guard
your heart against Hypocrisy.

I will give you but one preservative which is this.

1. Before you go upon any duty, clear the sincerity of your hearts, make your
end as high as may be. Set out aright, loose off well, begin in God, in Gods
strength, in Gods grace, in Gods assistance. A good beginning, will make as
good a close.

2. When thou art upon the duty, then look to thy heart, suffer no base, no
by-ends to steal in, to poison all thou do. Keep thine eye steadfast upon God
in the doing of the duty. Do the duty as if there were no men, no hopes, no
fears, no rewards in the World, as if none but God and thou were in the World.

3. Afterward when the duty is done, if there has been any thing, if God have
quickened, enlarged, inflamed, humbled thy heart, give God all the glory.
Beware least it be with thee, as it was with Paul, and his company, that when
a fire is kindled, a viper come out of the heat. Has God kindled a fire in thy
heart, warmed, inflamed thy spirit? Oh! beware that a viper come not out of the
heat, a viper of pride, of vain glory. Know this, they that seek Gods glory in
the work, will give God the glory, when the work is done. If then there have
been any good, let God inherit all the glory; but if any evil, take it to thy
self, for it came from thee, and let it be thy work to lament it, to be
humbled for it.

And now this Rule will be of special use. There are four uses.

1. This will fence thy heart, guard and strengthen thy heart against
Hypocrisy; this will keep out Hypocrisy, here is no place of entrance for it.

2. It will keep down Hypocrisy; for Hypocrisy gets no ground so long as it is
seen and mourned for.

3. This clears the heart in the main, that thou art no Hypocrite, though there
may be Hypocrisy in thee, yet being seen, fought against, mourned for,
resisted; it reigns not, it shall not denominate thee an Hypocrite.

4. It will clear thee of the sin of Hypocrisy; God will never charge thee for
that which thou chargest thy self withal; he will not impute that to thee
which thou imputest to thy self. That which is thy misery, God will never
impute to thee as sin. Hypocrisy seen, mourned for, sighed under, resisted,
fought and prayed against, shall never be a condemning Hypocrisy. And so much
shall now serve for the first branch of the exhortation, with the motives to
get sincerity, with the remedies to cure Hypocrisy, and preservatives against
it.

Second Branch of the Exhortation is. Having gotten, Clear sincerity.
labor to clear this to your own souls, that your hearts are sincere. It is a
thing possible to be cleared, a man may come to evidence to himself the
sincerity of his own graces and gracious performances. And it is a thing
necessary to be known, in respect of your peace, of your comfort. So
necessary, that you can neither live with comfort, nor dye with comfort, unless
you be able in some measure to clear the sincerity of your hearts, the
integrity of your spirits. And being a thing so necessary, I will here lay down
some Rules and directions, for the better inabling of you to this present duty.

1. Rule.
1. Make a through and sound search, deceits lie low, Hypocrisy is spun of a
fine thread, and is not discerned without diligent search. A false evidence is
the fruit of a superficial search. Though gross Hypocrisy is seen without
search, yet close Hypocrisy must be narrowly searched into, otherwise you shall
not be able to discover it. Here you must not only read over your selves in
your actions, but in your affections, not only in your practices, but also in
your Principles. Hypocrisy lies low, it is a root sin, The heart of man is
deceitful above measure, says the Lord, who knows it? Jer. 17.9. like a
crested picture, on the one side an Angel, on the other a Devil. And I must
tell you, that sin lies at the bottom of a deceitful heart, and therefore it
will ask some pains to discover it. It was a fair speech of the Children of
Israel, Deuteronomy. 5.29. Whatever the Lord shall say unto us, we will do. And it
may be they meant as they spoke for the time, they were not aware of deceit in
their hearts. But he that saw further into them, than they into themselves,
discovered deceit to lie at the bottom, below, which they were not aware of,
and therefore it follows, O that there were such an heart in my people! alas!
it is but a present pang of conscience, there is no such heart in them. So it
was well spoken of Hazael, 2 King. 8.12, 13. when Elisha told him what bloody
cruelties he should exercise toward Israel. Is thy servant a Dog, says he,
he thought the Prophet did him a great deal of wrong; what, should ever he
exercise such beastly cruelty? but he saw not the bottom of his heart, as was
seen after in the next Chapter. So it was well spoken by them in Jer. 42.6,
7.20, 21. When the Princes desired Jeremy to inquire of the Lord, whether they
should go, and bound themselves with an oath to obey, whithersoever God bade
them go, they would go. But there was a deceit lay low, they had a secret
resolution to go into Egypt, and thought God would have sent them thither, and
then they would have been taken for an obedient people. But when the message
came contrary, they showed the falseness and hollowness of their spirit, and
fall into flat contradiction against the word of the Lord. The word that thou
have spoken we will not do. And therefore seeing the heart is so exceedingly
deceitful, there is great need of thorough search and trial of our spirits. If
you take the first verdict the heart gives up, you are likely to be deceived,
and therefore we are to observe the Apostles Rule, 2 Cor. 13.5. to examine and
prove; that is, not only to examine, and so take the first Evidence the heart
gives up, but prove the Evidence, whether it be true or no. Deceits lie low.
As for example.

Enquiry is made whether I have Faith, etc.

2. Rule.
2. Labor to acquaint thy self with the most sure and clearing Evidences of
sincerity, and try thy heart by them. It may be, thou hear the Word, and
perhaps with joy, thou bewailest sin, and perhaps with tears; thou avoidest
gross sins with care, thou opposest common corruptions with zeal. All these are
comfortable signs, but they are not infallible evidences of Grace. For what is
in all this which Ahab, which Saul, which Herod, which Judas had not? It is a
great deal of wisdom in the trial of our selves, to be acquainted with those
sorts of evidences, which are of a clearing nature, of which I will give you
two properties.

1. Those Evidences which are clearing, are such as the Word does countenance;
What ever evidences the Word does not countenance, they are but the
presumptions of our own heart, and never give us comfort in life or death. It
is the book must cast us, or clear us, at the last day.

A second property of clearing evidences. They must be such as are universally
reciprocal, distinctive evidences. That is, such evidences as are incompatible
with any whose hearts are not sincere, and concomitant with them whose hearts
are sincere. They must be such as are essential to a Christian as a Christian.
If there be any who has them, and is not a Christian, is not sincere, or any,
who is a Christian sincere, and has them not, they are not right. They must
be such as do manifest every person in whom they are to be sincere, and do
discover, where ever they are not, what ever shows they have, they are not
sincere.

I have told you formerly on another subject, that what ever another man may do
or have, and yet not be in Christ, yet not be sincere, will never be a
sufficient evidence to me, that having or doing that, I am sincere. And by
these two properties there will be a great deal cast down from being clearing
evidences, if I had time to insist on them. Thou prays, thou hears, thou do
much in the ways of God, but this will not be enough to clear thy sincerity,
for I have showed you that a man may do all this, and more too, yet not
sincere, and therefore these will be no clearing evidences. And therefore let
us go by this rule, examine what are those clearing evidences of your
sincerity, and examine your selves by them.

Obj. But how shall I know what are those heart-clearing evidences, that so I
may examine my self by them?

Answ. I have showed you some properties, you see of evidences of this nature.
I have also cast down many from being sufficient to clear your sincerity. We
will now give you some which are clearing evidences.

1 Some taken from the disposition of mourning. Demonstrations of sincerity in
1. Mourning in part of Sin.


1 An Hypocrite cannot mourn for all sin, it may be he may mourn for general,
for common, and sensual sins, but not for close, spiritual and secret
sins, his unbeleef, his hypocrisy, pride.

2 An hypocrite cannot mourn for sin as sin; for sin in its own nature, but as
clad with wrath and punishment. Now then, if God have given thee a heart to
mourn for all sins, and for sin as sin; it is an evidence of thy sincerity.

1 An hypocrite cannot mourn for the want of fullness of ordinances. 2 Of
Ordinances want.
2 Nor can he mourn for want of any Ordinance, out of discovery of the beauty
and excellency in them. Now then, if God give thee a heart to mourn for, etc.

3 An Hypocrite cannot mourn for sins of others, 3 In sin of others.
nor 2 for the want of growth in himself. If therefore God has given thee such
a heart etc. thou must conclude thine own sincerity.

Sincerity of Desires.
2 For matter of desires.

1 He cannot desire the death of all sin, he has some darling, etc.

2 He cannot desire the death of any sin, as sin, but for other respects. If
therefore God has given thee a heart desirous to be purged, as well as
pardoned, that desires the death of all, and of sin, as sin, etc.

Again in point of desire of grace. 1 An Hypocrite does not desire all grace,
there are some he would not own, he loves not universal exactness. 2 He
desires not any grace as grace, in its own native beauty and excellency, but at
times, death, etc. and then as a stalking horse. If therefore God has given
thee a heart to desire and thrist after all grace, exact conformity to God in
all things, and to desire grace, as grace, etc.

Of Affections. 1 To God.
3 For matters of affections. 1 An Hypocrite cannot love God for himself. 2 He
cannot love God as God, as in his own nature, so contrary. If therefore God
has given thee a heart to love him for himself, etc.

To Sain^s
2 Again toward the Saints.

1 An Hypocrite he loves not all the Saints, some he may, not all. 2 He
loves not the Saints as the Saints, but for other respects. If therefore God
has given thee a heart to love all Saints, poor godliness, as well as rich,
grace in russet and gray, as well as grace in Silks, etc. And to love them as
Saints, as having the image of Christ on them. To have communion with them, to
love brotherly communion, to love them most, where you see most grace, etc.

So for hatred.

1 He hates not all sin. 2 He hates no sin, as sin, if any at all. Now if God
has given thee a heart, etc.

3 To Ordinances.
So again. 1 He loves not all the Ordinances. 2 He loves not any Ordinance as an
Ordinance. He has no savor in an Ordinance, he has no prizing of an
Ordinance, he has no hunger after an Ordinance, no rejoicing in an Ordinance,
no care to walk answerable to the Ordinances. If then God has given thee a
heart to do all this, these are special evidences.

Thus you see in brief I have showed you a taste of clearing evidences, by
which you may examine your own spirits, etc.

3 General Rule.
3 If you would clear your sincerity, then remember this Rule. Take not up your
evidences from the carriage of your spirits, either when they are at best, or
when they are at worst, but in a middle way; wherein thou art most thy self,
this will best clear your sincerity. If thou seek for an evidence when thy
spirit is at the worst, thou may sometime find it too low to afford thee any
thing; if at the best, thou may find it too high to be a continuing evidence,
and so in the one thou may be discouraged, in the other deceived, many have
flashes of affection in some present heat, who yet have not soundness of
spirit in them. Herod heard the Word with joy, here was a heat, but all his joy
would not enable him to part with his Herodias, no soundness. Let it be your
wisdom to take up your evidences in a middle way, neither when at best, nor
when at worst, that is your most constant frame, and that temper is most thy
self; in the other we are carried above our selves in comforts; or cast below
our selves in temptations, and there is no sure judging, not the best judging
of the frame.

4 Rule.
4 Judge not of the sincerity of thy spirit by some particular acts. But let
the constant frame of your spirits and general conversation discover it. If
particular actions might determine the case, we should sometime conclude those
unsound, who are sincere, and them sincere, who are yet unsound. You may look
upon a child of God, and see him sometimes to have his planetical and
extravagant motions, though the constant course and bent of his spirit be
Godward. We read of David murdering, and committing adultery, fearful sins!
We read of Joseph swearing, Job cursing the day of his Nativity, falling out
with his stars, Jonah vexing, Peter denying, Thomas not believing. And if you
judge by the particular Acts, though exceeding bad, you will condemn the
generation of the just.

On the Contrary, you shall see Pharaoh desiring the prayer of Moses, Balaam in
a good mood, desiring to dye the death of the righteous, Saul condemning of
himself, Ahab humbling of himself, Ninevey repenting, Foelix trembling, Herod
hearing John Baptist joyfully. And if we now judge by these particular actions,
though seemingly good, we shall justify those whom God condemns.

We have a maxim in Logic, that no general Rule can be stablished upon a
particular instance; and another, that no particular instance can overthrow a
general rule. So here, as no man can safely conclude from no better premises,
than from some few actions, though in themselves materially and substantially
good, that the heart is therefore sincere. So on the contrary, no man ought to
conclude, because of some planetical and extravagant motions, that a man's heart
is unsound. We are not to judge of sincerity, by some particular actions good
or evil, but we are to take up our judgment of our selves by the general
frame, bent and disposition of a man's heart, together with his general and
constant conversation in the ways of God, and this will best discover our
selves to our selves. So much for the fourth Rule.

5. Rule.
5 The fifth Rule whereby we shall be enabled to clear the sincerity of our
hearts, is; Be careful to read your spirits, and take exact notice of your
hearts at sometimes more especially. God in the wisdom of his Providence, does
single out some special times, wherein he discovers the hypocrisy of the
unsound, and declares the sincerity of his own. It is very seldom that God
does suffer a man to end his days, before he have tried him, and so discovered
him one way or another. The young man in the Gospel went on fairly for a long
time, and it is like, thought his condition good enough, but at last you see,
Christ put him to the trial, and by that discovered to him the unsoundnesse of
his heart. Herod he went on fairly for a time, he heard John, he heard him
often; he heard him gladly, nay, and reformed too in many things, but at last
God discovered his unsoundness, God uncased him, and made known the deceit of
his heart. So Saul went on for a while, but at last God discovered him, So
Simon Magus and Balaam. And as God has times for the discovery of Hypocrisy in
the wicked, so he has some special times and occasions, wherein he does
discover the sincerity of his own people. Moses was a holy man, but he had the
time of his trial, he might have been esteemed the son of Pharaohs
Daughter, have enjoyed all the plenty and honor of the Court; but he refused
to be called the son of Pharaohs daughter, slighted, all that honor, and
chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the
pleasures of sin, which are but for a season, here was the discovery of his
sincerity, Heb. 11.24, 25.

Abraham he was a holy man, but yet he passed through times of trial too. And
they were great ones. To name but one, God commanded him to offer up his son in
sacrifice, here was a trial, a great trial, Genesis 22.2.

1 Had he been only to have parted with a dutiful Servant, it had been
something, but to part with a Son, that is more.

2 If with a Son, yet but an adopted son, the trial had not been so great,
but this was a natural son.

3 If with a natural son, yet if he had been but one of many, that trial had
not been so great, but this was not only his own, but his only son.

4 If with his own Son, if with his only son, yet if Abraham had been young,
and so probable to have had more, the trial had not been so great. But it was
with his own, his only son, and the son of his old age, he was never like to
have more.

5 Nay yet further, though he had been, etc. yet if he had been an Ismael, and
not an Isaac, the trial had not been so great, but it was to part with his
Isaac, a Child of many prayers, and of many promises, and in whom his heart
delighted.

6. And again, if he had been to part with him in the ordinary way of nature,
by natural death, the trial not so great; but he was to part with him in a
Sacrifice, wherein he was to be mangled and cut in pieces.

7. But yet had another been the executioner of his child, it had been some
mitigation: But Abraham himself must be his executioner, he must do this sad
act.

And not to do it among his friends, who perhaps might have stepped in, and
comforted him in this trial; but he was to go three days journey to an
unknown place, and there he was to take away the life of him he loved so
dearly. Yet herein Abraham obeyed Gods command, and therein showed his
sincerity. When the Precept of trial might seem to contradict the Precept of
Obedience, when his dutiful Obedience to the one, might seem to speak his
undutifulness to the other; yet herein he declared his sincerity. Whereupon
God tells him, now I know thou loves me, when now thou have made it known, now
thou have discovered thy sincerity, seeing thou have not withheld thy only
son, Genesis 22.12. here was sincerity, now I know thou fear God. The like I
might instance in Job, in David, in Mordecai, they had their discovering times,
times of trial. So that God does still single out some special times wherein
he discovers the sincerity of his own people. And if you would be ever able
to clear your sincerities, read the carriage of your hearts at these special
times. One quarter of an hour may give a man surer evidence of his sincerity or
hypocrisy, than all the time of his life besides.

There are five special times, wherein you may have the advantage, Read your
spirits in times of
if you be careful, to read your own spirits, to clear the sincerity of your
hearts.

1. In times of darkness and temptation. 1. Darkness.
Read the actings and goings out of your spirits at such times; an unsound
spirit will now fall from God, desist in his duty, strike sail. But the sound
spirit, he will hold closer to God, Cujus faciem timer, ejus faciem invoca^.
and follow him when he seems to forsake him. He will go on to love him,
although he be not able to clear whether ever he shall be beloved of him.
He will repent of sin, though he be not able to evidence whether ever God
will pardon sin. He will go on to obey and serve God, though he be not able
to determine whether ever God will reward his obedience or no. Such like
dispositions do now break forth in a sincere heart, in the times of greatest
darkness, which in times of clearer manifestation have no occasion to show
themselves. And these are the most undoubtedst evidences of your sincerity,
which perhaps you shall ever meet withal in your lives. As wicked men do
discover their greatest corruptions in their highest advancements; so Gods
people do discover, and exert, and put forth the highest acts of grace in their
lowest and meanest conditions. As the Sun shows greatest glory when it is
lowest, when setting. So, etc.

As Christ set out the greatest acts of divinity in his lowest abasements, then
he sealed up the beams of the Sun, rent rocks, graves open, the earth
trembles, etc. So the Saints, etc. This is that the Psalmist says, unto the
upright there arises light in darkness. Where the heart is unsound, it is dark
in the greatest light; so on the contrary, there is light in the greatest
darkness. Hypocrisy is like painted windows which let in no light; sincerity is
like windows of Glass.

Times of manifestation.
2. See how your hearts and spirits work toward God, and toward sin in times
of light, and clearer manifestations of God. Where the heart is unsound,
comfort does him no good, he will do something in a storm, then perhaps pray,
etc. but he will do nothing in a calm. Comforts make him more careless, more
loose, more remiss in his Christian way. Where on the contrary, he who has a
sound spirit, as he is carried strongly toward God, when he withholds his
manifestations: so if God do but let in a beam of his Countenance into his
soul, he rejoices more in it, than in a World. Nay, and these comforts do
quicken him to further duty, he cannot lie at anchor, but he must launch out
into the deep, and lay out himself, his parts, his abilities, etc. I have
sometimes told you that quickness and comfort may be separated, a man may have
comfort without quickness, he may have joy without life. But quickening was
never separated from comfort. A man cannot have joy, but there will be life,
etc. Affections are like tinder, and Comfort like sparks, not a spark of
comfort can fall upon the heart, but the whole soul is set a fire, and carried
strongly on after God. Comforts from God ever lead the soul to communion with
God.

Of outward distress.
3. See how your spirits do work toward God, in times of outward distress and
calamities upon you. 1 An unsound spirit, he is for the most part proud and
impatient under Gods hand, and ready to think God does him wrong in afflicting
him. But where the spirit is sincere, he is humble, he is patient, he lays
his mouth in the dust, kisseth the rod, and accepts of the punishment of his
iniquity, as you see the phrase, Levit. 26.41. Example in Aaron. 2. Again, an
unsound spirit, he roars under the lashes, Flagella dolent, quare flagellantur
non dolent.
cries under the affliction, never complains of the sin. As you see, Jer.
30.15. Why cryest thou, etc. But where the heart is sincere, no evil troubles
him, so much as the evil of sin. You see it in David, when plagued. 3. Again,
an unsound spirit, he desires to have the stroke removed, not to have his
heart amended. The other desires rather the amending of his heart, than the
removal of the stroke. Says Bernard, I had rather God should better my heart,
than remove his hand, rather continue my strokes, Malim erudiri quam ^ru^.
than my sins. You see this in Job, when Gods hand was on him, Job 34.32. That
which I see not, teach thou me, and if I have done iniquity, I will do it no
more; as if he had said, Lord I know not the particular cause of this
distress, what it is thou aims at, what I see not, teach thou, etc.

4. A fourth time, Of Prosperity.
wherein to read your hearts is in times of prosperity. An unsound spirit grows
worse by mercy; mercy, deadens, s^^^^ens his heart, Isa. 26.10 Let favor be
showed, etc. Hazael professed much when he was low, but no sooner advance^,
but mark then how he acted against God, his Church and people, endeavoring to
make his raising their ruin. So Saul, Jehu. Where now on the contrary, where
the heart is sound, all their raisings, raise God, God is advanced in all their
advancements.

And the higher God sets up them, the higher will they endeavor to raise and
set up God, his glory, his cause, his people. M^^cies on an enemy strengthen
him to sin, but on a friend strengthen to service, he is but a man of greater
ability to serve God. Many think if they were but so rich, so great; Oh how
would they advance God and his cause! how make all to serve him, but thy heart
may deceive thee, if thy heart be not sound, the higher God raises thee, the
lower thou will lay him, the more good God does for thee, the more evil thou will do to him. It is a special time to read your spirits, to see to your
sincerity, in time of prosperity. There is no trial in afflictions alone, they
have something in them may make men humble, meek, etc. but look to them in
times of prosperity of a Church, Religion, cause of God. Many men have stood
firm in the times of affliction of a Church, which stagger, fall back in times
of redemption of a Church. That is the saddest. It is no strange thing for men
to stagger, to fall in the times of a declining in the Church, for fear, etc.
But that is a corrupt heart indeed, corrupt with a witness that falls away in
prosperity. That is the fourth time.

5. See how your spirits work in time of difficulty of danger. Of Danger.
An unsound heart thinks how he may avoid the danger; a sincere spirit, how
he may avoid the sin, Heb. 12.4. striving against sin, not against danger;
trouble, but against sin; to keep their consciences pure and undefiled. An
unsound spirit thinks how he may save his carcass, a sound Christian how he
may keep his conscience. As Epaminondas who resolved to keep his buckler, or
dye for it, being wounded to death,

Cries out, number salvus clypeus meus? intimating he was not hurt, if his
buckler were safe. What he of his buckler, a sincere heart cries out of his
conscience, number salva conscientia? An unsound spirit he sees and judges his
safety sometimes to lie in the neglect of duty, and therefore in times of
danger he will bank and decline his duty, for fear of man. But a sound spirit,
he sees his safety to lie in the doing of his duty, and his danger in the
neglect of it. An unsound spirit will rather choose sin than affliction, Job
36.21. But where the spirit is sincere, he will rather choose the greatest evil,
Vultis in vincula injure, vultis in mortem, voluptas est mihi.
than the least sin, as Daniel, and the three children. Ambrose says, will you
cast me into prison, will you take away my life, all this is desirable rather
than sin. And when Eudoxia the Empress, threatened Chrysostom with banishment,
go tell her, says he, I fear nothing in the world, but sin. And the reason is,
Nil nisi peccatum timeo.
because they look on sin as the grand and universal evil, the womb of evil,
and all other evils, but the births of sin. It has been the founder of hell,
for before sin no hell, it was that which laid the corner stone in that dark
vault; nay it is that which has filled hell with those treasures of wrath, and
still adds to it, and increases the fuel, Romans 2.5. Nay, they look not only
upon sin as ^n evil universal, but as universally evil, no good in sin. And
therefore when the Apostle would speak the worst of Sin, he could find no name
worse, than in its own to set it out by, sinful si^, as you see Romans 7.13.

These may be the special times wherein you may read your own spirits, and be
able to gather evidences of your sincerity.

3. Branch of Exhortation.

You that have cleared your sincerity, do you labor to maintain the evidences
of it, etc.

4. Branch of Exhortation.

To exhort them whose hearts are sincere, that they would declare the sincerity
of their hearts on all occasions. I have told you, that God has special times
for the trial and discovery of the sincerity of his own people. And it should
be our wisdoms to take notice of those times and seasons, and our care at
those times to declare our sincerity. Balaam had once a time to declare his
sincerity, when he was hired with wealth and honor, to curse the People of
God; but not approving himself at that time, he was branded for an hypocrite
for ever. Saul had once a time to discover his sincerity, when he was
commanded to go and slay all; but missing that time of declaring sincerity, he
is branded, etc. The young man had a time too, when Christ propounded to him,
to part with all and follow him, but missing that, not taking time to declare
sincerity, etc. Solomon had a time too, but he was too neglectfull, and what
follows? he is questioned whether ever saved or no, he is pictured between
heaven and hell, as if men knew not where to fix him. These had all special
times afforded to them of declaring their sincerity, and like vile wretches,
they make them times of discovering Hypocrisy. And there is not a man of you,
but God does afford you some or special other occasions in your lives of
declaring the sincerity of your hearts, which if God give wisdom to discern
of, and a heart to close with, you will be happy; but if not, you will smart
for it. God may suffer you to lie and roar upon your deathbed, for want of an
evidence of sincerity, because you are neglective of declaring your Sincerity,
when God affords you an occasion of it. Oh what sad thoughts will these be,
when thou shall look upon thy life, and think with thy self, Such a time I was
in such a place, in such an office, had such an opportunity to show my self for
God, to advance his glory, to do good to his Church, his people, his cause, and
yet vile wretch I neglected it, I bawked it, I was unserviceable, or I used my
power, my strength, my authority, as an Engine against God, against his people,
against his cause, this will be trouble with a witness.

Well then, if you would prevent this, let every one in their several places
and stations, declare the Sincerity of their hearts. Make your places your
power, your parts, your riches, your friends, serviceable to God, to his
Church, to his Cause. As Christ made all his Ascensions for the good of his
Church, so do you. Think it not much to adventure and hazard any thing for the
glory of God, the good of the Church. Pray for the Church, act for the Church,
do for God, suffer for God, run this brave adventure to hazard all for the good
of the Church of God. He who raises up Gods glory, though by the ruins of
himself; he who advances Gods cause, though himself lie low for it, shall
never be looser by it, has bargain good enough. You know those places, He who
prizeth father and mother, riches, lands, before me, is not worthy of me.
Again, There is no man forsakes father, or mother, riches, or lands, for my
sake, etc. but shall have a hundred fold, etc. So, Who saves his life, shall
loose it, but he who looses his life, etc. So, He who denies me before men,
him will I deny. It is now a time wherein wicked men do show their corruptions,
do you make use of it, as a time to show your graces; when they discover their
hypocrisy, do you declare your sincerity. I have looked and wondered to see
those men who have stood firm in the times of affliction of a Church, should
stagger and fall back in the times of redemption of a Church. It is not so
strange for a man to fall in the times of the declining of a Church: Then fear
may make men stagger, as in Peter. But that is a corrupt heart indeed, corrupt
with a witness, who falls back, and flies off, in the times of reforming of a
Church, to see men to fall back not in the times of persecution, but in the
times of reformation, this is a sad thing. It may be weakness of grace, which
occasions a man to decline and fall back in the times of persecution; but it is
a wickedness, and height of wickedness, it shows a spirit opposite to God and
goodness, to be worse in times of reformation. We see it so in many in our
times, and seeing unsound spirits to discover their corruptions, let Gods
people now discover their graces. When Israel halted between God and Baal,
making a mixture of divine worship and idolatrous together, one to be set off
by the other, that poison might be swallowed down without scrupling; then did
Elijah take occasion to declare his sincerity, when he cried, how long do you
halt? etc. When Haman had plotted the death of all the Jews, and had gotten the
Kings warrant for the doing of it, then was it a special occasion for Mordecai
and H^sler to declare their sincerity, which they did, Hesler 4.15, 16. When
Israel had joined themselves to Baal Peor, then was it a special occasion for
Moses to declare his sincerity, which he did, Numb. 25.5. You see what honor
Phineas won by taking that special occasion of declaring his sincerity. The
like of Levi, in Deuteronomy. 33.9. So of Abraham, Genesis 22. consider, 1. God calls on
you to declare your sincerity. 2. The Church calls on you.

1. Those abroad, our po^r distressed brethren in Ireland, they cry in the
language of the Psalmist, Psalm. 94.16. Who will rise up for me against the
evil doers, or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity? Do
you declare your sincerity by helping them with your purses, with your prayers,
and with your persons, so far as you are called out to it.

2. Our own Church and Nation calls upon us to declare our sincerities, the
singleness and honestness of your hearts in these double times. To help forward
with our prayers, the good of the Church, the great work which concerns Gods
glory, his cause now on the wheels, the great work of reformation.

3. Your conscience, that calls on you to discover your sincerity; and
conscience is either a man's best friend, or worst enemy. If you would not have
conscience show it self an enemy at that time, when you desire it to appear
your friend, then make use of the seasons to declare the sincerity of your
hearts to God. And then will conscience be thy friend in health, thy friend in
sickness, thy friend in life, thy friend in death, when all other friend^ must
leave thee. The testimony of Hezekiahs conscience to him when he lay on his
sickbed, which gave in evidence of his sincerity, brought more comfort than
all the World. Lord, remember how I have walked before thee, etc. Would you
have conscience to give in the like testimony for you? then declare the
sincerity of your hearts, when God calls you out. There is a story, the moral
whereof is good; that a man who had three friends which he loved well, and
being sent for to the King, asked which of his friends would go with him; one
tells him he could not go, not stir, another told him he would go a little
way with him, but could not go out with him; the third, he tells him, he will
not only go with him, but answer all for him, bring him off. God is the King,
the World, kindred, and conscience, are ^he three friends, the arrest, death,
and the person sent for, the soul. The World, that will leave you, kindred
bring you a little way, to the grave, there leave you, but it is a good
conscience which carries a man thorough, and makes a man stand blameless before
the tribunal. If you would have conscience be your friend, the^ labor to
discover sincerity now.

A TREATISE OF THE Wonderful Workings OF GOD FOR HIS Church and People.

BY SAMVEL BOLTON, D. D. And MASTER of C. C. C.

LONDON: Printed by Robert Ibbitson, for Thomas Parkhurst, and are to be sold
at his Shop over against the Great Conduit in Cheapside, 1656.

A TREATISE OF THE Wonderful Workings OF GOD FOR HIS Church and People.
EXODUS 15.11. Who is like unto thee, O Lord, amongst the Gods! who is like
thee, glorious in Holiness! fearful in Praises! -- Doing wonders!
WHen troubles are threatened, God does charge us with two things, and
undertakes to discharge us of all the rest.

1. The first thing in Gods charge is Faith, Psalm. 55.22. Cast thy burden upon
the Lord, The burden of fears, of cares, of troubles; There is the charge; and
the discharge follows: He shall sustain thee.

2. The second thing God does charge us withal is Prayer, Psalm. 50.15. Call
upon me. But if you will take the charge and the discharge together. See Phil.
4.6. Be careful for nothing. There is the discharge -- But in all things make
your request known to God. There is the charge.

And there are two things which God does charge us withal, when our fears are
blown over, and they are 1. Thankfulness. 2. Obedience.


The former you may read, Psalm. 50.15.

The latter, 1 Samuel 12.24. And this has been the practice of the Saints, when
calamities and troubles has been either felt or feared; they have betaken
themselves to those weapons to encounter them with, Faith and Prayer.


You see in Heslers time. And when God has bestowed deliverance, then they
have betaken themselves to Praises. You see in the same story of Esther, the
Primitive Christians had their Stationary-daies, their days of Prayer, wherein
they assembled themselves together for the removal of the Churches pressures
lying upon them.

And no doubt, but they had their Solemn Feasts, and times of Praises, when God
had wrought his deliverances.

The want of Mercy sends us to Prayer; the enjoyment of Mercy sends us to
Praises.

But what need we seek further for an instance? you see here it was the
practice of Moses.

The former Chapter tells you of his Dangers and Fears: The Egyptians pursued
him, verse. 8, 9, 10. Together with Moses behavior and demeanor, in these
straits, verse. 13, 14, 15.

Where first you see his Faith, verse. 13, 14. And the 15th. verse implies his
Prayer. Though we read of none expressed, yet there is one implied. The Lord
said unto Moses, wherefore cryest thou unto me? speak unto the Children of
Israel, that they go forward. By which is implied, that Moses his spirit did
mightily wrestle with God in Prayer, although we read not of any words he
there uttered.

And in this Chapter you may read of his praises for that great deliverance
which God had wrought for them. No sooner was he come to shore, but he
sings forth the praises of God, both for their own deliverance, and the
enemies destruction.

So that these words that I have read unto you, they are a part of a Psalm of
Thanksgiving, for the glorious and wonderful deliverance of the Children of
Israel from the host of Pharaoh.

The sum of all you shall see in the 9, 10, 11. verses, where you may read
these three things, 1. Man's purposing. 2. Gods disposing. 3. The Churches
retribution.


1. Man's purposing, in verse. 9. which was bloody enough.

1. The Enemy said, I will pursue. 2. I will overtake. 3. I will divide the
spoil. 4. My lust shall be satisfied upon them. 5. I will draw my sword. 6. My
hand shall destroy them. Here was a bloody purpose, and all was done in their
thoughts.
2 We have God disposing in the next verse. Thou did blow with thy wind: the
sea covered them: and they sank as lead in the mighty waters. And then

3 Here is The Churches Retribution, set down in a way of Admiration of God
excellencies; Who is like unto thee, O Lord among the Gods! Who is like unto
thee, glorious in Holiness! fearful in Praises! Doing wonders!

Here is the Church Riding in Triumph, in a majestic solemnity, admiring of
God, and triumphing in him; as she does still in all her songs of praises for
Deliverances, See Judge. 5. and 1 Samuel 2. at the beginning, and most elegantly
in Isa. 25.9. Lo, this is our God: we have waited for him, and he will save us:
This is the Lord, we have waited for him, and we will be glad, and rejoice in
his salvation.

We will hold you no longer in the Preface, that which I shall commend unto
you, from the words, is this

Doct. The Wonderful God, does do wonderful things, for his Church and people.

He does not only do wonders simply: but great wonders, Psalm. 136.4. nay,
mighty wonders, Dan. 4.3. Amazing, astonishing wonders, for his Church and
people.

In the prosecution of this doctrine, we will go through these five things. We
will show you, 1 The truth of it, That God does do wonders. 2 The ground and
reason, why God does such wonders. 3 What those wonders are, which God does. 4
When is the time, that God does these wonders. 5 Whether God will do a wonder
for us.


1. Quere.
1 For the first of these, That God does do great wonders for his Church, even
such things as are above our thoughts, above our hopes, above our expectations,
above our reason to conceive, above our faith to believe.

The whole Scriptures are but the Annals, or the records of the wonders which
God has done for his Church and people. You can all tell me, what wonders God
did for his people in Egypt. The Psalmist tells you so, Psalm. 78.12. Mavelous
things did he for them, in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt.
And you know what wonders he did for them at the Red Sea, when there was
nothing but death before them, death behind them, they were surrounded with
death. Yet then God unbared his arm, and caused the Red Sea to divide it self,
Vehiculum. Sepulchrum.
which became a passage to the one, and a grave to the other.

And wonders he did for them in the wilderness. Not a day without a wonder;
Every day was the Birth of a wonder. He gave them bread from heaven: he gave
them water out of the rock. Read the 78 Psalm at your leisure, and the 9. chap.
of Nehemiah, and in them you shall see a little Chronicle of the great wonders,
which God has done for his Church and people.

But to the Doctrine, That God does do wonders for his Church and people.

1 God has wonderfully disappointed great plots, and desperate counsels, and
designs against them.

We will give you an instance of this in Hamans time. Haman had a desperate
plot for the ruin of the Church and people of God, you may read it in the 3d.
of Esther 8, 9, 10. to the end. In brief, it was this: To overthrow and put to
death all the Jews, upon pretense, that they kept not the Kings laws. Here was
their plot.

The disappointment of it you shall read in the 6. 7, 8. Chapters. The means
whereby this design was broken, was but small, and therefore the greater was
the wonder, the more visible was the hand of God. The breaking of the Kings
sleep, was the breaking of this design, as you read, Elish. 6. beginning -- The
King could not sleep well, what then? Could he not lie still in his bed? No,
he must have a book, and that book, the book of Chronicles: and that Book must
be opened; where accidentally, (though surely guided by Providence) he opens
and reads that passage recorded concerning Mordecai, where was registered his
faithfulness in discovering and disappointing of a murder intended against
the King. Whereupon God set this act of faithfulness so close upon the Kings
heart, that he could not rest till Mordecai was rewarded for it. And this
reward must be Hamans ruin, his advancement, Hamans abasement. And this was
the rise of Hamans disappointment.

The like you have, Dan. 6.4, 5. There was a great design the Nobles had
against Daniel. They saw Daniel was faithful to the King, and they could find
no way to ensnare him, unless it were in something that concerned the law of
his God. And therein, if they could find any thing in his obedience to God,
that might render him disobedient to the King; they should then have their
desire of him.

And therefore their Plot was this, To make a Decree, that who ever should ask
any Petition either of God, or man, for the space of th^^^y days, save only of
the King, he was to be thrown into the den of Lions.

Well; the Plot took according to the Desire of their hearts: for
notwithstanding this decree, Daniel made his Prayers and supplications to his
God, three times a day, as you see in the 10, 11. verses.

Upon this they go and tell the King: Have not thou, O King, made a Decree,
that none should ask any Petition of God or man, save of thee? etc. Here is one
Daniel of the Captivity, who regards not thee O King, nor the decree thou have
signed: But makes his Supplication three times a day, verse. 13.

And what was this now, but to render him to the King, factious, seditious, a
Rebel, a Traitor, One who cared not for King, nor Law? Though indeed Daniel was
a better subject than the best of them; though they would have rendered him
rebellious to the King, because he was obedient to his God.

But mark the issue of it. God disappointed them in their design, and brought
their own plot upon their own Pates. Daniel was preserved by the Lions that
should have destroyed him, as they did afterward them. The like of the three
Children.

I might go down to our days, The Powder Plot: Eighty-Eight: and God knows how
many since.

2 God has wrought wonderful deliverance for his Church. Deliverances
wonderful, and the way he has wrought them was,

1 Sometimes by small means. For weakness and strength is all one with God; as
Asa confessed, when that Great Army came against him, 2 Chronicles. 14.11. It is all
one with thee, to help with many or with few. Infinite wisdom and power knows
no difference. As the Mariner turns about the greatest ship with a small rudder.

No means can be so contemptible; but he can make it succesful to his own
purposes.

As the greatest means will be no privilege, without Gods concurrence: so the
smallest means shall be no prejudice, if God will concur.

We read, God has sometimes armed natural Causes, Sun, Moon, Stars, Hail,
Wind: All which, were wonders, against the enemies of the Church.

The Stars in their course were said to fight against Sisera. The Lord slew the
enemies of Joshua with Hail; and the Moabites with the Sun shining upon the
water.

And we read in the Ecclesiastical History, that the Christians, being to
fight against the Barbarians, were in a great distress for water: And upon
their Prayer, God sent them abundance of rain, to refresh their Army: But
incountred their enemies with Thunder and fire from heaven. In remembrance of
which, the Romans called the Christian Legion (...): Fulminatrix, The thundering
Legion.

And sometimes God has armed other causes, putting strength into weak and
contemptible means, for the deliverance of his Church. God has oftentimes
delivered his Church by such instruments, as the enemies before would have
looked upon with scorn, as upon cast and despicable Creatures.

As God has weakened and infatuated them, he has intended to destroy: so has
he strengthened and guided with a spirit of wisdom, such as he has intended
for the deliverance of a Church.

You see Cyrus comparatively a weak Prince; yet God made him an instrument to
overthrow the most strong and puissant people in the World, the Babylonians;
and by him to deliver his Church.

Deborah a Woman; and yet God raised her up for the deliverance of his Church.

So you see God does it by small means.

2. Sometimes God works the deliverance of his Church without means. And this
is more wonderful.

When God looks about and sees there is no man, then does his right hand bring
salvation. When the Channel of Creature-helps is dry, when the stream of second
causes does not run: Then does God himself stand up for the defense and
deliverance of his Church and People; and creates deliverance out of nothing.

What God does by means, he can do alone. What he does mediately, he does
sometimes immediately from himself. The Angel slew an hundred fourscore and
five thousand, 2 King. 19.35.

We read, when Julian went to war against the Persians, he vowed to his
Idol-Gods, that when he returned, he would give them a sacrifice of all the
Christians in the Empire.

Here was now no means for the deliverance of the Church. But God undertaketh
the work himself, smiting him from Heaven with an unknown blow, and by that
delivered his Church.

The like also of Maximius, and of Herod, Act. 12.23. Though there be weakness
below, yet there is strength above: Though means be wanting, yet he can
create means, or he can work without. God and Faith, work best alone.

3. Sometimes God works the deliverance of his Church by contrary means. And
this is yet a more wonderful way.

God does often work his works by Contraries, he brings good out of evil, Life
out of Death, etc. As the Physician does order poisons and destructive
ingredients to physical, useful, and healthful purposes: So those things which
in themselves are against us, God in singular wisdom and mercy, turns them for
us. That which has been used as the means of ruin, has God often turned to
the means of raising a Church and People.

This is like the opening of the blind man's eyes with Clay. One would think it
should rather put out the eyes of a seeing man, than give sight to a blind man.
But if Christ do undertake the work, though the means be never so contrary, it
shall be effectual.

Thus you see that God does often do wonders for the good of his Church and
People.

2. Quere.
2. We come now to the second thing. The Grounds and Reasons.

1. The first is, Because he is a wonderful God. Wonderful things beseem a
Wonderful God. His Name is Wonderful, Isa. 9.6. And therefore his works are
Wonderful. This is the inference, Psalm. 86.10. Thou art great, and do
wonderful things. Every one delights to do actions suitable to themselves;
suitable to their own greatness.

When Alexander met with a great difficulty, his spirit thus incounters it, Jam
periculum par animo Alexandri: Now here is a danger, here is a difficulty fit
for the spirit of Alexander to encounter withal: here is a work suitable for
Alexander to do. Great enterprises, great difficulties, great things befit
Great spirits. Magnus magna decent. And wonderful things befit a wonderful God.

And upon this ground Gods reliefs come not in, until cases are desperate;
because then he may discover his great Power. And such deliverances are most
suitable to the great God. He could as well h^ve saved Lazarus from sickness,
as have raised him from the grave: but he suffers him to dye, be buried, and
lie three days in the grave, that he might magnify his power, in the raising
of him again. He lets the difficulty go beyond the help of man, that you might
the better know what the Power of God is.

2. The second Reason. God does wonderful things for his people, to get himself
a wonderful Name, that God might be known in the World.

Therefore did God execute such fearful Judgments on Pharaoh, and wrought so
great deliverances for his people; that he might get himself a Name, and
publish himself to the World, Isa. 63.12.

Special cures win more glory to the Physician, than a thousand ordinary cures:
so special victories win more honor to a General, than a thousand ordinary
skirmishes: so here, special deliverances to God.

If God should only walk in the ordinary ways of his Providence in the World;
his glory would not be so much seen and advanced: And therefore God does often
step out of his ordinary paths of Providence, and goes in Extraordinaries, that
he might discover his Glory and Power, and advance his own Name.

This know, that it is Gods great design in the World, to advance his own Name,
and make it glorious to the ends of the Earth. This is one way God does it by:
even doing wonderful things for his Church. Hereby God wins a great deal of
honor and praise from the Saints, and dread and terror from the wicked, as the
Scriptures speak.

You know how terrible was the Name of the God of Israel to all the Earth, by
those great wonders God had done for Israel in Egypt.

And therefore this was the argument which David used, why God should destroy
such as were his enemies, and work deliverances for such as were his people;
That men might know, that thou, whose Name alone is Jehovah, art the most high
over all the Earth, Psalm. 83.18.

Great Mercies and wonderful deliverances, publish and set forth God, when
smaller cannot do it.

Great Deliverances publish great Power; great Mercy, great Wisdom, and great
Truth. God is lost in smaller deliverances; but visible in greater. They who
are unwilling to acknowledge God in lesser, are forced to acknowledge him in
greater deliverances; and to say with them, who without doubt were loath enough
to acknowledge it, Digitus Dei est hic; The finger of God is here.

None, but a God could have disappointed such Counsels.

None, but a God could have discovered such Plots.

None, but a God could have removed such Evils.

None, but a God could have wrought such Deliverances.

3. The third Reason, why God does wonderful things for his Church, is, as to
get, so to uphold his great Name.

You have an excellent place for this in Deuteronomy. 32.27. God was highly displeased
with Israel, for their provocations of him; and he threatened to destroy them:
yet after all this, he says, -- I said, I would scatter them into corners,
and would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men: were it not
that I feared the wrath of the enemy: lest their adversaries should behave
themselves strangely, and lest they should say, our high hand, and not the
Lord, has done all this.

The like you have in 2 King. 18.35. Who are there among the Gods of the
Countries, that can deliver out of my hand? so he vaunted, and God suffered
him to soar so high, that he might have the greater praise, and his Glory be
higher advanced by the greater downfall of such a Lucifer.

And this was the Argument which Moses urged God withal, when he threatened to
destroy the Children of Israel, Numb. 14.15. Now if thou kill this people, then
the Nations which have heard the fame of thee, will speak, saying: Because the
Lord was not able to bring this People into the Land, which he swear unto
them, therefore has he slain them in the Wilderness. As if he had said, --
Thou have gotten thy self a Name, by the mighty wonders, which thou have done
for thy people: but if thou should leave now, and do no more, thou would
lose thy glory, which thou have gotten, and the Nations would be ready to
charge thee with weakness and impotency, that thou wast not able to do what
thou have promised, and purposed to do for thy People.

The like you have in Deuteronomy. 9.28. And in Exodus 32.12. And the same Argument you
have in Jos. 8.9. When God went not forth with the armies of Israel, but
suffered them to be smitten by their enemies. O Lord, (says Joshua) what
shall I say, when Israel turn their backs upon their enemies! If it be thus,
what will become of thy great Name!

Arguing by this, that there was a necessity for God to do great things for his
People; still to uphold that great Name he had gotten, which otherwise would
fall to the ground, Psalm. 79.9. Help us, for the glory of thy Name; and deliver
us for thy Names sake.

And an excellent place you have for this, in Isa. 48.9, 10, 11. For my Names
sake will I defer my wrath, and for my Praise will I refrain it from thee, that
I cut thee not off.

4. Reas. God does wonderful things for his People, that he might inherit
wonderful praises from his People. Therefore does God work wonderful
deliverances for his Church, that his Church might return suitable praises to
God again, -- Psalm. 111.4. He has done his wonderful works, to be remembered.
As if he had said, it was for this end, that God did those wonderful works,
wrought those great deliverances, that they might be remembered, that they
might be kept upon the imagination of the thoughts of the heart for ever. As
in 1 Chronicles. 29.18. That we might be so many living Monuments of thankfulness,
so many Trumpets to sound forth the praise of his Greatness and Goodness, from
Generation to Generation. And he that forgets Thankfulness, forgets the end of
Gods bestowing of Mercy, and robs himself of the fruit and effect of the
present Mercy, and hinders himself of future.

5. Reas. God does wonderful things for his Church, to add torture to the
Devil, and his Children.

Gods mercies and deliverances to the Saints, must needs inrage the Devil, and
wicked men.

When Haman had prevailed so far as to get a bloody decree against the Jews,
he joyed exceedingly, as one that promised to himself the utter ruin of them
all. Now God stepping in on a sudden, and showing a wonder to disappoint him in
his design; No man can conceive, much less express how much this added to
Hamans torture and vexation. He goes home, and vexes himself, and vexes in
his bed, and could have no rest.

Achitophel was so tortured, that his design did not take, that he was
impatient of his Life. He could not ease himself, but by destroying himself.

The like you have of Balak God has his ways to make wicked men gnash their
teeth before they come to Hell; and this is one way, to put them in a kind of
hope of having their will upon the godly, as they had in the verse before the
Text, I will pursue, I will destroy, I will divide the spoil. -- And then on a
sudden over-turning all, blowing upon their projects, bringing all their
enterprises to naught: Oh! this does make them vex, and torture their own souls.

6 Reason, God does wonderful things for his Church and People, That both our
selves and the Generations to come might be quickened and stirred up to trust in
him, obey him.

1. That we our selves might be quickened to trust in him. And this you see
was the fruit of that great deliverance in the text, Exodus 14.31. And Israel
saw that great work, which the Lord had done upon the Egyptians: And the People
feared the Lord, and believed the Lord.

And this use David made. That God that has delivered me from the Lion and
the Bear, he will also deliver me from this uncircumcised Philistine: So
Psalm. 63.7. Because thou have been my helper; therefore under the shadow of
thy wings I will rejoice, That is, because thou have been my Help: I have had
experience of thy goodness to me in such and such straits. Therefore under the
shadow of thy wings I will rejoice, Not only; Trust in thee, but Rejoice, as
being assured thou will help me in time to come.

Men unmindful of former experiences, are still to seek in every fresh
difficulty.

Where Experiences are the Premises,
Assurance may be the Conclusion.
David was a man of many choice experiences of Gods goodness to him; and he
was a man that was choice of them: he laid them up, and made use of them at
every need. He did not only make use of the Experiences themselves, but of
every thing, that came in to it, or was a Trophee of it.

It is a passage not to be neglected, that when he was forced to fly from
Saul, coming to Ahimelech the Priest, he desired a weapon of him, for his
defense and safeguard. He told him, that there was none, save only The Sword
of Goliath, whom he had slain, and David said, there is none like that, give it
me, 1 Samuel 21.9. This was a Trophee of Gods goodness to him: It was an Ensign
of a former Experience of Gods love to him: And there was no better weapon for
his defense, than such a one, as was both an experience and a weapon. In
carrying this, he carried an Experience with him, which might Comfort him, and
encourage him too.

2 Corin. 1.10. Says the Apostle: he has delivered us from so great a death,
and does deliver: In whom we trust he will yet deliver us.

Thus from the former Experiences of Gods goodness to him, he makes out an
argument of future deliverances.

And, if we were but thus wise, to treasure up former Experiences; the former
parts of our lives would come in to help the latter: And the longer we live,
the richer in faith we should be.

We ought indeed to trust God, though we had never Tried him: but, when he
helps our faith by former Experiences, this should strengthen our Confidence;
and make us to go unto God, as unto a Tried friend.

If we were well read in the History of our Lives, we might have a Bible of
our own, drawn out of the Experiences of Gods dealings with us, and we should
be able to say, in any difficulty and distress; I dare trust God in this
difficulty; I dare adventure on him, in this present distress: I have tried
him, and found him true; He never failed me. And because he has been my
help, therefore under the shadow of his wings will I rejoice. This is the first
part of this Reason, God does wonders, to quicken and encourage his Church and
People, to trust in him and obey him.

2 God does it, that the very generations to come might be encouraged to trust
in the same God, in the like distresses.

This use the Church made of Former Experiences, Psalm. 22.4, 5. Our Fathers
trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou did deliver them: they cried unto
thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. And
from hence the Church gathers an argument, that that God, that had delivered
others, would also deliver them.

The like you have, Isa. 51.9, 11. Awake, awake, Put on strength, O arm of the
Lord: Awake, as in the Ancient days, in the Generations of old. Art not thou
he, that wounded the Dragon? who dried up the Sea, and made the depths a way
for the ransomed to pass over? -- As if he had said, All those Former
Experiences of thy Gracious dealings, and wonderful deliverances of thy
Church, they are as so many encouragements to us, to believe thy goodness to
us. And therefore the Psalmist tells us, Psalm. 9.10. They that know thy name
will trust in thee. -- And he gives the reason. -- For thou Lord have not
forsaken them that seek thee. -- He does not say, Thou Lord wilt not, but,
thou Lord have not. Gods hath-not, is his will-not too.

The Argument were not good, would not hold in men. They Have not, therefore
they Will not; Men may change, men may alter.

1. Either they may repent of former courtesies.

2. Or they may resolve to do no more. Men, we see, shut their hands, because
they Have opened them, and their former courtesies are reasons of future denials.

But the argument is good here. He hath-not: therefore he will not forsake
his people.

He will be gracious, because he has been gracious. Gods former dealings
toward his Church and people, do but publish to the world, and inform us, what
his future behavior shall be to his Church and people. He Has not,
therefore he will not.

God blames the Israelites, because he had done so great works for them, And
yet they believed not.

7. Reas. God will do wonderful things for his Church, because His love and
engagements do move him unto it.

There are four loving engagements of God, which move him to do wonderful
things for his Church, 1. They are his. 2. He has promised. 3. His people
trust in him. 4. They seek unto him.


1. God is engaged to do wonderful things for us, Because we are his. We are
his people, he is our God: we are his Spouse, he our husband: we are his
children, he our father: we his Members, he our head: we are his portion,
his inheritance, etc.

And this is a great engagement for God to do great things for us; what will
not a loving father do for his child? what will not a loving Husband do for his
wife? etc. we stand in the same relations with God.

He thought nothing too great to suffer for us. He suffered great things, and
he suffered cheerfully: he was in pain till the hour came. And do you think
he will think any thing too much to do for you?

God does what ever is done in the world. And there is nothing that he does,
that I may say his heart is more in, that he does with more Complacency and
delight, than those things he does for his Church and People. His whole heart
is in them; and therefore does them cheerfully, and does them fully. As you
know, whatever your heart is in, that you do willingly, that you do thoroughly,
etc.

Indeed, there was Nothing to engage him, To make us his People; before he
made us his People, as Moses says, God chose you, not because of thy
righteousness, the uprightness of thy heart; for thou art a stif-necked
People. But because the Lord Loved you, etc.

But there is something to engage him, To do for us now, he has made us his
People, because we are his People, this is that, that Samuel did comfort the
Israelites withal, 1 Samuel 12.22. The Lord will not forsake his people, for his
great Names sake, And why? what is the reason? what is the engagement? why
says he, Because it has pleased the Lord to make you his people.

2 A second loving engagement, which causes God to do wonders for his People
is, Fidelis Dominus, qui se nobis ^ecit debitorem non aliquid a nobis
accipiendo: sed omnia nobis promittend^: Aug.
because he has engaged himself to us, by many great and precious Promises.
Gods Promises are engagements upon him. God has made himself our Debtor, Not
by receiving any thing from us, but by promising all things to us. God has
made many precious promises to us.

1 Promises of Preservation, Isa. 33.16. He shall dwell on high: his place of
defense shall be the munition of rocks; bread shall be given to him; his
waters shall be sure.

A Promise, than which I know none more full in the Book of God, wherein all
Objections, that a fearful heart might raise, are answered and taken away. Let
us view it over.

1 He shall dwell on high] If he were among his enemies, he might be in
danger: But he shall dwell on high; nay, on heights, as the Word is: many
Ascents, many Heights, above the reach of danger, out of Gunshot.

2 But suppose they could raise up Mounts, and come as high as he; yet they
shall not hurt him. He is in a place of defense.

3 But what then? His defense is not so strong, but it may be broken thorough.
No says the Text, that is impossible* for his place of defense shall be the
Munitions of Rocks; many Rocks; and many Munitions of Rocks (and therefore
impregnable) to guard him.

4 Why? but he may be starved out; his supply will not always last. There is
no plowing and sowing upon Rocks; he may be famisht out. No says the Text.
Bread shall be given him; He shall be provided for.

5 But what shall we do for Water? There is no Water to be had out of Rocks.
You see it was that which posed the Faith of Moses: to fetch Water out of a
Rock. But says the Text, he shall have Water too.

6 Yea but his Water may be spent. It will not always last. No says the Text:
His Waters shall be sure; never failing Waters, sure Waters.

Again, in the same Chapter, verse. 21. The Lord will be to us a place of broad
Rivers and streams, wherein shall go no Gallie with Oars, nor shall gallant
ship pass thereby. Showing the defense God would be to his People. He will
be a Stream, nay a River between us and our enemies. And a broad River, a
River that cannot be passed over. Why but they may use Oars. No says the
Lord, He will be a River, wherein no Gally with Oars shall pass. But a Ship
may. No, nor gallant ship shall pass thereby, for the Lord is our Judge; the
Lord is our Lawgiver; the Lord is our King; he will save us. But what if any
ship should attempt? You shall see, verse. 23. God will untackle them. Thy
tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their Mast; they could not
spread the sail.

2. And as he has made promises of Preservation from, So he has made
promises of Deliverance out of trouble, Psalm. 34.19. Many are the troubles of
the Righteous; but the Lord delivers him out of them all. So Psalm. 50.15.
Call upon me in the time of trouble; I will deliver thee. So Psalm. 91.15. I
will be with him in trouble, and will deliver him. So Isa. 54.17. No weapon
formed against thee shall prosper. And an excellent promise we have, Isa.
43.3, 4. I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee. God speaks
here as the Lord and Possessor of the whole Earth, Egypt was his, and Ethiopia
was his; and both these he gave for to redeem his Church.

The Church was in bondage and captivity, you know, in Egypt. And God gave
Egypt for her ransom. And how? because she could not be ransomed and
delivered without the loss of Egypt. Therefore God gave Egypt for her: That is,
he would rather lose all the Land of Egypt, than his people should not be
ransomed: he would sink the whole Kingdom of Egypt, if it stood betwixt his
People and Deliverance. And so it follows in the 4. verse. I have loved thee,
therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life. As if he had
said. I love thee, thou art more dear to me than all the World; and I do not
stick to give the lives of thousands to uphold thine. Multitudes shall be
destroyed, rather than thou shall not be preserved. I love thee, and therefore
I will give men for thee.

Thus you see God is engaged to do wonderful things for his Church, because of
his Promise.

That love which has moved him to make these precious promises to us, will
never give him rest, till it has caused him to make good those promises which
he has made.

3. A third loving Engagement, which causes God to do wonders for his People
is, because they trust in him. Trust is a kind of Engagement upon a man,
although he had made no promise. A man will not deceive another, who reposeth
his whole trust in him, though he were not engaged by Promise. There is a
kind of Engagement in Trust it self: And shall we then think that God will,
when he has made so many precious promises to us? This were the greatest
deceit in the World, a Soul-deceit. If God should call us off from all other
succors, from other shelters, and tell us, that if we will trust in him, he
will be our succor, our security. And should God fail the soul; this were an
undoing-deceit, the greatest deceit in the World.

No, my Brethren, there was never man who laid up his confidence in God, but
he found God to be that to him, which he expected.

Faith ingageth all the Power, all the Wisdom, all the Mercy, and Truth of God
to help us. And if the Power, Wisdom, etc. of God can do wonders for thee: God
will then do wonders for thee, if thou believe in him. Believe (says Christ)
and thou shall see the wondrous works of God.

4. A fourth Engagement, which causes God to do wonders for his People is,
because they seek him. He does not say to the seed of Jacob, seek ye me, in
vain. He has styled himself -- The God hearing prayers; and bids us call upon
him in the day of trouble, and he will hear. The Prayers of Gods People, they
are as so many Engagements upon God, to move him to do for them.

Faith and Prayer will set All-God awork. It will set the Power, Wisdom, Mercy
of God a work, for you. Faith and Prayer will remove Mountains. Nothing shall
be too hard for that people to do, whose hearts and spirits God holds up to
believe, and to pray. Be it to thee, even as thou will.

Luther having been in his study, and earnest with the Lord about the business
of the Church; receiving a gracious answer, he comes down and cries, We have
overcome; the day is ours. And so it fell out, says the story: For the Church
prevailed.

There is a kind of Omnipotency in Faith and Prayer, because these two set the
Omnipotent God, and the Omnipotency of the Power of the Omnipotent God, to work
for us.

And I believe, The great work of Reformation has gone so slowly forward,
because Gods People are not so strongly carried on in seeking.

3 The third thing we have to do, is to show you

3. Quere.
What are those wonders which God does for his Church and People?

1 God does wonders for the souls of his People.

2 God does wonders for the body, and outward man. 1 Gods Wonder^ to the soul.


1 For the soul. And we will give you a glance of these. The first Wonder, and
indeed the Wonder of Wonders, which God has done for his Church and People is,
1 Wonder for the soul.


1 The giving of Christ for us, and to us.

All wonders are swallowed up in this wonder. Nothing is wonderful, if compared
to this. God manifested in the flesh. Hence the Apostle, 1 Timothy 3.16. Great is
the mystery of Godliness. God manifested in the flesh. That such greatness, and
such meanness; such finiteness, and such infiniteness; such riches, and such
poverty; such strength, and such weakness; Tantus Deus, tantillus Homo; So
great a God, and so mean a Man, all in one: Here is a Wonder.

There is four great Wonders conspicuous in this.

1 Here is a Wonder of Humility; which will appear, if you consider, 1 Of
Humility.
1 Who he was. 2 What he became.


1 Who he was. He was the Son of God; The express Image of his Fathers
person; One equal with God; and thought it no robbery to be equal with God;
he was God blessed for ever, As the Apostle styles him.

2 What he became. He took not upon him the Nature of Angels; which yet had
been a greater descent, than if all the Angels in Heaven had been turned into
Worms. But he took not the Nature of Angels; but he took upon him the Nature
of Man, and that not at the best; but of Man fallen, subject to infirmities,
Penal, not Culpable: General, not particular.

And what a wonder of Humility was this? There is not the meanest Angel in
heaven, but would have thought it a wrong above amends, to have been so low
abased. Here was a wonder of Humility, Factor terrae, factus in terra. The
maker of the earth, to be made of earth.

2 Here was a wonder of wisdom.

That God should find out such a way to recover us, when we were lost: If all
the united Consultations of men and Angels had been laid together, they could
never have found out a way to Reconcile Gods mercy in the salvation of man, and
yet his Justice in the damnation of sin.

If God should have helped us thus far. You are miserable Creatures: But I am
a merciful God. The demands of my justice I must not deny: neither will I deny
the entreaties of my mercy. Find me then but one, that can satisfy my justice,
and I will show my mercy to you. Ah! where should we have found one, who was
strong enough to bear sin, and to satisfy the wrath of God for us! No, it was
his own wisdom, that found out the way. Here was a wonder of wisdom, which
we adore and admire.

3. Here was a wonder of Love.

An Height, a depth; a length, a breadth, a Love beyond all dimensions. Hence
said to be a Love passing knowledge, a Love that may be apprehended by faith,
not comprehended by reason, it was an infinite love. And this is more than if
we could gather all the bowels of the Creation together. Hence says Christ,
who knew the greatness of it, John 3.16. i. e. So God loved the world so
infinitely, so incomprehensibly, that he gave his only begotten Son, that,
whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.

4. Here was a wonder of mercy; which will be more conspicuous if we consider,
1. The Person. 2. The Time.


1. The Person, who undertook this; It was the second Person in the glorious
Trinity: the Person against whom the first Sin was in some special respect
committed. He is the wisdom of the father, and called wisdom, Prove. 8. And
this sin was an affectation of wisdom, to be like to God. As the
falling-sin is now the sin against the Third Person, Sin against the Holy
Ghost: so the sin which did occasion the fall, was in some special respects
against the second Person. And therefore the greater is the wonder of mercy,
That he, against whom the first sin was so committed, should undertake the
expiation of it.

2* Consider the time, when he took our nature. And that was when we were
brought to a desperate loss: when it was made evident that nothing else could
help us, Heb. 10.6, 7. Sacrifice and burnt-offerings, thou would not have.
Then said I, Lo, I come. When Legal washings were declared unable to pacify
God, or to work our peace; Then Christ comes into the world. Christ came not
into the world till it was made Evident, That without him, God could not be
satisfied, nor man be saved. And this is the first Wonder, The sending of
Christ, in whom all is wonderful. His Incarnation, the Hypostatical union of
two natures in one Person: His Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, Session,
Intercession: They are a chain of holy wonders. Hence, Isa. 9.6. Christ is
called wonderful: because all in Christ is wonderful.

1 He is wonderful in his person and natures: God-man; and mortall-immortall,
finite and infinite, so great, and yet so mean: so rich and yet so poor. Here
is a wonder.

2 He is wonderful in his Offices. A King, Priest, and Prophet.

3 He is wonderful in his government.

That he should bring us to life, by death, to glory by misery; to honor by
shame; All wonders. This is the first wonder, and the root of all the rest.

2 Another wonder God does for the souls of his People, is, The second wonder
to the soul. 1 In Conversion


1 The work of Conversion and regeneration, that a man should partake of
another begetting, of another birth, of another nature, than others have in the
world: Nay, than he himself had. This is a wonder. That a man should be the
same, and not the same: The same man for body, yet as different in qualities,
as if another soul did dwell in the same body. That he should live by another
life; be fed by other food, refreshed by other comforts, than others are. Here
is a wonder, that of a Lion should become a Lamb; of a Wolf, a sheep; of a
Saul, a Paul; a Persecutor, become a Preacher. Here is a wonder.

And the greater is the wonder, if you look upon the weakness and
contemptiblenesse of the means, God works this by. The ministry of a weak man.

It had been no great wonder, if the Walls of Jericho had fallen down by the
battery of a Canon. But this made it the wonder, that the blast of Rams-horns
should bring down the walls of Jericho. And this is that, which makes this work
more wonderful, that by such weak and Contemptible means and men, in the eyes
of carnal men, this great work should be effected.

When a man shall come to the Church, with full tide and stream of lust,
lifting up his head, puffing at God, glorying in his sin and shame, Nay
perhaps, Come with purpose to contemn, to scorn the Dispenser. And to see this
man return home, by the Ministry of a weak man, wounded, slain, laid upon his
back, crying out with the Publican, God be merciful to me a sinner: or with
Paul, Lord, what will thou have me to do? I am willing to do any thing, to
suffer any thing, etc. Here is a wonder; well may we say in the voice of the
Prophet, What ails thee, thou Jordan, that thou art driven back! Thou sea, that
thou fleddest!

And as the birth of a Christian, so

2 In the life.
2. The life of a Christian in grace, is wonderful. It is a mysterious life: A
life hid from the world: for 1. The seat of this life is hid and secret. 2. The
principle and spring of this life is secret and mysterious 3. The Nourishment
mysterious. 4. The conveyance of nourishment. 5. The comforts of this life. All
wonders. Nothing in Grace, but wonders.


3 In Perseverance.
3 When God shall hold up a man's heart to fear him, to seek him, to believe in
him, in times of darkness, and temptations. Here is a wonder.

All the workings of Faith are wonders: but especially in temptations, and
Desertions.

1 That a man by Faith should conquer a troop of fears, silence an Army of
doubts; answer a throng of disputes; and carnal-reasonings; overcome all the
powers of darkness, to chase ten thousands Devils before him, which all the
power of earth cannot do. Here is a wonder.

2 That a man by Faith should hold up his head, under the burden and guilt of
many thousand sins, the lest of which would sink the soul, if Faith did not
cast all this upon the Lord.

3 That a man by faith, should be a rock in the midst of a storm, and stand
immovable when the winds blow, and the billows rage; when heaven and earth
seem to come together, as you see David did, Psalm. 27.1, 2, 3. and Psalm. 46.1,
2, 3. I will not fear, though the earth be removed, though the mountains be
hurled into the midst of the Sea.

4 When God shall keep alive a little spark of grace in the midst of a sea of
corruptions, hold up his own work in the mids of all Counter-workings, and
oppositions of sin and Satan. Here is a wonder.

5. When God shall make a man willing to sacrifice his goods, liberty, life,
rather than to wound his Conscience, and offend his God. This is a wonder,
which, without the power of God; could not be wrought.

6. When God shall bear up the spirits of the Saints with joy and comfort, in
the absence of all created comforts, as you see, Hab. 3.17. Although the
fig tree shall not blossom, nor shall fruit be in the vine, etc: yet I will
rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.

Nay, in the presence of all created discomforts, to stand up, and rejoice
under the frowns, menaces, scorns, scourges, prisons, persecutions of men;
embrace the stake, kiss the chains, smile on the terrors of death, rejoice with
Stephen under a shower of stones. Here are Wonders.

7 When God does turn all the afflictions, nay, all the sins of his Church and
People, to the good of his People, to humble them more, cast them out of
themselves, cast them upon the hold of Faith, the exercise of Prayer; make them
more watchful, more careful, more exact. Here Is a wonder.

Secondly, God works wonders for the body; for the outward condition of the
Church; for the good of his people, 2 Gods Wonders for the Body.
in regard of the outward man.

1 God does often restrain the wickedness and malice of men against his Church;
that though they be never so full of Hell and fury; yet they shall not be
able to vent it, against the Church and People of God. Thus you see it was with
Rabshakeh, when he came with purpose to destroy Jerusalem; yet God put his
hook into his nose, and his bridle into his lips. He restrained him, as you
see in 2 King. 19.28, 32, 33. And this made David to say, when the Princes took
counsel together, to take away his life, My times are in thy hands, Psalm.
31.15. Though they be never so full of malice, their designs be never so
bloody, yet my times are in thy hands; they shall not be able to hurt me:
though they consulted, yet he knew they could not act: God could restrain them.

God has the Devil, much more wicked men, in a chain; and they cannot go a jot
further than he gives them chain; and that shall be no further than for his
own Glory, and the good of his Church, as he tells us, Psalm. 76.10. Surely the
wrath of man shall turn to thy Praise, and the remainder of wrath shall thou
restrain.

Though wicked men be never so full of wrath and fury against the Church, yet
they shall vent no more than what shall turn to the Glory of God, nay, the
Praise of God; so much as his People shall have cause to praise him for. The
remainder of wrath, (though never so full) he shall restrain. They shall burst
before they shall vent any of it, to the hurt of his People. And this is a
great wonder. His setting bounds to the fury of men, as he does to the raging
of the Sea. Hitherto shall thou go, and no further: restraining the malice of
men against the Church, is as great a wonder, as to see a Millstone hang in the
Air, and not fall down.

2 God does often calm, and still the raging fury of wicked men against his
Church and People. He does not only bound them, but still them.

And thus you see it was with Esau. He came forth with rage, and
bloody-purposes against Jacob, to be revenged on him for all. But you see how
God calmed him. In stead of killing him, he falls upon his neck, and kisses
him. It was God that did it. And therefore it is said, Genesis 33.10. That Jacob
saw the face of Esau, as the face of God. It was not Esau, but God that he saw
in Esaus face. He saw God appearing in the wonderful changing, and calming of
his spirit, who came with such fury against him. And this was the fruit of his
wrestling and praying the night before.

3. When God does carry on great purposes with weak and contemptible Power:
makes weak means successful to do great purposes and effects. This is a wonder,
and a wonder God often does; as you see in Asa, 2 Chronicles. 14.11. It is nothing
with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no Power. As the
Mariner can turn about the greatest ship with the smallest Rudder: So God, who
ever sits at the Helm, and steeres and governs all, can bring about his own
purposes by weakest means.

As he brought Jeremy out of the dungeon with old rotten rags, good for
nothing: So he makes use of such means in straits, for the deliverance of his
Church, as the enemies thereof do look upon with scorn, as upon cast and
despicable Creatures.

As God does weaken and infatuate them, he intends not to prosper; so he
strengthens and guides with a spirit of wisdom, those he intends for the
deliverance of his Church. You see this in Deborah, in Cyrus, who though he
were a weak Prince, yet God made him an instrument for the overthrow of the
most strong and puissant people in the World.

4 When he makes the Afflictions and persecutions of his Church, a means of
growth and increase of his Church.

As it was said of the Israelites, Exodus 1.12. The more they were afflicted,
the more they grew: so has God still done for his Church. The primitive times
tell us of thousands, who were brought in, not by Sermons, but by the
sufferings of the Saints. The blood of those Martyrs being the seed of the
Church.

And Julian knew this so well, that he left off to persecute the Church, as
his Predecessors had done. Non ex misericordia, sed ex invidia; not out of
mercy, but envy, says the Historian; because he saw, The more they were
afflicted, the more they grew: The more they were oppressed, the more they
increased: And therefore he left off that course. But the Church lost more by
Sunshine, than by Storms; more by Peace, than by Troubles; by Smiles, than by
Frowns.

5 When God shall bring about the Peace of his People, by the trouble of his
People; their healing, by their woundings; their comforts by their fears. When
God shall work his work by contraries; bring joy out of sorrow, life out of
death, create comfort out of discomforts: This is a wonder; and a wonder which
God has frequently showed for the good of his Church.

How often has God made the lusts of men, even the malice and rage of his
enemies, to be a means for the good of his Church and People? making those
things which in their own nature were for the ruin, a means for the raising of
his Church and People.

The stories of Pharaoh, of Haman, and others, afford you plentiful proof of
it. Thus, out of the Eater comes sweetness: out of those things destructive in
themselves, comfort and deliverance. This is to turn poison into food, evil
into good. As God does turn the evil of sin, so much more the evil of trouble,
to the good of his Church. He makes all troubles subservient to deliverance,
as pangs and throws are to the birth.

As it was in the waters of Bethesda: the waters were troubled before the
diseased were healed; God made the trouble of the water subservient to the cure
in the water: So he often makes the troubles of his People, subservient to the
growth and increase of his People.

As the VVhale which swallowed up Jonah, he made a means to bring him to the
shore: So that trouble which we think will swallow us up, God makes to advance
their peace here, till he set them on the shore of eternity.

We our selves have had the experience of it. But this is the Lords doing, and
it is wonderful in our eyes.

6 When then are nothing but thoughts and preparations for war and
destruction: And God shall please to compose our differences, heal our
breaches, change the sad face of things; beat our swords into Plow-shares, and
our spears into Pruning Hooks. This is a wonder.

And this is a wonder which God can do; a wonder which he has done; a wonder
which we have had experience of; and such an one as we are now in
expectations of, which God of his mercy grant.

It will be more destructive to our enemies than our wars. In the mean time,
there must be our prayers and endeavors for it.

4. Quere.
4 When is the time which God takes to do these wonders for his Church?

1 When God shall get himself most glory of the enemies of his Church and
People: Then is the time God takes to do wonders.

If God had disappointed Haman, at the beginning of his design, he might
thereby have delivered his Church: but he had not then gotten so much glory
out of him; and therefore he suffers him to go on with his design, and bring
it up to ripeness, that now it is ready to be put in execution: and then God
stepping in, in a wonderful and unexpected way, he got himself a great deal of
glory upon him.

Therefore does God oftentimes stay till the enemies be ripe, till they have
dug graves to bury themselves in; twisted cords to bind themselves withal:
that thereby their confusion might be greater, and Gods glory more visible.

2 When God shall get most praise from his ^wn people. God is very desirous of
the praises of his Saints. As he does Bathe himself in their tears, so he
does delight himself in their joys. He loves to hear their Praises, as well
as their Prayers.

And you know the greater the straits out of which God does help and deliver,
the more are the hearts of the Saints enlarged with praises to him. And
therefore God does take such a time for the declaration of his deliverances, as
thereby the hearts of his People may be mightily enlarged and affected with
the mercy.

3 When God can do the Church most good, and work the compleatest deliverance
for them: Then is the time for God to do wonders for his Church.

You see this in the story of Pharaoh. God could have wrought a deliverance for
them, had he but unwheel'd his Charets, as soon as he came out of Egypt. But
it had not then been so complete a deliverance as they afterward had.

Though God had delivered them from that present trouble, yet their enemies had
been alive, and they should have heard of them again. And therefore God he lets
them go on, and follow them unto, nay into the Red Sea, and then to work a
complete deliverance for them, he shows a wonder upon them.

The like you have, Mich. 4.11, 12, 13. Many Nations are gathered together
against thee, who say, let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. But
they know not the thoughts of the Lord, nor understand they his Counsel: for
he shall gather them as sheaves into the floor. Arise and thresh, O Daughter
of Zion: for I will make thy horns iron, and thy hoofs brass, and thou shall
break in pieces, many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord,
and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.

Where observe, God suffers Nations, and many Nations to gather themselves
together against Sion. And why did God do so? certainly they thought they
should have the day of Zion: and so they say, Let her be defiled, let our eye
look upon Zion. But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, they understand not
the Counsel of God. For God suffers them to gather themselves together, but
for this end, For the compleater ruin of the enemies, and by that, for the
compleater deliverance of the Church. So it follows, They know not the thoughts
of the Lord: for he shall gather them. They gather themselves together; and yet
says the Text, God gathers them: They gathered themselves to ruin the Church:
and God gathers them, to ruin themselves. He shall gather them as sheaves
into the floor, and the fuller the load, the more welcome to the Husbandman.
And then Arise and thresh.

4. A fourth time, wherein God does wonderful things for his Church; is,

When the enemies of the Church are carried on with most rage, and promise
themselves most success against the Church and people of God.

You see that in the verses before the Text, 9, 10. when the enemy said in his
heart, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my lust shall
be satisfied on them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. --
Here they expressed their fury and rage, and promised themselves good success in
all.

And this was the time for God to do Wonders, you see in the next verse. Thou
did blow with thy wind, the Sea covered them, they sank as lead in the mighty
waters.

It was so in the Powder Plot: A Plot never to be forgotten. When they had
intended to have blown up, King, People, Nobles, Commons, Senators, Senate,
Laws, and Lawmakers; nay, three kingdoms at a blast: They could have buried
all in one grave, and consumed all in one Bonefire. Here was their rage, their
fury. And did they not also promise to themselves as good success in their
way? Had they not then in their purposes disposed of Crown and kingdom, and all
the Chief Offices, and Revenues in the Land? -- And now was the time for God to
show a wonder for the deliverance of his Church, which you know he did. A
wonder of wisdom in the discovery of the Plot, and a wonder of mercy, in
disappointing of it.

5. When Gods People are brought low, when all humane helps fail; when the Arm
of flesh is weak, when the stream of second Causes is dry. Then is Gods time to
show a wonder for their releif; when we cannot be releeved without a wonder;
then God works wonders for our relief.

You see this Deuteronomy. 32.35, 36. The Lord shall judge his People, and repent
himself concerning his servants: when he sees, that their power is gone, and
there is none shut up, nor left.

When Israel was brought to those straits, the Red Sea before them, the
Egyptians behind them, and mountains on each side them: then says Moses, fear
not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, Exodus 14.13. As if he had
said; you are now in straits: your extremities are great: and now is the time
for God to help: now is Gods time to do wonders for you. There are two times,
1. Man's Time. 2. Gods Time.


Man's time is, when ever we are in need, when ever we are in trouble: but Gods
time is, only when all helps fail; when no releif is in the arm of flesh, then
all is in God.

God is ever ready to put forth himself in desperate cases, because then his
mercy and power will be most conspicuous, his People most thankful, and
deliverance most glorious.

It is an old experienced Truth, Man's extremity is Gods opportunity. The depth
of Man's misery calls in for the depth of Gods mercy.

It may be observed in all Ecclesiastical Histories, that when deliverance
approached, then was persecution the hot rest. The Scribes and Pharisees
blasphemed most, when their Kingdom was nearest to ruin. In this, like the
Devil, who roars most, when his time is shortest.

The greatest darkness is before the morning watch; when the morning is
darkest, then comes the day, when trouble is greatest, then comes deliverance.

You know, when the task of bricks was doubled, then was Moses sent to deliver.

The Ancient Tragedians, when things were brought to that strait, that there
could be no possibility of humane help imagined, they used to bring down some
of their Gods out of the Clouds, and thence was the phraise (...), which was
not much differing from that among the Jews -- In the mount of the Lord it
shall be seen.

Gods promises are never nearer fulfilling, than when to sense and reason they
seem furthest off from fulfilling. This was Abraham's case, when at Gods command
he was about to sacrifice his Isaca.

6. The time when God does wonders for his Church, is,

When God does give and hold up a mighty spirit of Prayer in his People to
seek.

You see this in the deliverance of the Church out of the Babylonish captivity.
In which deliverance God expressed many wonders of mercy to his Church. At
which time God raised up A mighty Spirit of Prayer in them to seek. As you see
in Dan. 9.2, 3. And this was prophesyed in Psalm. 102.13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Thou
shall arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favor her, the set time
is come. Why? how shall we know, that Now is the time? he shows in the 14th
verse. For thy Servants take pleasure in the stones, and favor the dust
thereof; that is, they mourn, and they Pray. And therefore it is time for thee
to help and deliver, as you see in the 17th verse. Thou shall regard the Prayer
of the desolate, and not despise their Prayer.

As when the Lord has an intent to destroy a People, he does either expressly
charge them, not to pray for them, as he did Jeremy. chap. 14.11. Pray thou
not for this people; and chap. 7.16. Pray not thou for this people, neither
lift up cry, nor Prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: For I will
not hear thee.

Or he does secretly dead and straiten their spirits, that they cannot Pray.

So, when he does stir up the hearts of his People to seek him; It is an
evident demonstration, that God will do great things for that People.

He has told us, that He will not forsake them that seek him; when the eyes
and hearts of Gods People are big with sorrow, then is Gods mercy big with
deliverance, ready to be delivered.

Wicked men have a measure of sin to fill; as God said of the Amorites. The
iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. And Christ to the Scribes and
Pharisees. Fill you up the measure of your Fathers, Mat. 23.22.

When the Harvest is ripe; then will God put in his Sickle, Joel 3.13. put in
the Sickle, for the Harvest is ripe; for the wickedness is great.

In a word. God has a bag for the sins of the wicked, Job 14.17. And God has
a bottle for the tears of his servants, Psalm. 56.8. He bags up sins; and he
bottles up tears. And when once his bag is full of the transgressions of the
wicked: and his bottle is full of the tears of the Saints: Then shall salvation
come to Zion; then will God stir up himself, for the relieving and succouring
of his Church.

When wicked men are ripe for Destruction, the Church ripe for Deliverance,
then will God perform his whole work upon Zion, and will punish the fruit of
the proud Doer.

7. When the glory of God is mightily concerned. His worship, his Truth, his
Cause; Then is the time, God will do wonders. Though God will not do it for us;
yet he will do it for his own Names sake. He will not suffer his glory to be
polluted.

And this was the Argument Joshua had, Josh. 7.8, 9. When Israel had sinned,
and God had delivered them up to their enemies, he pleads with God. Lord, what
will become of thy great Name! Though Israel deserve not that thou should
stand out for them; yet let not thy glory suffer for their sin; but let thy
Name, which is so much concerned, draw thee out to relieve and help.

The like you have, Isa. 48.9, 10, 11. For my Names sake I will defer my anger;
and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off. For my own
sake, even for my own sake will I do it: For how should my Name be polluted?
And I will not give my glory to another, 2 King. 18.35. Who are there among the
Gods of the Countries, that have delivered their Country out of my hand, that
the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? Here you see now was Gods
Glory concerned, and therefore to preserve his own Glory, he shows a wonder to
help them.

And happy are they, whose deliverance is joined with Gods Glory. Though God
will not always deliver for our sake, yet will he deliver for his Glory, for
his own Namesake. As he tells them in Ezekiel. 36.32. Not for your sakes do I
this, says the Lord God, be it known unto you; be ashamed and confounded for
your own ways, Oh house of Israel! But though he would not do it for their
s^kes; yet he did it for his own sake, even for the Glory of his own Mercy, as
you see in that place.

5. Quere.
5. How shall we know, that God will work a wonder for us?

We are now in sad and distressed conditions; and a wonder must be wrought
for the helping and relieving of us. But whether God will work a wonder for us,
or no: There is the great question. This I am sure of, If God do not work a
wonder for us, we shall be made a wonder. Nay, three Wonders to all Nations.

1. We shall be made a wonder of folly, a wonder of madness. Who, because
none else could, therefore we would with our own hands ruin our selves. Which
should we effect, it would be the grief of our friends, the joy of our
enemies, the Popes Holy Day, Germanies tears, Irelands ruin, Scotlands hazard,
and our own overthrow.

2 We shall be made a wonder of scorn, a hissing, and a byword to all
Nations: That England, (that was Compendium Mundi: Of which I may say, as did
the Historian of Ormus, that if the whole World were a Ring, England were the
Diamond) that England should ruin her self, and with the foolish Woman in the
Prove^bs, pull down her house with her own hands.

3 And a wonder of misery. For all the World were not able to bring that misery
upon us, that we shall bring upon our selves. In which combustion, if we
preserve our Jewels, though we lose the rest, it is well. But we may fear all
will be endangered; if those, (who were the first movers of our trouble: such,
who Viper-like would eat out the heart of their common Parent) be not taken
away.

Well then. The case is so with us, As a wonder must be done, or we shall be
made a wonder: a wonder of folly, scorn, misery: But whether or no, God will
now do wonders for us; Here is the Question.

And I must confess, there are many sad presages of evil amongst us: many
things which speak, that God will rather make us a wonder, than do a wonder for
us.

1 Grounds of Fear.
I will first give you the grounds of my Fears, and then give you the grounds of
my Hopes, that God will not desert us at this time.

The Grounds of Fear are 1 Either Spiritual 2 Or Natural.


1 Spiritual grounds of Fear.
1 Spiritual; and they are 1 The Universality of sin 2 The Impudency. 3 The
obstinacy of sin amongst us.


1 Universality of sin.
1 The Universality of sins. All persons, all places are filled with all kinds
of sins. The Land is full of Adulteries, full of Oaths, full of Oppression,
full of Injustice, of Pride, Profanation of the Sabbath, contempt of the
Ordinances; full of Drunkenness; the whole land is defiled with blood: Prince,
and People; Magistrates and Ministers; great and small, poor and rich: We are
all defiled with sin. We may take up the complaint of the Prophet, Isa. 1.6.
from the sole of the foot, even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but
wounds and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, nor bound
up, nor mollified with ointment.

But there are four sins especially that threaten evil to us, and those are
such, as do more immediately concern God and his worship.

1 Idolatry. 1 Idolatry.
2 Profanation of his Ordinances 3 Profanation of his Sabbath. 4 Contempt and
abuse of his Ministers.
Any of which are enough to sink a Nation, though guilty of no more.

2. But secondly, Add unto this, The impudency of sin. 2 Impudency of sin.
Sin has gotten a Whores-forehead, without modesty, or restraint. Men are not
ashamed to publish sin as Sodom, and their iniquities like unto Gomorrah. Not
ashamed to swear, to drink, to profane the Sabbath, to contemn Ordinances.
Many are more ashamed to pray, than others are to swear.

3 And thirdly, Add to this, The obstinacy of sin. 3 Obstinacy of sin.
Sin is not only universal and impudent; but it is grown obstinate, stubborn
and incorrigible. Insomuch, that neither Mercy, nor Judgment; Word, nor Works;
Promises, nor Threats will be powerful to persuade with men. Then indeed may
sin be said to be incorrigible, when it is grown too strong for that means
God has set up, to keep it down. When sin is too strong for the Ordinances,
and Offices God has set up for the suppressing and keeping down of sin: Then
it is incorrigible, Jer. 6. ult. The Bellows are burnt. The Prophets lungs
consumed.

Besides these, diverse others might be named.

1 Too much fleshly confidence. 2 Our unanswerable walking to the means and
mercies we enjoy. 2 Natural grounds of Fear. 2 Natural grounds of Fear.

1. The great opposition of wicked men, and unsound spirits, against the
endeavors of Reformation.

Too many there are, who hate to be reformed. Old bottles will never brook
with new Wine. Nor will old hearts close with a spiritual way.

It is now with us as the Lord complained of Ephraim. Hos. 7.1. When I would
have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered. All the while
before their corruptions did lie a sleep; they little thought there were any
such spirits in them: But when the Physician comes, then they appear.

2 The Schisms and Divisions among us: which threaten evil upon us. If we had
joined our mutual strength against the common adversaries, and not turned the
heat of contention upon our selves, we had not now been so weak, nor our
adversaries so strong.

But I hope we shall be like sheep, that though a fair day has scattered us
all over the field, one from another; yet a storm will drive us together again;
seeing herein our concernments are mutual and reciprocal.

3 The wilful blindness and security among us. That men will not see how much
their Religion, their Liberties, and Privileges are concerned. Or, if they do,
yet (with Gallio) they care for none of these things. At least, not so much as
to hazard and adventure any thing for the securing and upholding of them.

4 Missing of Opportunities. O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Had thou known, even
thou, at least in this thy day, the things that belong unto thy peace! But now
they are hid from thine eyes, Luke 19.41, 42. There are some special times when
God does put advantages into the hands of his people; the loss whereof is never
recovered again.

It is not here as with Tides, that if we miss this, we may go with the next;
but if we miss this, perhaps we shall never have another.

And these are the chief grounds of my fear, that cause cross thoughts in me,
and give way to suspicion, that God will not do wonders for us.

2 Grounds of Hope.
Yet to these let me add the grounds of my hope. That even at this time, God
will do wonders for England.

Now then the Arguments that may persuade with us, and the Reasons, which may
induce us to believe, that God will do wonders, are these five:

1 From God.
1 From God.
1 Such as are taken from God, and that

1 From the goodness of his Nature. He is gracious and merciful. Gracious in
himself, and exceeding gracious to his Saints.

Though we have never a Promise for a particular deliverance at this time; yet
we may venture our selves upon the good nature of God, That he will not
deliver us up into the hands of cruel, merciless, and bloody men, who seek our
ruin.

Though our sins be many, and God might scourge us sharply, as we deserve;
yet he loves his People so well, as not to put them into the hands of such
cruel men to be punished.

You have some ground for this suggestion in Deuteronomy. 32.27. When God was highly
displeased with Israel, and threatened to destroy them; yet he feared the wrath
of the enemy. He feared they would deal too hardly; that they would destroy
them rather than scourge them. He knew not how to put them into their hands,
Though Israel had sinned, yet he was loath to make use of sinners to punish
sin: He knew the Mercyes of the wicked were cruel mercys.

2 A second Argument from God is, Because Gods glory is now much concerned. It
is not alone our good, but his own glory, that is concerned: and he will have
a care of that. Though he will not do it for us, yet he will do it for his
own Names sake.

There are many things, which he will not do for our sakes: yet will he for
his own sake. You see in Ezekiel. 36.32. Not for your sakes, do I this, O house of
Israel. But though he would not do it for their sakes, yet he would do it,
because his glory was concerned; He would do it for his own Names sake; you
have the like expressions, Exodus 32.12. Deuteronomy. 9.28. Isa. 48.9, 10, 11. Though
Israel had provoked God, yet for his own Glory sake he would deliver them.

And if we do not look with two partial eyes, I cannot see, that Ever the
glory of God was more nearly and closely concerned, in all the stories, I have
read, than it is at this time.

Gods Glory in his Truth, in his worships, in his Saints, in his Ordinances;
they are all nearly concerned at this Time.

And how would wicked men triumph, how would our enemies insult and glory? What
pious heart could endure to hear those Blasphemies, they would cast up against
heaven, and those contempts cast upon the People of God.

2. Arguments from the Church.
2. There are some Arguments taken from the Church of God in general. And that
is, 2 From the Church in general.
that

The good of most of the reformed Churches in the Christian world, does depend
upon the welfare of England. And in a great measure, Upon the good success of
this present Parliament.

If it should not go well with us, Scotland would be hazarded, Ireland
ruinated, Germany irrecovered; And all the reformed Churches in the Christian
world would feel the smart of our stripes.

And therefore, seeing the preservation and deliverance of England, is of such
public concernment, it may much persuade with us, That God will rather do a
wonder, than England shall not be preserved.

3. Arguments from our selves. 3 Arguments from our selves

3. There may be some Arguments taken from our selves; to induce us to hope,
that God will do a wonder for us.

1. Though it be true, we have many fearful sins and abominations among us;
And those are public too; such as have overspread the whole land: yet these
sins are not national: they have not yet been countenanced by a Law. There is
profanation of the Sabbath. But there are good Laws against it, and for the
strict observing of it. There has been Idolatry among us, But there have been
Laws against it; Swearing, yet Laws for the punishing of them.

Which affords me this comfort: 1. That, though these sins be in our Nation,
and do abound among us: yet they are not the Sins of our Nation. There have
been Laws against them: and so long they are not national.

And it has been 1. Either the Corruption. 2. Or the cowardice of our
Magistrates,


That sin has not been punished. I say, the corruption of many, who have
strengthened the hands of evil doers, either conniving at them, siding with
them, or abetting of them in their way. And so those, who should have been the
bolts to have kept out sin, have been the Latches to draw in sin, let in sin.

Or it has been the Cowardice of them, that they durst not appear for the
punishing of sin, Ezekiel. 22.30. I sought for a man among them, that should
make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me, for the land; that I should
not destroy it: I sought for a Phineas, that might stand up to execute
Judgment, and what was there none? Certainly there were many: but they were
Cowards and durst not appear against sin.

2. Though these sins were in a kind National; as indeed the Corruption and
connivance of them in Authority gives too much largeness to them, increases
the latitude of them, makes them of greater extent and guilt: yet now we are
about reforming them.

And we never read, that ever God did ruin a Nation, when a Nation was in a
way of reforming.

Indeed, that which comes nearest to it, and that, which is the saddest piece
in all the Scriptures, is in that example of Josiah: He set upon the work of
Reformation, yet God held up his purpose of destroying that people; You shall
read it 2 King. 23.26, 27. Notwithstanding the Lord turned not from the
fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah,
etc. Notwithstanding all that Reformation, as you may see in that Chapter: Yet
the anger of the Lord was not turned back, but his hand was stretched out
still; First, to cut off that godly King, and afterward to cut down that
ungodly people.

1. But first I must tell you, That Gods decree was then past against them. And
God had pronounced it long before, as you see in his message to Hezekiah, 2
King. 20.17. and I hope there is yet no Decree gone out against England.

2 And secondly, Though he would not revoke, what he had Decreed: yet this good
act of Josiah procured the Deferring of Gods Judgments, all his days, 2 King.
22.18, 19, 20. But to the King of Judah, thus shall ye say to him, Behold, I
will gather thee to thy Fathers, and thou shall be gathered to thy grave in
peace, and thine eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this
place.

So that this is yet strong. God did never destroy a Nation at any time, when
his People were about the Reforming of that Nation.

And it has pleased God at this time, to set us up a choice Assembly. An
Assembly chosen by Prayer, brought together by Prayer, and held together, and
preserved to this day, by the might of Prayer.

And their spirits have been held up amidst many difficulties and strong
oppositions, to Hazard themselves, their lives, and estates, for the good of
our souls, our bodies, and estates.

And I say, it was never heard of, nor read of: It is an untracted case, that
God should destroy a Nation, whilst they are such, whom he has himself
singled out, and set up for the Reforming of a Nation.

If he would have destroyed us, he would never have been at the pains to
Reform us. One cannot stand with the other.

3 A third Argument from our selves. And that is taken from the beginnings of
mercy.

You know what our Condition has been before, the remembrance of it is fresh.
God at that time did hear the cry of our souls, and pittyed us in our low
estate, and did go forth in the beginnings of mercy to us. And may we not
Reason; if God would have destroyed us, he would never have done thus much for
us.

That which God has done is an earnest unto us, and an engagement upon God, To
go on in the finishing of what he has begun to do for us already.

Shall we think, he has brought us out of Egypt, to destroy us in the
Wilderness? Shall we think, the Sun of Mercy has shined on us, but only to
warm our heads against a storm? shall we think, he has exalted us thus high,
that he might lay us the lower in the end?

Indeed thus God has done with the wicked. But we never read that he has so
done with his own people.

Shall we think he has delivered us from lesser, to reserve us to greater
Judgments? Freed us from Rods, to whip us with Scorpions? delivered us from
lesser evils, to ruin us at once? this cannot be I think, though the
appearances were greater against us than they are.

Thus God may do with wicked men; but thus God did never do with his own.

A fourth Argument taken from our selves, to induce us to Hope, that God will
do a wonder for us, is, There is a stock of Prayers going out, and laid up for
the good of this Church and Nation.

Many Prayers have been made. And I tell you, all the praying spirits in the
World are now at work for England. Who has a tongue, and does not speak? who
has a hand, and does not stretch it out? and I tell you, this is something
considerable.

If the Prayer of one Moses could do so much; what will the prayers of so many
thousands? What? has God heard England for Scotland? and England for Ireland?
and will he not hear England for it self? that were strange. Shall they save
all others, but their own souls?

Indeed we sometimes read, that praying spirits could not prevail to save
others: but yet they saved their own souls. As God said; Though Noah, Daniel,
and Job were in Jerusalem, they should not deliver Son nor Daughter; they
should only be delivered themselves, Ezekiel. 14.20. But we never read, that
they should prevail to save others, and yet not be able to save their own
souls. Will God then hear us for others, not for our selves? would a friend
grant you a request for another? and deny the same to your self? No certainly.
Nor will God.

A fifth Argument is; This has been a time, wherein God has drawn out the
Graces of his People; which perhaps had they been suppressed and not discovered,
we had been in no hazard.

And do you think that God will draw out the graces of his People, for the
destruction of his people? Indeed nothing is more ordinary, than to draw out
the sins and corruptions of wicked men, for their own ruin, to be Cart-ropes
to bind themselves. But we never heard God did draw out the graces of his
people for their ruin. We read, he has hardened wicked men to destruction*
but never made the heart tender, sensible to destruction. Men have perished by
their fear, deserting the cause of God: but never any who perished by their
courage and standing to it.

Did Esther lose any thing by her Obedience? did Daniel? did the three
Children? It brought them into the fire, but preserved them in the fire:
nothing was consumed but their bands: not one hair was singed. Though God do
draw out the sins of wicked men, to their destruction, as Pharaoh, Haman, etc.
yet he never draws out the graces of his People to their destruction.

I say no more but this. If God should not preserve us; if he should not do a
wonder for us at this time, it is an untracted piece of Providence: we have
not a president of the like, since God had a Church: He does with us so, as
he never did with any of his people since the beginning of the World.

4. Arguments from our enemies.
4 From our enemies.
4 The fourth head of Arguments is taken from our enemies: which may induce us
to Hope, that God will do a wonder for us. Consider then,

1 Their former wickedness, which shall hunt them, and find them out.

2 Their present sinfulness, such as these 1. Their Pride. 2. Their
Profaneness. 3. Their scorn and contempt of God and his ways. 4. Their
Cruelty. 5. Their Blasphemies and Bloody-hell-born-Oathes.


All which induce me to hope, That God will never give a blessing to the
means, nor yet to the men. They have but escaped the hand of man, that they may
fall into the hand of God: The Justice of men, that the Justice of God, who is
a punisher of sin, a consuming fire, might at once be revenged of them. But I
shall only give you two things to consider of. Consider then 1 The Persons
against whom they are. 2 The Persons, who are against us.


1 The Persons against whom they set themselves. And that is, against his
Church, his People, his Saints, his Mourners, his Sighers, his Prayers, his
Members, his Treasures, his Jewels: Such as are as dear to him as the apple of
his eye: such as he has said, he will give men for, and people for their
life. -- Yea, and therefore are they enemies to these, because they are friends
to God; because they run not out with them in the same excess of Riot, as the
Apostle says.

2. Look upon the persons who are against us. They are such as are declared to
be Papists, Atheists, scorners and contemners of God and his ways: such as
are proud, profane, cruel, and bloody-minded-men: haters of God, blasphemers
of his Name, by new and hel-born oaths; such as have made themselves obnoxious
to the stroke of Justice. Many of whom have escaped the hand of man, that they
may, I hope, fall into the hand of God, and the justice of man, that the
justice of God might discover them, and find them out, who will be a sad
avenger of these things.

Thus does the wickedness of the enemy speak deliverance to the Church of God:
when the Devil drives his servants so furiously, it is a sign they will quickly
be at their journies end. When Satan's rage is violent, it is not long; Rev.
12.11. Woe be to the Inhabitants of the Earth (that is, to the wicked, and the
ungodly.) But rejoice ye Heavens: (that is, ye Saints and People of God) why?
For the Devil is come down, having great wrath. But can this be a matter of
rejoicing? Yea says the Text, Because he has but a short time. When the
Devil comes down with great wrath, it prognosticates his time is not long.
When men are grown so hellish in their malice, their oaths and Blasphemies,
that they are become an abhorring and abomination to men: Then will God
certainly ease himself, and unburden a Nation of them. You have something to
this, 2 Timothy 3.8, 9. when their wickedness, of whom the Apostle speaks there,
was abhorred of all men, Then (says he) they shall proceed no further.

Object. But you will tell me, that this will not be enough to persuade with
us, that God will do a wonder for us: For we sometimes read, that God has
given up the godly into the hands of wicked men, to be punished: as you read
ordinarily in Scripture. And Habakkuk complains of the like, Hab. 1.17. Thou
art of purer eyes, than to behold evil, and can not look on iniquity?
Wherefore look thou upon them that deal treacherously, and hold thy
tongue, when the wicked devoureth the man, that is more righteous than himself?

Answ. It is true. God has sometimes given up a people to others, who have
been greater sinners than themselves. He has given up one wicked Nation, to
another that was more wicked than they. But we do not read that God has given
up the good of one to the evil and wicked of the same Nation. But then

2. When God has done this; it has been, when he was highly displeased with
his people, after he has sent Prophets to warn them, to humble and reform
them; and yet they would continue obstinate in their evil ways, and would not
be reformed: as he tells us at large, 2 Chronicles. 36.15, 16.

3 When God has done this; it has been, when his own people have been so
involved, and inwrapped with them, that there was no separating between them.
And thus oftentimes the Saints may be involved in the same general calamities
with the bad, because of that politic union and conjunction that is between
the Members of a state and Commonwealth. So in a Commonwealth universally
sinful, a few righteous men may as parts of that sinful society, be justly
subject to those temporary evils, which the sins of that society have
contracted upon them.

4 When God has done this, it has been, when his own people have had
communion with the sins of them, with whom they live. When there is a
communion with the evil of sin, we must look for a communion with the evil of
punishment. Oneness of sin brings Oneness of sufferings. But none of these are
our case. For

1 We are not to be delivered up to another Nation; but to those, who are
Vipers in our own: and the good to the bad.

2 Though we were involved together; yet they have separated themselves from
us; which if it had not been done, we might suspect, that such Jona's would
raise storms.

Indeed, the way for wicked men to be preserved, is, to body themselves with
the Saints, is to abide by them; whiles the Wheat and ^ares grew together, the
Tares were preserved. The Tares had not been preserved, if they had not been in
the field with the Wheat: But being there, God would not pluck up the Tares,
lest the Wheat also should be destroyed. But when the Wheat is gathered in; or
if the Tares shall separate themselves from the Wheat, bundle themselves
together against the Saints: it is the ready way to their own destruction, that
is the way to have no mercy; when God may deal with them single, and there be
none with them to bear off the blow.

4. Gods People have not communion with them in their sins.

1. They do not approve of them in their Judgments.

2. They do not consent to them in their wills.

3. They do not act them in their lives. This is to have Communion.

No, but further,

1. They are grieved with them; as Lot was, his soul was grieved with the sins
of Sodom.

2. They are grieved for them; not only with them, but for them. They are
matter of their mourning. Thus David shed rivers of tears, because the wicked
kept not Gods law, Ezekiel. 9.4. A mark was to be set on the foreheads of them,
who were Sighers and mourners for the sins of Jerusalem.

3. They are not only grieved with, and grieved for; but they Pray down, Preach
down, mourn down, live down; the sins of this sinful Commonwealth; which may
be an argument to us, that God will preserve us from that overflowing scourge,
that devouring deluge, which he may bring upon wicked men.

5. Argument.
5. The fifth Argument to induce us to hope, that God will now do a wonder for
us, is taken from the Consideration of those great things, which God has
promised to do for his Church and People, in this latter end of the world.

Indeed God has done much for his People in all ages of the World; you may see
his Wonders upon record. But all these are nothing in comparison of those,
which he has engaged himself to do for them hereafter.

The World is the stage, on which God will act all his Wonders; and it cannot
be long before this frame be dissolved, and this stage be taken down. If
Saint John's time were the last hour, surely ours are the last minute.

But yet God will not take down the stage, till all has been acted, which he
has engaged himself to do for his Church.

Now I say, God has engaged himself to destroy that man of sin: to make his
Church glorious.

Read at your leisure; how much God has promised to do for his Church, in Isa.
60. throughout, Glorious Promises, which though they had a gradual
accomplishment in the first Preaching of the Gospel, yet not so fully as the
Words there hold out, which yet must be made good, and therefore it is yet to
be expected.

Hitherto the Church has been buried up under reproach, scorn, and
persecution: hitherto sufferings, Prisons, Fires, stakes, they have been the
Portion of the Church.

As yet, (though we have had our Lucida intervalla, our Respites, and
Breathings) The Church of God has been, like Noah's Ark, tossing, and
fluctuating upon the Billows, and devouring waves of troubles and Persecutions.
And the Saints under the Altar, the blood of the slain, cries, How long Lord,
holy and true! though they say, How long, yet they say, Holy and true: They
give God the glory of his truth and faithfulness. Though he defer the
accomplishment, of what he has promised, yet he is true of his promise.

And has God engaged himself to make his Churches glorious, and that before
the end of all things? And is the day so near to an End? And is God faithful,
is he true of his Promise? why this may something persuade with us, that
notwithstanding the present oppositions, and troubles, God is now coming in
with mercy and deliverance to his Church and People.

And God has not left us without home-hopes, that the work is begun -- That
mighty Spirit of Prayer, which God has poured out upon his People; That
increase of light and knowledge, the weakening of the man of sin, in those two
Limbs, whereon he has stood so strongly: Germany and Spain: that numerous
increase of converts, within these few years: All which are fore-running signs
of the Rising Condition of the Church. God does not use to beget Children to
the Murderers; nor to increase the number of his People, to fatten the sword of
the enemy.

Indeed, when God has intended to bring judgments upon a People, He has
taken his People away: he has lessened the number, as he tells us Isa. 57.1.
He takes them away from the evil to come: but he never increases them
against judgments. As the lessening presageth judgment: so, when he
increases them, it is a presage of mercy.

Every one, that is now brought in, every Convert we have, is a Pledge to this
Nation, that God will nor destroy this Nation. Nay, it is an evidence, that God
will do great things for us.

Act. 7.17. It is said, When the time of Promise drew nigh, the people grew and
multiplied in Egypt. Their growing was a sign of their rising: their increase
discovered the promised mercy was not far off.

And these are the hopeful signs, that the day of the Churches redemption draws
nigh, and is even at the doors. As Christ said of the fig tree, when you see
the Fig Tree bud, and put forth her leaves; know that Summer is nigh; So when
you see these things, you may know, that the Churches Redemption is at hand.
God is risen upon his throne, and will not sit down (if our sins do not make
him repent) till he have made his Church glorious in the earth.

And now having told you my thoughts, and that which persuades with me to hope,
that God will do a wonder for us, yet I must tell you again (that you may not
be discouraged with the sad appearance of things) that we may suffer many
throws, many pangs, much opposition, and perhaps some blood, before these
things. God will save us From trouble, by trouble: He will bring us through a
Sea, and through the wilderness unto Canaan. Yet I will say as Joshuah did,
Numb. 14.8. If the Lord has any delight in us, he will bring us into this
Land.

God seldom does great things, without great commotions. Paul and Silas were
not delivered out of Prison, but by an Earthquake. Though it be grievous to
see, yet it is that we fear. And we must not forsake a good cause, because of
opposition. This were to leap, out of the ship, because the winds blow: to be
impatient of the Ark, because the billows rise: to seek our safety in the midst
of Danger.

This assure your selves: Though Earth and hell should fight against you: your
safety lies on Gods side, in Gods cause: and there is no safety elsewhere.

These things I suggest to you, by way of Cautional advise: that when you see
these things, you may not be troubled. As Christ said to his Disciples, These
things I tell you before, that when they do come to pass, your hearts may not
be troubled: So these things I tell you before, that, though God will deliver
us from trouble, yet it will be by trouble: though he save us, yet it shall
be by fire: that, when you see these things you may not be troubled, when you
see storms to fall, oppositions and troubles to arise, you may not be moved
from your own stedfastness.

I tell you, this is necessary advice, a seasonable admonition to you: lest the
oppositions and seeming contrarieties of Gods proceedings should weaken your
faith, and move you from your own steadfastness.

The best of us are too apt to live by sense, and not by faith; by works, and
not by the Word; by Gods outward appearances, and proceedings of Providence,
and not by Promises. And therefore out Faith, does wane, or increase according
as God does let out, or restrain himself in the ways of his Providence, when
God does let out himself to succor and releeve his Church; when we see
deliverance in the Promise, and deliverance in his outward proceedings too;
then we can believe: but, if God do any way restrain himself, or his outward
Proceedings do seem to walk contrary to his own Promises: Though perhaps that
be the next way for the performance of his Promises. As you see it was with
Joseph, with Israel in Egypt, where the Promise spoke one thing; and Gods
outward proceedings seemed to speak another.

In this case we are ready to give up all, and thus did David: I shall one
time or other perish by the hand of Saul; and therefore we should learn this
lesson in some kind, to shut our eyes to the works of God, and look upon the
Word of God: Not only to look upon the outward proceedings of Providence: but
upon the stability and truth of the promise: and see the Word say Yea, when the
Works seem to say Nay: and conclude, because the Promise says, it shall be;
though all secondary means, whereby the Promise should be performed, say, It
shall not be.

We read that Ulisses; when he was to pass the Coast of the Sirens, he
caused his men to stop their ears, that they might not be enchanted by their
music, to destroy themselves: But for himself, he would only be bound to the
Mast, that though he should hear, yet their music might not be so strong as
to allure him to destroy himself, and leap into the Sea.

There are some of Gods people who are weak in Faith: And when they see Gods
outward proceedings of Providence seemingly contrary to his Promises; they are
apt to be charmed from their own stedfastness. Now as for these, it were good
for them to stop their ears, and to shut their eyes to the works, and look
altogether upon the Word of God: But there are some that are stronger, and
therefore may look upon the outward proceedings of God: But withal let them
bind themselves fast to the Mast, the Word of God; lest, when they see the
seeming contrariety of his proceedings to the Promise, they be charmed from
their own stedfastness, to the wounding of their own souls.

God has promised, that Antichrist shall fall: He has promised to make his
Church glorious. And though in outward proceedings he should seem to uphold
the one, and evil entreat the other; yet let not this weaken our Faith, in
believing the truth of what God has promised.

If you put a straight stick into the water, yet sense will render it to be
crooked; it will appear so to the eye: but reason corrects it, and tells you,
though it appear to be so, yet it is not so; you put it in straight, and so it
is.

Does reason prevail against sense? and why should not Faith prevail against
Reason? when to outward appearance, God seems to be against us, why should not
we by Faith conclude, that God is for us? even for us, when he seems to be
against us?

The outward face of things may be such as may possess the Church with fear,
when God has a purpose to do great things for his Church. So you read in Joel
2.21. Fear not, O Land; be glad, and rejoice; for the Lord will do great
things for you. It was a time of Joy, in respect of Gods purpose; and yet a
time of fear, in respect of their present apprehensions. God had a purpose to
do great things for them, and yet the face and outward appearance of things
were such, as did at that time possess the Church with fear. It was so; but it
should not have been so.

You see what Christ says, in Luke 21.25. There shall be signs in the Sun, in
the Moon, in the Stars; and upon the earth distress of Nations; the Sea and
Waters roaring, men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after the
things that shall come upon the Earth, for the Powers of Heaven shall be
shaken. Could there be a sadder appearance? And yet says Christ, when these
things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your
redemption draws nigh.

Here you see Christ does turn the saddest and sorest perplexities, that ever
the world shall see, into a Doctrine of Comfort to his Church; because all these
things were but a preparatory to the redemption of the Church.

One would think this to be a strange consequent deduced from such an
Antecedent: A Consequent so comfortable, from an Antecedent so terrible: that
so terrible a Doctrine should afford us an use of Consolation. Yet so it is. Be
the premises what they will, the conclusion is good. Be his Providence what
they will, his Promise is good; and those promises shall turn all those
Providence to good.

And this is the admonition I give you, that whatever oppositions, whatever
troubles, whatever evils we meet withal in the way of deliverance; Be not
troubled, let not your hearts be discouraged: for this is the way whereby God
will do you good; making all your evil and trouble subservient to good.

What the Apostle says of his Bonds, I may say of all oppositions, Phil.
1.12. The things which have happened to me, have fallen out to the furtherance
of the Gospel. His prison was the Gospels liberty; his straits and bonds, the
Gospels enlargement; his abasements, the Gospels advancements.

As we say, the choicest blessings come out of the fire of afflictions: so the
greatest deliverances come out of the greatest oppositions. And thus much for
that.

We will now come to Application.

Uses
First of Information, and that of diverse particulars. 1 Information touching
the greatness of God.


1 It informs us of the greatness of our God.

1. Of his Power. 2. Of his Wisdom. 3. Of his Mercy. 4. Of his faithfulness,
toward his people.
For all these Attributes are visibly declared in every wonder God does for his
Church.

1 His Power.
1 God discovers the greatness of his Power in every wonder he does for them.
If a man were able to do it, it were no wonder. Hence he is said to make bare
his arm, to reveal his Power. And it is attributed to his right hand, to his
outstretched arm, etc.

2 His Wisdom.
2. God discovers the greatness of his Wisdom.

1. Wisdom in the Manner, In relieving in such a way as could not be
conceived.

2. Wisdom in the Time, In helping in such a time, when things are desperate;
or in such a time, when he gets himself most glory, and does us most good.

3. Wisdom in the means, by relieving of us.

1. By such means as we never thought of, or

2. By such, as if we had thought of, would have been judged too small to have
wrought so great a deliverance.

3. Or by such, which we should rather have judged a means of ruin, than of
raising us: yet Gods wisdom sees more than we can.

3 Gods Mercy.
3 God discovers abundance of Mercy; yea and Free Mercy. Every deliverance of
his Church being wrought out of his own bowels and compassion, Psalm. 136.
(which is a Psalm of praises for wonders.) You see at the foot of every verse,
a declaration of Mercy -- He brought his People out of Egypt; for his Mercy
indureth for ever. He divided the Red Sea; for his Mercy indureth for ever.
He overthrew Pharaoh and his Host; for his Mercy indureth for ever.

4 Gods Truth.
4. God discovers his Truth and Faithfulness to his Church. God has engaged
himself by many precious promises to do wonders for them. And all the
deliverances of God, they are performances of promises. They may be all
subscribed at the foot of the promise, as so many particular instances and
experiences to prove the truth of the promise, and to discover the faithfulness
of the Promiser to us. They are so many witnesses to both. By the mouth of two
or three witnesses every word shall be established, says the Apostle. It is
true, it is spoken of the word or man, not of the Word of God. God is Truth it
self. You may believe him without a witness. But yet God has not left himself
without witness; As the Apostle says. Nor has God left any word without
witness.

There is never a truth, never a promise in the Word, but it has been made
good by a thousand experiences; we have a Book of Experiences, to annex to the
book of Promises, of the many wonders, which God has in all ages wrought for
his people: all which does discover the faithfulness and truth of God, and the
Promise to us.

2. Information. 2 Information
This may inform us of the blessed and happy Condition of the Saints, who have
interest in such a God; as can do wonders for them: Propriety in
all sufficiency does make the injoyer happy. And what a blessed Condition is
this, to have interest in such a God, who can do wonders, for the relieving of
us.

Though your troubles may be too big for man, yet not for God; your miseries
and extremities may be above the supply of creatures: but they cannot be
above the Power of God; He can do wonders: he can do that, which man cannot
do.

Though you have no ordinary means of help, yet you have interest in a God, who
can do extraordinary things: yea, and Extraordinary things in an ordinary way:
nay, by Ordinary means, if he undertake the work. I may say concerning such,
as the Psalmist -- Blessed are the people that are in such a case. Blessed are
the people, whose God is the Lord, Psalm. 144.15.

3. Information. This may inform us, 3 Information
How precious the Saints are in the esteem of God, what love he bears to his
Church, that he will do wonders for them. Wonders for their preservation from
trouble, and wonders for their deliverance out of trouble.

Men may do smaller courtesies for ordinary and common friends: and they may
give their dole to them, they do not care for. But, if they will lay out the
utmost of their power, of their strength, and estates, to hold up, or to do
good to, or to relieve one: we must needs conclude, they love such entirely.

Gods Dole, his common blessings of this life, Rex honores dignis congiarium et
indignis Senec.
will not be enough to evidence his love: He causes his Sun to shine, and
his rain to fall upon the good and bad promiscuously. But when God does
exercise the greatness of his Power, Wisdom, Truth, Mercy, as he does in the
wonders he does for his Church: this is an evident sign of that love he bears
thereto.

Wicked men may be subjects on whom he does exercise the Wonders of his
Justice, and of his Power. As Pharaoh. But the Saints are they, for whom he
does exercise the wonders of his mercy, in mercy. Gods wonders are for the
good, or for them in a good way.

that the Condition of the Church is oftentimes, very sad, very dark, very
evil: because a wonder must be expressed for relieving of them.

Ordinary reliefs may help ordinary distempers. But when extraordinary must be
used; it declares the conditions are exceeding sad.

The very doing of a wonder for relief, implies a condition to be such, as is
beyond the helps and succors of humane and created Power. If men could help,
if means could relieve, it were no wonder to help. Therefore this implies, that
the Condition of the Church, in respect of things below; may be oftentimes very
sad, very miserable; yet

5 Information
5. This informs us again, that the Conditions of Gods People, Come never to be
so sad and uncomfortable, as thereby to despair of help and relief: seeing we
have a God who does wonders for us. Our Condition is not so low, but a Wonder
may raise us up again.

We may be hopeless and helpless, in respect of Creature supplies and
reliefs: but we can never be Hopeless, never helpless in respect of Gods; when
Creature-helps fail, God does but turn us from sense, to Faith; from reasoning,
to believing, from Creatures, to himself. He bids us shut our eyes, to the
things below, and look altogether above, as Jehoshaphat did -- Lord, we know
not what to do; but our eyes are up unto thee. And David too, when he
encouraged himself in the Lord his God. In the most hopeless condition there
is a door of hope: because deliverance is nearest, when help seems furthest
off.

And Oh! that we could learn, at such a time as this, to live by Faith, and
not by sense; to shut our eyes to works, and look upon the word of God: we
should then be strong in God, and find encouragement from him, when we see
nothing, but discouragements from below.

We are too apt to live by sense, and not by faith; and therefore accordingly
as God does let out, or restrain himself, in the ways of his providence; so
our faith does wane, or increase.

We are too like Hagar; when the Bottle is dry, sit down and Cry. Whereas, on
the Contrary; we should trust in God.

1. In the weakness of means. Though there be weakness below, there is strength
above, weakness and strength are all one with God. Nay

2. In the want of means. Though means be wanting, yet God can create means:
nay, do his work without means. Nay

3. In the Opposition of means. When the Word says, Yea; though works say,
Nay: when the Promise says, It shall be. Though all Secondary means, whereby
this Promise should be effected, says, It shall not be: yet are we to rest
upon God, and the Promise.

God does often speak one thing to sense; and another thing to Faith. He is
not ever that in Appearance, which he is in Truth. He may speak death to
sense, as you see he did to the Children of Israel, at the Red sea. Had they
consulted with sense and Reason, they could see nothings but death: when yet
he speaks life and deliverance to faith. As you see Moses says -- Fear ye
not: stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord. God may, in outward
appearance speak evil, when yet, in the purposes of his heart, he speaks good.

As God may seem to heal, when he means to destroy: to speak Peace in his
Providence, when he speaks terror in his word: so God may seem to kill, when
he intends to cure: to destroy, when he intends to save, Jer. 29.11. -- I know
the thoughts, I have thought toward you, says the Lord, the thoughts of Peace,
and not of trouble: even to give you a desired end. Though my proceedings sem
to be evil, yet my thoughts are good; though my ways are war, yet my purposes
are peace, to give you at the last, an expected end.

6. Information. This may inform us, 6 Information
That there is no ground for wicked men, to insult and glory, in any probable
advantages, which they may have against the Church and People of God; God can
work wonders for his Church and People.

You see in the verse before the Text, the Egyptians had many advantages
against the People of God: and they promised to themselves certain and
infallible success. They said, they would -- Pursue, they would overtake, they
would divide the spoil, their Lust should be satisfied on them, etc. But God
shows a Wonder, and lays all their Pride, and all their hopes in the dust;
what began in pride, did end in shame.

It was the best speech, that Ahab ever spoke; when Benhadad made such a vain
boast, that the dust of Samaria should not serve for handfuls of them, who
followed him. -- Tell him, (says Ahab) Let not him that girdeth on his
harness, boast himself, as he that puts it off. -- God shows a wonder, and
all is turned about, 1 King. 20.11. And forward Benhadad, and his thirty two
Kings, who came to help him, fled before the face of seven thousand of Israel,
as there you may read.

7. Information. This may inform us, 7 Information
What engagements of duty and obedience do lie upon such a People, for whom God
shall do wonders.

1 What engagements of Love. Love is the Loadstone to beget Love. And God
having expressed his love to us, how should this engage us to love him again.

2. What engagements of thankfulness, Psalm. 111.4. He has done his wonderful
works to be remembered. As if he had said. This is the end, I did these
wondrous works for, that you should remember them. If you would not have
remembered them, I would not have done them.

It is the speech of Seneca. This is the rule of good turns, Haec est lex
beneficiorum.
that the giver must soon forget he gave: but the receiver must never forget,
he has received.

Indeed God has done wonders for this Nation; many wonders, wherein he has
expressed his Wisdom, his Power, his mercy, his Justice; And yet God has
forgotten he has given; he goes on as freely in mercy, as if every mercy were
the first mercy he has bestowed.

But have not we forgotten that we have received? if so, God will Remember,
that he has given.

God does remember he has given, when his People forget they have received.
As you see he did to David: I have done this and this, and if that had been
too little; I would have given thee such and such things more: so upbraiding
him with his forgetfullnesse.

If you would not have God remember against you, what he has given: do you
then remember what you have received from God. This will quicken you to
thankfulness.

8 Information
8. Information. If God do wonders for his Church; then let this discover unto
us, What ground, and what encouragement there is for us at this time, 1. To
trust in God. 2. To pray to him. 3. To hope in him. 4. To wait upon him, that
he would do wonders for us. You have encouragements,


1 From the experience of God: he has done wonders, read the 78. Psalm, and
the 9th of Nehemiah; and you shall see a little Chronicle of the great Wonders,
which God has done for his Church and People. And this is a mighty
encouragement, the experience of what God has done for his People heretofore.

As we may say of the Experience of Gods Judgments on the wicked. Lege
exemplum, ne exemplum fias: read the example, lest thou thy self be made an
Example: read the example of Sodom, of Pharaoh, of Jerusalem. All these were
set up, to deter you from their sins: As the judgments of God upon the wicked
men, are set down to deter us from sin: so the mercyes and deliverances of the
Church are recorded, To encourage us to believe, to trust in him, in the like
difficulties.

Can our condition be sadder than Isreal's was at the Red Sea? than David's was?
than Jehoshaphats? than the Churches in Hamans time? And God did then deliver
them, that we might be Encouraged to trust in him, in the like straits and
difficulties.

And as we have encouragement from the experience of Gods wonderful
deliverance of others: so we have encouragement from the wonderful deliverance
of our selves.

Revolve in your thoughts those great deliverances in Eighty-Eight, in the
Powder Treason: and that late deliverance which swallows up all the rest: when
the Heavens were black, the Clouds were gathered, and threatened to come down in
a storm of blood: when two Armies were in the field, and ready to make our Land
an Aceldema, a field of blood; yet how wonderfully God did then step in, to
compose the differences, and to settle a peace, when there was nothing but
expectations of war and ruin?

This our God has done, and besides this many fresh and later experiences of
his goodness: All which should now come in to encourage us to believe, and
trust in the same God, to do great things for us.

Indeed, we ought to trust God, though we had never tried him; though we had
never experience from him. But when he helps our Faith, by former experiences;
this should strengthen our confidence, and make us to go unto God, as to a
tried friend.

Were we but well read in the story of our lives, we might have a Bible of
our own, drawn out of the experiences of Gods dealings with our selves; and we
should be able to say in any difficulty and distress; I dare trust God in
this difficulty; I dare venture on him in this present distress. I have tried
him, and have found him true, he never failed me. And because he has been
my help, therefore under the shadow of his wings will I rejoice; as says the
Prophet.

2. A second encouragement is, From the Power of God. 2. Encouragement.
He can do wonders. He not only has, but he can do wonders still. -- The
Arm of the Lord is not shortened, that he cannot save. What he has done, he
can do. He is still as wise, as powerful, as faithful, as merciful as ever he
was. There is no shadow of change in him. There is nothing above his skill, nor
above his power; if not above your Faith to believe.

It is our sin only, which hinders the current of Mercy, that stops the stream
of Mercy: our unbeleef, our neglect of duty, our unthankfulness, our pride,
etc. Let us remove these, and Mercy comes amain. You have a full place for it,
Judge. 10.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, etc. You see there, that God had
oftentimes delivered them; he had wrought many wonders for them, as he tells
them there. And they were now again in a new distress, and therefore cry to
God. But God tells them they had walked unworthy of former deliverances, and
therefore he would deliver them no more; whereupon they go and confess their
sins before God, they humble themselves, and reform their evil ways. And
(says the Text) His soul was then grieved for the misery of Israel. -- God
delivers them.

Well. this may be our condition. God has wrought many deliverances for us:
we are now in new straits; but we have walked unworthy, and our sins may
stand as an obstacle to hinder Gods proceedings of mercy. Let us now then
humble our selves, and reform, and God will be grieved for our misery, as he
was for theirs.

3 A third encouragement that we have to these duties, is, from the
consideration of Gods love to his Church, and many precious engagements to them
in promises. The Church is dear to him; we are his Spouse, his Members, such
as he dyed for, etc.

We are his, 1. By Choice. 2. By Purchase. 3. By Gift. 4. By Covenant.


And being his, he will do great things for us also.

Gods love to his Church is that, into which we may resolve all the mercies
he does for his Church; and is the only ground of our Faith and hope, to
expect mercies from him. It is the Sea, the spring. Well then, having so strong
encouragements to these duties, I would now have spent a little time to have
pressed these duties on you; but I forbear.

9 Information.
9. Information. This may inform us, what is the reason that God suffers wicked
men to conceive, and to hatch mischief against the Church: Nay, and to bring up
their designs to ripeness, that they are ready for execution: why God does not
disturb them all their way. Here is the Reason. Because he can do wonders.
Though he let them go on, yet they can never get the advantage of God, nor can
they make it past Gods help. It is but showing a wonder at last, and all is
dashed.

Men, when they see an adversary, whom they can easily Master, when they
please, they will let them go on, counsel, advise, lay their heads and power
together, and seem to take no notice of them. They know, the further they let
them go, the fuller and compleater will be their overthrow at last.

So does God here. He suffers wicked men to go on, but is, because he knows
he can overtake them, though they think they have got the start, before they
come to the goal, or get the prize.

When men see, there would be some hazard at last, when they had brought their
design to ripeness, or did fear, that the adversary would be too strong for
them: then they will labor to hinder the beginnings and gatherings; they will
endeavor to crush the birth of their counsels, or they will set themselves
against their power, as soon as they can. And this is the wisest way among men.

But now God, he can let them go on; he can let them bring their designs to
ripeness; they can never swell so big, as to be too great for his power to
conquer them; can never make their design so strong, as to nonplus his
wisdom, and skill to help.

And therefore he will let them go on, because he can dash them in their
Manhood, as well as in their infancy, in their strength, as well as in their
weakness. It is but showing a wonder, and all is done.

And this was the Reason why God suffered the five Kings of Canaan to lay all
their strength together, that they might be able to do that jointly, which
they were never able to do singly. Yet it is said, -- The Lord hardened their
hearts to join together, to come against Israel. Though they thought by this
means to overthrow Israel: yet Gods end was to make the quicker dispatch, the
fuller overthrow of them.

And therefore he let Pharaoh also to go on; did not stop him in his
preparations, nor hinder him in his setting forth, but let him follow them to
the utmost. God knew he could have him at the last; he could show a wonder,
and break all in pieces.

The like of Haman. God could, if he would, have dashed his bloody counsel in
the beginning; he could have set the King against it. But he lets him go on,
and bring his design to ripeness; and then declares a wonder, and ruins him
and his counsel too.

And this is the reason why God suffers wicked men to go on, gather themselves
together, bring their designs to the utmost: Because he can break them in the
end, as well as in the beginning. It is but doing a wonder at last, which is
familiar with God; and all is broken in pieces. And therefore Melancthon says,
Non est judicandum de operibus dei ante quartum actum.

2. Use.
Let it be an Use of cautional Advise to wicked men. 2 Use is for Caution to
the wicked.
Let them beware of designing or attempting any thing against the Church and
People of God, seeing they have such a one on their side, as can, and will do
Wonders for the relieving of them.

It was a truth, which Zerish Hamans wife told him, Esther 6.17. -- If Mordecai
be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou have begun to fall; thou shall
not prevail against him, but shall surely fall before him. It seems it was a
known truth of those days, even among Heathens, that there should be no
power, nor counsel against the Church of God. God would do wonders for them.

Gods people are dear to God; they are all the riches he has in the World:
He calls them so: His Inheritance, his Portion, his Jewels, his Treasure. He
has a great deal of lumber in the world besides: but these are his Jewels
only; and it cost him dear to make them Jewels. It was no lesser than the price
of his own blood. As the Apostle says -- You were not redeemed with silver and
gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, 1 Pet. 1.19. Gods people are all
the Income Christ had for his blood and sufferings: all that Christ desired:
all that God promised, and all he enjoys. As you see, Isa. 53.11, 12. He shall
see of the travel of his Soul and shall be satisfied, etc.

And do you think then, that God will not preserve his People? yes certainly,
and will not stand to do wonders to preserve them. Assure your selves, God will
never desert his cause, his Church, his People; when things are brought up to
their ripeness, that God is, as it were, drawn out to discover to the world,
in what cause he will stand, for what persons he will fight: Then he will
declare it to the comfort of his Saints, and to the cost of all those, who are
enemies to the Church of God.

God has promised, That he will never leave us, nor forsake us: He has said
-- He will be with us, as he was with Joseph, in Prison. And that not only
as a Spectator but as an Actor: not as one to look on, and take notice only:
but as one to relieve and help us. His power shall be with us, his Wisdom
with us, etc.

And as he is with his Church: so is he against the Enemies of it. His Power
is against them, before whom All the Nations of the Earth are but as the drop
of a bucket: And his wisdom against them; his justice and truth against them.
And Woe be to them whom God is against. Thou may stand out against the
power of men: but not of God, if he once prove thine enemy.

He has a rod of Iron, a Scepter of power, an arm of strength to crush in
pieces all his adversaries. And therefore as Pilates Wife said to her Husband:
-- Have nothing to do with that just man: so I say to you, Have nothing to do,
by way of offense, against the Church, and People of God; you will but ruin
your selves, in seeking their ruin. Gods Church is both too heavy, and too hot
for you; see them both, Zach. 12.3. There God says of his Church, That he
would make it a burdensome stone: who ever lifts at it, shall be crushed in
pieces, though all the Nations of the world be gathered together against her,
yet all will be to no purpose.

For God will make his Church a burdensome stone, that whosoever lifts at her
shall be crushed in pieces. He does not say, whoever lifeth it up, for that
cannot be; but, whoever lifts at it, whoever seeks to hurt it, shall crush
themselves. Their very attempt shall be their destruction.

Haman lifted so long at this stone, that it fell on him at last, and crushed
him to pieces.

Pharaoh followed the Children of Israel so long, that there was no return at
the last: he was buried in the waters.

Julian attempted evil against the Church so long, till at last God from heaven
struck him, slew him. The Church, God makes too heavy for his enemies, and too
hot too. As you see in the 6. verse of that 12th Chapter of Zach. In that day
will I make the Governors of Judah, like an hearth of fire among the wood, and
like a torch of fire in a sheaf: and they shall devour all the people round
about.

All the encounters of wicked men against the Church, is but like a sheaf of
straw encountering with a torch of fire, that burns themselves.

Whiles the iron is in its own nature you may handle it, and deal with it: but
if once the nature of Fire be put to it, then ware your fingers, if you prove
so bold and hardy as to touch it.

We say, He that shoots in a piece overcharged strikes down himself, not that
he aimed at. There was never man, who levelled piece against the Church, but
he shoots in a piece overcharged, and shall be sure at last to be struck down
with its own recoil.

They shall but lay snares, to take themselves; dig graves to bury themselves
in, make rods for their own backs, and pave a way for their own destruction at
last, Isa. 54.15, 16, 17. Behold, the enemy shall gather himself, but without
me: whosoever shall gather himself in thee against thee, shall fall. Behold, I
have created the Smith, that blows the coals in the fire, and him that
brings forth an instrument for his work, and I have created the destroyer to
destroy. No weapon made against thee shall prosper: every tongue that shall
rise against thee in judgment, shall thou condemn. This is the heritage of the
Lords servants, etc.

God will work wonders for the deliverance of his Church; and for the
destruction of the wicked at last. Let this be for caution therefore to the
wicked persecutors.

Let this be for encouragement of Gods People, 3 Use of Encouragement to the
People of God.
in these Times of danger and trouble. Though our condition be very sad at
this time, Our enemies strong, we weak; they full of rage and bitterness
against us: yet there is no cause of fears, nor of discouragement.

1 There is no cause of fear, seeing we have a God on our side, and such a
God, as is able to do wonders for us. You may set God against all the strength,
and provisions of the Arm of flesh.

Thus you see David did, Psalm. 20.7. Some trust in Charriots and some in
Horses: but we will remember the name of the Lord our God. He set God against
all.

Alas! what are Castles and Forts? what are multitudes of men? what are riches?
what is Provision of horse? the Psalmist tells you, Psalm. 33 17. A Horse is but
a vain thing to save a man, Isa. 31.3. Their Horses are flesh, and not Spirit.
-- Prove. 21.31. The Horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is
of the Lord.

All this, and whatever an adversary may have to glory in, is but an arm of
flesh: but you have a God, and a God that can do wonders for you. I will boast
in God (says the Prophet) all the day long.

Give not way then to sinkings of Spirit: you have no cause of fears, if you
look above, as well as below: if you converse with Heaven as well as with
Earth. Indeed, if we look below, God for the relief of (the weakness of our
Faith) has stirred up the hearts of our worthys and People to afford so
willing a concurrence in the service of the King and Kingdom at this time. But
this is not our strength. Look above, and you have a God, who can, who will do
wonders for you.

Fear is utterly unbeseeming 1 A Christian, who is the soldier of Christ. 2
Religion, which is the Cause of Christ.


1 It is unbefitting a Christian. For the Righteous should be bold as a Lion.
Let the sinners in Zion be afraid: not you, who have so great a God as can do
wonders for you.

Luthers spirit does well befit a Christian (especially in these days) who,
when he was dissuaded from going to Worms; (about some extraordinary
business of the Church) because of some Plots laid against him, he makes reply
-- Vocatus ingrediar, etsi scirem tot esse Diabolos Wormatiae, quot sunt
tegulae in aedium tectis. I am called to it, and though every tile in the City
were a devil, I would go. This was Resolution and courage befitting a
Christian, who is a soldier of Christ. And

2 Fear is unbeseeming Religion; which is the cause of Christ. A good cause
should have a good courage. It was the speech of Luther to Melancthon, who was
an holy, though a fearful man, when Melancthon had discovered his fears to him.
-- If our cause be not good, let us desist, and leave it. If it be good; let
us go on courageously: Christ's cause, and a Cowards heart are ill coupled
together.

Gods People are too apt to this: And therefore does Christ steel the heart of
his Disciples against it. -- Fear not little flock. Though a little flock: yet
there is no cause to fear, having so strong a Shepherd. -- And, fear not worm
Jacob; though a worm and weak, apt to be trod upon: yet fear not. Isa. 41.13,
14. -- I will help thee, says the Lord, thy Redeemer; the holy-one of Israel.
-- And, Who art thou, that are afraid of a man, that shall dye, and forgets the
Lord, thy maker? Arguing, if they had not forgotten God, they would not have
feared man.

What though they be carried on with all headstrong violence, to seek our
ruin? what though their purposes be cruel? God can,

1 Calm them, still them, as he did the Sea. Peace and be still; as he did
Esau, when he came against Jacob.

2 Stop them in their way. He, that Sets bounds to the Sea, and says hitherto
shall thou come, and here shall thou stop thy proud waves: can set them at a
full stand.

So you see he did Senacherib. -- I will put my bridle into his lips, and my
hook into his nose. And I will bring thee back the same way thou came, etc. 2
King. 19.23.

3. He can turn them, and change their hearts: as he did Paul's, when he went
out breathing threatenings, and slaughter against the Church of Christ, Act. 9.

4. He can over-turn them, overpower them, even wherein they deal proudly he
will be above them, Exodus 18.11. bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat
in a dry place, even the heat with the shadow of a cloud, etc. Isay 25.5.

2 As there is no cause of fear, so there is much less any cause of
discouragement, in these days of evil, God can do wonders.

You shall never know what God can do, nor what God will do, till you stand in
need: God loves to appear in time of extremity; he loves to put forth himself
in desperate cases.

As the shipmans star never appears, but before death: so Gods Power never
discovers it self, till a dissolution and death of secondary means.

When we have the sentence of death passed upon us, in respect of created
helps and means: then is Gods time, to step in, to recover and relieve us.

You see this in the Apostle, 2 Cor. 1.9. We received the sentence of death in
our selves, that we might not trust in our selves, but in God, who raises the
dead.

We should not know, what God can do, if it did not appear, what man cannot
do; we should not know the power of God, if we did not see the weakness of man.

It was Bernards rapture upon the meditation of Adams sin. -- Foelix culpa!
quae talem meruit redemptorem! Happy fault! which occasioned us such a
Redeemer! I may better say. Happy necessity! which occasioned the reliefs, of
such a God, which ingageth God to help us, and relieve us.

Were it not for the greatness of our misery, we should not have experiences
of Gods mercy. And how many would say, I would not lose the Experiences of Gods
goodness, in such a sad condition I was in, for a thousand worlds? I would
rather go through a thousand such sad conditions, than want one of those
experiences of his mercy in it.

At these times you shall have Experience of Gods Power, wisdom, mercy,
faithfulness, more than all your life. All which are drawn out to help in need.

As I never knew confident strength to prosper, so I never read of trusting
weakness to miscarry. If you peruse the word, you shall often read, that Gods
people have miscarryed in the strength of means, but never read, they
miscarried in weakness. And the Reason is, because they trusted God in the
one, and were self-confident in the other.

This is our spirit, when means are weak and wanting, then we fly to God; but
when means are strong to bring purposes to pass, we are apt to rest upon them.

You see it was so with Asa: Once he was weak, and then he trusted: another
time he was strong, and then he was self confident. And the issue in the one,
was, -- he prospered; in the other -- he miscarried. Weak means were
successful, because the strong God was in them; his Faith brought God into
them: and strong means were unfruitful, because he made God of them, he
trusted in them.

As God thinks himself neglected, when we will not trust in him, in the
presence of means: so he thinks his power disparaged, when we will not trust
in him, in the absence of means. Not to trust in God in strength of means, is
to neglect God. Not to trust in him in weakness of means, is to limit God.

God loves then to appear, when none else will, when none else can. It was the
Argument which David had, Psalm. 22.11. -- Be not far from me, for trouble is
near; for there is none to help. This was that whereby he would engage God to
help: because there was none else to help him.

As it was said of the Redemption of the Church from sin: so it may be said of
her deliverance from trouble. -- When he looks about, and sees no man, then
his right hand shall bring salvation. He will do a wonder to save you.

Though there be Mountains of Oppositions in the way, yet he can encounter
with them; and there are four ways God deals with Mountains, with strong
Oppositions.

1. He either melts the Mountains, he dissolves them as water, Isa. 64.3. --
When thou did terrible things, which we looked not for; thou came down,
and the Mountains melted at thy presence. -- In the former verse, they trembled
at his presence; he unhearted them, took away their courage: and here they
flowed down at his presence. Not flowed up; or grew stronger: but flowed down,
were melted and dissolved at his presence; he took away their strength. Or

2. He lays them into plains. That is, He makes those Mountains, which were
before unpassable for greatness, now to be no Opposition at all, in the ways
of his people: He levels and lays even the hearts of the enemies, that they
shall not be any hinderance to the passage of his people. And thus, Zach. 4.7.
-- Who art thou, O great Mountain, before Zerubbabel? thou shall be a plain. Or

3. He thrasheth the Mountains: He destroys those, who stand to oppose Gods
Church and People. So you have it, Isa. 41.14, 15. -- Fear not, thou Worm
Jacob; I will help thee, says the Lord thy Redeemer. Why, how will he help?
-- Behold, I will make thee a sharp Iron instrument with teeth; and thou shall
thrash the Mountains, and beat them small, and make the Hills a^ chaff; and the
wind shall carry them away, and the whirlewind shall scatter them: And thou
shall rejoice in the Lord, and glory in the holy one of Israel. -- Pharaoh was
such a Mountain, and such an one was Senacherib; but he thrashed them both.

4. He passes over them. He steps over the head of all Oppositions, which
are in the way to the deliverance of his Church, Cant. 2.8. Christ is there
described to -- come leaping over the Mountains, and skipping over the Hills.
And as he did, when he came to deliver his People from sin, so he does
often, when he comes to redeem his Church from trouble, -- He comes skipping
over the Mountains, passes over the head of all opposition, when he comes to
deliver them.

And therefore trouble not your selves for the greatness of Opposition: Though
there should be never so many Mountains of Opposition, yet God can melt them,
or he can level them, or thrash them, or skip over them. And one way or other
God will do, for the deliverance of his Church.

We look and pray for this last. That God would overlook all Oppositions, and
come and help us.

4. Use.
Is God able to do wonders for his people? 4. Use. To teach
then if we have been a people, whom God has wrought wonders for: such things
as none but God alone could work: as indeed he has: let us hereby be taught
three lessons.

1. Of Thankfulness. 2. Of Obedience. 3. Of Dependence.
1. Here is a lesson of thankfulness to be learned. We, 1. Thankfulness.
even we stand before God this day, the subjects of abundance of mercies. Many
mercies God has bestowed on us, and long continued to us: Many evils he has
kept from us, and many evils he has freed us from. We stand before God this
day, the brands of many glorious deliverances, which God has wrought for us.
We have received more mercy, and have had experience of more goodness,
preventing, delivering mercy, within these three years, than others have had in
three Generations.

God has discovered the wonders of his wisdom, the wonders of his power, the
wonders of his mercy and love, in many a glorious deliverance, which he has
wrought for us. And how ought we to be carried out with praises under the
enjoyments of so many mercies? how should our souls, being warmed with the
sense and consideration of these mercies, burst forth into a flame of praises
to God?

But alas! It is with us, as with the Children of Israel. We are very
solicitous wanters, but we are forgetful injoyers. And that which should be a
means of drawing us nearer to God, is a means of further distance from him.

I must tell you, that your unthankfulness under all these receipts of mercy, is
a great and a provoking sin, and might justly make a stop of mercy now.

1. It is an inhumane sin, against the very principles of Humanity. A beastly
sin; nay, worse; for the Ox knows his owner, and the Ass his Masters crib.
Its a devilish sin.

2. It is a sinning sin: a productive sin; a womb of sin: it brings forth many
more sins.

3. It is the abuse of a good God. Who can least of all endure to be abused in
his mercies.

4. It is the grave of Mercy. Where all Gods mercies are buried and lost; a
very land of forgetfulness.

5. It is the destruction of mercy, Hos. 2.8, 9. -- She knew that I gave her
Corn, and Wine, and Oil, and that I multiplied her silver and gold, etc.
Therefore will I return, and take away my Corn in the season thereof, and my
Wine in its season, and I will recover my Wool, and my Flax.

That which gives birth to mercy, is Prayer; and tha which gives breath to
mercy is, Thankfulness. Mercy is but short breathed, short lived, when men are
unthankful: Unthankfulness cuts the throat of Mercies. Unthankful persons are
never long injoyers of mercies.

2. A lesson of Obedience.
2. Learn a Lesson of Obedience. Let the Mercy of God quicken you to duty. Look
upon every mercy as a further engagement to you to walk more holily and more
exactly with God.

As all the spiritual mercies of God, Election, Redemption, Justification,
Sanctification, promises of Glorification, were all bestowed as engagements to
Obedience: So all the temporal mercies also, 1 Samuel 12.24. Therefore fear the
Lord, and serve him in truth, with all your hearts, and consider what great
things he has done for you.

When mercies are spurs to duties, when mercies make the least addition to
graces, God is well pleased with the bestowing of mercy; and where God sees
such ground, he delights to sow the seed of mercy.

3. A lesson of Dependence.
3. Learn a lesson of Dependence upon God. It is a shame that we should be
afresh to seek in every new difficulty. It was that which God blamed the
Children of ^srael for: That notwithstanding the great and wonderful works, he
had done in their sight and eyes; yet they did distrust him, all was not enough
to work up their hearts to believe God, and trust in him. And David blames them
for the same, Psalm. 78.19, 20. -- They spoke against God; can God furnish a
Table in the wilderness? Indeed he smote the Rock, that the waters gushed out,
and the streams overflowed: But -- can he give bread also? Can he provide
flesh for his people? One would think this a senseless reasoning. But Unbeleef
is a senseless sin. One would think that they did sufficiently answer
themselves. That what went before, had been answer sufficient to what followed
after. The same power was required for the doing of the one, that was for the
other; and when they had seen the power of God to work the greater, 'twas
strange they should doubt of the less, but here is the baseness of our
spirit; Though God have given us never so many experiences: yet we are still
to seek in every new act of dependence on him. And without further grace we
cannot do it.

We think, when we are in straits and difficulties, if God would but help us
through this strait, if he would but relieve us in this difficulty; we should
never distrust God, whilst we lived; we should depend on him in the saddest
conditions, whiles we have a being.

But these are but our present thoughts, and without future assistances and
supplies, we are as far to seek in another, as we were in the first.

Well, My Brethren: God has wrought many great things for us: every one of
them should be a Life-mercy, a standing-mercy, a mercy to be set up to
encourage us to depend on him for ever: Mercies, that we should live on in
straits, and feed upon in difficulties; mercies that should be for store to
feed upon for a long time.

You have an expression, Psalm. 74.14. -- Thou brakest the head of the Leviathan
in pieces, and gave him to be meat to thy people in the Wilderness. -- By
Leviathan is meant Pharaoh: and God gave him to be meat to his people in the
wilderness. That is, He wrought that deliverance for them, before they entered
into the wilderness, that this might be meat for them to feed upon, and
strengthen their Faith in dependence upon God in the wilderness, where they
were put to it, by so many difficulties. This mercy was to be a standing-dish,
not for a meal only, but for store: meat laid in to feed on, to strengthen
their dependence.

Faith is called Feeding, John 6. And the experience of Gods goodness is
Pabulum Fidei: the meat of Faith. That mercy is never well digested, that is
not fed upon. He that does not feed upon a mercy, gets no nourishment by a
mercy, no good. You take the Name of God in vain (that is, his works, his
experiences, which are part of his Name) you take them in vain: All this is but
food cast away upon you, if thereby you are not strengthened for the Fuller
dependence upon God.

And now my brethren, we have had many Glorious experiences of Gods goodness
to us: and all these are meat to feed upon. You are now in new straits and
difficulties: bring out your standing-dishes, the former mercyes and
experiences to feed upon; to refresh your Faith, to enable you to depend upon
God afresh.

He that is not a good Treasurer, a good Storer of mercys, he is never out of
straits; he is still to seek in every difficulty, and gone in every new
strait: whereas he who lays up Experiences, and can make use of them, feed
upon them; he shall be enabled thereby to depend upon God in any strait and
difficulty whatsoever.

Thus you see David -- God delivered me out of the Paw of the Lion, and out of
the paw of the Bear: and he will deliver me out of the hand of this
Philistim. David feeds on the Lion -- And, -- because he has been my helper,
therefore under the shadow of his wings will I rejoice.

Now, in the passing of this duty of dependence upon you, I find two things to
be great enemies to it, which be you aware of.

1. Beware of Obliterating the Notions of God. 2. Beware of burying the
remembrance of his works.
1. Beware of Obliterating the Notions of God. Had Moses seen God, and had the
same Notions and apprehensions of God at the Rock, that he had at the Red sea,
which was a far greater difficulty, then to fetch water out of the rock: he
could have trusted in God for that, as well as for the former. But those
thoughts and conceptions of God, were, for the present darkened, and
over-shadowed with Passion; and therefore he could not trust God then.

So, if David had had the same apprehensions of God, when he counterfeited
himself Mad, for fear of Abimelech, the King of Gath; or when he was pursued by
Saul, and burst forth into these words: -- I shall one day perish by the hand
of Saul; which he had at other times, as when he says, Ps. 27.1, 2, 3. -- The
Lord is my light, and my salvation, whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength
of my life: of whom shall I be afraid? when the wicked mine enemies, and my
foes came upon me, to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though an host
pitched against me, my heart should not be afraid: though war be raised
against me, In this will I be confident. Or when he says, to Saul concerning
Goliath. God, that delivered me out of the Paw of the Lion, etc. he will
deliver me from this uncircumcised Philistim. Or when he says, -- God is our
hope and strength, a help in trouble ready to be found: therefore will not we
fear, though the Earth be moved, though the mountains be hurled into the
depth of the Sea: He would not have so fainted in these like, or less
exigences.

So, had Abraham had the same apprehensions of God, when he feigned his wife
to be his Sister, which he had, when God made him the Promise of a Son; or
when he went to sacrifice his Son: he could have trusted and depended on God
in this c^se as well as in the former: this difficulty being far short of the
other.

So, did Gods people see God at all times, as they do at some times, they would
then be able to depend on God, and trust in him, in any cases though never so
difficult: but if they lose the apprehensions and conceptions of God; and
suffer Passion and fear, to raise up a cloud to overshadow and darken their
understandings; they shall never be able to believe and depend upon God in any
difficulty: and therefore first hold up the Notions of God, of his power,
wisdom, mercy, and the like.

2 Beware of burying the remembrance of his former works, Psalm. 78.6, 7. They
were commanded to tell the wondrous works of God to their children, that the
generations to come might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of
God. Intimating that the best way to keep up their hope and dependence on God,
was to hold up the remembrance of what he had done. He, that forgets the one,
will not be able to do the other.

And therefore you see it set down as a reason of the Disciples distrust. --
Their hearts were hardened. They forgot the miracles of the Loaves. Mark. 6.52.
Intimating, that it they had remembered that, they had not now been to seek in
this present difficulty.

And indeed the want of the remembrance of former mercies does cause us to
distrust, and hinders us in our dependence on God for present and future
straits: whereas on the contrary; holding up the remembrance of former, will
enable us to hold out in present and future distresses.

You cannot think his arm is shortened: you cannot think God cannot: nor can you
think God will not: that he has helped before, and will help no more: for
mercy is tied to the Church by covenant.

Wicked men may enjoy a mercy to day: but they can have no assurance to have
another to morrow: because mercy is not tied to them by Promise, or by
Covenant. But now mercy is tied to the Church by Covenant, by Promise. He has
tied his mercy to us by his Truth. Psalm. 25. -- All his ways are mercy and
truth, not only mercy, but truth.

All God does is but Performance of Promises; we hold his mercy by Tenor of
truth, and may challenge mercy by virtue of his truth. And therefore David
could say, Psalm. 23.6. -- surely mercy and goodness shall follow me all the
days of my life.

Wicked men cannot, but the Saints may say, Mercy shall follow me all the days
of my life. Not in this, or that particular, but in every passage of
Providence, as the water followed the children of Israel, the rock followed
them, 1 Cor. 10.4. from one station to another, as long as they wandered in that
dry and thirsty wilderness.

5. Use.
Does God do wonders for his Church? Then it is good being on the Churches
side. They have a God with them, that can do wonders for them; what though our
enemies have skill, power, strength, and multitude; yet we have a God, who is
stronger, than the strongest, wiser then the wisest; who can overpower, and
overplot our enemies; who alone can do wonders for us.

As Plutarch said of the Scythians, that though they had no music, nor vines:
yet they had Gods among them. So whatever is wanting to a people, if they have
God with them, there is a plentiful supply of all. You may set God against
all, and he can weigh down all advantages.

When Charles the Fifth, Emperor of Germany, sent his Herald with challenge again
Francis the First, King of France; He commanded the Herald to proclaim him
with all his Titles. Styling him. -- Emperor of Germany, King of Castile, King
of Aragon, of Naples, and of Scicile.

Francis commanded his Herald to proclaim as often King of France; as the other
had titles of honor by all his Countries. Implying, that France alone was more
worth, than all the Countries, the other had.

So, when our adversaries do glory in their strength, in their skill, in their
power, and multitudes: let us oppose God against them, whom they oppose; and
there is enough to weigh down what ever advantage the arm of flesh can have
against us; we have a God with us, whiles we are with him, with his cause,
with his truth: And he can do wonders for us.

6. Use.
Does God do wonders for his Church? Then let us fall down and adore this God,
who can do wonders for us. -- Who would not fear thee O King of Nations! says
the Prophet, Jer. 10.7.

It was the speech of an Heathen King, when he had seen the Wonders that God
had done: -- Let all men fear and tremble before the God of Daniel, Dan. 6.26.

When Christ had done that great wonder in calming the rage of the sea; the
Text tells us, -- They all fell down at the feet of Jesus, and worshipped him.
Gods wonders for us, call out for our Worship of him.

Fall down then, at the feet of this God, and Worship him.

Fall down at the feet of his Power, and dread it.

Fall down at the feet of his Mercy, and adore it.

Fall down at the feet of his Wisdom, and admire it.

Admiration is suitable to Wonders. It is said -- He shall be admired in his
Saints. When wicked men tremble, do you fall down and admire, and bless that
God, adore that God, who alone does wonders.

7. Use.
Does God do wonders for his Church? 7 Use.
and are we now in a sad condition? A people that shall be made a wonder,
unless God do a wonder for us? Oh! then let us carry our selves in such a
deportment and demeanor, as is suitable to such, who are expectants that God
should do wonders for us. Oh! that we could put our selves in a posture fit
for mercy and deliverance! -- Seeing you look for a new Heaven, and a new
Earth, wherein dwells Righteousness (says the Apostle) what manner of
persons ought you to be? So, seeing you look, you expect that God should do
wonders for you: Oh! What manner of persons ought you to be in Holiness of
Life! how holy, how humble, how spiritual ought you to be in all manner of
conversation! Oh! take heed of sinning in the face of mercy, in the face of
deliverance. Lie not, swear not, etc. It was a sad aggravation of Isreal's sin:
They provoked God at the Red Sea, even at the Red Sea; it is doubled, to put a
greater Emphasis on it, Psalm. 106.7.

It is nothing but our sins, which hinders the current and stream of Mercy: if
these were removed, mercy would come amain* Whereas on the contrary, sin will
not only make our* but even the good purposes of God to become abortive to us.

You see it in Jer. 18.9, 10. At what time I shall speak concerning a Nation,
or a Kingdom, to build and to plant it: If it do evil in my sight, that it
obey not my voice: Then I will repent of the good wherewith I said, I would
benefit them.

Many buds, and many blossoms of future deliverance have appeared. Oh! it were
a sad thing if our sins should blast all these, and rob us of the fruit of our
hopes, of our prayers and tears. Our sins put obstructions to all Gods
proceedings of Mercy.

And therefore you see, when the Temple was to be built, and great things were
to be done for them: The Prophet, by way of necessary preparation, exhorts the
people to repentance, to cast away their sins, Hag. 1.6. knowing this, that
though God had begun, yet if they continued their sins, they would quickly make
a stop of Gods mercy; God would soon repent of his mercy to them.

God had brought Israel out of Egypt, and brought them near Canaan; yet their
sins coming betwixt them and Canaan, turned them back again into the
Wilderness, and there they walk in a Round forty years, before they could
find admission into Canaan.

God is gone out before us, triumphing in the greatness of his strength;
preparing a way, hewing down difficulties, levelling mountains, turning all our
oppositions into good. But if you do not leave your sins, you will make God
quickly to leave you, so to work your own confusion.

Well then. You are all expectants of Mercy; let every one of you labor to put
himself into a posture fit to receive mercy: Let every one walk and demean
himself, as such as looks for great things from God: And then that God that
has begun, will assuredly make an end: He that has laid the foundation, and
is laying stone after stone upon it every day, will not desist till the
building be perfected.

8 Use.
8, Use.
Is it so, that God does wonders for his Church? then learn,

1. To trust in God. You see, He is a God doing wonders. And (as Christ said,
Learn 1 To trust in God.
Mark. 9.23.) If thou can but believe: All things are possible to him that
believes: Wonders are possible.

There is nothing too hard for God to do; if there be nothing too hard for you
to believe. There is nothing difficult, but to believe: He that has conquered
and overcome his own unbeleef, has done all. All things are possible to the
Believer. Do not you stick at believing, and God will not stick at doing
wonders for you, Heb. 11.33, 34. By Faith they subdued Kingdoms, stopped the
mouths of Lions, quenched the violence of fire, etc.

As Unbeleef does imprison Gods power, mercy, and goodness; It is said -- He
could not do much, because of their unbeleef. -- And they limited the holy One
of Israel.

So Faith sets God at liberty; sets the power of God at liberty. Nay, it puts
on the power and mercy of God. Therefore exercise Faith. The time of our
trouble, should be the time of our trust.

As Mordecai said to Esther: God set her up for such a time as that: So I may
say of Faith. God set up Faith for such a time as this.

When means fail, when there is nothing but weakness below, when sense and
reason are put to it; then is it Faiths work to come in. And therefore exercise
Faith.

Let not any difficulty undermine Faith: Let not any seeming discouragement
come between your souls and the promise.

Zach. ^.6.
Things marvelous to you, are familiar with God, things wonderful to you, are
easy to God. You have Bibles. Oh! that you had Faith to make use of them: you
would there find, all things are possible with God; and therefore nothing
impossible to Faith*

2. Be encouraged to Prayer. This is the great work of our times. 2 To pray to
God.
Faith and Prayer will do wonders. Faith and Prayer have had an hand in most of
the wonders that ever were done in the Earth. These will set the great God on
doing wonders for us. A Prayer made up of promises, and put up by Faith, will
show wonders in Heaven and in Earth.

You read what wonders Gods people have wrought by Prayer. They have -- dried
up the Sea, Exodus 14.21. -- brought fire from Heaven, 2 King. 1.10. -- Caused
the Sun to stand still, Josh. 10.13. -- Vanquished the enemy, Exodus 17.12.
Praying-Moses did more than fighting-Joshua.

The day would fail to tell you of all.

See what wonders followed upon David's Prayer, Psalm. 18.6. -- In my distress I
called upon the Lord, I cried to my God; he heard my voice out of his Temple,
my cry came unto his ears. -- See what follows, verse. 7, 8, 13.14* -- Then the
Earth shook and trembled: The Lord thundered in the Heavens, and the highest
gave his voice. Hailstones, and coals of fire. He sent out his arrows, and
scattered them, he shot out his lightenings, and discomfitted them.

And an excellent place you have, Isa. 54.15. -- When the enemy shall come in
like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him. --
That is, shall both defend from his violence, and put him to flight. And it is
an observable phrase: The Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard. That is,
says one, The Spirit of Prayer is lift up.

When trouble and evil are threatened, the enemy comes like a flood
irresistably; then the Spirit of the Lord stirring up Prayer in his peoples
hearts, shall lift up a standard against them; be your defense, and chase them
away.

When God does intend to bestow great things on his People; first he gives
them the Spirit of Prayer, the Harbinger and Forerunner of mercy, Jer. 3.19. --
But I said, How shall I put thee among the Children, and give thee a pleasant
land? As if he had said. I have purposes of mercy to thee: I have thoughts of
deliverance. I think to bring thee into thy own land again, and do wonders for
thee. But what way shall I go to effect, and bring about this? -- And I said,
thou shall call me, my Father. As if he had said. I have now bethought me of
a way. I will pour a spirit of Prayer upon thee, and thou shall call me
Father, and so I will put thee among my Children.

3. Be encouraged to hope, as well as to pray. Hope, 3 Encouragement to hope
in God.
Heb. 6.19. it is called the anchor of the soul, sure and steadfast* that takes
sure hold, and then breaks not, in the greatest tempest; at such an anchor we
may ride in the most overgrown storm. They say, Clement was cast into the Sea
with an anchor fastened to him, and could not drown; we shall not in the
deepest Waters, if we be fastened to this anchor, for God delights in them,
who hope in his Mercy, Psalm. 147.11. and whom God delights in, enemies shall
not delight over, his mercy shall prevent their utterly undoing-misery. Hope is
the Daughter of Faith, therefore when Faith has brought forth the birth of
Prayer, let it bring forth the other Twin also of Hope: And then also

4. To wait on God.
4. Be encouraged to wait. For as long as we hope we will wait, and no longer;
as long as you expect, and hope your friend will come to you, so long you will
stay and wait for him, but give over hoping once, and then you will together
give over waiting: Hope has two acts; it expects that a Mercy will come, and
then it waits till it do come; as it is confident of Gods goodness and truth,
that in his due time he will show mercy; so it is conscious to its own duty,
and therefore humbly and patiently waits Gods leisure, till that time come; and
this although many cross Providence, and greatest dangers should come between,
yea in the way of thy Judgments. O Lord, have we waited for thee, says the
Church, Isa. 26.8. and well they may, seeing by experience they ever find that
the Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeks him;
Lam. 3.25.

And then, when you have learned these lessons of trusting in God, praying,
hoping, and waiting on him: Then you shall say with the Church, Isa. 25.9. --
Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us. This is
the Lord; we have waited for him; we will rejoice and be joyful in his
salvation.

There are many glorious wonders which God is now to do, at the latter end of
the World for his Church. This time is reserved for a time of Wonders. And who
knows but this may be one of the Wonders which God now does for his Church at
this time?

Could we but remove 1. Our Unbeleef. 2. Our Unthankfulness. 3. Our Neglect of
Duty. 4. Our Unworthy Walking.


Could we but 1. Believe more Strongly. 2. Pray more Fervently. 3. Live more
Holily.


And God would do Wonders for us.

I tell you, the way to engage God to do Wonders for England, is, 1. To Believe
more. 2. To Pray more. 3. To Reform more.


1 Would you engage God to do Wonders for England? Believe. Set Faith on work,
and you will work in the bowels of a Promise: nay, in the bowels of God, pitch
Faith upon God. Let Faith have her full and perfect work. And there is No
Temptation so strong, but Faith will conquer.
No Affliction so great, but Faith will master.
No Prison so strait, but Faith will open.
No Danger so great, but Faith relieves us in.
No Misery so unsufferable, but Faith will deliver us out.


Do but believe, (says Christ) and thou shall see the wondrous works of God.
As if he had said: God will do no wonders, John. 6.4.
if you will not believe: Indeed God can do wonders, as Christ said* He could
not do much because of their unbeleef.

Though unbelief take no Power, no Wisdom, from God: For as the Apostle says
-- God is faithful, whether men believe or no, So I may say -- God is
Powerful, God is merciful, God ^^ Wise, etc. though we believe not: But,
though our unbelief do not weaken the Power of God, yet it straitens and limits
it. Though it rob God of no mercy, yet it robs us of all. Though he has mercy,
yet has he none for us.

Well then, that is the first, Believe; You have to deal with a God, and this
God is a God of Power, and this God, and this power is yours in Covenant: And,
by virtue of that, all for your good. Let Faith now stir, Mark. 9.23. If you
can but believe; all things are possible: wonders are possible.

To Believe is difficult; but to him, that Believes, nothing is impossible --
If you had but faith, as a grain of mustard seed, say to this mountain be thou
removed hence, and be cast into the sea, and it shall be done. Though Faith
be but weak, though but small, A grain, yet if it be but lively, if a grain
of Mustard Seed, Acris, and Fervida: if it have Acrimonie and Vivacity in it,
as Mustard Seed has; one grain shall be able to remove a mountain. That is,
whatever may be to the glory of God, and the good of his Church, be it never
so difficult: the least Faith, if true Faith, will effect it, and bring it
about.

You shall read in Heb. 11.33. what wonders Faith has wrought. It has the
same Power, and the same God of power to deal with still.

Encouragements to Faith, I have given you diverse, in the former discourses,
from the Power, from the love of God, from all those former experiences, that
both ourselves, and generations before have had of Gods goodness. As I have
showed at large.

2 Would you engage God? pray to him; we have had many praying days. They
began for Ireland, but may be continued for England. And oh! That this day
might be more successful than former days!

You that carry Irelands miseries, Englands breaches and distractions in your
bosoms, send out armies of Prayers, let your closets, and the Churches bear
witness of your sense of, and sighs for the miseries.

And resolve to give God no rest, till he has established Zion, the joy and
praise of the whole earth. Ask and desire largely of God for his Church. God
has a larger heart to give, than you to beg. He will suffer no creature to
equal him, in his love to his Church. You shall not ask more, than he is
willing to bestow, Ephesians. 3.20. He is able to do exceeding-abundantly, above all
that we are able to ask or think, and Jer. 33.3. Call unto me, and I will
answer thee, and show thee mighty things, which thou know not.

Well then, let no Difficulty undermine your Faith: no, nor Discouragement put
you off from seeking.

Jacob held up to pray; notwithstanding all his discouragements: Though he
wrestled in the night, though he was all alone, though God told him, he would
leave him, though he staid to his loss, and God smote him in his thigh; yet
he held out to wrestle with God.

He that would prevail with God, must not only Pray, but continue in Praying.
Jacob prayed all night, David day and night, Jonah three days and three
nights, Daniel 21 days, and 21 nights, Moses forty days, and forty nights.
Though God delay, though God defer, though God deny, yet hold out. Break in
upon Gods retireings; urge God with his own Promises, with his glory, with his
name, with his truth, with his worship, etc. All which are more precious to him
than a world.

I have told you, that there shall be nothing Too hard for that People to do,
whose hearts and spirits God does mightily hold up to seek him.

You know what wonders Prayer has done. It dried up the Sea, etc. And we have
had experience of the fruit of Prayer more than any. God did never honor Prayer
more in any age, than in our Generation. It has been the great Engine, that
has carried all Gods purposes about. Nothing has been done without, and
nothing has been done against prayer.

You may revolve in your thoughts, the wonders God has wrought, within these
three, or four years, for this Church, and our neighboring Nations.

We have prayed dead, and prayed alive, breathed life and death by prayer, we
have prayed into bonds, and prayed out of bonds, as Peter was.

When sin had drawn the sword, prayer sheathed it again, when sin had
overspread us, and covered us with a cloud of blood, Prayer dispelled and
scattered this. To God give the glory.

And you, who have had experience of this before, be you quickened and
encouraged to it again. Be mighty with God, Faith and Prayer will work wonders.

3 Would you engage God to do wonders for you? add a third engagement, and
that is

Reformation. Supplication is nothing without Reformation.

The Arm of the Lord is not shortened, that he cannot save: 3 Reformation.
nor is his ear heavy, that he cannot hear: but your iniquities have separated
between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he
will not hear. As if the Prophet had said, God is as powerful, and as merciful
as ever he was: he is as able to do wonders, and as willing as ever he was.

And the reason, why he does them not, is, Because your sins do separate
betwixt you and your God, your sins rob you of all the good.

You look upward, to see whether God will help.

You look downward, to see whether man can help.

But what is all this, if you do not look inward to find out your sins, and
cast them away, which hinder help, you have that the reas^^, Judge. 10.10, 11,
12. God had oftentimes delivered them, as he tells them there, and they were
now again in new distresses, and therefore cry to God, But God tells them, they
had walked unworthy of former deliverances, and therefore he would deliver them
no more: whereupon they go and confess their sins before God, they humble
themselves, and reform their evil ways: and then, says the Text, -- His soul
was grieved for the misery they were in; God did then deliver them.

Well this is our case, we have been a people, who have enjoyed many great
mercies and deliverances, but now we are in new straits.

Let us go and humble our selves, but reform too; else Gods soul may not be
grieved for our miseries, if we still grieve him with our sins, but

When God sees us to be cruel to our sins, he will then be merciful to our
souls, when he sees us to be grieved for our sins, he will then be grieved for
our miseries*

Reform your Families, your Parishes; your persons, good and bad: set ye upon
the work of Reformation, and God will not stick to do a wonder for us.

God is driving on the great design of his own glory. It is our wisdom to take
notice of it, and in this way to further it, and not to hinder it.

Oh then! Reform. Twere a fearful thing, that the Nation should perish, because
thou will not reform.

God will never be merciful to that man, who is merciful to his sins. You read
what the Prophet said to Ahab, Because thou have spared the man, that was
reserved to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life.

Well then. Hear the Nation, Hear Religion, hear all calling out upon you,
reform.

1 Let the wicked reform. 2 Let the Saints reform.
1 You wicked ones, do you reform, Your profainness, Oaths, blasphemies,
uncleanness, your contempt and hatred of Gods Truth, Ordinances, ways,
servants, etc. for else one sinner, as Achan may make an halt in Isreal's march
into Canaan, and how much rather, if the whole Camp be full of such.

2 You Saints, Be reformed 1 Of your Pride. 2 Of your Lukewarmnesse. 3 Of your
Formality. 4 Of your Covetousness. 5 Of your Vanity in your Speeches. 6 Of
your Unthankfulness for Gods mercies. 7 Of your Unfruitfulness under means of
Grace. 8 Of your Censoriousnesse of your Brethren.


And this Land-Reformation, would prevent a Land-Desolation; when God sees us a
repenting-People, he will be a ^^^enting-God; when he sees us in a Posture of
Reformation: he will be in the way of Preservation.
