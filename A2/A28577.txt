ELEGY On the Death of Her Highness MARY Princess Dowager of Aurange, DAUGHTER
TO CHARLES the First, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, etc.
HAil Graceful MARY! Summoned up to be,
A Member-Saint oth' Heavenly Hierarchy!
For since Your Virgin-Name-Sake's Peer'd with You,
Our Ave-Maries must be Doubled too.
What Zeal of Glory did Your Highness Move,
To rob Low Countries, to Enrich the Above?
Or was it in a Complement You fell,
To leave HENRIETTA 'thout a Parallel?
Was It not Enough, that Glouc'ster's Shining Star
Shrunk the Payr-Royal, to a Royal Payr?
And as Ambassador (to fit Your State)
Prepared Your Ways, knowing the Path was strait?
But must ( O Times!) more Royal Blood be spilt,
To make Atonement, for a Kingdom's Guilt?
Cursed be that Tenero sedet in Ore Lues.
Si, tam pracipiti, fuerant Ventura, Volatu,
Debuerant alia, Fata, Venire Via.

Bane of Greatness! A Disease
That Scandals Galen and Hippocrates!
So loathsome too, the Soul would hardly own
The Body at the Resurrection!
Thus the Lamb Suffers, while the Fox still thrives:
Heavens Kingdome's near; It Is time to Amend our Lives.
It Is for the Nations Sins, a Punishment
On Princes falls. They Would Live if We Would Repent:
Here let our Souls, flow from our Eyes in Tears!
Like Those, Whose Hopes, are Mastered by their Fears!
Another Branch, lop't from the Royal Tree,
And shall the Shrubs remain Secure and Free?
Oh! if our Earthly Gods, like Men, must lie,
How, like the Beasts that perish, shall Vassals Dye?
All Things Immortal, in this Lady were
But mere Mortality, and That lies Here!
Whose Goodness needs no Gloss to set it off,
Say but -- 'Twas Charles his Daughter -- That Is Enough.
Oh may Her Son like Her, live to inherit
The Mothers Virtues and the Fathers Spirit!
Then will Heaven bless its Blessing with that Good
Which cannot be Expressed, less Understood.
The Wonder of Her Sex! less Great, then Good:
Honoring Her Name, Ennobled by Her Blood!
The Ages Joy and Grief! Envy and Pride!
You could not think Her Mortal, till She Died.
In brief, be this Inscribed upon Her Tomb,
HERE LIES THE MIRACLE OF CHRISTENDOM!
But -- Cease to Mourn! --
A Princess never Dies;
But, like the Sun, does only Set to Rise.
