HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
A Proclamation against excess of lavish and licentious speech of matters of
State.
WHereas We by our Proclamation, given at Whitehall the four and twentieth
day of December last, did publish and declare Our Royal pleasure against the
licentious passage of lavish, and bold discourse, then grown too frequent;
And did thereby forewarne, and straightly command all Our loving subjects, from
the highest to the lowest, to take heed how they did intermedle by pen or
speech with causes of state, and secrets of government, either at home or
abroad, but contain themselves within that modest and reverent regard of
matters above their reach, and calling, that to good and duetifull subjects
apperteineth; As also not to give attention, or any manner of applause, or
entertainment to such discourse, without acquainting some of Our Privy
Counsel, or other principal officers therewithal, respective to the place
where such speeches should be used, within the space of four and twenty
hours, under pain of imprisonment, and Our High displeasure; And yet We are
given understand, that notwithstanding the strictness of Our commandment, the
inordinate liberty of vnreuerent speech, touching matters of high nature,
unfit for vulgar discourse, does daily more and more increase: We have thought
it necessary to redouble our Princely Direction, and strait Charge in that
behalf; wishing all men to rest assured, that howsoever Our own nature has
bin always prone unto mildness and clemency; yet We are, and shall be
sensible of such presumption, so highly and directly affronting Us in our
Royal commandment.

And therefore We do by these Presents eftsoons charge and command all manner
of persons, of what estate or degree soever, That from henceforth they presume
not to offend against Our said former Proclamation, either by licentious and
bold Speaking or Writing, or by applauding, entertaining, covering, or
concealing such unfitting Discourse, upon pain of Our indignation and
displeasure, and whatsoever other punishment shall be meet to inflict upon
such Delinquents.

And We do further charge and command, not only Our Officers and Ministers,
but all other our loving Subjects, as they tender Our pleasure, and will
answer the contrary, that they use all diligence to discover and bring to
Justice, all such as shall offend in either kind; letting all men know, that
We will extend the like severity toward the remissness of such, who shall
conceal, as against the boldness of audatious Pens and Tongues, so
vnrespectiue of duty to Government.

Given at Our Court at Ashbie, the six and twentieth day of July, in the
nineteenth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
