By the Queen,
WHere the ancient intercourse of marchaundizes betwixt our Countries and the
low Countries of the king of Spain our good brother, has been of late
interrupted by sundry prohibitions made in the said low Countries, as well
against the carrying of the commodities of our Realm into those parties, as for
the bryngyng certain commodities of those low Countries, and many other,
through the same into this our Realm, whereby at the beginning such hyndraunce
appeared lykely to ensue to the subjects on both parts, as it was motioned
and thought mete by us both that a metyng and diet should be devised and
accorded within some convenient time, for the redress of such matters as were
pretended to be the causes of the said prohibitions. And now by process of time
it is become manifest that although the foresaid prohibitions were of their
own nature hurtful to the subjects on both parti^s, so as thereof depended an
expectation of a redress for both our subjects: yet the usage and manner of
execution of the same prohibitions, on the other side, do now directly and
notoriously benefit and enriche only the subjects and inhabitauntes of the
said low Countries, and directly and notoriously hurt and injury our proper
subjects, not only by the plain stoppyng and restraynyng of our merchants
from their ancient trade accustomed into those Countries: but by the
continual hauntyng into our Realm of them only of the low Country, and by
stuffyng and burdenyng our Realm with all superfluous and vnnedefull wares
even contrary to their own prohibitions, and consequently by carrying away the
treasure and monyes out of our Realm. For although by general words of their
prohibitions, the woollen clothes of our Realm are utterly forbidden to be
brought thither, upon a pretense of infection, and likewise other commodities
whereupon our handycraftes people should labor, be strayghtly forbidden to be
brought hither by any person out of the said low Countries: Notwithstanding
it is well known, that the greater part of those commodities, come originally
from high Almayne and other Remote Countries, and have as it were but their
passage through those low Countries, yet a great number of people of the same
low Countries, either as contempnyng their own prohibitions, or having by
special labor some secret licenses, do daily carry, as they have all this
summer also used to do, all such clothes, without any scruple of infection, as
they can by any means with favor, and sometime without knowledge of officers,
obtain to be transported out of our Realm, and likewise cease not to bring
great quantities of all kind of wares, and specially such as are most
superfluous into this our Realm, returnyng for the same, as experience does
prove, monyes and plate from hence in all the secretest manner that they can.
Whereupon although we have borne herewith very long, yet now we are necessaryly
compelled to provide spedye remedy for our loving subjects, according to the
natural care which we are bound to have of the public estate of our said
subjects, in matters so manifestly sought to undo them. For the relief
whereof, we are also daily sued unto by the company of our marchantes
adventurers, who have not shipped any clothes out of this Realm, as they were
accustomed, into those low Countries, by the space of these thirtene months,
being thereby sore charged with ye commodities remaynyng upon their hands: That
although upon long expectation of some common order to be taken betwixt us and
the counsel of our good brother rulyng for him in the said low Countries,
they have to their great charges, remained without trading any kind of
marchaundizes, either into, or out of those Countries: yet it might please us
to have compassion of them, and to permit them with our favor, and without
further delay, to carry their clothes which were shipped five months passed,
into some other places and countries mete for them, considering they see another
liberty, nor suertie to resort into the low Countries, as they were
accustomed. And further, that this inordinate usage of the Merchants of the
Low Countries (...) permitted to be continued in our Countries, by the^ (...)
intent to overthrow and impoueryshe all other (...) upon this urgent
necessity, first licenced our said Merchants, (...) any other convenient
place where they shall think best, being out of these low Countries as we
back (...) but their commodities shall for their proper values and estimate,
be desired in very many places. And next, we do ordeyne and strayghtly charge
and command, that until these late great disorders and interruptions of the
intercourse by these prohibitions, and specially by the notable parciall
misvsage thereof shall be reformed and repaired (whereunto for our part we are
so wyllyng as we will refuse no reasonable means) no manner commodity, wares,
or marchaundizes, growing, wrought, or provided in the said low Countries, or
coming through the same, shall be from the publication hereof, by any manner of
person, transported from the said low Countries, hither into this our Realm,
or into any Port or Creke thereof, upon pain of forfaiture of the same, the one
half thereof to us, and the other to any person that shall give due information
thereof either to our privy counsel, or into our Exchequer, as other
informations are given, within two months after the offense committed
against this our Proclamation.

Yeuen at our Castle of Wyndsor the.xxiii. day of March.1563. in the sixte year
of our reign.
God save the Queen.
