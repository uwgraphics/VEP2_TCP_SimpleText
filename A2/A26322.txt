Adam Bell.
MErry it was in the green forest,
among the leaves green:
Whereas men hunt east and west,
with bows and arrows keen.
To raise the dear out of their den,
such sights have not often been seen:
As by three yeomen in the North Country,
by them it is I mean.
The one of them height Adam Bell,
another Clim of the Clough,
The third was William of Cloudesle,
an Archer good enough.
They were outlawed for Uenison,
these yeomen every chone:
They swore them brethren on a day,
to English wood for to gone.
Now lith and listen Gentlemen,
that of mirth loves to hear:
Two of them single men,
the third had a wedded fere.
William was the wedded man,
much more then was his care:
He said to his brethren on a day,
to Carlisle he would fare,
There to speak with fair Alice his wife,
and with his children three:
By my troth said Adam Bell,
not by the counsel of me:
For if we go to Carlisle brother,
and from this wild wood wend,
If that the Justice do you take,
your life is at an end.
If that I come not to morrow brother,
by prime to you again:
Trust you then that I am taken,
or else that I am slain.
He took his leave of his brethren two,
and to Carlisle he is gone:
There he knocked at his own window,
shortly and anon.
Where be you fair Alice he said,
my wife and children three?
Lightly let in thine own husband,
William of Cloudesle.
Alas then said fair Alice,
and sighed very sore:
This place has been beset for you,
full half a year and more.
Now I am here said Cloudesle,
I would that in we were:
Now fetch us meat and drink enough,
and let us make good cheer
She fetched him meat and drink plenty,
like a true wedded wife,
And pleased him with what she had,
whom she loved as her life.
There lay an old wife in that place,
a little before the fire:
Which William had found of charity,
more then seven year.
Up she rose* and forth she goes,
evil might she speed therefore:
For she had set no foot on ground,
in seven years before.
She went into the Justice hall,
as fast as she could hie:
This night she said is come to town,
William of Cloudesle.
Thereat the Justice was full feign,
and so the Sheriff also.
Thou shall not travel hither for naught,
thy meed thou shall have ere thou go.
They gave to her a right good gown,
of Scarlet it was I heard saine:
She took the gift and home she went,
and couched her down again.
They raised the town of merry Carlisle,
in all the have they can:
And thronging fast unto the house,
as fast as they might began,
There they beset the good yeoman,
about on everyside:
William heard great noise of the folk,
that thither-ward fast hide.
Alice opened a back window,
and looked all about:
She was ware of the Justice and Sheriff,
and with them a great rout.
Alas treason, then cried Alice,
ever woe may thou be:
Go into my chamber, husband she said,
sweet William of Cloudesle.
He took his sword and his buckler,
his bow and children three:
And went into the strongest chamber,
where he thought surest to be.
Fair Alice like a Lover true,
with a Pollax in her hand:
Said, he shall dye that comes in
this door, while I may stand.
Cloudesle bent a right good bow,
that was of a trusty tree:
He smote the Justice on the breast,
that his arrow burst in three.
Gods curse of his heart said William,
this day thy coat did on.
If it had been no better than mine,
it had been near the bone.
Yield thee Cloudesle said the Justice,
and thy bow and thy arrows thee fro:
Gods curse on his heart, said fair Alice,
that my husband counsels so.
Set fire on the house said the Sheriff,
since no better it will be:
And burn we therein William he says,
his wife and children three.
They fired the house in many a place,
the fire flew on hye:
Alas then said fair Alice,
I see we here shall dye.
William opened a back window,
that was in his Champer hie:
And there with sheets he did let down,
his wife and children three:
For Christ's love do them no harm,
but wreake you all on me.
William shot so wondrous well,
till his arrows were all gone:
And fire so fast about him fell,
that his bow string brent in two.
The sparkles brent and fell upon
good William of Cloudesle:
But then was he a woeful man,
and said, this is a Cowards death to me.
Lever had I said William,
with my sword in the rout to run:
Then here amongst mine enemies wood,
so cruelly to burn.
He took his sword and his buckler thou,
and among them all he ran:
Where the people thickest were,
he smote down many a man.
There might no man abide his strokes,
so fiercely on them he ran:
Then they threw windows and doors on him,
and so took that yeoman.
There they him bound hand and foot,
and in a deep dungeon him cast.
Now Cloudesle then said the Justice,
thou shall be hanged in have.
One vow shall I make said the Sheriff,
a pair of new gallows thou shall have,
And all the gates of Carlisle shall be shut,
there shall no man come in thereat.
There shall not help Clim of the Clough,
nor yet Adam Bell,
Though they come with a thousand more,
nor all the devils in hell.
Early in the morning the Justice arose,
to the gates fast ga^ he gone:
And commanded to shut close,
lightly every chone.
Then went to the Market place,
as fast as he could hie:
A pair of new gallows there did he set up,
beside the Pillory.
A little boy stood them among,
and asked what meant that gallow tree:
They said to hang a good yeoman,
called William of Cloudesle.
That little Boy was town Swine-heard,
and kept fair Alice swine:
Full often he had seen Cloudesle in the wood,
and gave him there to dine,
He went out of a crevice of the wall,
and lightly to the wood he ron:
There he met with these weighty yeomen,
shortly and anon.
Alas then said the little boy,
you tarry here all too long*
Cloudesle is taken and doomd to death,
and ready to be hanged.
Alas then said good Adam Bell,
that ever we saw this day:
He might have tarryed here with us,
so often we did him pray.
He might have dwelt in green Forest,
under those shadows sheene:
And kept both him and us at rest,
out of trouble and teene.
Adam bent a right good bow,
a great heart soon he had flaine:
Take that child he said to thy dinner,
and bring me mine arrow again.
Now we go hence said these jolly yeomen,
tarry we no longer here:
We shall him borrow by Gods grace,
though we buy it full dear.
To Ca^lile went those good yeomen,
in a merry morning of May:
Here is a fit of Cloudesle,
and another is for to say.
ANd when they came to merry Carlisle,
in a fair morning tide:
They found the gates shut them unto,
round about on every side.
Alas then said good Adam Bell,
that ever we were made men,
These gates are shut so wondrous well,
that we may not come therein.
Then spoke Clim of the Clough,
with a wile we will us in bring;
Let us say we be messengers,
straight come from the King.
Adam said I have a Letter, well
let us wisely warke:
We will say we have the Kings seal,
I hold the Porter no Clarke.
Then Adam Bell beat at the gate,
with strokes great and strong:
The Porter heard such a noise thereat,
and to the gates he throng,
Who is there said the Porter,
that makes all this knocking?
We be two messengers said they then,
be come right from the King.
We have a Letter said Adam Bell,
to the Justice we must it bring:
Let us in our message to do,
that we were again to the King,
Here comes none in said the Porter,
by him that dyed of a tree:
Till that a false thief be hanged,
called William of Cloudesle.
Then spoke Clim of the Clough,
and swore by Mary free:
If that we stand long without,
like a thief hanged shall thou be.
Lo here we have the Kings seal:
what Lurden art thou wood?
The Porter weend it had been so,
and lightly did off his hood.
Welcome is my Lords seal he said,
for that you shall come in:
He opened the gates full shortly,
an ev^ll opening for him.
Now are we in said Adam Bell,
whereof we are right feign:
But Christ he knows assuredly,
how we shall out again.
Had we the keys said Clim of the Clough,
right well then should we speed:
Then might we come out well enough,
when we see time and need.
They called the Porter to counsel,
and wrung his neck in two:
And cast him in a deep dungeon,
and took the keys him fro.
Now am I Porter said Adam Bell,
see brother the keys we have here.
The worst Porter in merry Carlisle,
that came this hundred year.
Now we will our bows bend,
into the town will we go:
For to deliver our dear brother,
that lies in care and woe.
Then they bent their good yew bows,
and looked their strings were round,
The Market place in merry Carlisle
they beset in that stound,
And as they looked them beside,
a pair of new gallows there they see,
And the Justice with a Quest of Squires,
that judges William hanged to be.
And Cloudesle lay ready there in a Cart,
fast bound both foot and hand:
And a strong rope about his neck,
already for to hang.
The Justice called to him a lad,
Cloudesle cloath^ he should have,
To take the measure of that yeoman,
and thereby to make him a grave.
I have seen as great marvail said Cloudesle,
as between this and Prin;
He that makes a grave for me,
himself may lie therein.
Thou speak proudly said the Justice,
I will thee hang with my hand:
Full well heard this his brethren two,
there still as they did stand.
Then William cast his eye aside,
and saw his two brethren,
At the corner of the marketplace well prepared,
ready the Justice to chase.
I see comfort, said Cloudesle,
yet hope I well to fare:
If I might have my hands let free,
right little might I care.
Then spoke good Adam Bell,
to Clim of the Clough so free:
Brother, see you mark the Justice well,
lo yonder you may him see.
At the Sheriff shoot I will
strongly with an arrow keen:
A better shot in merry Carlisle,
this seven years was not seen,
They loosed their arrows both at once,
of no man they had dread.
The one hit the Justice, the other the Sheriff,
that both their sides began bleed,
All men voyded that stood them nigh,
when the Justice fell to the ground:
And the Sheriff nigh him by,
either had his deaths wound.
All the Citizens fast began flee,
they durst no longer abide;
There lightly they loosed Cloudesle,
where he with ropes lay tide.
William stepped to an Officer of the Town*
his axe out of his hand he wrung:
On each side he smote them down,
him thought he tarried all too long.
William said to his brethren two,
this day let us live and dye:
If ever you have need as I have now,
the same shall you find by me.
They shot so well that tide
for their strings were of silk sure,
That they kept the street on every side,
the battle did long endure.
They fought together like brethren true,
like hardy men and bold:
Many a man to the ground they threw,
and made many a heart cold.
But when their arrows were all gone,
men pressed on them full fast:
They drew their swords then anon,
and their bows from them cast.
They went lightly on their way,
with swords and bucklers round:
By that it were mid of the day,
they made many a wound,
Many an out horn in Carlisle was blown,
and the Bells backward did ring:
Many a woman said alas,
and many their hands did wring,
The Mayor of Carlisle forth come was,
and with him a full great rout:
These yeomen dread him full sore,
for of their lives they were in great doubt.
The Mayor came armed a full great pace,
with a Poller in his hand:
Many a strong man with him was,
within that store to stand.
The Mayor smot at Cloudesle with his bill,
his bucklor brast in two:
Full many a yeoman with great evil,
alas treason they cried ^or woe.
Keep we the gates fast they bad,
that these Traitors thereout not go:
But all for naught was that they wrought,
for so fast down they were laid;
Till they all three that so manfully fought,
were gotten out of a braid*
Have here your keys said Adam Bell,
my office here I forsake:
If you do by my counsel,
a new Porter do you make.
He threw the keys at their heads,
and bad them evil to thrive;
And all that lets any good yeoman,
to come and comfort his wife.
Thus be the good yeomen gone to the woo^*
as lightly as leaf on linde;
They laugh and be merry in their mood,
their enemies were far behind.
When they came to English wood,
under the trusty tree;
There they found bows full good,
and arrows great plenty.
So God me help said Adam Bell,
and Clim of the Clough so free.
I would we were in merry Carlisle,
before that fair many.
Then sat they down and made good cheer,
and eat and drunk full well:
Here is a fit of these wight yeomen,
another I will you tell.
AS they sat in English wood,
under their trusty tree:
They thought they heard a woman weep,
but her they could not see*
Sore then sighed fair Alice,
that ever I saw this day:
For now is my dear husband slain,
alas and well away.
Might I have spoke with his dear brethren,
or with either of them twain,
To show to them what him befell,
my heart were out of pain.
Cloudesle walked a little aside,
and look under the green-wood linde,
He saw his wife and children three,
full woe in heart and mind;
Welcome wife, the^ said William,
under this trusty tree:
I had weend yesterday by sweet S. John,
thou should me never see.
Now well is me she said that ye be here,
my heart is out of woe:
Dame, he said, Be merry and glad,
and thank my brethren two.
Hereof to speak said Adam Bell,
I wis it is no boot:
The meat that we must sup withal,
yet rests ^ast on foot.
Then went they down unto the lawnd,
these Noblemen all three:
Each of them slew a Heart of Greece,
the best they could there see.
Have here the best Alice my wife,
said William of Cloudesle:
Because ye so boldly stood by me,
when I was slain full nigh.
Then they went to supper,
with such meat as they had:
And thanked God for their fortune,
they were merry and glad,
And when they had supped well,
certain without any lease,
Cloudesle said we will to our King,
to get us a Charter of peace.
Alice shall be at our soiourning,
in a Nunnery here beside:
My two sons shall with her go,
and there they shall abide.
My eldest son shall go with me,
for him I have no care:
And he shall bring you word again,
how that we do fare.
Thus be these good yeomen to London gone,
as fast as they may hye;
Till they came to the Kings palace,
where they would needs be.
And when they came to the Kings Court,
unto the palace gate:
Of no man would they ask leave.
but boldly went in thereat,
They proceeded present into the hall,
of no man they had dread:
The Porter came after, and did them call,
and with them began to chide.
The Usher said, yeomen what would you have
I pray you tell to me?
You might have Officers shent,
good sirs from whence be ye?
Sir, we be Outlawes of the Forest*
certain without any lease:
And hither we be come to the King,
to get us a charter of peace.
And when they came before the King,
as it was the Law of the Land:
They kneeled down without letting,
and each held up his hand.
They said, Lord we beseech thee here,
that ye will grant us grace:
For we have slain your fat fallow Dear,
in many a sundry place.
What be your names then said the King,
anon that you tell me:
Adam Bell, Clim of the Clough,
and William of Cloudesle.
Be ye those thieves said the King,
that men have told to me:
Here to God I make a vow,
ye shall be hanged all three,
Ye shall be dead without mercy,
as I am King of this Land:
He commanded his Officers every chone,
fast on them to lay hand.
Therefore they took these good yeomen,
and acrested them all three:
So may I thrive said Adam Bell,
this game likes not me.
But good Lord we beseech you (...),
that ye will grant us grace,
Insomuch as we do to you come,
or else that we may (...) you pass,
With such weapons as we have here,
till we be out of your place:
And if we live this hundredth year,
we will ask of you no grace,
Ye speak proudly said the King.
ye shall be hanged all th^^e:
That were great pity said the Queen,
if any grace might be.
My Lord when I came ^^^st into this Land
to be your wedded (...),
The first boon that I would ask,
you would grant me bel^^^:
And I asked ye never none till now,
therefore good Lord grant it me.
Now ask it Madam said the King,
and granted shall it be.
Then good Lord I you beseech,
these yeomen grant ye me:
Madam ye might have asked a boon,
that should have been wor^^ them all three;
Ye might have asked towers and towns,
Parkes and Forests plenty:
None so pleasant to my pay she said,
nor none so leefe to me.
Madam, since it is your desire,
your asking granted (...)*
But I had lever (...) given you,
good Market (...).
The Queen was a glad woman*
and said, Lord gramercy.
I dare undertake for them,
that true men they shall be:
But good Lord speak some merry word,
that they might comfort see.
I grant you grace then said the King.
wash fellows and to mea^^ go ye.
They had not sitten but a while,
certain without leasing:
There come two messengers out of the North,
with letters to the King:
And when they came before the King,
they kneeled down upon their knee:
And said your Officers greet you well,
of Carlisle in the North Country*
How fares my Justice (said the King)
and my Sheriff also:
Sir they be stain without leasing,
and many an Officer more.
Who has them flaine, said the King*
anon that you tell me:
Adam Bell, Clim of the Clough,
and William of Cloudesle.
Alas for ruth then said the King,
my heart is wondroussore:
I had lever then a thousand pound,
I had known this before,
For I have granted them grace,
and that forethinketh me:
But had I known all this before,
they had been hanged all three*
The King opened the Letter a^on,
himself he read it tho.
And there he found how these outlawes had slain
three hundred men and m^e*
First the Justice and the Sheriff,
and the Mayor of Carlisle town,
Of all the Constables and Catchpoles,
alive he left not one.
The Bailiffes and the Beadles both,
and the Sergeants of the Law:
And forty Forresters of the fee,
these outlawes have yslaw,
And broke his Parks and slain his dear,
of all they chose the best:
So perilous outlaws as they were,
walked not by East nor West.
When the King this Letter had read,
in heart he sighed full sore:
Take up the table then said he,
for I can eat no more.
The King then called his best Archers,
to the Buts with him to go:
I will see these fellows shoot said he
that in the North have wrought this woe.
The Kings Bowmen buskt them blithe,
and the Queens Archers also:
So did these wight yeomen,
with them they thought to go.
There twice or thrice they shot about,
for to assay their hand:
There was no shot these yeomen shot,
that any p^icke might stand.
Then spoke William of Cloudesle,
by him that for me dyed:
I hold him never a good Archer,
that shoots at Buts so wide,
Whereat then said the King,
I pray thee tell to me:
At such a But sir he said,
as men use in my country.
William went into the field,
and his two brethren with him,
There they set up two hasell rods,
twenty score pace between:
I hold him an Archer, said Cloudesle,
that yonder wand cleaves in two;
Here is none such, said the King,
for no man can so do.
I shall assay sir, said Cloudesle,
ere that I further go:
Cloudesle with a bearing arrow,
clave the wand in two.
Thou art the best Archer, said the King,
for sooth that ever I see:
And yet for your love, said William,
I will do more mastery,
I have a son is seven year old,
he is to me full dear
I will tie him to a stake,
all shall see him that be here,
And lay an apple upon his head,
and go six score pace him fro:
And I my self with a broad arrow,
shall cleave the apple in two.
Now have thee then, said the King,
by him that dyed on a tree,
But if thou do not as thou have said,
hanged shall thou be,
And if thou touch his head or gown,
in sight that men may see:
By all the saints that be in heaven,
I shall you hang all three.
That I have promised said William,
I never will for sake:
And there even before the King,
in the earth he drove a stake,
And bound there^^ (...) eldest son,
and bad him stand still thereat;
And turned the child's face him fro,
because he should not start*
An Apple upon his head he set,
and then his bow he bent:
Sixscore paces th^re were met,
and thither Cloudesle went.
There he drew out a fair broad arrow,
his bow was great (...) long:
He set that arrow in his bow,
that was both stiff and strong,
He prayed the people that were there,
that they would still stand:
For he that shoots for such a wager,
had need of a steady hand.
Much people prayed for Cloudesle,
that his life saved might be:
And when he made him ready to shoot
there was many a weeping eye:
Thus Cloudesle clave the Apple in two,
as many a man might see:
Now God forbid then said the King,
that thou should shoot at me.
I give thee xviii. pence a day,
and my bow shall thou bear:
And over all the North Country,
I make thee chief Rider,
And I Will give thee xiii. pence aday, said the Queen,
by God, and by my fay,
Com fetch thy payment when thou will,
no man shall say thee nay.
William, I make thee a Gentleman,
of clothing and of see:
And they two brethren yeom^n of my Chamber,
for they are lovely to see*
Your son for he is tender of age,
of my wine celler shall be,
And when he comes to man's estate,
better preferred shall he be*
And William bring me your wife said the Queen.
I long full sore to see:
She shall be my chief Gentlewoman,
to govern my Nursery*
The yeomen thanked them (...),
and said to some Bishop, we will (...),
Of all the sins that we have done*
to be assoyled at his hand.
So forth be gone these good yeomen,
as fast as they can hie.
And after came and lived with the King,
and died good yeomen all three.
Thus ends the lives of these good yeomen,
God send them eterna^^ bliss*
And all that with hand bow shoot^th,
that of heaven may never miss.
FINIS.
