AN ACCOUNT OF THE Raising the Siege OF ESSECK.
Published by Authority.
Vienna, November 12.
AN Officer, dispatched by the Duke de Croy from Esseck, is arrived here with
Advice, That on the 29th of the last Month the Turks, to the Number of about
16000, Commanded by the Bassa of Bosnia, and Mustapha Bacha (the Grand Vizier
remaining himself at Belgrade) appeared before that Place. That on the 30th the
Enemy advanced, and attackt the Counterscarp; but finding the Besieged in a
better Condition than they expected, they retired, and began to open Trenches
in order to a regular Attack. That on the 2d of this Month the Enemy raised two
Batteries, and began to play two Mortar-Pieces. The same Day the Duke of Croy,
to take a stricter View of the Enemy, made a Sally with 200 Foot and 100 Horse,
and beat the Enemy out of their Trenches, and took a great many Prisoners; who
declared, That the Turks being informed that several Imperial Troops were on
their March to re enforce the Garrison of Esseck, they had resolved to make a
General Assault, in order to possess themselves of the Place at once before the
said Succors arrived. Whereupon on the 6th of November the Duke of Croy drew
up the Forces he had with him in two Lines on this side the River, Commanding
them to make all the Noise they could with their Drums, Trumpets, and Kettle
Drums; which so disturbed the Enemy, who imagined that the Succors the Enemy
expected, were arrived, that they immediately ceased to work in their Trenches,
and the next Morning in great Confusion quitted their Camp, and marched away,
leaving behind them four Pieces of Cannon, two Mortar-Pieces, (which was all
they brought before the place) some Ammunition, and great part of their Baggage.
