A Fight at Sea.
Famously fought by the Dolphin of London, against five of the Turks men of
War.
THE Magnanimity and worthy resolution of this our English nation, from time to
time indureth the true touch and trials of the Sea in deep extremity: whereby
other Countries (not only admires thereat, but ties to the same a diserued
commendation:) Amongst many other such like Adventures, I am imboldened to
commit to your censure the Accidents of this our late voyage and return from
Zant into England, which happened as here follows.

Having at Zant, at the end of this last year finished our business, and laden
our Ship for England, being named the Dolphin of London, of the burden of
fourteen score Tun or there about, having in the same some 19. pieces of
Ordinance, and 9. Murderers, Manned with 36. Men, and two Boys, the Master
thereof one Mr. Nichols, a man of much skill, and proved experience; who making
for England, we came from Zant the first of January 1616. the wind being
North and by East, when with a prosperous gale, by the eight day in the morning
we had sight of the Hand of Sardaine, the wind being then come westerly, the
ninth, in the morning, we stood in for Callery, and at noone the wind being
Southerly we came close by the Towers, where some two Leagues off we made the
fight, which day at night the wind growing calm, we sailed toward the Cape,
the tenth day we had very little wind or none at all, till it was two of the
clock in the afternoon, which drove us some 3. Leagues eastward from the Cape
Pola: where we espied a Fleet of Ships upon the maine of Serdine, near unto a
Road called Callery, belonging to the King of Spain, being the 12. of January,
on which day in the mornings watch, about four of the clock, we had sight of a
Sail making from the Shore toward us, which drove into our minds some doubt
and fear, and coming near unto us we espied it to be a Sattie, which is a
Ship much like unto an Argosey, of a very great burden and bigness, which
perceiving, we imagined some more Ships not to be far off, whereupon our
Master sent one of our company up into the maine top, where he discovered five
Sail of Ships one after another, coming up before the wind, being then at
West, South west, who in a prospect glass perceived them to be the Turks Men
of War: The first of them booning by himself before the wind, with his
Fagge in the maine top, and all is sails gallantly spread abroad, after him
came the Admiral and the Vice Admiral, and after them two more, the
Reare-Admirall and his fellow, being five in number, all well prepared for any
desperate assault, whereupon, we immediately made ready our Ordinance and small
shot, and with no little resolution prepared our selves to withstand them,
which being done, we went to prayer, and so to dinner, where our Master gave
us such noble encouragement, that our hearts ever thirsted to prove the
success, and being in readiness for the fight, our Master went upon the
Poope, and waued his sword three times, shaking it with such dauntles courage
as if he had already won the victory, this being done we seconded him with
like forwardnes, whereupon he caused his Trumpets to sound, which gave unto
us much more encouragement then before, and being within shot of them, our
Master commanded his Gunner to make his level, and to shoot, which he did,
but missed them all, at which the foremost of them bore up apace, for he had the
wind of us, and returned as good as we sent, so betwixt us for a great time
were a most fierce encounter, and having advantage of us by reason of the
wind, about eleven or twelve of the clock they laid us aboard with one of
their Ships, which was of three hundred Tun or thereabouts, and had in her
35. pieces of Ordinance, and about two hundred and fifty men, the Captain
thereof was one Walsingam, which seemed by his name to be an Englishman, and
Admiral of the Fleet, for so it signified by the Flagge in his maine top,
having (as I said) boarded our Ship, he entered on the Larbord quarter, where
his men, some with sabells which we call Fauchins, some with hatchets, and
some with half Pikes, where they stayed some half hour or thereabout, tearing
up our nail boords upon the poop, and the trap hatch, but we having a
murderer in the round house, kept the Larbord side clear, whilst our men with
the other Ordinance and muskets played upon their Ships: yet for all this
they paid our Gallery with small shot, in such sort that we stood in great
danger to yield, but at last we shot them quite thorough and thorough, and
they us likewise, but they being afraid they should have been sunk by us,
bore a head of our Ship, and as he passed along we gave them a broad side, that
they were forced to lay by the ley, and to mend his leakes: This fight
continued two hours by our glass and better, and so near the shore, that
the dwellers thereupon saw all the beginning and ending, and what danger we
stood in, for upon the shore stood a little house, wherein was likewise turned
a glass all the time during the fight which measured the hours as they
passed, and this was Walfinghams part.

Now for Captain Kelleyes Ship, that came likewise up with his Flag in the
maine top, and another Ship with his Flag in the fore top, which Ships were
at least three hundred tun apeece, and had in each of them 25. pieces of
Ordinance, and about two hundred and fifty men, so they laid us aboard on the
Starbord quarter, and the other on the Larbord, where entering our ship thick
and threefold, with their semiters, hatchets, half pikes and other weapons put
us in great danger both of the lost of our Ship and our lives, for they
performed much manhood and many dangerous hazards, amongst which there was one
of their company, that desperately went up into our maine top to fetch down
our Flag, which being spied by the Steward of our Ship, presently shot him with
his Musket that he fell headlong into the Sea, leaving the Flag behind him,
so these two ships fought with us with great resolution, playing upon us with
their Ordinance and small shot, for the space of an hour and a half, of whom
we received some hurt, and likewise they of us, but when they saw they could
not prevail, nor any way make us to yield, they bore up and passed from us to
lay their ships by the lee to stop their leaks, for we had grievously torn and
battered them with our great Ordinance, and this was the second attempt they
made upon us.

Now for the third, there came two more of Captain Kelleyes ships of two
hundred and fifty tun apeece, that in each of them had 22. pieces of
Ordinance, and at the least two hundred men all well provided as might be,
which was as we thought too great a number for us, being so few in our
ship, but God that was our friend, gave us such strength and success that
they little prevailed against us, for at their first coming up,
notwithstanding all their multitude of men, we shot the one of them quight
thorough and thorough, and laid him likewise by the lee, as we had done the
others before, but the other ship remaining, laid us aboard on the starboard
side, and in that quarter they entered our ship with their Semiters,
Fauchions, half Pikes and other weapons, running toe and fro upon the deck,
crying still in the Turkish tongue yield your selves, yield your selves,
promising we should be well used, and have part of our goods delivered back,
with such like fair promises, but we giueing no ear unto them, stood stiflie
in our defense, chosing rather to die, then to yield, as it is still the nature
and condition of all Englishmen, and being thus resolved, some of our men
plied our Ordinance against them, some played with the small shot, some with
other weapons as swords, and half Pikes and such like, in midst of which
skirmish, it so happened by ill chance that our Ship was fired, and in great
danger to be lost and cast away, had not the Lord in his mercy preserved us,
and sent us means happily to quench it, but now mark the accident, the fire
being perceived by our enemies to burn outragiously, and thinking that our
Ship would have therewith been suddenly burned to the water, they left us to
our fortunes, falling a stern of from us, and so we put to the shore under
the little house, for some succor, where we let an Anchor fall thinkeing to
ride there all that night, which we had no sooner done, but we saw another
Ship bear upon us, whereupon we were sore frighted and so forced to let our
Anchor slip and so set sail to get better succor, putting into the road
between the two little houses where we lay five days, mending the bruises and
leakes of our ship: the losses we received in the aforesaid fight, were six
Men and one Boy, which were killed outright, and there were hurt eight men and
one boy more: but the Lord does know what damage we put them to, and what
number we slew in their ships.

The Master of our Ship being at the Helm, was shot twice betwixt the
legs: And the Surgeon dressing the wounds of one of our men, a Ball of
Wildfire fell into his Basin which he suddenly cast into the Sea, otherwise it
had greatly endangered us. The Turks were aboard and sounded their Trumpets,
yet notwithstanding, our men assaulted them so fiercely, that they forced them
off, and the Boson (seeing them fly) most vndantedly with a whistle blourd
the^ to the skirmish, if so they durst. The Captains of three of their Ships
were English men, who took part with the Turks thus to rob and spoil upon
the Ocean, their names were Walsingham, Kelley, and Sampson.

Upon the 13 of January there came aboard certain Spaniards in the morning
betimes, to witness what hurts we had received, who seeing our men dead, went a
shore with us, and showed us where we might bury them, but as we were busy
in making their graves and covering the bodies with earth, there came sailing
by a Flemish Ship of tweluescore tun, which had in it some five or six
thousand pounds, which had been chased with those men of war that had fought
with us before, all which money they brought in along Boat to the shore, and
left in the Ship only the men, which were 16. Sailers and 2. Boys, that
afterward within two days brought the said shipe into the Road, not any
thing at all endangered, God be praised.

Upon the 15 of the same Month, when we came from the burying of our men, and
had rested our selves in our ship some two or three hours, as God would have
it, the wind began to blow a strong gale, and by little and little, grew to a
tirible tempest, through which from Sunday night till Friday in the evening,
we lay in such extremity of weather, as rain, wind, lightening, and thunder
that we thought we should never have got clear from the Road where we lay:
during which storm and tempest there dyed one of our men, that had been hurt
in the fight, whose body we cast ouerbord, into the sea, without any other
burial, and so when the wind and sea a little calmed, we set up sail and
came forward: but within three, days after we buried three men more in the
Sea, and the same afternoon we arrived in the Road of Callery, and lay at
anchor, where again searching our Ship, we found it rent and torn in four
several places, one in the gun-roome, another between the deckes, the third
in the skereridge, and the fourth in the masters round-house, so in Callery
we mended our Ship, and hired certain men there to help us to stop her
leaks, and having all things most fitting for our Voyage homewards, upon the
30. day of January we committed our fortunes again unto the Sea, and so
leaving Callery we came foreward with a Frenchman, who was bound to a place
called Orestone, some thirty Leagues from Callery, where after two days we
left his company, being the first day of February, and after that putting
forewards still toward England, we are now by the will of God, most safely
arrived, and our Ship after so many ouerpassed dangers, received into the
Thames, near London to the great joy and comfort of the Owners thereof.

God be praised.
