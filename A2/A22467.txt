By the King.
A Proclamation for the execution of the Statutes made against Rogues and
Vagabonds.
THe insufferable swarms of Rogues and Vagabonds in every street, highway, and
place, within all the Counties, Cities, and Towns of this Realm, especially
in, and about Our Cities of London, and Westminster, and Suburbs thereof, and
Counties adjacent thereunto, and the many insolences and mischiefs daily
committed by them, draws us back to the remembrance of the many good Laws,
made and established with great care and providence, both for the suppressing
and punishing of this sort of lewd and incorrigible people, and for the relief
of the indigent, aged, and impotent poor, to which good Laws, nothing can be
added, but the due and careful execution thereof, We therefore by the advice
of Our Privy Council, have thought fit and do hereby publish Our Royal
pleasure and command accordingly, that all Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of
Peace, Constables, headboroughs, and all other Our Officers, and loving
Subjects, whom it may any may concern, do from henceforth take special care,
That all those Laws at any time made heretofore against Rogues and Vagabonds,
and for the relief and maintenance of the true indigent, and impotent poor,
be put in due execution; and We will and command all persons whosoever, in
their several places, to use their best diligence, to see the same performed
accordingly. And to the end We may have a good account of this Our command,
which so much concerns the peaceable and happy government of this Kingdom;
We do further straightly charge and command, That all Our Justices of Peace, of
the several Counties of this Realm respectively, do once in every month,
give a Certificate in writing, unto the Lord Lieutenant of the said County, of
their proceedings herein: And that the Lord Lieutenant of every Country, do
demand such monthly Certificate, as aforesaid, and having received and account
thereof, do from time to time, once in every two months, return his
Certificate unto Our Councell-board, that so We may truly understand, what
reformation does follow upon this Our Admonition: And We do hereby give
assurance to all, whom it may any ways concern, That wheresoever, and in
whomsoever We shall find any negligence in this behalf, We shall not only
hold them unworthy to bear any Office or Authority under Us, but shall also
proceed against the offenders with severity, as contemners of Our Laws, and
of our royal Commandment.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the sixteenth day of February, in the third
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
