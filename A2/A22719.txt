JAMES by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Jreland,
defendor of the Faith, etc. To all to whom th^se Presents shall come, Greeting.
Whereas all Trade and Commerce whatsoever amongst our w^lbeloued subjects, does
chiefl^ consi^t either in Buying and Selling, or ^orrowing and Lending: And for
that a great defect is daily f^und in the policy of our State for want of some
good, trusty and ready means of intelligence and intercourse between our said
Subjects in that behalf. By means whereof, many men oftentimes upon occasion
of necessity and sudden accidents, are enforced to put away and sell lands,
leases, or other goods and chattels, to great loss and disadvantage for want
of good and ready means to give general notice and public intelligence of
such their intentions, to many that would (if they knew thereof) as willingly
buy as the others would gladly sell. ^or redress and remedy whereof, our
trusty and well-beloved servants Sir Arthur Gorges and Sir Walter Cope Knights,
Gentlemen of our privy Chamber, have out of their careful endeauours found
out and devised a most safe, easy and speedy way to the great advancement, and
help unto general Commerce, and Trade amongst our well-beloved Subjects;
whereby to serve the turns and occasions as well of Borrowers as Lenders, and
of Buyers as of Sellers, by plain and direct course of reciprocal
intelligence, and interchangeable correspondency, for the ready notice and
understanding of one another minds. We in our Princely care and providence for
the general good of our people (which we much desire and tender) have thought
it fit, and just that the said Sir Arthur Gorges and Sir Walter Cope should
receive from us some favorable approbation and lawful authority, to
establish, further and advance this their industrious care and faithful
endeauours for the public good; whereby much ease, comfort and benefit would
undoubtedly ensue to our Subjects of this our Realm of England and the
Dominions of the same, in the knowledge and use thereof. Know ye therefore, that
we reposing great trust and confidence in the providence, integrity and
fidelity of the said Sir Arthur Gorges and Sir Walter Cope, for their honest,
just, and r^spectiue dealing herein: of our especial grace, certain knowledge,
and mere motion, have given and granted, and by these presents for Us, our
Heirs and Successors, do give and grant absolute, full and free license,
power and authority unto the said Sir Arthur Gorges and Sir Walter Cope, their
Executors, Administrators and Assigns, and to their Deputy and Deputies,
during the term of one and twenty years, next and immediately ensuing the date
of these Presents, to erect, set up, keep and maintain in any places, Cities
or Towns within our Realm of England and the Dominions of the same, where the
said Sir Arthur Gorges and Sir Walter Cope, their Executors, administrators or
a assigns shall think most fit and convenient, a public Office, room or
place of resort or repair of people for the notice of Borrowing and Lending of
moneys, and for the better knowledge of buying, selling or exchanging of
lands, tenements or hereditaments, leases or any other goods or chattels
whatsoever, which they or their Deputies shall think fit, and worthy to
beentred and registered; and to keep one or more Calendar or Kalenders,
Register or Registers, for the registring of all and singular such lands,
tenements, hereditaments, leases, wares* commodities, moneys, or any other
things or chattels, that shall by the mere motion or good liking of the owners
themselves, or their Factors for them be brought to such Office and Offices,
there to be entered and registered, to be bought, sold, morgaged, pawned,
borrowed or lent: which Office in every City, Town or place where it shall be
kept, shall be called by the name of The Public Register for general
Commerce. And also that it shall and may be lawful, to and for the said Sir
Arthur Gorges and Sir Walter Cope, their Executors, administrators or assigns,

tenements, hereditaments, leases, goods, chattels, profits, commodities or
merchandises whatsoever, which they the said Sir Arthur Gorges and Sir Walter
Cope, their Executors, administrators or assigns, or their deputy or deputies,
or any of them shall think worthy to be entered or registered in the said
Office, and that in all things according to the true intent and meaning of

TO THE VNPAR tiall Reader.
IN matters of this nature, where a loyal desire has endeavored to perform
an acceptable service to the Commonwealth; albeit the success sort not in
every point, answerable to hope and expectation: yet this may stand for a maine
comfort, that the intention tention is free from all public offense, or
private wrong, and therefore respects not the tax or scandal of those
malignant humors, which are accustomed to cast corrupt aspertions on honest
designs. But because this project has merely and solely proceeded from mine
own poor conceit and labor, (aiming specially at the advancement of mutual
Commerce, the bond and sinews of humane society) I have thought good for the
avoiding of all doubtful construction or mistaking (which might blemish it in
the birth) to deliver it into the world, with a perspicuous Ouerture and
direction concerning the port and uses thereof; because they are but briefly
touched, and in general terms set down in the Patent.

Arthur Gorges.
AN OVERTVRE AND EXPLANATIon of the purport and use of this OFFICE.
FIrst, it is to be under stood that this Office to be known and called by the
name of The public Register for general Commerce, is indeed but the very
resemblance of a public Market, whereunto all men may freely repair, and
resort to Trade and Traffic, without constraint or restraint, at their own
wills and pleasures. And as in Markets many Commodities are sold and met
withal more easily, and better cheap in one self place, then by seeking up
and down the Country for them with m^re trouble, and at dearer rates in
several places: so is it by the use and benefit of this Office, which as a
public Market, is solely in his Majesty's power to authorize and privilege.

Secondly this public Market is a place which all men may easily find out
and freely repair unto, for speedy means of help upon any extremity of for
feitures of bonds or counterbonds, or danger of morgages of lands or goods by
breach of d^yes, when they know not suddenly where to provide themselves of
moneys upon good security; for that every man (especially those that dwell in
remote shteres) is not acquainted with a Broker, nor knows assuredly where to
find one to serve his turn upon such urgent occasion, or if he do* it will
be at a dear rate: which defect this Register shall be able to supply with
very conscionable and moderate consideration; taking nothing of any, but what
the parties themselves shall in reason think fit and competent for the serving
of their turns, by the travel of the Officers.

Thirdly, by instance to make it more plain, such men as have moneys lying by
them, that they would expose after eight, nine, or ten in the hundred may, if
they please, make it known and have it registered in this Office, whereby such
as repair unto this Register to borrow, may also receive notice and direction
accordingly for such sums as they desire by as signment from the Officers, if
the security be good and liked of.

Fourthly, by way of example also to express the use and benefit of this
Office for Buying and Selling: Suppose that one has lands or a house in
Wilt-shiere that he would gladly sell, suddenly to raise moneys, without too
great loss, but knows not how to make it generally known to the world; and
that there are some others as desirous to buy lands or a house in that shire at
a reasonable rate, and cannot learn nor get knowledge of any such; yet by
recourse to this Register they may easily inform themselves, and have mutual
intelligence of one another minds perfectly, and readily, albeit they dwell
far asunder; where as now many times both parties are in care and cannot serve
their turns accordingly, undergoing thereby much inconvenience, which this
Office with great ease does remedy.

Fifthly, the parties themselves that do either lend or borrow, buy or sell, may
^se it with as great security and secrecy as they shall think fit by using
other men's names then their own, other places then their own houses, and
other friends or Factors for themselves if they be so disposed. So as by this
free, plain and easy course all men may rest satisfied, that there is no
cunning intent by means of this Office, to defraude men, nor by the practice
thereof to discover men's wealths or secret estates, further then to themselves
shall seem good.

Sixthly, it is neither desired nor meant that any should leave their moneys
or goods that they would lend or sell, in the charge or custody of this Office,
but in such places as the owners themselves shall think most safe and
convenient; whereby such as would borrow or buy, may (if they please) by this
Register be directed to those places or persons that would Lend or Sell to
serve their ^urns mutually. And by this course all men may rest secure of the
integrity and fair dealings that shall be used concerning other men's moneys
and goods; which the Patentees se ek not to have the custody or exposing of for
their private profit, but will rather avoid the accidents and dangers of such
hazards, and losses, as might happen in so great a charge, by mis-reckoning,
robbing, or many other ways, which we see so often happens unto men in their
own private houses. And such a misfortune might be both a disparagement to our
credits by wrong constructions, and also a tax and prejudice to the proceeding
and reputation of this Office (which consisting merely of the good opinion of
the world for the just dealing to be used therein) if it be found contrary or
corrupt, it cannot subsist, but will die in it self as unprofitable.

Moreover whereas manymen dwelling far from London, are now enforced to repair
thither, to their great travail and charge to serve their turn; many waiesin
these forenamed kinds; by the benefit and use of this Office they shall be
much eased. For it is intended (by the favor of God) that in several places
of this Realm this public Register shall be kept in some such chief Cities or
Towns as shall be found most convenient to serve the Countries next about
them in these affairs, and to hold correspondency with the City of London.

Again, it is very certain that diverse lands, leases, houses, woods and
chattels, which have been sold privately at very low rates, to the no little
loss of the owners, would have bin purchased at more indifferent prices, if
they had bin more publicly known: for it often falls out, that those who
would gladly buy such, do seldom or never get knowledge of the Sellers intent,
till the things desired be past recovery, ^o the prejudice of both parties:
which defect this public Register will be a great means to supply.

Furthermore, there are a world of extraordinary things, which are but few
men's moneys, and the owners themselves would gladly vent if they knew how, but
lie concealed or in effect lost in the sale, because that diverse others, which
would as willingly buy such at valuable prices, know not how or where to
recover them. But herein it is to be understood that no commodities of base
quality or inferior values shall be entered into this Register, but such as
the Officers shall think fit to be dealt in, without disparagement of the
place.

Besides, it often falls out that men upon extremity are driven to pawn
things of good value for small sums, to serve their turns with moneys, until
they can sell them outright; wherein they use the means of Scriueners or
Brokers, in whose hands they leave the said pawnes, setting very reasonable
prices on them; allowing also a reward: and yet notwithstanding it is often
s^ene and spoken of, that many Scriueners or Brokers, to whom such things have
been committed in trust, would never vent them at the owners prices, except
they might make a greater surplusage to themselves then the rate limited. And
by that means many have been kept in want of such relief, as their own
goods would afford them; whereby at last their pawnes have eaten themselves
out in usury, or at least ^aue been sold to great loss, the owners wanting
means to redeem them: to which grieuance this public Register may yield a
comfortable remedy.

Moreover, whereas many conscionable men would willingly expose their moneys
for eight or nine in the hundred, but cannot make it known, and therefore do
put their stocks into the hands of Brokers or Scriueners to employ for them:
so it is, that those Brokers do for the most part take ten in the hundred for
those moneys which the owners do afford at a cheaper hand; thereby wronging
both the lender and borrower: which inconvenience this public Register would
easily remedy, by giving all men safe and ready means to expose their own
moneys; besides the assurance never to be deceived in their trust, which now
many times happens when Brokers or Scriueners do chance to fall banckrout.

Furthermore, whereas there is daily occasion of returning and paying of moneys
from one part of the Kingdom to another, by means of Trade and Commerce: and
therein is found a great defect for want of some safe and speedy means of
direction, for interchangeable correspondency in that behalf (because that men
are now enforced either to convey those moneys that they are to pay or receive,
by Carriers, Clothiers, or ^eruants, who are many times robbed; or else men are
driven to be at extraordinary cost, for the returns of moneys, by letters of
exchange) by the use of this public Register men may (if they please) greatly
ease and remedy both these inconveniences. And to express the manner of doing
it by example (which is the plainest way of instruction,) Suppose that if any
Gentleman, Merchant or Tradesman of the North, upon occasion of business, being
come to London, gives notice there unto this Register, that he can make present
payment of moneys in York at a certain day, to serve the turns of any
Londoners, or others in that place, if they will deliver the like sums in
London; and so accordingly may any Londoners or others search the Register to
that or the like intent, whereby to give himself knowledge of any
interchangeable correspondency, for payments or receipts at York. And in this
sort may men mutually understand one another minds for Trade and Commerce,
and with no less facility and security serve their turns one of another in
matters of this kind, throughout all those Cities of this Kingdom, where this
public Register shall be erected and kept, which will be free for all men to
repair unto, at their pleasures. But herein it is to be understood, that this
public Register shall not be made so vulgar, as to be kept in every chief
City or Shieretowne within the Realm, but in those necessary and commodious
places that shall be found most fit for the public good, and to perform
those beneficial Offices that are promised and may be expected by the use of
this public Register for the advancement of general Commerce.

Again, to give those men that would borrow full satisfaction, how they shall
be assured when they come to this Register for direction in that behalf, and
have given the Officer such gratuity, as in reason and out of his own free
will he has thought fit, in regard of the note or direction delivered to serve
his turn, for the sums that upon good security he would take up, and not be
disappointed nor lose his reward given: Jf it so fall out (for such accidents
may happen) that either the party that should lend this money be from home, or
else how otherwise so disposed of his stock, (since the intelligence given to
this Register) that he cannot instantly serve the turn of him that would
borrow; let that party again return to the Office, and he shall either
pr^sently have another note, whereby to serve his turn, or else he shall
receive the reward that he has given the Officer in that behalf: Whereby may
plainly appear, that there shall be no shifts used either to frustrate men of
their desired purpose and hope in this Office, or tricks to draw rewards for
that, which by the use of the Office, or travel of the Officer is not merited.
And in this point I have thought fit to give good caution; both for that such
chances may sometimes fall out: and besides it is not unlikely, but that this
objection may be made. And therefore very pertinent to the purpose, and to
avoid doubts', plainly to set down an answer, and certain resolution, what
men may depend upon, and how they shall be dealt withal in such cases, thereby
to avoid all scruple. And as in matters of borrowing, so upon occasions of
buying, the like course and restitution shall be used.

But because amongst all these Ouertures and relations, the^e has not been
any mention made, either when or where this public Register shall be erected
and kept; the which it may be presumed men will expect should have been in
this discourse related, touching that point, it is v^ry requisite this much to
siy: that the Office is of such a nature, as that it will require many things
necessary for the complete ordering and fitting thereof, as also no less care
and circumspection in the choice of such Officers and Clerks, as shall be
answerable and suitable to that integrity and just dealing that is promised by
the Patent, in the behalf of the Patentees. Besides, to find out and fashion
a convenient place fit for this Office could not be done suddenly, nor in have,
consideri^g that our Patent was not past the Seal little more then a month
since; and before that time the Patentees not assured whether it should pass,
or not: and therefore no reason f^r them to make preparation for that which lay
not in their own powers to dispose of. Notwithstanding is it so f^ll out, that
the project (in manner as it is expressed) prove acceptable to the world, in
regard of the public good, which is the true scope and end thereof, this may
suffice, that all expedition shall be used for the erecting thereof, and
sufficient notice given by some public manner of intelligence in what place
it shall be kept.

Lastly, whereas his excellent Majesty according to the custom of former
times, and of all well policed States, has in his Princely disposition pleased
to give grace and preferment to diverse honest Proiects and profitable
inventions, which have truly tended to the public good, without wronging the
particular right of any; and in that regard has also vouch safed to grant his
Letters Patent for the sole privilege and practice of this new invented
Register to the Patentees, if any undutiful or malignant spirit for a self
private gain, will expostulate the justness of this proceeding, it is thus
truly and briefly answered, That it is in all equity as honorable for his
Majesty, to provide as good means for the ease and benefit of his people in
general (without any abridgement of former liberty) as it is lawful or just
for any private Scriuener, Broker, or other, to provide a course to advance his
own particular estate and profit, which is often done to the detriment of
many. And now that the nature, use and scope of this public Register is
plainly and truly manifested* I leave all men to their own sense and liking,
and the success here f to the eternal guider of all things.

FINIS.
