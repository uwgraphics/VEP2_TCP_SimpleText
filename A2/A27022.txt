A LETTER FROM A Matron of Rank Quality IN WINDSOR, TO One of the same, IN
DRUERY-LANE.
Madam,
IN my last to you I gave you an account of the succession of our Affairs here,
without omition; nor am I unsensible (however you please to think me) of your
Qualification; that is, I know you so exact a Mistress of your affections, that
you sleep not without counselling your Table Book or Diary; this known to me,
forces me to an ill opinion, and that a worse, which is, that either you have
nothing worth communicating, or that you have forgot that knack of friendship
and commerce which keeps the World in business; but I will not persist this
way, the Town I hope will never want Community, though the Court be distant,
and to suspect you were a sin that I shall never be guilty of. I have nothing
that is new to send you, only some few Remarks of my own; Our Court is a
continued Scene of joy and pleasure; not prescribed by time of day or night,
for they are one, and are but used as other Masqueing Robes in the Great Balls;
the Day in Grottoes, shady Springs and Bowers, they sit like Venus Doves,
Billing and Cooing; till envying Jove, who cannot court so well, though he
should do it with a Golden Shower, talks loud, and with repeated Thunder
frights the soft fair one closer to his arms; the trembling Prey, with Eyes
half bent, and Heart and Breast all throbbing, looks in his face; the Youth,
though no contemner of a Deity, offers protection, and yet closer, takes the
Charmer.

And whilst the Thunderer larums all above,
He storms below, and gets the Fort of Love.
The night is another Act of the same Scene, yet no entire Broben Scene, as
your Neighbor said his last Act was; not like that of Poet Bayse, for this is
all love and intriegue, without sleeping or frighting. Here might indeed be
Usurping, but that here is more Collonies than Conquerers; but for Seranading,
as Fidling, Dancing, and fat Singing. Augustus kept his Court in Greece Land in
Winter time compared to us, yet with such Dicorum, that Guards nor no one is
disturbed, no Bravades, no Marterers of Glass; none of those Copper-Captains
here, Gold is thought too base, to take the Impression of the God of Love; so
Hearts for Hearts exchange, and only leave the Guinney-Slaves in Hostage for
the League they have concluded. Indeed Madam, I cannot give you the character
of any one intreague, and not lessen it; all things are managed to your
advantage, that sure some God directs in each affair, only your Friend and
mine, pretty Miss Lay-Cock, is almost dead of a Cold, occasioned (my Lord
imagines) by her rising to hear and see the Serenaders; but she is mightily
disturbed with it, her Shoulders, Arms, especially her Head and Throat, and
what is most observable, when she is on a Bed, let my Lord do all he can, she
does not sleep for pain; Album Greebium has been used, and the foot of her
Stocking; but that is not the Remedy; you are desired by her to take the old
Lodging for her and my Lord at Doctor R -- in Long-Acre, the fine air and ill
Wine has brought a flushing in my Lords face, which she endeavoring to take
off with a Mercurial Water, turns to a dry Scurf; Dear Madam, if your face
burned last night you must pardon us, we were together a knot of excellent
Company, and your name was not the least in use amongst us: Old Mr. T -- came
to see Madam F --, and brought along with him one Sir D --, a Gentleman of
great Ignorance, yet very inquisitive, and as ceremonious as a French-Taylor,
or a Country Dancing Master, and so over-civil, that he would not put on his
Hat till the Lady had drank her Glass off; Master T -- partly tired with the
formalities of the Esquire and partly to leave him to the management of the Lady,
pretends private business with me, and takes me into the next Room, from whence
we had the convenience both to see and hear what there was acted after a little
pause, as playing with his Hat, looking at his Feet, and scratching his Head,
he starts up, and boldly asked her what a Clock it was, and at the same time
(because he would not take her word) pulled from his Pocket a Gold Watch, which
she so prittily commended, that the Esquire had sense enough (with a great sigh) to
say, It was at her service; which she graciously accepted, and from her Arm
took a Bracelet of Pomander and presented the Squire; See (said she) it is not
in my nature to be ungrateful, nor in my power to show the bounty of it; so
tying it on his Arm, offered to have kissed his Hand, which he prevented, falling
on his knee; The Gods forbid, said he, that the Son of a Dotrel by the Father,
and Trebubble by the Mother, should permit such Worship; no, Madam, let me pay
it here; So taking up the Martins-Lane, he Kissed and blushed, and blushed and kissed
so hard, that had it been flesh and Blood, it might have Sworn a Rape against
him. What else past that night I leave you to judge, but I think that she is a
happy Woman that has a fine Estate and a Fool to manage, there is one provided
for, which I am heartily glad of, though my care must be the greater: Heaven
they say, provides for the Lame and the Lazy, but I am sure I might have
starved but for my own Industry; but I know in case of necessity, she is more
Genteele then to deny to see a Gentleman that is my Friend, however, our time
here is very short, New-Market's coming on, I cannot help my Ambition, I must
follow the Court, though I protest, a penny's better and easier got amongst the
honest Citizens, with less noise, less care, and more security, nay, the the
world is come to that pass, that if a Gentleman send his Footman with express
command for such a Lady, the saucy Rascal will see all, examine their Linen,
see their Breasts and Teeth, smell their Breaths; nay, some must know whether
their Bellies are not wrinkled, and Page must be denied nothing, because
Forsooth, a great Courtier has that privilege. Indeed Madam I am weary, and
would leave it off, but that I am sure they would say I am grown Whiggish,
therefore since I cannot leave it off with my Credit: Pray make it your
business against the time, to provide what new Faces you can, and if you can,
think of something, if possible, to out-doe that Cutting at New Market; if
there be a Penny to be got honestly, why not we? I have spoke to Mr. C -- the
Tarter, to help you with 20 of his Coulen de Feile, and pray deliver one to
each of them, those that cannot Read may study the Posture, which if well done,
will look better than a Feather you know where. Dear Madam, assist my poor
Husband in what you can, I understand that a parcel of Hectoring Roysters, came
at an unseasonable hour, when a woman could not be got for Love nor Money, and
only because the house was unprovided at that time, broke my windows and his
Pate, for pretending to keep a Bawdy House and having never a whore in it; but
I know not how this can be justified, they were not Ignorant where I was. But
as to our business at New Market, now I think on it, it is Bartholomew-Fair time,
and for those women I spoke of, you cannot furnish your self better then out of
the Bell-Conies, many of them Dance well, and have a pretty way of Singing, I
know not whether they understand Catting or no, but if you do not provide for
them they will go naked within this two months. Pardon me Madam, that I
prescribe Rules to one so absolute, one that has Pit-B^xt and Gallared from
your Infancy; one that knows more names than I do faces, but I presume because
you can forgive, which is the best excuse at this time I can offer: This with
the rest we must be sure to have, one strong Dockt Third Rate, one that has
Courage, no matter for his Beauty and Crape, it is good enough; the Guard must
be Courted sometimes a good Tossing beforehand; have a care of a Pin-Buttock,
a Barbary never becomes a Portmantle for Coach-men, Grooms, Footmen, and
Postilions, we will fit our selves at Sturbridge, but for the Serving-men, those
Jucetos of their Masters, those Autum Butter-flies with May-wings, Gentlemen of
the Shedrew and Cravat-string, those and the Genteele Pages, will be content
with nothing under a Sopp in the pan. Madam, I am sure the House that I have
taken has convenience enough for all these, and question not but with our
endeavors, to make a better time on it then the last, New Faces will be the
only thing: I protest, I was forced to pass one Woman by Three several names
to one Man; this was a great deal of confidence, Madam, but I hope, so warned,
you will provide better; you know who I have here, Druery-Lane, Covent Garden,
and thereabouts will furnish a larger Seragalio then we shall need; and truly,
it is nothing but conscience to employ them, poor Women! they have had a long
Vacation. Pray Madam, let me have your answer by the next, and forget not the
Rooms in Long-Acre, least they be taken up, for such Colds are infectious, and
few escape them; which will obliege to your service for ever,

M. B.
