By the Queen.
A Proclamation for the publication of her Majesty's most gracious commission
under the great seal of England, for avoiding of the trouble and charges that
grow by concealements, and that her Highnessed loving subjects may compound for
security of their estates from her Majesty for a perpetual quiet to them and
their posterities.
THe Queens most excellent Majesty, having been informed that where diverse of
her loving Subjects have of long time quietly inioyed diverse Manors, lands,
tenements, and hereditaments, some by descent, and others by purchase or
otherwise upon just and good considerations, and others that have obtained
grants upon good consideration, from her Majesty, of some other of her noble
Progenitors, have been of late years greatly vexed, sued, and put to
intolerable charges by color of Letters pattents of concealment, which are
found for the most part to be void in Law, or upon pretense that the said
Mannours, lands, tenements, and hereditaments be from her Majesty concealed
or unjustly detayned, or may hereafter upon such pretenses be vexed and put to
extreme charges: Her Majesty out of her gracious and Princely disposition,
being very desirous (as in all other things) not only to free her loving
Subjects from such vexations and suites as have been already attempted, but
foreseeing and providing for the utter extirping and taking away of the cause
of such like hereafter: And to the intent that such of her loving Subjects as
desire to settle and establish their estates for themselves and their
posterity, and to be discharged of the mean profits, may upon such
composition as shall be agreeable to equity and good conscience, obtain
Letters pattents to be made to them, under the great Seal of England, in such
sort as their several cases shall require: Has for that purpose (and that her
loving Subjects with less suite and attendance may attain to the same)
granted her Highness Commission under the great Seal of England, unto the
Lord Buckhurst, Lord high Treasurer of England, Sir Robert Cecill Knight, her
Majesty's principal Secretary, Sir John Fortescue Knight, Chauncellos of her
Highness Exchequer, Sir John Popham Knight, Lord chief Justice of England,
Sir William Peryam Knight, chief Baron of her Highness Exchequer, Robert
Clarke Esquire, one of the Barons of the same Exchequer, John Sauell Esquire,
one other of the Barons of the same Exchequer, and Edward Cook, her Highness
Attorney General, or to any four or more of them, whereof the said Lord
Treasurer, Sir Robert Cecill, Sir John Fortescue, or Sir John Popham to be two,
for the relief of her loving Subjects, in such cases concerning the premises
as her Majesty in her Princely wisdom, has thought to tend to the general
quiet and security of her loving Subjects and their posterities, Giving
thereby to her Commissioners full power and authority for such reasonable
compositions as they shall think fit, as well to secure the estates of her
loving Subjects therein by force of Letters pattents under the great Seal of
England, as to discharge the mean profits thereof, as by the same Commission
more at large appears. Wherein her Majesty's gracious pleasure is, that no
person be enforced, or drawn to discover the imperfection or imbecillitie of
any their estates or interestes. And to the end, that this general and
perpetual quiet and good to her loving Subjects, proceeding from her Majesty's
exceeding grace and favor might take to good effect as is most Princely and
honorably intended, Her most excellent Majesty has commanded the same to be
published and diuulged generally through her whole Realm by these presents,
And that her Majesty has given in charge to the said Commissioners upon
suite made by any of her loving Subjects, to execute the said Commission in all
things according to the tenor and purport of the same with all convenient
expedition.

Given at her Majesty's Manor of Richmond the fourteenth day of January, in
the two and fourtieth year of her Reign.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Queens most excellent
Majesty. 1599.
