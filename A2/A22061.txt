The letters which JOHAN ASHWEL Priour of Newnham Abbey besides Bedforde / sent
secretly to the Bishope of Lyncolne / in the year of our lord M.D.xxvij.
Where in the said priour accuses George Joye that time being felawe of Peter
college in Cambridge / of four opinions: with the answer of the said George
un to the same opinions.

Every man that does evil / hates the light: and comes not to the light /
that his dedis should not be reproved. Johan.iij.

The first opinionis (as M. pryour says) that a simple priest has as large
and as great power to bind and to lose / as has a bishope / or the Bishope of
Rome. The second that he i^puteth unto me is yt faith is sufficient without
works. The third that he fayneth on me / is that every priest may have a
wife or a concubine. The fowerth / that every lay man may hear
confessions..v. And because he says that I hade men goinge on pilgrimage in
deriseon / I have set to the scripture that damneth worshipping of images.
Tandem vincat veritas. At last ye truth will have ye victory.

Qui operit odiu^ suu^ fraudulenter: reuelabitur malicia eius in cetu. Prouer.
26 He yt kouereth his hatered to hurt a no^ther: his malice shall be openly
declared.

Qui voluit lapide^: reuertetur^ (...) Proverb.xxvj. He that rolleth a stone
shall have it rolled him agene.

Here follow the priours letters taken out of his own hand word for word.
The superscription.
MOst Reverend father in god dew reco^mendacions had acording to you with
humble obedience: I your spiritual child louinge sugget / and daily bedeman
is glad to here of your prosperous welfare / the which I and my brethern
daily pray to god to continue. And where as your lordschip wrotte youyr loving
letters willing them to be kept secrett: so I beseech your lordschype / that
these simpule letters of mine may be kept secrette unto your self. Also where
as my lord your suffraga^ informed your lordscip of on master gye by the
knowledge that he had of me what erroneus opinions he hylde: forsothe sum be
out of my mind / and sum I hane called to my mind by the reason of your
letters. Vna opinio ^rat quam ipse tenebat / quod ta^ta and tam larga potesta^s
ligandi atque soluendi erat data a deo simplici sacerdoti / quanta episcopo vel
Romano pontifici (quod est maius). Allegauit and probauit suam intentione^ and
opinione^ per ista ^ba Christi dicentis: Ite in vniuersum mundu^ predicate
e^ange. etc. Quia sicut misit me pater / and ego mit^^^os. Hec cu^ dixisset
insufflauit and dixit eis s^z in p^^^^li numero: Accipite spiritu^ s. and
quoru^ remi seri^^s pec. re. eis / and quoru^ re. re. sunt ergo etc.

Secunda opinio / an fides sine operibus sufficit. Ipse tenebat quod sic. Et
ego teneba^ contra / quia di^us Jacobus apostolus ait / quod fides sine
operibus mortua est. Et sic pro and contra inter nos. Sed tamen in conclusione
sua ipse concessit quod opera fidei subintelliguntur in vera fide and perfecta
/ and sic co^clusionem faciebat quod sola fides sufficit.

Tertia opinio / quod quilibet sacerdos potest habere vxorem vel concubina^:
and posuit exe^plum in beato Petro / qui habebat vxore^ ante vocatione^ and
post vocationem. Sed frater meus celerarius tenebat quod non vtebatur vxore sua
post vocatione^ suam ad apostolatu^ sicut ante / sed Petrus faciebat vt
Apostolus Paulus ait in quadam epistola: Qui habe^t vxores / tanquam non
habe^tes sint. Et sic pro and co^tra erat inter eos. Et frater meus celerarius
interrogabat ipsum / quare Ecclesia militans hic in terris ita statuit ac
ordinauit quod ministri Ecclesie non habere^t vxores vel concubinas nunc sicut
tunc / at ipse respo^debat. Na^ lex per To. Po^tifice^ cu^ suis Cardinalibus
Episcopis ac ministris est lex positiua and per hoiem facta / quapropter po^t
per hoi^em co^fringi ac destrui pro meliori proposito / and allegauit illud
dictu^. Quod eius est destruere cuius est condere.

Quarta opinio erat / quod qilibet laicus po^t audire co^fessio^es: iuxta illud
diui Iaco. Co^fitemini alterutru^ pcta^ vr^a etc. Et fr^ meus celerarius
fatebatur hoc esse licitu^ in tpere magne necessitatis / alias no^: and
allegauit quod Juriste dicu^t / quod no^ est licitu^ in lege necessitas facit
licitu^. Sed ipse dicebat contra atque tenebat quod i^ oi^ tpere per illud
dictu^ s. Jacobi Co^fitemini etc. p^terea voluit habere hoi^es peregre
proficisce^tes in derisum: ob qua^ causam no^ venit nu^c ad memoriam. But for
these and diverse other we have been sumtyme sine charitate prop^ circu^stantes
and sedentes. And sumtime I have given hi^ exhortacio^ openly and sumtime
secretly that he should leave such Lutronous opinions. Also M. chawnceler made
search for hi^ diverse times when he came into the co^tre but the^ he was ener
at Ca^brig i^ Peter house. And M. chawnceler gave unto me strett commandment
i^ your lordship name that I should not suffer hi^ to preche in no^ of owr
chirches with out your licens and writing with your sealle / and so he come
no more at me / nor I pray to god that he do not except he amend. qia dictu^
vulgar infecte onis with heresi / iulisy / and fre^sy etc. but I beseech your
lordship that no creature may know that I / or any of mine do show you of
these things for then I shall less the favor of many in my contre. But I am /
and have been / and will be ever at your commandment. Et sic valeatis in Christ's

festis or yo^keres in the cowntre he has had mani lewd opinions among the
pepolle and some good folkis would murmur and grugge at his saynges and some
would rejoice them



The answer of George Joye or gye as he calls him.
MAster priour / I meruel greatly / considering the great kindenes and love that
you ever p^tended towerd me never opening your grefe and mind to me so often
resorti^g to your place / never moneshi^g me (although you say that you
exhorted me openly and secretly / which is not trwe) that you never made any
insinuacio^ unto me of this your preuey odiouse ente^te / but rather showed me
vtwordly a fayer flateringe co^tenaunce desyeri^ge me often to abide which you:
but (as I now perceive) all was to honte out somewhat of me whereby you might
thus Juda^ly betraye me / and so do your spiritual father and other / sich a
secret sacrifice. Suerly / I had never believed although it was told me of
mani that you had thus accused me / had I not seen your own hand: which
letters I would have winked at as I do yet at other mennis false reportis on me
/ if I had been but giltye al things (as I am not) which you do i^pute unto
me i^ the^ I would have let your letters lie still in derkenes aftir your
desyer: Or if they had been but only harmfull unto my body and name which I am
bound to defend: yet I would have suffered soft sile^cs and pacie^s to have been my patrones and defends before god / never to have a^swerd you /
co^forti^ge my self in my god the god of al counfort / now expulsed my native
land through your letters lesinge my poor liui^g / forsaki^g al my ki^ne and
friends / being i^ great pouertye and kare in the which al / you have set me
for that I would awoided the cruel tira^nye of your spiritual father and of
other incenste by your letters. I would (I say) have conforted my self and do
daily as god gives me grace with this one comfortable sai^g of my savior Mat.
5. Blessed or you when men cast rebukes and sclaunderouse reuilinges upon you
/ persecuti^g you and report al manner of euel agenst you / belyinge you for my
sake: Rejoice and be glad for great is your reward in heaven. This one
sentence is enough to answer for me and to comfort me agenst al sclaunders and
false reportis / and even agenst your letters as touching my person and fame.
But in that your letters and opinions ar sclaunderouse and blasphemouse agenst
god and his truth / I may not suffer them to be bid in derkenes as you
desyerd your most Reverend father to keep them. Wherefore I shall by goddis
grace avenge and deliver his truth from your false opinions / and that by his
true word / that yet if thus / it would please god to open your eyes and show
you his truth and call you to repe^tau^ce

First you say that one opinion was that I held / that as great and as large
power to bind and to lose was given of god to a simple priest as to a byshope
or to the bishope of Rome (which is more). Which intent and opinion (you say)
I proved by these wordis of Christ saing. Go your ways in to the world and
preach the Gospel etc. for as my father has sent me / so send I you etc.
Sir / first ye shall know that what so ever the scripture affirms / I hold
it for no opinion: but I believe it to be true for there is great difference
between faith and opinion And as for these textis which you say that I
alleged to prove my intent / look you whether they make for your opinion of
bindinge and losinge in secret confession aftir your understanding / or
rather to pertain to the open preachinge of the word of God. And turn to
Mark in the. 16. Chap. and look whether this your text. Quia sicut misit me
pater etc. follows (as you allege it) Ite in mundu^ vniuersum with a
conjunction causale as you falsely bring it in to show the cause of the
sentence before. But turn to Johan cap. 20. and there shall you se it stand
with out a Quia / as a proposition first propounded of Christ in a comparison
or similitude and aftirwarde there disposed / the comparison declared both in
the geuinge of the holygost and power to forgive and to hold sins. Nether did
I allege these textis as you do at rovers so confusely confoundinge one
Evangelist with a another to confute your false opinion / nor yet added I any
scilicetiu plurali numero for Solomon warns Prouer bioru^. 30. that we add
nothing to goddis word lest we be reproved and found liars. And Christ
spoke his words in the plural no^bir at the geuinge of his kayes to al his
apostles: as ye may se Ioh. 20 with out any scilicet / if you know a verb
of the plural noumbir from the singular. But I pass over your ignorance /
and shall prepare me to confirm the truth into the co^futacion of your false
opinions: of the which. The first is that a bishope or the bishope of Rome (by
who^ you understand the Pope) has a greter and larger power to bind and to
lose given them of god then a simple priest. That the truth of goddis word
might be deliuerde from your false opinions and losed from your violente
wrestinge of holy scripture: and that it apereth verily by your opinion / that
you know not what Christ meant by the keys of the kingdom of heaven / nether
yet what is vnderstande^ by binding and losing: ye shall know that when Christ
asked his disciples Matt. 16. Who^ say you that I am? Peter (as the mouth of
the^ al) answered that thing which they al believed: eue^ thus / Thou art
Christ the son of the living God. That they al believed thus as Peter openly
confessed / the text folowinge declares. For even contenently he warned not
only Peter / but al them who^ he asked the question that they should not tell
any man that he was Jesus Christ. This / Johan declares in the. 6. chap.
Vhere Christ asked his disciples. And will you go away to? Peter answerde as
the mouth for them all. Lord / to whom shall we go? thou haste the wordis of
euerlasti^ge life / and we believe (he said not I believe alone^^ know that thou
art Christ the son of the living god. Here Peter answered for the^ all the
same thing that he confessed Mat. 16. upon this therefore so faithful a
knowledge and belief seen in the^ all he promised the^ Mat. 16. the keys of
the ki^gdome of heaven / for where he saw like faith there would he give like
office. And as Bede says in the Homely of the same text. When al were asked
in general Peter alone for all answerde / so that the same thing that Christ
answered Peter / he answerde to them al in Peter / saing: Blessed art thou
Simon bar iona etc. and to the shall I give the keys of the ki^gdome of heaven
that what so ever thou shall lose i^ the earth it shall be losed in heaven: And
what so ever thou shall bind in earth / it shall be bound in heaven. That he
promised the^ al / these keys it is manifest in the performinge of the^
Johan. 20. ca. Where it is told when these keys here promised were given /
to who^ they were given / and what he meant by the^: Mark in the. 16. and Luc in
the. 24. both to telling the same story. They were given the same day that
Christ rose from death at the caveninge / the disciples gatherd together in
an house for fear / the doors shitto the^. unto whom Christ entered in
saluting them saing: Peace be with you. But first let us se what christ me^t
by these keys your opinion is that these keys ^r the autorite or power whereby
Pope bishope or priest holds and absolueth the man that confesses him into
their cares / and of this power only (I dare say) you understand your opinion
/ and so accused me as adversary to it. But Master priour you shall understand
that I mean no sich power by these keys nether Christ means any since by
them. For when he gave them these keys: he sent them not forth with them to
hear confessions / but to preach his gospel / as witnesses both Johan. 20.
and Mark. 16. so that these keys ar annexed un to the office of preachinge as
ye may se at the geuinge of them. But if you were well aquainted with Christis
gospel / ye should have read year this i^ Mattheu the 23. chapter. Vvo be to
you scribes and Pharisays / hypocrites for you sh^tvp the kingdom of heaven
before me^ etc. How (I pray you) did they shit it up? L^^e declares cap. 11.
sayng w^ be to you lawyers for you have taken away the keye of knowledge / so
that uether your selves enteryn / and yet forbid you the^ that would enteryn.
Now thanked be god which has here told us at the last what he me^te by his
keys calli^g the^ the keys of knowledge: but I pray you how did the pharisays
and lawiers shit up the kingdom of heaven? vexely (even as Luce says in that
they took away the keye of knowledge wherbi men should come thither / as now do
their successors forbiddinge men to preach Christ's Gospel / and to read his
holy testament which to the very keye of the knowledge of God our father and of
Christ his son to be our only savior: this is the keye that opens the
high way to the kingdom of heaven / this opens the door of the which
Christ speaks Johan. 10. through the which door who so ever enters shall be
saved etc. And for this cause Christ called his Gospel and holy word the keye
of knowledge or keys in the plural noumber of the kingdom of heaven alluding
unto the double propertye that one keye has both to open and to shitte. Now
since the shitting up of the kingdom of heaven be the taking a way of the keye
of the knowledge of goddis word: then must the openinge of it nedis be the
geuinge of the keye of the knowledge of Goddis word. which knowledge stands in
the preaching hearing and reading thereof. wherefore Christ said at the
deliverance of th^se keys Mark the. 16. Go your ways into all the world
and preach my Gospel. And Johan cap. (...). As my father has sent me so
send I you. Here may you se what Christ me^t by these keys promised Mat. 16.
and when they were given / Luce telling the same story more at large saying:
Thus it ^^ehoued Christ to suffer as it is written and to rys^ ag^ne the third
day from death / that repe^taun^^ and remission of sins should be preached
in his name among all nations. For at the preaching of the law / men know
there sins / and feel themself bounde^ / of the which knowledge and felinge
there folowth repentance. And at the preachinge of the Gospel which promises
remission of sins there folowth faith which loses the captive conscience in
to the quiet liberty of the spirit. Now had they the word delyuerde the^ to
be preached which he called the keye of knowledge / now were they i^spired with
the holy ghost / now was the keye of David given them that opens and no man
shitteth Apo. 3. for after long co^municacion and declaring him self to the^
/ he said these are the wordis which I spoke to you while I was yet with you:
for all must be fulfilled which were written of me in the law of Moses / in
the prophetis and psalmis. Then opened he their hartis that they might
understand the scriptures / the propertye of a keye is to open that which
before was shitte / thus does Luce allude and agree his speech with the
propertys of a keye / for before in the journey to Emaus with the two disciples
he says their eyes were shitte up and holden so that they knew him not / but
aftir he had rebuked them for their unbelief and opened the^ the scriptures
turning the keye of his word in their hartis / the holygoste working with all /
their eyes were opened and they knew him. Here may ye se in the story of
Luce how with his word he opened the hertes of these two disciples yet locked
up in unbelief before they returned to Jerusalem unto the other xi.
disciples. Now says he / even as I was sent / that is to say / to open
mennis hartis losing them with the keye of my knowledge from unbelief by
preachinge and expounding the scriptures / eue^ to send I you / he sent not
only the^ but has seem hitherto and shall send preachers with the same keys
of knowledge of the word to bind and to lose like wise unto the worldis end.
Note here also how often lu^ uses these wordis / their eyes were holde^ /
their eyes were opened / he opened their wits ever more alludinge unto the
propertye of a keye. Thus he opened their hartis with the keye of his word to
bring in his knowledge in to the^ / the holy ghost breathed into them and
turni^ge the kaye in their hartis into the right sense and understanding of his
word. An example is setto in Johan of Thomas Dydimus which was not emonge
thapostles at the geui^ge of these keys of the knowledge of his gloriouse
resurrection which was that Gospel and the very joyful tidingis: wherefore his
heart was yet locked up and holden in unbelief: not with standinge yet the
other apostles did put this keye into hi^ and so begane to practice it upon hi^
sainge. V^d^^us du^m: but this keye turned not right i^ his heart ne opened it
/ for he beleved the^ not but said: Except I se the holes of the nails in his
ha^dis and put my finger into them / ye except I put my hand into his side / I
will not believe it. (here was Thomas sore bounde^ and holde^ with the sin of
unbelief But aftir.viij. days / they being there within again and Thomas
with the^ / Jesus came in / the door shi^te and stood emo^ge the^ sai^ge: peace
be with you: ^ the^ said he to Thomas: put i^ thy finger here and feel my
hands / puttup thy hand and thruste it into my side / and be no more in
unbelief but believe. Here the keye of christis word turned right i^ Thomas
his heart losinge it from unbelief / and he said D^s meus and deus meus / my
lord and my god. The work of God co^teyneth both the law and the Gospel.
The law is that which god commands us to fulfill / as ar the.x.
co^mau^deme^tis / the gospel is the power of god unto health for every man that
believes To. j. and it is the promise of grace and remission of sins given us
through Christ. The law is spiritual and re^reth our hertes and our very
affectis: as to believe and to trust i^ god only to love hi^ with all our hearts
/ soul / and mi^de above al things. Here the law shows us our sins and
of what sinful nature we are that cannot fulfill these co^maundeme^tis: here it
works wrath / it fears and so vexes our co^scie^ces at the knowledge of
our sins that we begi^ne to be angrye with gods judgment wri^i^g i^ us (sich
is the weakness of our sinful nature) ye and we in a manner despeyer: thus the
law workinge her power and office in us / sin is increased / and we are led
captive and bound ander the law of sin which is in our members. Romans vij.
For the law is the power of sin. 1. Corint. xv. At these offices and use of
the law preached or read / a sinful conscie^s felith her self bounden and
holden under the power of sin and karyed towerde damnacion / as Paul
declares i^ his pistle to the Romans / there expressinge the nature and
strength of the law / as every sinner touched of God may feale verily i^ his
own heart at his conversion. But when the gospel comes which is that joyful
tidingis / that Christ came to call and to save sinners / and that grace and
forgeuenes of sins is given through his death to as many as believe this
comfortable, promise: the^ the sinner heari^g these tidi^gis and beleui^ge the^
perfitly: fealeth his heart eased / comforted and losed. But if he believes it
not: the^ is he yet holde^ still bounde^ i^ to da^nacio^: this is the bindi^ge
and losinge of the keys of gods word. This expressed he brefely i^ Mark
sai^ge. He that believes and is baptized shall be saved / and he that believes
not shall be damned. and Ioha^ on this manner said: whose sins you shall forgive
/ they are forgiven the^: and whose you shall hold / they ar holde^. Also a
another manner of bindinge and losinge by these keys / the scripture reme^breth
i^ the. 18. ca. of Mat. which place shows us how the virtue of
exco^municacion or separatinge of obstinate impenitent and open sinners out of
the co^gregacio^ should be used (...) the sinner ought to be rebuked of his
bro^^er who^ he had offended / and then if he will not hear hi^ to be moneshed
before one or two witnesses / and yet if he hear them not to be co^playned of
unto the ^ole congregation. Who^ if he yet wilnot hear: then to be separed
from the felawship of the faithful. This exco^municocio^ or putti^g out of the
congregation Christ called in the said place of Mattheu^a hindinge: and the
reconcilinge of the same person if he be penitent after this) is there called a
losinge. whervppon he said unto his disciples on this ma^^er. If this obstinat
man wilnot hear the congregation let him be to you as an haithen and publica^^
/ that is to say as an infydele excluded out of faith full (...) company. For
verily I say unto you ^ what so ever ye bind upon therthe they shall be (...)
in heaven / and what so ever you lose on therthe they shall be losed in heaven.
that is to say / whom so ever you puttout of the congregation here af^^r this
form prescribed you / the same thing is confirmed in heaven: and whom you
receive agene as pentient and sorye for his offenses the same (...) received in
heaven. This manner of binding and losinge Paul put in execucion once upon the
open (...) as ye may read in the.v. cap. of the first to the there binding
and holding him in his sin as an obstinat / open / and vnshamefaced sinner
none pu^^u^e of holy company. and aftir his great (...) and repentance losed
him agene reco^cyled (...) restored unto the congregation: as it is written in
the. 2. Corin. ca. 2. Now compare the form and cause of Paulis executinge of
this manner of exco^municacion and absolui^g agene unto our bishops lighteningis
and thondringis of their exco^municacio^s and kursingis / and look how they
agree with Christis word and Paulis form in all circumstancis.

But as for the keys which are the law and Gospel preached or read / for that
the one binds and the other loses the beleuers from sin and condemnacio^:
it needs not to dispute whether the Pope has more power to lose with
preachinge thereof then a bishop / or a bishop greter then a simple priest.
For the popis high holiness may not desce^de to so vile and low an office
although he were learned. and the bishoppis busynes may not attend to
execute thoffice and power of edifyinge they are so full occupied i^ destroyng.
the simple sir Ioha^ is not now learned and yet if he were learned / he must
have their autorite which is hard to be obtained if he will preach the truth
Peter and Paul were but pore simple prestis in comparison to our holy father
the Pope / to the most reverend Cardinalis gracis / and to our lordis the
bishoppis / and yet I think they had as great and as large (as you say) power
to lose and to bind with preachi^ge the word of god as has Pope / cardinal /
bishope / abbote or priour And as for the scripture / it puts no sich
difference of lordely powers / nether knows it sich lordely and stought
namis: but says to the^ / though the haithen play the lordis / yet shall not
you be so / it says not you shall be so: but vos aute^ non sic. But set men to
look whether it be truly translated into englisshe that while they are in
co^ferringe on text with a another lokinge narowly for fautes in the
translacion were non was: your fautis and abhominacion might be balked or the
less espied: but had they left hontinge for errors in the translation and
conferringe text to text / and compared your lyuinge to the Gospel / they
had seen them agree to gyther as derkenes with light / and the deuell with
Christ. More over the scripture knows no siche difference as you suppose
between Pope / bishope and priest but callethe a priest a bishop and a bishop a
priest if ye e^glisshe these two wordis pres^^er and Episcopus aftir the common
englisshe as ye may read Act^. 20. and.i. ad Tit^. And as for this (...) Pope
or the overmoste bishop / I find the^ not but that there were certain called
the chief or principal of the prestis unto whom Judas went sayng: what will you
give me and I shall betraye hi^ and deliver him into your hands / as you had
went to have deliuerde me by your secret false letters / of the which chief
prestis it is written also Matthew. 27. that they called a counsel erly with the
elders of the people agenst Jesus to deliver and to put hi^ to death Nowe^ I
trust M. priour / you se how the law (...) binds / and the gospel losethe
and how Christ put the keys of his Gospel in to the hartis of his disciples
once lockedup in unbelief and ignorance* and how happily he turned them
opening their hartis in to the knowledge of him now risen by the power of his
spirit / preachinge and interpretinge them the law and the prophets losinge
their witt^s opening their eyes. And even so do the preachers of goddis word
daily that are sent and inspired with his spirit* all thought they be but
simple prestes in your eyes and nether pope nor bishopa) occupye their mindis
in his law day and night and exercise these keys besely turning the^ in
mennis hartis whetting the word of god upon them / and as Paul exhorts his
Timothe preaching his word are fervent in ceason or out of ceason / improve /
rebuke exhort with all long sufferi^ge. 2. Tim. 4. These men I say that thus
preach and teach continually goddis word and declare it puerly have the
keys of the kingdom of heaven: these lose when they open sinners hartis into
repentance and faith / they bind when they preach the law and hold still
siche as believe not their wordis but resist and persecute them. And you / M.
priour and as many as nether can nor will preach but persecute them that God
sends with these keys: you (I say) whether ye be Pope / Cardinal / Bishope
/ abbot / priour or priest / nether lose nor bind / nor yet have you Christis
keys but only those rustye tradicions and laws of men to shitt up the
kingdom of heaven / and to take away the knowledge of Christ with ungodly
inhibicions / lighteningis and thundering of exco^municacions / threateningis /
persecucions / impresoningis / scourgingis and burningis / nothing feari^ge
that terrible thondre clappe of Christis own mouth daily thondringe over you
headis / cryinge Matt. 23. Woe be to you scribes and Pharisays hipocrits / for
you shittup the ki^gdome of heaven before men / and nether your self enteri^ /
nor yet suffer you siche as would come thereto to enteri^. And yet fear you not
this terrible threateni^ge of everlasting da^nacion hanging over your headis?
These ar your counterfetted keys and false pestelent persuasions to drive the
people from the knowledge of Goddis word and their salvation / which word is
the keye and high way to the kingdom of heaven. ye say it is hard and derke
for the lay people: but woe be to you says I say ca. 5. that tell the^ the
light to be derkenes. you say that the scripture in englisshe would make
sedicion / bread errors and hereseys emonge the lay men and so to be evil for
the^: but woe be to you says I say that say that thing which is good to be
evil. ye say the letter slaythe / is vnsa^erie and bitter for them: but woe be
to you says I say agene that say that which is sweet to be bitter. Thus is
the holy / clear / good and sweet gospel of Christ belyed shamefully and
blasphemed of you. If it be bitter and unsavory / it is (...) savor / it is
^ou^rd and derke to you that perisshe says Paul. 2. Corin. 2. and. 4. It had
be^ better for you to have obayed the counsel of Eamaliel Act^. 5. then thus so
manifestly repugned and faught agenst God: but you ar so blinded with your own
malice that you se not how sith you inhibyted the pro^^^rs / aid the word of
God to be taught and (...) lay men / and persecuted it / the more it (...)
^ethe / it gro^eth it spreads / it thrusts you down and declares you
openly to be the very Pharis^^^s / scribes / ^ipocritis / and even the very
Antichristis that (...) and his apostles prophesied to (...) dares. Repent /
repent you therefore and converted to God / ask grace and mercy that he would
illumine your hartis and lose you with the ^eyes of the knowledge of his holy

in the second chapter and Luce in the (...) only God that forgeueth sins: and
so the Apostles forgive the^ not. The^ I answer you (...) many thi^gis
pertaining only to god (...) of his infinite goodness gives unto us: (...)
calls the^ owrs. The keys which are the word ar his ^d yet he calls the
word owrs and many (...) that were wrought with the same word as (...) where
he said to the Apostles. He^l^ ^he ^ik / make clean the leprose / raise the deed
/ castout deuels. which al were his workis and yet he gave them power to do his
workis. The word where with they did these miracles / was his word / and yet
he called it theirs / saing. Vv^o so ever receive not you / another will hear
your words etc. ye and even our own good workis (as we believe it is he that
works them in us / as testifies Isaie the. 26 and yet is he content of his
liberalite that we bare the name of them and be called our workis. But he
rewards his deadis in us says Augustine. If this solucio^ satisfies you not
/ then remitte I you unto a like manner af speech. Jeremy. 15. Vv^ere God had
Jeremie cast out the Jwes from his presens / saing: Eijce illos a facie mea.
And yet god casted them out his own self / and even so in like autorite he
said to the Apostles: Vhose sins so ever you forgive / they are forgeuen etc.
For aftir the familiare phrase and vehemence of the Hebrewe speech (as the
professors of that tongue affirm) When God bad Jeremie cast them forth: he
would nothing else but that he should tell and preach them to be cast forth
and led into captivity if they amended not their living / so when he said to
thapostles. Whose sins so ever you forgive etc. He meant that to whom so ever
you preach and tell the^ their sins to be forgeuen / if they believe in me and
change their life / their sins ar forgeuen. For as at Jeremies preachinge
the ungodly were castoute / so at Thapostels preachinge the penitent beleuers
have their sins forgeuen. And the unbelievers ar holden captive in their
sins.

M. Priour of Newnhams second opinion.
Now as touching your second opinion / which you say that I held: That
faith without works is sufficient / verily I never said so: but I might say
that by faith without works a man is justified. Which is Paul's sainge in
the third cap. to the Romans / and this sentence I believe as true with Paul /
and hold it for no^ opinion And for a declaracio^ of this Paul's sentence / I
will first tell you what is faith / what it is to be justified before god / and
what is the rightwisnes of faith. First ye shall know that the Apostle
defines faith in the. 11. ca. to the Hebrews saing that faith is the very
suer and substancial belief of him which is the same thing that we hope
fore: that is to say faith is an infallible and undoubted certaintye in our
hearts / whereby we believe and trust in the invisible God: and to opene this
definicion yet more plainly. Faith is that same co^stante and fast
persuasion in our hearts assuerde us by the holygoste / certifyinge us of the
goodness of God and of his promises towerde us / by the which persuasion we
believe verily his words and ar assuerde in our hearts the holy ghost
testifinge it in us) that he is our God / our father / to us an almighty helper
and deliverer / and that we are received in to his favor by the death and
meretis of his son Jesus Christ our savior / upon the which belief and
assuered persuasion we love him so ernestly agene that we cease not the
occasion and time offrede) to fulfill his plesures in doing the works of love
or charity to our neghbours. Of this lively faith Paul speaks always /
which by love is mighty in operacion ad Gala. 5. and mente no more dead faith
in this his sentence / A man is justified by faith / the^ he mente of a dead
man / when he alleged the prophet Abaku^saing / the rightwise shall live of
his faith / for deed faith gives no life.

To be justified orto be made rightwyse before God by this faith / is nothing
else but to be absolved from sin of God / to be forgeuen / orto have no sin
imputed unto him of God.

The rightwysnes which is allowed before God that comes of faith is sometimes
in scripture called his mercy or favor towerd us and in us / whereby he is
moved for Christis bloudis sake to promise us forgeuenes. And sometimes it is
taken for his truth and faithfulness in the performi^ge of his promise / and of
this is he called just or rightwise / faithful and true. Vv^erfore the
scripture comenly joins these two words / mercy and Truth or faithfulness
together especially in the Psalms as I noted in the argument of the. 89.
Psalm / and as David prays God in the. 31. Psalm. to deliver him for his
rightwisnes sake: that is for his mercies sake or for his truths sake / and in
the. 5. Psalm. lord ledemeforthe for thy rightwisnes sake. The mercy whereby God
is moved to promise us his benefits / goth before / and his truth in
performinge feloweth / now the manner of the scripture is / to use the one for
the the other / as the kingdom of heaven for the gospel which gothe before and is
the knowledge of the way to the kingdom / and because of hearing the word /
comes faith To. 10. therefore to hear in scripture is sometimes taken for to
believe / as Johan in the. 6. Every man that has hard and is learned of my
father comes to me / that is to say every man that believes on the father
etc. and in the same ca. He that comes to me shalnot ho^ger / which saing the
sentence following expounds thus / He that believes in me shall never thirste
or shall be ever satisfied / here / to come to Christ which follows faith in
him / is taken for to believe in him. and sometime that at gothe before is taken
for that at follows / as may apere well to them that are excercised in readi^g
of holy scripture / as the keye of knowleg and the gospel ar al one / for that
one comeh of the the other. Farthermore. Paul in the. 9. and.10. ca. to the To.
and i^ the. 3. to the Philip. declares two manner of rightwisnesses: one he
calls the rightwisnes of the law or our own rightwisnes / and the the other
the rightwisnes of god or of faith. the rightwisnes of the the law is that at
is gote^ by works of the law / the rightwisnes of faith is that whereby God
of his mercy rekeneth us righwise for our faythes sake. Outward works show
us rightwise before the world / but faith justifies us before God / Abraham's
vtwarde deed in obainge God and going forth to offer his son Isaac / Genesis.
22. and James. 2. was a testimony of his faith / and declared him rightwise
before men / aft^r the rightwisnes of the law / but his faith justified hi^
before God long before yer Isaac was borne / Gene. 15. Also we are justified
before God only in that we are chosen in Christ before the wolrde was created /
Ephe. 1. Of the which election and iustifica^^^ / our faith when god gives
it us / certifieth our hearts / and aftirwarde when our faith brekethforth i^
to good works for trwe faith cannot be idle than ar our works a testimony
before men of our faith / so that our faith is a secret and a suer
persua^ion to our self of our election before God / and our works that
proceed of faith ar a testimony of our faith to the world / of the which
vtward works the world iugeth us rightwise a^tir the rightwisnes of the law.
But here let men take heed lest they despise the rightwisnee of faith ^s
heresy / and stand to the rightwisnes of their own works. Of who^ thus
speaks Paul To. 10. They are ignorant of the rightwisnes which is allowed
before God / and go about to stableshe their own rightwisnes: wherefore they are not under the righwisnes of God. There Paul (as I poynted you to before
brings in Moses / Leuiti. 18. and in Deutero. 30. describinge these two
rightwisnes / as one contrary to the the other. of the which descripcio^ I will
not here tarry / read the places and Paul's pistle to the To. and to the Gala.
and understand it if god will give it you. This is therefore Paul's sentence to
the Romans in the third chapter. We suppose that a man is justified by faith
with out the works of the law / understanding it of iustificacion / and of
that rightwisnes that is of lively faith and allowed before God / as I have
declared it before. And for the probacio^ of this sentence / the Prophets /
Christ his own self / and his Apostles spente al their labors and lives /
and especially Paul laboring above al other to confirm it / as it apereth in
his pistles / and especially in his pistle to the Romans. Vvheryn he laid this
sentence of the iustifyinge by faith / at the beginning as his principal
proposition and chief foundation grounded of the testimony of Abaku^ the
Prophet. Agenste the which proposicion / the Iwe which sought for the
rightwisnes of works / as now do the false Christen / a non objected saing /
as you do now. If faith only justifies / wherefore the is the law with so
many good works commanded us to fulfill it? Paul answerthe / By the law come
men in to the knowledge of their sins. And because ye should understand that
by the law he me^te the moral law / and not the ceremonial. He gave example
i^ the. 7. ca. of the moral law sai^g. I had not known that co^cupisce^se had
be^ sin except the law had said. Thou shalnot lust And now therefore (says
he Romans 3.) the rightwisnes of God is made manifest with out the law / by
the Gospel from faith to faith / which rightwisnes was sometime preached of
the Prophets / and proved by the testimony of the law. And now a^ men
justified freely by Goddis mercy and by the redemption that is in Jesu Christ
through faith in his blood etc. To. 3. Then agene obiecteth the Iwe as now
does the Christian / in the beginni^ge of the 4. ca. What the^ shall we say to
Abraham our father aftir the flesh: what got he by his works? Was he not
justified by them? If Abraham (says Paul) were justified by his works / so
has he whereof to rejoice / but not before God. And even here is James question
soluted Iaco. 2. sayng. Abraham our father / was he not justified by his deeds
when he would have offered his son Isaac? yes verily / as here says Paul /
he had to rejoice before men but not before God / that is to say / he had that
deed which justified him and declared him just vtwardly before men with the
rightwisnes of the law for his obedience: but as concerning the rightwisnes
of (...) before God says Paul Abraham believed in God / and it was rekened him
for rightwisnes. This is Paul's first argument to prove his principal
proposicion: which argument he takes of the example of Abraham father of the
people of God. In whom the form of rightwismakinge was first declared and
setforthe for our example. The second argument Paul deduceth of the
diffinicio^ of th^s word Was Rekened: which stands in the said autorite of
Genes^s. 15. and it signifies a rekeninge and a fre forgeuenes of a duty
which the dettour is not able to pay / sainge. To hi^ that works is the
reward not rekened of favor / but of duty: And to him that works not /
but believes on hi^ that justifies the ungodly. Faith is rekened for
rightwisnes (faith says he and not works) even as David says: Blessed is
that man to whom the lord rekeneth not his sin / he said not blessed is he
that works / but he to who^ God rekeneth not sin / that is to say /
although he be a sinner and not able to come out of debt: yet will not God of
his mercy reken it unto him ne lay it to his charge / for that the penitent
sinner believes that Christ made satisfaction for him and paid the ransom
for it with his preciouse blood. And upon this fre forgeuenes he sealed him a
quitaunce with the seal of circumcision which was a toke^ to hi^ that he was
justified by his faith. But we have now a more suer and liuelyer token of our
right wismakinge by faith / for god has confirmed us in Christ / he has
anointed us / he has co^segned us unto him / and given us his holygost for an
erneste of his promise to be justified by faith. 2. Cor. 1 and Ephe. 1. thus
sayng. Aftir that you hard the Gospel which is the word of truth wheryn ye
believed / ye were scaled with the holy spirit which is to us as an ernest penny
to be assuerde of our promised heretage / which is purchesed us by redemption
into the praise of the glory of God. Mo arguments Paul makes in the same.
4. cap. to the Romans / for the probacion of his sentence / espy them out if
you can and desyer God to give you understanding. Also ye shall know that
Christ came not as a lawyer like Moses / but he was the very redemer and
reconcyler of the beleuers through his blood into his fathers favor and grace.
The law was given by Moses / but remission of sins and the holygoste is
given by Christ / Johan. 1. ye and that unto all and upon all that believe To. 1
Oh what consolacion is in this one place set forth for feared and troubled
conscienses? suerly no tongue can express it / for although we want good
works / as we want al / for there is not one that does good / but we are al
sinners) yet let us believe that for Christ's sake we are received freely into
our fathers grace. This rightwisnes is set forth of his mercy for us with out
the works of the law / wherefore suerly / it were great blasphemy agenst
Christ / and no less defilinge of his mercy se^te / not to receive the
merits of his passion / that is to say the rightwisnes by faith / but to
turn it into our sinful works. If any man* be he never so holy shuldbe
justified by his works then had ^hriste says Paul to the Galat. in the
second chapter dyed in vain for that same man: let us therefore receive
Christ's rightwisnes now offered us let us trust to his rightwisnes and merets
and not to our own / nor yet to any others / for all our rightwisnesses says I
say i^ the. 64. chapter ar as the spotted and four clothes of a menstruose.
It is verily ^ great blasphemy to refuse this suer and fre forgeuenes in
Christ's blood / ye and a dam^able thing to (...) it as heresy and to seek
for works of our own muencion upon this hope and belief to deserve heaven and
to be justified by them. For this article to ^e known Paul swet so sore in
his pistles and labored in h^s preachin^e. But yet let not blind carnal
reason make this objection agenste him saing. If faith without works
justifies / then need we not to do any good works? Not so (...) for by faith
therefore ar we justified to thentente we should* do good works and never cease
/ and therefore Paul after that he had sufficiently proved his conclusion did
serro in the. 12. (...) to the (...) good works then ever we are able to do.
(...) wor^es in their place / and faith in her place / for if the works are not
done of faith / then are they sin Romans xiiij.

Now master prior because you or not greatly acqueynted with Paul's doctrine /
although he be your patron and painted at your gates: because his arguments
ar to high for them that never felt faith / nor yet tasted the fealinge of the
spirit of faith i^ the schole of the cross. I will desce^de with you into a
more sensible demonstracion to prove Paul's sainges trwe and to da^ne your
opinion. Paul as he was going to persecute Christ's church was smiten down a
murderer and rose agene a justified man / which yet had done no good works /
but only believed in Jesus Christ that smit him down and spoke unto him ergo
faith only justified. The young innocent new Christined and departed I think
you will grant is justified / but not by his works / ergo. The thief that
hanged by Christ was justified upon the cross / but not for any works that
he there did / ergo for his faith only. Wherefore sir / me think ye were to
hastye to judge me a Lutherane and an heretic for affirming or holding any
saing of holy scripture / which I know well you understand not and to impute
unto me that which I never said / and so preuely to accuse me where upon to
avoyde the cruel tira^nye of my lord your reverent and spiritual father with
his adherentes that yet fight agenste the lord and his anointed / I was
constr^yned to lose all that I had and to flee. Sir / stand you to your
glisteringe good works and glor^ouse merets beleuinge to be justified and
forgiven for them and not in Christ's death / and trust you to them if you
will) ^or as for me which am an heretic and a Luther^ne in your opinion / I
shall by Goddis grace fea^e with Iobe al my deades / and pray with David: O
lord I beseech the enter not into judgment with thy servant / but save me
and deliver me for thy rightwisnes sake and not for mine / that is to say save
me for thy mercies sake and not for my merets. Also I shall by Goddis grace
aftir that mesure of the faith that god has given me / believe to be saved i^
this faith / that is to say / that my savior Christ has dyed for my sins
/ and is risen for my rightwis making by whose death and sufferi^ges / my
father in heaven is peased and has received me into his favor for Christis
bloudis sake / so that now Christ has redeemed me and saved me / he is mine
/ and al his merets ar mine. His rightwisnes / his wisdom / his holiness / his
satisfaction / his fulfillinge of the law / and al his good deades ar mine /
as sufficient to serve me for my salvation / and yet will I not cease to do
good works / but rather am I bound for this love to do mor then ever I am
able / though I trust nether to my nowne nor yet to any others. Thus have you
a rekeni^ge of my faith as co^cerninge th^s article. Now to your. 3. opinion.

Master priour of Newnhams Third opinion.
YOur third opinion is / that I should hold that every priest may have a
wife or a concubine. Sir this may welbe your own opinion / for it was never
mine I take God to record that a priest might have a co^cubine / but this I
believe that it is lawful and stands with holy scripture / that every priest
which have not the gift of chastity / ought to have his own wife / and no
another (...) / nor yet a co^cubyne. Although your church militar as you call
it for they are beter soudiers then preachers permits the prestes in some
places to have their concubines paynge their annual tributes to their* bishopes
for their lecencial lust / and in many places / to their great sclaunder /
their Co^missares / Scribes with other officers wink at their boredome and
adultery / for bribes / for favor / or fear. you told me once secretly as
we walked aftir souper between your barn yard and your high gates / that the
Pope had dispensed with the Cardinal to keep a concubine / which thing then
(as litel learni^ge as I had) I could not believe to be lawful / but that it
had been rather lawful for as much as he had not the gift to live chastely
if ye said true) to have married and lived in chaste matrimony with his own
wife. Nether believe I that your church militante did godly to in^ibit priest
or any woman the holy and honorable ^acrame^t of matrimony / which God did
institute for every man and woman that would receive it / and denied it no man
/ as a sacrament that makes lawful the act of wedlok / which committed
without wedlok / to sin and damnable. you say that I took for my example /
saint Peter which was a priest / and yet had he a wife / both before Christ
called him to the office of an Apostle / and also aftir his calling. Which
example you cannot deny. But then bring you in for your help to confute my
sainge your brother celerer called / Joha^ Berde / or Johan Salpho / a man of
like learning and could beter skill in making of a pease ri^e then in
allegging of holy scripture saing / that Peter used not his wife aftir his
calling / and to prove this he allegged Paul in a certain pistle (say you /
for nether of you could tell where i^ what pistle nor yet understood you your
own allegacion saing. They that have wives let them be as though they had no^.
This text therefore Paul writ not to Peter only and to the other married
Apostles / but to the Corintheans / and to al us that are of Christ's church ye
to all the world / now if you understand this same Paulis sainge in the. ^.
ca. in the first to the Corintheans. The^ that have wives / let the^ be as
toughe they had no^ as your brother Celerer allegged it for Peter / that is to
say let them not use their wives / then aftir your minds / ought noma^ that
have a wife to have the felawship of his own wife. Here may men se what
^lerkely disputers ye are and what pr^bye promotours and accusers of Christen
men your spiritual and most reverend fathers in god have procured them. The
text therefore is thus understood / as the circumsta^ce of the letter
declares (...) that have wives be as though they had (...) not their minds
be so inordinatly drowned in l^ste and tangled with hare for their household
that they be h^^dred from preachinge of the word of they be called thereto /
orels be le^^^d from the hearing and following of the word if they be
otherwise called. By this text Paul intended no less to forbide amaryed man
the chas^e company of his wife and the due benevolence ^as he calls it to
the same chapter the^ the byer and s^ll^r to not use his goods lawfully / when
he says in the (...) f^lowinge. They that bye let the^ be as though they
possessed nothing / that is to say / let them not be so gredely glued to their
goods / but that when they se occasion they can be content gladly to depart
from them to releue the necessite of the poore^ (...) for the declaracion of
this his mind be showed the cause why he thus said / addinge thereto saing
thus. For I would have you without to (...) trouble. If Paul by this text
should forbide any man the company of his wife as you dreamed (...) should he
say contrary to himself in the same chapter / saing. Let the man give unto
his wife the due beneuole^ce / and let the wife like wise unto her housba^de.
But be it i^ case that peter (as he did undoubted) had the company of his wife
aftir his calling / did he offend god in so doing or no? If ye say that be
offended / then blaspheme you and dishonor you the sacrament of matrimony /
whereby god sanctified and made honorable the chaste use thereof as Peter used
it. If he did not of ^ende / why then steke you so sore for Peter to defend
him for well and lawfully doing? But here and ye were well opposed you might be
found to be in the heresi of the Tacia^s and like heretics that damned
matrimony as vnpure / which god sanctified with his word / and instituted as
pure / holy / honorable and good / honouringe it with his presens and first
miracle / forbidding i^ no man or woman that would marye. To put you out of
doubt of Peter's felawshipe with other Apostles with their wives aftir their
calling: ye shall know that there were at the Corinthea^s certain false
prophets which observed Paul's liui^ge and the other Apostles (as you observed
mine) to carpe their co^uersacion and to mines be their autorite / and to
defame the^ to the people / saing ^ as it apereth by paul's answer) that he
fasted not / nor was chaste / but led his wife about with him / unto who^
paul answerde sharply on this manner. 1. Cor. 9. Have we not power to eat and
to drink? Other have we not power to lead about sister to wife as well as the
other Apostles and as the brotherne of the lord / and as Cephas? Other only
have not I and Barnabas power this to ^b? Here is it plain that Cephas which is
called Peter with other Apostles led about their wives with them. Who^ paul
aftir the manner of the scripture calls their sisters: as did Abraham Ge. 12.
20. and Isaai. 2. 6. and Solomon Can. 4. for that they were of like faith and
profession in Christ's religion with their housbo^des. ^^hy should not the man
be associated with his wife whom God commands to forsake father and mother /
and to ^leue to his wife? And Christ commands also that who^ God joins
let not man separat? Think you that the Apostles regarded these
commandments of God so light as to leave their own wives one flesh and
blood with the^ knit to gither with so fast a bond that only death must
depart them? The wife says Paul. 1. Cori^. ^.) has not power over her own
body / but her housbande / and likewise the man has not power over his own body
/ but the wife / withdraw not your selves one from a another except it be with
a common consent of both / and that but for a time (he says not for ever
both to go into religion) but for a time to give your selves to fasting and
prayer / and afterward come agene unto the same thing lest satan tempte you
for your incontine^cie. The Apostles for a suerty had chaste matrimony in an
higher reverence and honor then you think they had / and abhorred it not as
vnpure and profane as the forbiders thereof do / and as did like heretics.

That a pre^e which have not the gift of chastity ought to have his own wife
it is manifest / by the Apostle. 1. Cor. ^. saing. To avoyed fornicacion let
every man have his wife / here he excepteth noma^ / no not a priest (if a
priest be a man let him have his wife says he) and not a concubine or a another
mannis wife / and let every woman have her housbo^de. He excepteth nether no^ne
nor any other religiouse. But here you will say that they have vowed chastity.
And I say it is chastity man and woman to live to gither in chaste matrimony
desieringe no another. And if you say that the^ have vowed to live without the
desyer of the felawshipe and company of man for one to desyer a another in mind
is sin except they be man and wife) which you call virginal chastete: then
say I agene that they have vowed that thing that lies not in their power /
and so perform they it never. They that vow this chastity therefore let them
look before they leap. God at the first creacion griffed in to man and woman
as he has done into all creatures a certain secret natural properte to begete
/ to conceive / and to bring forth a another in like kind and that lawfully
with honor. Which natural ordinance and property it lies not in man to
altere and to change / nor yet to put away from his heart the natural love
and desyer to the the other kind whom God created to be his felawe helper unto
this natural effect.

No More then it lies in the liberty of the liuelye tree well planted to cease
from bringing forth her fruits in her time / except God alters this his
natural ordinance by some singler gift. For it is another vow nor mannis
tradicio^ that may alter nature. But yet many have striued to put away
co^cupiscens without matrimonye and to ob^ayne a gift of chastity by their
own works and enforcements febleyng their bodis: but the more they strived
agenste nature / the less they prevailed / and the more burninge they suffred^
and why? because they despised the remedy commanded by gods word to be
received / and went about to heal their decease with their own works and
inuencions. God ordined chaste matrimony as an holy and honest remedy for
this natural burninge and unlawful lust / commanding by his Apostle. 1.
Corint. 7. that if they cannot be continent and chaste / let them marye. For it
is beter to mary the^ to burn. But your church milita^te believes it beter /
to burn in all manner of filthy co^cupiscens and lust / ye to live in open
adultery and sin then to marye. And therefore under the pretense of the
setting up and extolling of their inordinat ordres: have they so obscured the
glory of honorable matrimonye who^ they have set in siche despite and
opprobrie reputing it so vnpure and unclean / that it may not be cowpled with
their holy ordres / ne celebrated in certain of their state holy times of the
year without their dispensacio^. They thought through the forbinding of
matrimony their prestes / to have institute in their church a more pure and
cleaner state of perfection the^ ever God ordened / but to what a chaste end
their holy porpose is come / every man may se / for all the wealth speak euel
and shame of them / and every man abhor them for their pride and unclean
living. But wherefore did your Church militant forbide their prestes to marye?
Because they were suer to have more avauntage by their adultery and horedome
then ever they should have by their chaste matrimonye. For if they had wives
then should not the Bishopes / Cancelers / Commissares / Scribes and somners be
fed so fat with their adultery and sin as they are. If the prestes had wives
/ then should they have a beter name and fame / then should the yoke and ^ares of
matrimony abate their pride / and encrese in them virtue and mekenes. But
paraventure they will say that the troublous sorrows and harefull state of
matrimony should hindre them from preaching and teaching their parochians /
nay verily / for nothing has let them more from that office / then their
welthy idle and unchaste living and riches / and nothing should forther it more
then to have experience of the cross and trouble / nothing more hinders the
word then the preather thereof to have an euel name: and the most part of
them never preached nor taught their flok nor never shall / and emonge these
few that preach because they have no wives: they destroy more with their
evell example of living / then ever they edified with their preachinge / which
sclaunderouse enormite might be reformed if they would receive that honorable
and holy remedy of chaste matrimony ordined of god for them. Vvedlok (says
the Apostle Hebre. in the. 13. cap. is honorable for all men / he excepted
none) and the chamber bed undefiled / but heremongers and adulterers god will
judge. If it be honorable for all men / how should it dishonor prestes that
live in perpetual burninge and desire of other mennis wives / servants and
daughters? Why may not chaste matrimony agree with your holy ordres? Is one
sacrament iniuriouse / harmeful or dishoneste to a another? Al your church
milita^t with their schole doctors say and affirm that the sacraments give
grace to the receyuers of them / and how then hapeneth it / that the holy
ordrede prestes may not receive the grace of matrimony? But (as I said
before) with out doubt these forbyders of holy matrimony ar of the sect of
those heretics that damned matrimony as vnpure / beleuinge that it may not
be used without sin: of the which now ar those curates which will inioyne
their parochia^s that shall be married / one not to know the the other (abusinge
Tobias example) in days aftir the celebracio^ of the sacrament / and will
forbide married persons to give their due beneuole^ce (as Paul calls it) to
each other in lent and other of their holy times. These me^ doutelesse believe
that the act and use of matrimony is sin and iniuriouse or irreuere^t unto
the same sacrament that makes it holy / lawful and honorable: these men know
not the virtue and grace of the word of God / which makes an holy and chaste
act of that which is sin without the same word Paul. 1. Thessa. 4.
commands the Thessalontans the holy and honorable use of matrimony saing.
Let every one of you know to possess his vessel i^ holiness and honor. Which
doctrine of Paul these curates rather ought to instruct them: then to inhibit
them that thing which the word sanctifies and makes honorable. Bri^ging
the married people into this error and co^braunce of conscience to believe that
they sin when they do well / and to make sin there as no^ is. But the blind
leads still the blind. Paul in his pistles both to Timothe and Titus
warned them that emonge al other qualites and conditions belonginge to any man
to be chosen priest or over seer of Christ's flok / they should se that he were
a married man and the man of one wife / that is to say a liver in chaste
matrimonye. And wherefore commanded Paul so diligently this point of
matrimony to be observed? Verily because he would have them blameless / for he
sen^ better remedy for their chastete and good fame to be preserved the^ by
chaste matrimony. And why he esteemed a married man worthy for the cure of any
p^^ethe / he tells Timothe saing: for if it be seen unto you that he
governs well his own houshold^ bringing up his childerne in subjection with all reverence: then may you suppose that the same man shall also well instruct
and teach an hole parish or town. But if he cannot rule and govern his own
house (says Paul) how shall he teach and take the charge and cure of the
congregation of God? Paul says. 1. Cor. 7. that married persons that have
bodily troble / and what is trouble else but to be cast in to the pleasure of
God to learn miche virtue? The governing of his house is an introdu^^on unto a
greter cure / there shall he practice and begin to monethe in time / and
learn to correct with discretion and love / now to be roughe and sharp /
then to be merciful and soft / all in time and in good ordir to keep them in
subjection / fear and learning Then must he learn to bear the weakness and
siknes of wife childerne and servants with other visitacio^s of god as loss
of goodis / death of his childerne or wife / with other infinite aduersites and
common karis of matrimonye. This thought Paul to be a schole and introduction
into the spiritual cure of an hole paresshe. But at this schole were never our
prestes and bishopes / but rather brought up in courtlye welthe and lust etc.
They have formed and reformed many years al other states and other mennis
liuinges / until now they their self ar so far out of frame / that no state
or ordir has more need of reformacion then they their selves. And the word of
God that should reform their enormites: they will not suffer it to come into
light: but god for his mercy redress this wiked state. Amen. It is not so
long a go since chaste matrimony was forboden the prestes. For at the counsel
of Nycene (when they had wives) where they would have first separated and
divorced them from their wives There rose up an holy man and confessor called
Paphnucius (look in the decrees. 31. distinct. and in. 2. lib. Ecclesiasti
tripartite history Epiphanio scholast interpret cap. 14) which man said
stiffly age^ste it / affirminge that wedlok was honorable for alme^ and that
it is chastity / a man to hold hi^ to his own wife. And thus persuaded he the
general counsel / that they should not lay siche a burden upon any men /
affirminge it to be grevouse. Which should be the occasion of fornicacion and
adultery both to them that were then married and to their wives. These words
spoke Paphnucius in the presens of all the counsel: notwitstondinge yet he him
self was no married man. And the counsel commended and allowed his sentence /
and decreed nothing as concerning that matter at that time / but left it in
every man's liberty: but since that time the church as they say has
forboden them to marye. Here may you se that other that counsel did a miss
and erred in approuinge it lawful for the^ to have wives or else the church
that did forbide it: but the counsel can not err (say they) wherefore then the
church erred that decreed the contrary? Of the which Church thus prophesied
Paul in the. 4. Chapter of the first pistle to Timothe saing / that in the
later days some should depart from the faith / geuinge head to sprites of
error / and to the deuelleshe doctrine of men spekinge lies through hypocrisy
/ having their conscienses marked with a hot yerne / forbiddinge to marye /
and co^maundinge to abstain fro meats which god created to be received with
geuinge thanks etc. Thus may you se how lively Paul did set forth your
Church militant here in earth in her own colors that forbo^e matrimonye and
meats etc. ye and of what sprite she is governed / and whose doctrine she
felowethe. Oh good God / how many souls have they drawn with their selves to
hell by this one law of forbydinge man and woman to marye? What burnings /
what concupiscens and unlawful lusts / have this Synagoge of Satan caused and
compelled to reign and to be ^aryed about in there persons hartis day and
night / that would marye and may and dare not? ye what adultery (...) with
other vnclennesses follows upon this deuellesshe doctrine and law of
forbidinge matrimonye? And yet thought they if couetu^^^^^ and ambiciouse
dominion were not the cause^ to have institute and set up a more pure
spiritual state and ordir then ever God made. But the holy fruits of their
spiritual ordninaunce declare the gostly author. your brother Celerer (say
you) asked me wherefore the Church militante ordened that the ministres of it
should not have wives or concubines as well now as then / unto the which
question you feign an answer in my name like as you feigned the interrogacion /
for if he had asked me any sich question: I would have denied his false
suppositio^ / for before this deuelesshe ordinance they had no co^cubines but
lawful wives. and the answer that you feign is impertine^t to siche a question.
^^^^fore if I should have answerde him demaund^^ (...) why the church milita^t
ordined that they should have no wives / I would have said / because they
thought to have a better avauntage by their co^cubines then by their wives /
and because matrimony is more co^bres and kareful / then to live with a another
mannis wife or with an hoar / who^ he may forsake and take a another when he
lusts. But you thought you letters should never come to light and therefore
you writ your pleasure.

But God at last shall ask a rekeninge wherefore his holy sacrament first of
al institute is now forboden and despised / wherefore they presone and torment
prestis that marye. As verily as the blood of Abel cried and obtained
vengeance / shall the blood of other good men vexed and slain / obtain the
same to fall upon these persuers and sheders of like innocent blood for
kepi^ge of goddis co^maundeme^ts.

Vvheter a lay man may hear co^fessions.
POwertly / you say that my opinion was / that every lay man may hear
confessions. Sir I am not remembered that ever I had any communicacio^ with you
of this matter: but if I had: I think I said not that every lay man / but some
lay man / and that aftir this form which Christ prescribes in the. 5.
chapter of Mattheu / preferring love and co^corde al sacrifices / as if a man
has offended his brother and aftirwarde touched with repentance go to him
knowleginge his offense desieri^g him of forgeuenes reconcylinge each other: do
not this lay man that hears and forgeueth him hear his confession and
absolve him? Also if a man has any grugge and inquietnes in his conscience by
the reason of sin committed that evermore troubles and fereth him of
damnacion / and this man cannot be quiet and confortetd ne have any peace in
his heart and assuerd how and by what meani^ he may have that suer forgeuenes
/ which is th^^^ faith in Christ / without the which no conscience may be
suer and at rest from the face of sin and da^nacion / of the which quiet
rest Paul speaks to the Romans in the. 5. chapter / saing. Because we are
justified by faith we are at peace with God through our lord Jesus Christ etc.
and because there are now so many blind curatis that know not this sovereign
remedy for sinful and unquiet co^sciencis / but rather damn it for heresy
and persecute it. If sich a troubled conscience (I say) go unto a discret
learned lay man for wa^te of o learned priest (as now thanked be god there are
mo lay men that know this salve then prestes) for counsel and conforte /
shewinge him his grefe and decease desiering his counsel and prayer: does not
this man aftir James mind sainge. Confess or show your sins to each other
/ and pray one for a another that you may be saved? Then say you that your
brother cel^rer said that it was lawful but in time of great need. Verily I
never see greter need then even now to feche this wholesome and sweet salve that
is to say / that only faith in Christ's death justifies and set our hartis at
rest at the lay man or woman: the prestis for the most part ar so ignorance
/ so proud and so maliciouse that they had lever persecute this sauinge health
of ma^nis soul / then to receive it and minister it to their s^k flock. But
these two manner of co^fessions presuppose a penitent and a contrite heart
hombled and unfeignedly confessed before god. Of the which manner of confession
David speaks in the. 32. Psalm / aftir the Hebrew compte in the. 5. verse: I
said / I shall confess my ungodliness which is agenste me to the lord / and
even strait thou forgauest it me. Nether is it Goddis law that mennis
consciencis shuldbe clogged with tellinge of al their sins that ever they
have done in to a prestis care: which is impossible for any man to do. When
David says Psalm. 19. Who may attain to the knowledge of his sinful nature?
Which Jeremy cap. 17. confirms sainge. Shrewed and unable to be serched is
mannis heart. Who can noumbre and tell al his sins with so many circumsta^cis
as the Popis law prescribes us? and yet his disciples teach us and preach
that we can have no forgeuenes of our sins / except we confess them into
their ears. Which doctrine not only vexes not a little many a good simple
conscience: but brings many for fear and shame into desperacion. If no sin
be forgeuen with out it be rehearsed and told them in their ears as they
teach us / the^ shall we never have quiet co^nsciencis. For we commit full
many and they to / which we can nether see nor remember. Also it is no small
iniurye to Christis blood to attribute the forgeuenes of our sins (as the^
teach) to the self confession. When it is only faith in goddis promise
through Christis blood that brings us forgeuenes of our sins and gives us
rest and peace in our consciencis Roma. in the. 5. Chapter. And yet to stable
she their combrouse confession they are not ashamed to abuse the holy scripture
changing the truth (as Paul says to the Romans in the first Chapter) in to
a lie / taking for them this place of Mattheu in the. 8. Chapter / where
Christ commanded the man healed of his leprye to go and show him self unto
the priest. Which place makes plain agenste them. For the man was hole and
clean both body and soul before he bad him go for his faith first had
purified his heart / and then Christ healed his body / for Christis cures
were perfect in healinge the hole man. Now this man healed / Christ bad him
go show him self to the priest / he had him not go and shriue him self to
the priest. He had him go show his skin and body For the prestis office was
to judge and to decerne whether the leprye was gone or not / and to dispose the
offringe for the cleansing of the sore / and to have a good portion thereof for
his duty / as ye may read Leui^ci in the. 13. and. 14. Chapter / and as the
terte following in Mattheu declares / if you would diligently note it and
confer the law and the Gospel to gither and remember that Christ said he
came not to break Moses law / but to fulfill it. Christ therefore would not
defraude them of their duty / nether be prejudice unto their office / lest
they should have accused him of breakinge of Moses law / for they honted for
siche occasions fast enough to bring him a way / and therefore he had the
man now healed go show him self to the priest that the priest might have his
privilege in the judgment of the cleansing of the leprye / adding to this
commandment / that he should offer the gift. that Moses commanded to be
o^fred (for this was that morsel that the couetuouse priest gaped so gredely
for) and Christ would not the priest to be disapoynted of his proye / adding
also these words. In to a testimony to themself / that is / to testify to
the prestis hartis / that although they ho^ted to take him as breaker of Moses
law / yet here in this cure they might well see hi^ observe it into their own
co^demnacion / if they did other wise accuse hi^ as any transgressour thereof /
as they did not with standinge at the last / their own consciencis witnesinge
agenste them. And even of the violent wrestinge and false interpretinge of this
one text to serve for our spiritual belyes and their ambiciouse impery men
may gather and see plainly many other placis and textis of holy scripture to
be like wise perverted and torn in to their tradicions. But God avenge and
deliver once his pure holy word from the captivity of these pestelent
skorners and gloriouse glosing hipocritis. Amen.

Of pilgrimages and worshipping of Images.
THen you say that I would have men in derision that went on pilgrimage / for
what cause it came not then into your mind / look and you can call the cause
yet into your mind / and who told you this / for I can tell you full well /
and who co^spired with you to observe me and to write my sainges and to
co^ceyue siche secret letters / but the lord will se to it and avenge Exo. 5.
Sir I mocked the^ not / but he that sits in heaven has the^ in derisio^. It
is the lord that scornethe the^ Psalm. 2. and that worthily because they
forsake him the living god alone for all sufficient / and ever ready to help
all that call upon him in faith and verite / and will run aftir strange
gods / into hills / wodes and solitary places / there to worshipe stocks
and stones / ye and pataue^ture to do worse things) of man's making. Are not
these men to be laughed at / or rather to be lamented / that may and ought to
worshipe god at home in their chamber / and yet will farsake / wife / childerne
and household (whose presens they behoue) and spend both body and goods in
long and wearye trauelinges to fall down and worshipe a stock or a stone
made with mannis hand? Are not these the people scatred so broad through all the land of Egypt to seek chafe? Exodi in the 5. chapter. Read the second
precepte as it stands Exodi in the. 20. chapter / read the law / the
Prophets and the new testament / and look how grievously God threateneth
these godgoers and saint sekers that should have but one God / him only to
honor and to serve / as Christ testified in the. 4. chapter of Mattheu / and
that in spirit and truth even at home in their hearts. Stand it not written
Exodi in the. 22. chapter. He that offers to any Goddis / that is to say
unto any image / save unto the lord only: let him dye with out redemption? He
abhorred strange gods so sore / that he forbade his people to name them /
Exodus in the. 23. Chapter. Hear what I say says in the.65 chapter: I have
stretched forth my hands all this long time paste unto a nation that forsakes
me / and seeks strange gods / which nation gothe not the right way / that
is to say not aftir my mind and commandments. Which nation exaspereth and
angreth me being present / and yet go they forth / to offer in groves and
wodes / doing sacrifices there at autares of stone / sittinge and knelinge by
toumbes and shrynes / sleaping in chirches full of images: let the schole men
excuse this falling dome before Images kissinge of their fete / kneling /
praing / holding up of hands / steking up of candles / and geuinge them gifts
/ etc. calling for their help in sikenes and perel making their vows unto
them. Let them cloak their worshipe with Dulia and Hyperdulia and yet shall it
be Idololatria / when they have made the best for them that they can. God will
not be worshipped with our inuencions / but as he him self has commanded he
forbode even the making of Images. For he se that they should steal a way his
worshipe. Thus said he Isaie in the. 42. chapter: I am he that is called the
lord: which give not my glory to any other creature nether yet my praise to
any karuen Images. Except you be ashamed of your stocks and* Idols in wodes
and hills / in whom you delighted and leave your groves and gardens / which ye
chose for your selves / you shall be like oaks whole leaves fall a vaye and like
a garden with out water. For the glistering glory of these Images shall be
turned into stubble / and the makers of them in to sparks of fire / and both
of them shall be burnte up to gither noman quenchinge them Isaye in the first
chapter. Read him also in the end of the second chapter. And hear what the
Prophet Baruch says of these Idolotres in the. 6. cap. Th^yr gods verily
have golden crowns upon their heads / from whom the prestes fetch gold and
sil^er and bestow it upon their selves. Also they give of the same gold and
Iwels to hores and make ^aye their harlettes their with / and aftir that these
harlettes have o^^rede them agene / they re^^^ave them and deck their goddis
with the same. And yet are not these goddis clean from rouste ^^wormes /
although they be kouere^ and dect with purple they must wype a way the duste
from their faces / for their houses ar full of duste etc. Read the. 44.
Chapter of Isaye.

AT last you put your most Reuere^de father in mind for forgeting / saing:
But I beseech your lordship that no creature may know that I / or any of mine do
show you of these thi^gis / for the^ I shall lose the favor of many i^ my
country etc. Oh yuel fauourde oules / backis / and night ravens that thus
fear the light. O negociu^ perambula^s in tenebris O preuey p^yson walki^ge in
derkenes. Fered you men more then god? Had you lever lose the favor of God
then of men? Is this the zele you bare to gods word? Had you lever let it lie
still strangled with heresy then you shuldbe disclosed and lose the favor of
me^? What Christian man would with draw you his favor for avenginge gods
truth from heresy? These ar the godly spiritual that take so great pain in
persecuting / presoning and putting to death with so great labors and study the
poor innocent souls and members of Christ for the pure zele they have to god
and to his word: secretly they dare acc^^se / but not openly / In d^rkenes
dare they stand and shoteforthe their arows dipped in venom / but not in the
light. They think to make the truth a liar which says in his gospel: there
is nothing so secr^etly done but it shall be disclosed. But it is your own
glory your own honor and idle belis ^uste tha^ you seek and ^ont for so
gredely / and not to deliver Gods truth from heresies / for it is his trwe
worl^ and the very lively me^bres of his poor chirch that you yet persecute so
cruelly. Which abominable blindness if you will not know and repent you at so
many daily exhortacions / warningis / and thretening is by Goddis own word
both in Latin and in Englisshe so merciful offered you: look for no another but
the vengeance and wrath of god now hanging over your headis / shortly to be
powerd down ^^pon you. Plages daily ar sent into your kingdom / and even the
Popis head which is Antichriste is now broken / Babylon is fallen in deed / and
all her karuen and graven goddis ar braste against the ground. I say in the.
21. chapter. Fle you therefore out of Babylon and let every man save his life.
Jeremy in the. 51. chapter. For there are many thingis that threten an heavy
fall and change to your Popish kingdom. The^ lord of powrs has decrede to
abate the pride of all stoutenes / and to pluk down all the great gloriouse of
therthe. I say in the. 23. chapter. It is the word of God (I tell you yet
agene) that they and you persecute so cruelly. It is Christ who^ you fight
agenst invayne so vlindely / and it is the breath of his mouth / that is to
say his almighty word that shall destroy you. But wherefore would you not
that any creature should know that you accused me? Verily Christ declares the
cause in the third chapter of Johan saing. Men loved the derkenes more then
the light because their workis were evil / for every man that both evil hates
the light / nether comes he to the light / lest his werkis be reproved. God
be praised / which like as at the beginning he drewforth the light of derkenes
/ now causes the truth to comforth through your false opinions and letters.
Amen. your spiritual father was negligent in kepinge your letters. Maledictus
^omo qu^ confidit in homine: and carnem facit brachium suum. Jeremy in the.
17. Chapter.

Now (Master Priour) if you can declare your opinions otherwise and confirm
them by holy scripture truly and purely vnderstonden: show forth your mind
in the name of God / and I shall gladly make answer again there unto: but in the
mean ceason (as right is and besemeth every christian) I submit this my
answer to your letters unto the tyrall of Boddis word and to his chirch that
can and will judge it aftir the scripture by the spirit of God / Qui miscreatur
and benedicat tibi. Iliuminet vultum suum super te / vt cognoscas in terra viam
suam / and in omnibus gentibus salutare suum. Amen.
