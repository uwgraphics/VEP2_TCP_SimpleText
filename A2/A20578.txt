TO THE READER.
Courteous Reader,

I Present unto you here two children, the one whereof has an Author
unknown; The other a Father deceased; Both Infants; both Orphans; and both so
like, as if they were Gemini horoscope uno. The Law enioynes you to keep them;
and their descent deserves it: If you keep, and cherish them in their
infancy, the Law by whose letters of commendations they are committed to your
tuition, will keep and preserve you and yours, your persons, goods, and good
names from violence, depredation, and detraction, unto posterity. Case them in
what fashion you please: And put them into what livories you like best; They
are both so seasoned, that no weather can alter their constitutions: And both
so solid that no test can disrepute their perfections; Indeed they were
intended for general good. For he that will calculate their Nativity, shall
by a true Judicial find in either a plentiful promise of public profit and
fundamental fabrique both of the study and use of the Laws of this Realm. It
is a duty we owe to the known Author though deceased, and a charity to the
Author whose modesty conceales his name, to communicate to the general what
was so collated in their particular, and so legaterily provided for their
common behoof; which not as proximiores sanguinis, or proper executors of the
will of the deceased, but as creditors to whom the administration of their good
intentions for the public is committed; we do now publish and commend to all
Students in the Laws, and others which shall desire to enable their judgments
in this kind.

In praise of the work.
AS after pain in digging of the Mould,
Long time is spent in seuering the Oar
From the mixed earth; at length refined Gold
Is by the Artist wrought, by which his store
Is much increased and the common good.
So by this Book if rightly understood
And prised at full worth, the Reader may
Observe the Authors labor, who has drawn
From the deep Mass of Law, an easy way
To make the Student perfect; and does pawn
His credit on it, Perusers may be bold
To show it for he knows the Touch will hold.
W. T.

Another.
When Critics shall but view the Title, they
Will carpe at this great Enterprise, and say,
It was too boldly done, thus to comprize
In a small Volume, Law, and a true size
To set upon it; but the learned will
Excuse his little Book, and praise his skill,
His aim being only to instruct the youth,
Not to control the Judge, or wrong the truth:
For he well knows, Cases with time may change,
And that prove common which before was strange.

ARISTOTLE in the first book of his Topickes expressing the means, whereby in
every faculty or science Intellectual, resting upon discourse of reason, Men
might abound in matter apt for Argumentation, and might be furnished with copy
of Reason fit for the proof or disproofe of things called into debate, in such
the sciences by them professed, expresses a fowrefold observation,

1. Quarum vna (as he says) est in propositionibus Arist. Top. lib. 1. cap.
12. 13. 14.
eligendis.

2. Altera in distinguendo quot modis quicquid dicatur.

3. Tertia in differentijs inueniendis.

4. Quarta in similitudinis cognitione and scientia.

All which are notable instruments of knowledge, greatly profitable, yea
necessary for the obtaining of all such sciences as do depend upon reason: and
so consequently much auayleable to be observed in the study of the Laws of
this Land, which are grounded upon the depth of Reason, and invested often
times by the name of Reason, in our Reported Cases, and ruled Authorities of
the same: 11. Hen. 7. 24. b. 13. Hen. 7. 23. b. Com. Colth. 270. b. Com. Brown.
140. b. 27. Hen. 8. 10. a. Montague.

Of which four Principles, purposing (for direction of study) to say somewhat,
in order, as they are before proposed.

It is to be considered that the first of them being Propositionum electio,
contains the Election, choice observation, and collection of all received
Principles, Propositions, Sentences, Assertions, Axioms and Reasons, importing
either certainety of truth, or likelihood of probability.

Wherein first Aristotle gives precepts to collect them, and then after gives
counsel, so to digest them, as that they may at all times be ready for our
use.

Wherefore hereof intending an ample discourse, it shall be requisite to
follow the ordinary and best Method, by Definition, Division, and the due
speculation of their Causes, whereby may be manifested what they are, of how
many kinds they are, the diverse manners of collection of them; and lastly, the
end, scope, and use, whereunto they tend, and the profit ensuing by observation
of the same.

That first therefore the names, by which in our Law they have usually been
called, might be made manifest before their nature be discovered (Primo enim
de nomine conveniat) it may with little labor easily appear, that sundry are
the titles or names given in the volumes of Reports and other writings of the
Law, unto such propositions as do remain as reasons of resolved cases.

Sometimes they have been called Grounds, See Grounds.
in the 30. Hen. 8. 44. b. Dyer numero 30. it is said, Est une auter Ground in
tenure in Chief. S. Il. doet este immediate del Roy; et il convient comencer,
et prend son original creation per le Roy mesme, et per null de ses subjects. So
likewise speaks Read. 5. Hen. 7. 23. b. Est bone Ground in Trespass,
Discontinuance Uide 12. H. 7. 13. a. Davers Com. 121. b. Stamford.
verse un est Discontinuance verse touts, with infinite such other.

Sometime they have been called Maxims; for Maxims.
so says Fortescue in 34, Hen. 6. 33. a. Est un Maxim en nostre Ley, Que in
chacun action personal, le Nonsute del an sera le Nonsutte de ambidoux, fore
prise in tiels cases que sont except per statut. Likewise says Knightley 19.
Hen. 8. 38. a. Dyer numero 51. Est un Maxim, Que un action sera touts foits
conceive ou le plus meliour trial, et notice del fait poit este conus; et
specialment lou de tort est personal, with diverse such like.

Sometimes they are called Principles, for so in the Principles.
8. Hen. 74. a. it is said, that it is un Common Principle, que Terre (S.
Estate de frank tenant) ne pas sans Livery de seisni. Likewise says Sanders in
the Com. Colthurets Case 28. b. Il ad este temis come Principle, (...)
Que quand un fait Livery de seisni que son Livery Vide Com. 345. a.
sera pris plus fortment verse luy.

Sometimes they have been called Eruditions. In Eruditions. Vide 14. Hen. 8.
28. a. Pollard 24. Hen 8. 40 Dyer. nu 66.
such sort says Keble, in 11. Hen. 7. 15. a. Ceo ad este un erudition, Que le
party navera Capias ad satisfaciendum, mes ou Capias gift in l'original. And
some in 29. Hen. 8. 40. a. Dyer numero 66. says, Justices 3 Ed. 4. 7 a. Lit.
Vide 33. Hen. 6. 54. a. 44. Ed. 3. 34. b.
Il est une Common Erudition, Que in cel County lou le tort commence, l'action
sera port.

Moreover, sometimes for their firmness they Laws positive.
have been called Laws Positive, for so speaks Belknap. 2. Rich. 2. Fitzh.
Account 45. Il est ley positive, Que home navera damages in breve d'accompt.

Sometimes they are invested by the title of Law it Laws.
self; for in such manner it is said Tempore Ed. 1. Fitzh. Grant. 41. Lex est,
cuicunque aliquis quid concedit, concedere videtur, and id sine quo res esse
non potuit. And so Bracton says, 9. Hen. 6. 59. b. lay prise pur ley, Que si
home plede un plee et preigne un protestation; Vide 9. Hen. 4. 59. b. Paston.
et puis son plee est troue encounter lay, il naver unque advantage de son
protestation. Of which manner speech there are manifold examples.

So that be they named Grounds, Maxims, Principles, Eruditions, Laws
Positive, Laws, Rules or Propositions, or by whatsoever other name they be
called, let us now seek the nature of them by their Definitions.

Paulus the ancient Roman Lawyer thus defines a Principle or Rule of law:
Regula Iuris, rem quae est, Li. 1. F. de Reg. Iuris.
breviter enarrat. etc.

If we do respect the original thereof together (...). Colth. 17. b.
with the effect it yields; Morgan in the Commentaries of Plowden, thus
defines it: A maxim is the foundation of Law, and the conclusion of Reason:
for Reason is the efficient cause thereof, and Law is the effect that flows
therefrom.

Such of the Civilians as in the description of a Rule of Law, Do only
respect the manner of the Collecting of them, from particular cases or
circumstances do thus affirm: Regula Iuris est multorum Prateus de Reg: Iuris
lib. 6.
specialium per generalem conclusionem brevis comprehensio. Or as Ioachimus
Hopperus in his first Ioach. Hopp. de Iuris art 371. a.
book de Iuris art, though disagreeing in words, yet one in the sense with
the former; Regulae Iuris sunt quaedam coniectiones tantum, and breviaria ex
pluribus speciebus in unum per commune aliquod collecta. Another of them in
this manner, Regula est sententia Sim. Shardius Lexic. Iuris Regul.
generalis, quae ex plurium legum mente a Iuris consultis notata atque
animadversa, paucis verbis summam earum consentionem and tanquam harmoniam
complectitur.

Matheus Gribaldus in his first book de ratione Matheus Gribaldus l. 1. c. 7.
de ratione studij Iuris.
studij cap. 7 says, Regulae Iuris nihil aliud sunt quam breves and
compendiosae sententiae ex pervagatis definitionibus perstrictae, quo and
minori labor discantur, and facilius diutiusque memoria teneantur.

Notes collected out of Authors.
Regula Iuris est plurium conpendiosa narratio, and Paulus lib. F. de regula
Iuris.
quasi causae coniectio.

Nec absimile est quod Grammatici dicunt, eam esse multorum similium
collectionem.

In summa autem est, ac si quis, praedictis cum verbis Ant Masae de exercitio
Iurispr. lib. 1.
Archid. did. 3. c. Reg. coniunctis, ita diceret, quod Regula sit compendiosa
definitio; seu cum Quintiliano universale, vel perpetule praeceptum diversarum
rerum, quasi sub una eademque causa cadentium, universitatem complectens.

Est Regulanihil aliud quam plurium rerum and specierum Ioach. Hopperus de
Iurit art l. 2. so. 469. a.
in unam quasi summam coniectio.

But binding our selves to no prescript rules of Art, for the better
understanding of the same, we may describe a Rule or Ground of Law thus: A
Ground, Definition,
Rule, or Principle, of the Law of England is a conclusion either of the Law of
Nature, or derived from some general Custom used within the Realm,
containing in a short Sum, the reason and direction of many particular and
special occurrences.

As touching the division thereof, we shall better Division.
observe how many Principles and Grounds there be, by the due consideration of
their causes from whence they spring.

Non solum ea quae insita sunt causae dicuntur, sed De causis. Arist 11. Met.
c. 4. T. 23.
etiam ea quae extrinsecus sumuntur: ut id quod motum affert and efficiens est.

Causarum quatuor sunt genera. Arist. l. 2. Them. c. 11. To. 11.


1 Vnum est forma atque essentia rei.

2 Alterum est in quo inest necessitudo non absoluta, sed ex adiunctione; si
alia quaedam sint, haec esse necesse est.

3 Tertium genus est id in quo inest rei efficiendae vis primaria.

4 Quartum est finis cuius causa aliquid fit.

Nam ad interrogationem factam per verba, propter Ant. Masae de exercitio
Iurisperitorum l. 1. p 38. b.
quid fit aliquid, nihil aliud unquam respondetur, quam aliqua exdictis quatuor
causis: Inter quas tamen, finis est potisstma, and quasi aliarum causa: Materia
enim non esset causa, nisi haberet formam; and forma itidem nisi ab agente
introduceretur; Agens quoque nen ageret nisi moveretur a fine; finis autem ipse
immobilis permanet: Est ergo primum movens, and prima causa, etc.

All causes of every thing are either
Internal or External.
Internal are the causes
Material
Formal.
The external causes are the
Efficient
Final.
As touching the Material cause, matter, or subject Material cause
wherein these grounds are conversant, the same are all those things, whereof
debate may rise between parties iudicially: which are as well divine as
humane. Insomuch as Iuris prudentia, or the knowledge of the Law, is Divinarum
humanarumque Blacton lib. 1. cap. 4. 4.
rerum scientia. And hence proceeds it, that all Grounds or Rules of the Law
of England in respect of their matter which they do concern, are either such
as are not restrained to any one proper or peculiar title of the Law, but as
occasion serves, are appliable unto every part, title, or tractate of the Law,
as by the view and due consideration of examples following may be made
manifest; All which, being either conclusions of Natural reason, or drawn and
derived from the same, do not only serve as directions and Principles of the
Law, but are likewise as Positions and Axioms to be observed throughout all
man's life and conversation; having their original from those Arts that are
necessary and behoofull for maintenance of humane society.

And first of all concerning the Art of Logic; Grounds borrowed out of
Logic.
from thence the learned of our Laws have received many Principles, as well
out of that part which concerns the Invention of Arguments, as of that which
teaches the disposing, framing and the Judgment of the same.

From the first part these may serve for example.
Idem non potest esse Agens and Patiens. 14. H. 831. a. b. 28. b. 8. 10. b. n.
37. Dyer. Com. 213. b. Com. 323. b.


Omne maius continet in se minus.

Magis dignum trahit ad se minus dignum.

Frustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora. 9. Hen. 7. 24. a.


Turpis est pars quae cum toto non convenit. With Com. 161. a.
many such like, etc.

From the Judicial parts of Logic, these and diverse others.
Qui negat confuse, negat confuse and distributive. 2. Rich. 3. 7. a.


But how that saying may be understood, and in what sense it may be intended
true, and in what not, peruse the case of 4. Hen. 7. 8. a. touching the travers
of a suggestion of breach of the peace: (where although the said Rule be not
mentioned, yet the meaning thereof, by the case there debated is partly made
manifest) Moreover Brian borrows the Sophisters verse, and makes it a Ground
to try whether an issue tendered be an express Negative or no, in 11. Hen. 7.
23. a.

Prae contradic. post contrar. Prae postque Subalter.

This likewise is derived thence, Negativum nihil implicat.

Out of natural Philosophy these with diverse other are deducted, that follow.
VIS vnita sortior. Grounds borrowed out of natural Philosophy.

Vltra scire non est esse with many other of like quallitie.

Out of Moral Pihlosophie.
FRom whence, as from a Fountain, all Laws Grounds borrowed out of Motrall
Phylosophie.
do flow, we do observe these few following for an example; As

Qui sentit Commodum, sentire debet and onus. Com. 244 a. 14 Hen. 8. 6. a. Com.
501. a. 13. Hen. 8. 16. a. 14. Hen. 8. 16. a. 14. Hen 8. 8. a. Com 160. b. Com.

prospiciat, vtilis est.

A vero non declinabit Iustus. Com. 48. b.


Quod tibi fieri non vis, alterine feceris, with many more such like.

Out of the Civil Laws there are also very many Axioms and Rules.
Which are likewise borrowed and Grounds borrowed out of the Civil Law.
usually frequented in our Law. For since all Laws are derived from the Law of
Nature, and do concur and agree in the principles of Nature and Reason: And
since the Civil Laws, being the Laws of the Empire, do bewray the great
wisdom whereby the Roman estate, in the time it most flourished, was
governed: Since likewise the Law of this Land has always followed best and
most approved Reason (which is also a type of humane wisdom) it does ensue of
necessity, that great Conformity must be between them. Which Conformity may
be made apparent partly by these (among some thousand Axioms and Conclusions
of Reason) following.

Qui tacet consentire videtur.

Vigilantibus and non dormientibus Iura subueniunt. Com. 357. b. 5. Hen 3. 222.

With others in manner infinite, written and published in the Latin tongue.

In the French also many other grounds there are in our Law, to befound
agreeable in sense and meaning to such as are frequent and usual in the Civil
Laws, and there published in the Latin-tongue, whereof also these following may
serve for example.

With many others to like purpose, if place did permit or cause did require to
observe the same: Yea many times when as no ground or Rule is expressed in our
Law, but that we may only Collect Cases Concurrent upon some Conformity of
Reason: We shall find in the Civil Laws a Proposition or Rule which shall
most aptly and most fitly express the same Reason in such shortness of
speech, as nothing shall seem more sufficient in that respect. And unto the
which Propositions such as are or may be framed by us in the French, cannot in
excellency be worthily Compared.

As touching the Canon Law. Forasmuch as the Grounds borrowed out of the Canon
Law.
studies both of the same and of the Civil Law, are in sort conjoined by the
professors of both what may be said of the one, in this respect, may likewise
be verified of theother: Which as well by view of the title De Regulis Iuris in
Sexto Decretalium, as also in diverse other titles of the same Law, especially
in such as are most usual for matters of debate in this Realm, as are those
of excommunication, Marriage, Divorce, Legacies, Tithes, and such like will at
large appear.

Finally many Grounds and Rules of the Laws Grounds derived from use, Custom,
and Conversation of men.
of this Realm are derived from Common use, Custom, and Conversation among
men, Collected out of the general Disposition, nature and condition of humane
kind: which Grounds are of two natures. The one observed out of Humane
actions, the other out of usual and ordinary speech.

(Principia externa proprie vocamus ea quae in Communi hominum vita versantur
and ab experientibus and prudentibus animaduertuntur. Ioh. Hopper: de Iuris
art.

Haec non tam ex ipsa hominis natura quam foris adueniunt, debent que non ex
mente hominis aut animo, sed ex Communibus vitae moribus longo vsu and
tractatione colligi. Ibidem Haec sunt igitur illa quae dico externa Principia,
quae ex communibus vitae vsibus and mortbus diligenter in historia obseruatis
decerpuntur, quae que non tam ordine describi, and Literts mandaeri, quam long
a tractatione colligi, and per manus tradi possunt. Ibidem.

Of the first sort are these and such like following.
Home est tenus destre procheni a soy mesme. Com. 5: 5. a. Paramour. Manxel. 6.
a. b.


Le inclination de touts homes est de fair ou parler chooses pour lour gain

Hallsc^s. 8. Hen. 6. 19. b. Per. Martin.


Quant home est party, ilne poet esse Judge indifferent a luy mesme.

With many other of like quality, which the intendement of the Law deriueth
and collecteth out of the usual Condition nature, and quality of things upon
the probability and likelihood of occurrences often or for the most part
happening and falling out.

Axioms or Propositions of the second sort, are Prouerbiall Grounds.
Prouerbium vulgo interpretatur probatum verbum, cum dicatur quasi Commune
omxium verbum. Prouerbia vero citata, instar iurium baberi tradium est. L.
solent. F. de officio Procurat. Sim. Sbardius Lexicon Iuris. Com. 280. a.
drawn from the phrase of speech, and deduced from the ordinary manner of
Conference by talk among men most usual in all places, As are the Common and
ordinary Proverbs and Prouerbiall assertions, and such like; the which, as
well by reason of their ordinary and often use in talk; as also for their
probability and likelihood of truth, have been sometime used as Axioms,
Principles, and Grounds of the Law; and are to be found confirmed with many
Cases, having been used as reasons in the same: Whereof these few ensuing may
serve for example.

Da tua dum tua sunt; post mortem, tunc tua non sunt.

Qui ambulat in tenebris, nescit quo vadit. Com. 173. a.


Necessitas non habet Legem. Com. 18. b.


As good never the whit as never the better. 29. Eliz 356. a.


Let him that is cold blow the coal. 14. Hen. 8. 23. a.


One to beat the bush and another to take the birds.

With many other such like speeches, which although they are of small moment,
being every where ordinary; yet nevertheless for the perspicuitie and
plainenesle, they have heretofore, at some times, in Law arguments been used,
and fitly applied in debate of cases (although not ad probandum, yet ad
illustrandum) and so likewise may at any time hereafter, upon like occasion
offered, without blame be frequented.

Although these general Positions, Maxims and Rules proposed, and such like,
cannot be properly reduced (as is aforesaid) under any one peculiar title of
the Law extant in any abridgement, table, or directorie; yet nevertheless may
they be brought under general titles or common places, to be framed of
purpose, As hereafter in place more convenient shall be declared.

And thus much therefore of general Grounds or Maxims.

Now follows to speak of such as are to be reduced Maxims appliable only
to one title.
under one particular title, tractate or matter of the Law, serving to no other
use, but only do concern the said special matter, and cannot be
transferred thence, neither may properly serve any other then their native
place, unto the which they are wholly and alonely to be referred: As for
example.

every title of the Law of like effect.

These special Grounds are of diverse sorts: for The diverse kinds of Grounds
which do concern one title.
some concern the very nature and essence of the title: some the consequents
and incidents annexed thereunto. Those which do concern the nature of the
thing, do flow from some of the causes thereof, as the Material, the Formal,
the Efficient, or the Final. Some from the general notion; others from the
special difference; and some do proceed from the effect. Those which do
proceed of the consequents, concern either the Incidents inherent and
inseparable, or the adjuncts and such like.

Which Grounds so drawn, if they be orderly disposed with all their
subdiuisions, and particular Rules, and the same furnished with apt cases, will
make a perfect and exact treatise of such matter as concerns that title,
resembling those treatises compiled, by Littleton, Parkins, Stanford of the
Plees of the Crown, and others of like form.

But in this place not intending to combine any Arbitrament.
such Grounds as do concern one title or matter, or thereof to endeavor to
draw a type of any perfect treatise, it shall be sufficient at this present,
for example only, to express that which is here meant, by the disposing of
some few Grounds of the title of Arbitrament, according to the observation
above mentioned, that thereby might be conceived, how such like Grounds
concerning one title or matter do flow from the causes and consequents of that
title, whereunto they are applied; and that a coherency of them might be both
found and orderly framed for the more certain obteyning of knowledge in
observing this, or the like course to this hereafter following.

First although we find not an Arbitrament to be defined in any report of our
Laws; yet nevertheless Rastall in the small treatise of the Terms of the
Law, thereof yields this description.

Arbitrament est un award, determination, ou Arbitrament Quid.
judgment, quel plusiors font al request de deux parties almenis, pur, and sur
ascum dett, trespass, on outer controversy ewe perenter les dits parties. But
more artificially it may be described out of the Civil Law thus:

Arbitrium est Arbitri sententia sive Iudicium inter controvertentes; privato
consensu, non autem publica interveniente authoritate, datum.

Out of the books of Reports of the Laws of this Land this full description
may be drawn.

An Award is a judgment 8. Edw. 4. 1. 8. Edw. 4. 10. a. 21. Edw. 4. 39. a.
given by such person or persons as are elected by the parties unto the
controversy, 9. Edw. 4. 43. b. Fairfax. 16. Edw. 4. 9. a. for the ending and
pacifying the said controversy. 8. Edw. 4. 10. a. 19. Hen. 6. 37. b. Askewe.
according to the comprimise and submission. 19. Edw. 4. 1. a. and agreeable to
reason and good conscience. 19. Hen. 6. 37. a.

Touching the Etymology or notation of the The Etymology.
names thereof, it seems to be called an Arbitrament, because the Judges
elected therein, may determine Ex boni viri Arbitrio. Or else perhaps because
Ex libero Arbitrio suo, of his own accord. It is called an Award of the French
word Agarder, which Loueday, for the quiet and tranquillity that should ensue
thereof, and for the ending of the cause which is wrought thereby.

The Material cause whereabout it is conversant, The Material cause.
is the controversy, which

1 First may be either action, suite, quarrel, or demand; and the

2 Second that, concerning duty or demand, either personal, real or mixed, or
every of them.

The Formal cause is, the form and manner of the The formal cause.
Award, or the yielding up of their judgment, according to reason, intent and
good meaning.

The Immediate efficient cause, is the Arbitrator The efficient cause.
or Arbitrators.

The Mediate efficient cause, is the comprimise or submission, and the parties
at variance, being also parties to the submission. Wherefore for the more
brevity we will discourse of every of these last recited, when we shall
discover the power of the Arbitrator.

The final cause, is both to appease The final cause.


1 First the debate and variance so risen between the parties, and
compremitted; and also to reduce

2 Secondly that which was before uncertain, unto a certainty.

So that by these you see, that those five things which are found to be
incident to every Award, viz.

1 First matter de controversy.

2 Submission.

3 Parties al submission.

4 Arbitrators and

5 Render sur del Judgment, spoken of in 4. Eliz. Dyer 217. a. are here reduced
into a methodicall consideration of the causes of every Award, seeing indeed,
they and no other are the very causes of the same.

The Genus or general notion of the former description, Genus.
is, that it is a Judgment.

The special difference whereby it is distinguished Differentia.
from other Judgments, and expressed in the said description, is, that it is
given by Judges elected by the parties, and not by coertion of the Law.

The effect is, when it concerns any payment of The effect.
money, to alter, change and make the controversy transire in rem iudicatam,
and thereupon to give action for the sum awarded.

If it do determine any collateral or other matter 2
then payment of money to be made or done, then is it not compulsary to
constrain the parties to perform it; but every of them is restored to his
former action. Except the comprimise or submission be by deed; and so therein
it rests wholly upon that security by bond, covenant, stature, or
recognizance, by the which the parties comprimitted themselves.

The Adiunct, is the performance thereof and the The Adiunct.
manner how, which whether the Award be performed or not, it makes nothing to
the nature and substance of the Award it self. But nevertheless such
performance of the Award is a requisite consequent annexed to the consideration
of the nature of an Award.

These the general causes of an Award thus considered; next follows the
consideration of the Grounds that flow from every of them.

From the Material Cause which is the Controversy, Material cause
these Grounds or Rules are deduced.

In Real matters quo Concern frank tenement, Real Matters
Arbitrament ne lia, le title, ne done ceo. 14. Hen. 4. 19 a.

In matters of Realtie which Concern freehold, an Arbitrament does neither
give title nor bind the right.

These with diverse other grounds, do proceed, as we have said, from the
Material Cause or Controversy.

There rests now to speak of such as do proceed Formal Cause.
from the Formal Cause.

Every Award, as touching the form thereof, ought to have these four
qualities.

1. First that it be not of a thing impossible to be performed by the parties.

2. Secondly, that it doc not ordain matter unlawful to be done.

3. Thirdly, that the same Award agree with Reason and with good meaning.

4. Fourthly, that it be sensible, full, and perfect in understanding.

As touching the first.

This Ground is also General: Wherefore it shall be expedient to divide it by
the particular Circumstances of cases unto more especial propositions,
together with their several Exceptions to be set down in manner following.

Thus much touching the Matter and form of Arbitrements and the Axioms,
Grounds and Rules deduced from the same: Wherein we have not expressed every
Rule that might be found in the books or collected thence, tending hereunto
Neither are these Axioms or Propositions here put down, furnished with all
those cases, that mighe be thereunto applied. For, not intending to express
the type of any treatise of this title; but only a Methodicall Abstract or
Directorie, that which is here exemplified in part may be sufficient to
express our meaning before declared. But to proceed.

The Efficient Causes, and the Rules drawn from Efficient Cause.
the same do: come next to consideration.

The first whereof is the Arbitratour. Of whom the Author of the Institutions
of the Canon Law Johannes Paulus Lancelottus. Arbitrator Quid.
gives this description. Arbitri dicuntur proprie, qui (nullam potestatem
habentes ex lege) consensu Litiganttum in Iudices eliguntur: in quos
compromittitur, vt eorum sententiae stetur.

Out of the books of the Common Law, a description of an Arbitratour may be
thus Collected.

Vne Arbitratour est Judge private, esle^ per les parties. 9. Edw. 4. 43. b.
Fairefax. 16. Edw. 4. 9. a. Feneux. 19. Hen. 6. 37. b. Askew pur appeaser les
debates enter cux. 8. Edw. 4. 10. a Billinge. Et de arbitrate et adiudge
selonque lour bone intent. 19. Hen. 0. 37. a. Paston.

Sithence in the Award it self, the Law requires such qualities, there has
not bin made many nor scarce any question, who may be an Arbitratour and who
not: Neither (considering what has been said touching the form of an Award)
should it be greatly necessary. Therefore we will proceed respecting in the
Arbitratour these three things.

1. First his Ordinance, from whom it is.

2. His Authority, what it is.

3. His Duty wherein it Consists.

Touching his Ordinance, he is ordained by these Ordinance.
two things.

1. First by the Election of the parties. 20. Hen. 6, 41, a.

2. By his own undertaking of the Charge. 8. Edw. 4, 10, a.

Billinge.

Touching his Authority, what it is. Authority


1. First it is derived from the Submission; and extends no further.

2. Thereby he is a Judge between the parties.

3. And therefore he cannot transfer his authority over to any other.

Touching his Duty, it consists in these three. Duty.


1. First to hear the grief of the party.

2. To judge according to equity.

3. To notify their Award.

First therefore concerning the election of the Arbitratours by the parties to
the Controversy Election of the Arbitratour.
(which ought likewise to be parties to the Submission) there is first of all
to be considered, what persons may by the Law submit themselves to an Queux
persons poient eux submitter al agarde.
Award made by others, and what persons cannot.

And therefore,

Si vne des parties submitt luy a vne Arbitrament Deputy.
dune part, et Depute del auter part in nosme del dit auter party:
Arbitrament Sur ceo fait per enter eux, semble bon. 4. Eliz. 217. a. 60.

Le Baron poet luy mesme submit al agard pur luy Baron and feme.
et sa feme pur chattells des queux il adle disposicon in droit, et per reason
de sa fem, et ceo Liera la feme. 21. Hen. 7. 29. b.

Si enfant submit luy al vne agard, il sera lie de ceo Enfant.
performer cy bien come home de plein age. 13. Hen. 4, 12, a. 10. Hen. 6. 14. a.

Si diverse dune part ont fait tort a un auter, and cesti Ascuns des parties.
a qui le tort est fait, et un de les auters submit eux al agard, de cest agard
fait les auters nient parties al submission aueron advantage in extinguishment
del tort. 7. Hen. 4. 31. b. 20. Hen. 6. 12. a. 20. Hen. 6. 41. a.

Si diverse del une part submitt eux mesmes al agard Joint et several.
de certain persons, and diverse del auter part: Les Arbitratours ont power de
fair agarde pur matters enter eux ioyntment, and issint pur matter enter eux
seueralment. 2. Rich. 3. 18. b. vide 21. Hen. 7. 29. b. Com. Dalton. 289. b.

Si diverse del une part and de auter submit eux al agard Ascunes des parties.
del une, que fait agard perenter ascunes dune party, and ascunes del auter
party et nemy perenter eux touts, and ne parle rien en son agard des auters,
uncore tell agard est bone. 22. Edw. 4. 25. b.

Thus much touching the parties that do submit themselves unto an Award, and
which make an election of the Arbitratours. Now follows Undertaking the Award.
that somewhat be also said as touching the undertaking of the charge of the
said award.

Si le Arbitratour protest, que il ne voile meddle Del parcel.
ave tout ceo que est commit a luy ou conteyne en le submission ou sil fait
agard tantum del percel, le agard est bone 19. Hen. 6. 6. b. 39. Hen. 6. 11. b.
Prisot, cont. 4. Eliz. 217, 60. 7. 1. Eliz. 243. b. 52.

Mes si le submission soit per fait condicionalment Parcel.
que le dit guard soit deliver deuant tiel iour: une Arbitrament de percel nest
bone 4 Eliz. 217. 60. 7. 8. Eliz. 243. b. 52.

Mes uncore, si le submission soit que ils estoieront al Parcel.
agard des Arbitratours de tout le chose comprimit ou fait pur ascun percel de
ceo: donque le Arbitrament est bone pur parcel. 39. Hen. 6. 11. b.

And thus much has been said of the taking upon them of the charge of the
Arbitrament.

Now rests it likewise to speak of the Authority of the Arbitrators
themselves: which is, as before is declared, grounded upon the submission.

The submission or comprimise therefore out of the Civil Law, is thus defined.

Compromissum est simultanea illa partium promissio, Compromise on submission.
qua sua sponte, ad alicuius boni viri Arbitrium suam remittunt controversiam.

Submissions are in two manners, either by writing or by word.

These that are by writing, are either by obligation, or by covenant.

Which obligation is either of Record, as a Recognizance, or by deed between
the parties.

And this Submission by writing, or by word is either absolute, or
conditional, so that the Award be delivered by a certain day, or such like.

Wherefore inasmuch as the authority of the Arbitratour is deduced from the
submission, it follows that,

Le Arbitrament que est fait de chose inent contain Nient contain in
submission.
in le submission, est void, 7, Hen. 6, 40, b. 19, Hen. 6, 38, b. Forsc. 9,
Ed. 4, 44, a. Chock. 19, Ed. 4, 1, a. Neele. 7, 8, Eliz. 242, b, 52.

Mes si le submission est de chose personales Arbitrators Nient contain in le
submission.
poient agard, que un des parties fera act que est de chose real in
satisfaction del personal tort. 9, Ed. 4, 44, a, Brian.

Si le submission soit de chose real, les arbitratours Real.
poient agard satisfaction deste fait de chose personal, 9, Ed. 4, 44, a, Brial.

Si les arbitratours agard, que un des parties fera Estrangler.
act al estranger, come feofment, ou tiels sembles, tell Arbitrament est void,
22, Hen. 6, 46, b. 17, Ed. 4, 23, a, Catesby. 19, Ed 4, 1, b, Brian. 5, Hen. 7,
22, b.

Si le submission soit dune chose, le Arbitrament Incident.
poit esse fait de chose incident a ceo. 8, Hen. 6, 18, b. 19, Ed. 4, 1, a,
Chock. ver. 9, Hen. 7, 15, b, 16, a.

Upon this authority given to the Arbitrators by the submission, to deal in
manner as aforesaid, in things touching the same submission.

It ensues also secundarily, that

Le Arbitrator est un Judge perenter les parties, 19, Judge.
Hen. 6, 37, b, Ascough. 9, Ed. 4, 43, b, Fairf. 16, Ed. 4, 9, a, leney. Com.
Fogosta. 6. a.

Wherefore likewise it ensues that the Arbitrator being a Judge cannot
transfer that his Judicial authority to any other.

And therefore,

Si le Arbitrament soit, que les parties estoiera al Arbitrament Estranger.
dun estranger; ceo nest bone agard, 47, Ed. 3, 21, a, Cont. 8, Ed, 4, 10, 11,
a.

Mes si l'estranger ad sait un Arbitrament deuent Estranger.
perenter les dits parties, le Agard pur estoier a tiel Arbitrament del
estranger est bone, 39, Hen. 6, 10, a, 11, a.

Mes si le Arbitrament soit que les parties performera Estranger.
le Agard dune auter deuant sait perenter mesmes les parties, lou in verity
nest ascun tell agard: uncore cest Arbitrament est bone prima facie tanque soit
nostre que nest tiel agard, 39, Hen. 6, 12, a, Prisot.

Mes uncore si le Arbitrament soit, que une act limit Advice.
per le Agard sera fait per le advise and counseil d'une auter person, tiel
Agard est bone, 8, Ed. 4, 11, a. 14, Ed. 4, 1, a, Chock.

Mes si le Agard soit, que le act sera fait per le Advise Adul^.
del Arbitratour mesme apres le Agard rendu sur tell Agard nest bone, 19, Ed. 4,
1, a, Chock.

Si les parties eux submit al Agard de certain persons, Vmpier.
and sil ne poient agree, donque al ordinance dun auter come umpier si les
Arbitratours font agard de parcel, umpier ne fera agard del auter parcel
remnans, 39, Hen. 6, 10, a, b.

Mes si le submission soit tiel que le umpier fera Agard Vmpier.
del tout ou part, donque il poit fair Agard de cest part, ouesque que les
Arbitratours nauont meddle, 39. Hen. 6. 11. b. Prisot.

Now as touching the duty of the Abitratours. First

Les duties des parties est a vener devant les Arbitratours Duty.
and mre lour grieves.

1 Et le Arbitratour doit eux oir.

2 Et solonque ceo adiudge, ou auterment il nest bone Judge, 8, Ed. 4, 10, a,
Billinge.

Those which affect the Method of Ramus (that is to begin with the efficient
cause, as here, with Arbitratour) rather then that which is usually prosecuted
by the Interpretors of Aristotle (namely to begin first with the matter and
form, which we hitherunto have endeavored to follow) may here add to, the
second part of the duty of an Arbitratour (that is, to that which has been
here said of this Judicial Authority and Judgment) as much as has been
before, first of all, showed by us, touching the Material and Formal causes
and the Grounds and Rules incident thereupon.

But nevertheless, to proceed with our intended enterprise, touching the third
part of the duty of an Arbitrator, viz. the publishing or notifying of his
Award, It is to be considered that the publishing or notifying of an Award is
either provided for and ordained by the submission it self; or else it is left
and permitted to the discretion of the Arbitratour.

If it be provided for, by the submission; for the most part it is in this
manner, that either the same Award made be notified to the parties, or some of
them; and that, either by a certain day or time, or else without limitation of
any time.

As concerning therefore the delivery of the Award, their is to be noted; that
where such provision is made of notification by the submission, that then;

Arbitrament nest Arbitrament deuant que il soit Pronounce.
pronounce. 8. Edw. 4. 21. b. Chock.

Hitherto has been said of such matters where the Arbitratours have executed
their Authority without controull of the parties: But if, before any Award
made, their Authority shall be Lawfully Countermanded. Then does there remain
in this place to be considered.

1. Whether such Countermaunds be permitted by the Law.

2. And in what Cases not.

3. And also in what manner the same is to be done.

Wherefore

The last cause of the four before remembered Regule a causa finali.
being the Final Cause (that is) the end and scope wherefore men do submit
themselves unto the Arbitrament and Award of any person, consists upon two
things.

1. Chacun Arbitrament est a fair final determination and de appeaser le
strifes, debates and variances Final determination.

2. Chacune Arbitrament est a reducer chose incertaine A reducer incertainetie

4. 6 a. Hankford. 4. Hen. 6. 17. b. Weston. 10. Hen. 7. 4. a.

Thus much has been said as touching the Causes.

Now as concerning the Genus or General Notion in the former definition of an
Arbitrament, It is to be considered, That

Chescun Arbitrament est un Judgment. 8. Edw. Judgment.
4. 1. b. Fairefax. 8. Edw. 4. 10. a. Ieney. 21. Edw. 4 39. a. Vauasour.

Because the special difference used in the said former definition of an
Award, was this, That it was given by Judges elected by the parties and not by
Compulsary Jurisdiction of the Court, thereof enseweth, that

Il est diversity lou home est Judge per authorite Intent del Arbitrator.
del ley, and per Election del party mesme: Car Judge de Record ne doner
Judgment verse les parties, sinonque ils sont appells deuant eux per process del
ley: Mes autrement est dun Arbitratour que est Judge per enter les parties. 8.
Ed. 4. 2. a. Illing sworth.

Of this also ensues, that whereas every Judgment of Record shall be executed
literally, according to the warrant issuing out of the Record, upon and for the
executing of the said Judgment; Yet nevertheless.

Chescune Arbitrament doit este expound et intend Intent.
accordant al intent des Arbitratours, and ne my Literalment. 17. Edw. 4. 3.

Mes si l'intent des Arbitratours ne estoit oue la ley: Intent.

agree ove le ley. 21. Edw. 4. 39. b. Fairefax.

The Causes of an Arbitrament being thus deciphered, there follows next the
Consideration of the effects thereof.

The Effects of an Arbitrament are these which do ensue.

Thus much has been spoken concerning Arbitrements, their Causes, Effects,
and Consequents.

There rests to accomplish our intended Method, that we add somewhat
touching that wherewith an Arbitrament is compared, matched and resembled in
the Book Cases.

Wherefore know you that,

Chacun Accord resemble un Arbitrament. Paria. Differentia.


Uncore Chacun Accord doit este satisfy oue Recompense; et Accord ne done
Action; leu del auter part Arbitrament pur que les parties sont adiudge de
paier deniers, done action; and ne besoique dests pledc, execute come deuant ad
apparus. 6. Hen. 7. 11. b. 5. Edw. 4. 7. a. 17. Edw. 4. 2. b. 17. Edw. 4. 8. a.
Com. 6. a. Fogassa.

And thus far forth for example sake, have we set out these Grounds and Rules
of Arbitrements.

Whereunto if there were added, in their due places, the residue of the Rules
and Grounds which may be collected out of the books of the Law concerning the
same, and furnishing both these and them with as many Cases as might be applied
thereunto; the same Cases being put at large under every of their Rules, to
demonstrate that in particular, which the Rule includes in general, the
enterprise would prove (as I think) some show of a Treatise, concerning this
Title.

Which being no hard thing to accomplish, thereby would appear that it were
neither impossible neither unprofitable, nor altogether unpleasant, to reduce
every title of the Law particularly to a Method; and so consequently, the
whole body thereof into a perfect shape, which now seems wholly without
Conformity, and altogether dismembered.

Wherefore now, as touching the Material Cause of Rules and Grounds, thus much
said, may suffice.

Formal Causes and Grounds of the Law.
THe divisions of Grounds of the Law, as touching and concerning the form, are
in sort to be Considered. 1. First, the Coherence of the words and the Matter.
2. Secondly, the manner of the Manifestation thereof.

For the Coherence of the Matter and words, there are to be regarded these two
qualities.

1. First, Verity and

2. Secondly Amplitude or Generality.

Verity of Propositions or Grounds consists of two sorts: For they import
either a necessary or known truth which cannot be impugned: Or Contingent
Verity or Probability, which may sometimes notwithstanding their show of
truth, be impeached of falsehood, and so be subject unto many exceptions:

The former of these are called Primarie Conclusions of Reason. And the later
Secondarie Principles.

1. Those of the first sort are such general assertions of the Law, as are
imprinted in the mind of every Man, and discerned by the light of very Nature
it self: which, as most certain and undoubted, need no Confirmation or
fortification, but of themselves are most sufficiently known to be true and
not impugnable: which the Philosophers do call, Primo and per se cognita;
Communes animi Conceptiones and Notitiae, familiar to the Conceit of every
person.

Of which sort for Example are some of them before mentioned, and here again
to be remembered in this behalf, in manner following.

Volenti non fit ininria

Qui sentit Commodum sentire debet et onus:

Fraus et dolus nemini patrocinantur.

With infinite other in universal Manner proposed, and with not a few in
special set forth, As in Grants, as before has been declared.

In Testaments.

Testamentum est morte confirmatum. Com. Griesbr. 180. b.


In Rents.

Chacun Rent est issuant horse de terre.

With exceeding many other of like nature to be found in every title or
Tractate of the Law. The manifest truth and great Reason of which said Grounds
is evident to every person of any Judgment, and need no proof for
demonstration and establishing of them.

2 Secondary Principles, are certain Axioms, Rules, and Grounds of the Law,
which are not so well known by the light of nature, as by other means: and
which although they need no great proof to be confirmed; because they
comprehend great probability; yet many times are they, at the first show, not
yielded unto without due consideration: and are peculiarly known, for the most
part, to such only as profess the study and speculation of Laws.

Probable they are said to be, because, although Probabilia sunt qua probant,
autoribus, aut plurimis aut certe sapientibus atque ijs vel omnibus vel
plurimis vel ijs quo rum spectata est and perspecta sapientia.
the manifest truth of them be unknown, yet nevertheless they appear to
many, and especially to wise men, to be true.

And of this sort in the Laws of the Realm there are so many found, that some
men have affirmed, that all the Law of the Realm is the Law of Reason: because
they are derived out of the general Customs, and Maxims, or Principles of
the Law of Nature Arist. Top. l. 2. c. 1. Doctor and Student l. 1. c. 5. fol. 1
c. a.
or Primary conclusions.

And for the knowledge of these Propositions there is a greater difficulty; and
therefore therein depends much the manner and form of Arguments in the Laws
of England.

Notes collected touching the difference between Primarie and Secondarie
Principles.
PRincipia immediata quae in demonstrationibus Arist. l. 1. c. 2. T. 5.
accipiuntur, in duo genera distribui possunt. Vnum little quae quanquam
demonstrari non possunt, non tamen ita aperta, and per se manifesta sunt, ut
necesse sit ante cognita esse ei qui artem aliquam discere velit, quae nos
Positiones appellamus.

Altero genere continentur ea, quae ita sunt per se perspicuae, ut non possint
non esse, omnibus multo ante cognita, and perspecta quam quicquam doceatur;
quae Pronunciata dicuntur.

To like effect speaks Aristotle in another place, Ea pro initio and
proposito sumenda sunt.

1 Quae in omnibus.

2 Vel certe in plurimis rebus inesse videntur.

The former sort Aristotle seems to call, as before showed, Pronunciata, the
other Propositiones.

And although in the Law of the Realm, they are indifferently called, without
distinction, Rules, Principles, Grounds, Maxims, Eruditions, and such like:
yet the judgment of Massaeus herein is worthy observation.

Accursius videtur non parum aberravisse a vero, Ant. Massaeus l. 1. de
exercitio Iuris peritorum.
cum idem significare voluerit Principia, Maximas, and Regulas; cum (Aristotle
auctore) cuiusque scientiae principia sunt quaedam propria, quae quod vera sint
non contingit demonstrari, and quae per se, and non per alia fidem'habent,
quoniam nihil prius superiusque in ea scientia est per quod confirmari
explicarique possint.

Talium autem Principiorum, nonnulla sunt positiones, alia dignitates, sic
dictae, ob id quod iure illis fides habenda sit, cum ea unusquisque audita
statim admittit: quale est istud: Totum unumquodlibet maius est aliqua sua
part. Hae rursus appellantur Maximae, Propositiones, and Communes animi
conceptiones; quod muliorum scilicet intellectu facile percipiantur. Tales
autem nonsunt Regulae; quae licet sint universalia Praecepta, indigent tamen
probatione, and probari possunt: Nec tamen auditae admittuntur.

He seems to attribute the name of Principles, Axioms, and Maxims to the
first sort, and the name of Rules to the second.

Of the secondarie Principles or Rules there are two kinds. Some deduced and
drawn from the usual and ordinary disposition of things (as has been before
declared) and by the observation of humane nature dispersed in the minds of
men, collected by long observation: Whereof some are altogether vpheld in the
Law upon common presumption, and entendment: Others do rest upon discourse of
Reason deducted in Argument. But of the former, some are such, as although they
are but probable, and import no certain truth, and therefore may
notwithstanding be sometimes untrue: yet nevertheless for the great likelihood
of them in humane actions, and the better to frame a conformity, through the
whole body of the Law, the said Laws permit no allegation to impugn them, or
any speech or auerment to impeach their credit.

The first sort of Secondarie Rules grounded upon entendment.
OThers there are also that depend upon entendment: But of the former kind,
this is one, grounded upon natural affection.

La ley ne voit presume que ascun voit led son heir, Com. Sharington and
Pledal.
ou auter que est procheni de son sanck, mes que il voit plus test advance luy.

Which Ground, upon the presumption of natural affection, is not such, as that
it sounds always true; (for in diverse persons nature works diversely)
Wherefore although this assertion show how every man should be affected,
notwithstanding it is no proof that all men are so affected. And yet
nevertheless this strong entendment of Law, does not permit any thing to
impeach the same; and will not suffer any person bound by collateral warranty
(the reason whereof flows herehence) to trauerse such affection, although
there be never so pregnant proof to encounter the same.

Notes touching the Definition, Division, and necessary Consequents of
Secondary Principles.

Quae etsi plerumque verae sunt, nec valde egeant demoustratione; non tamen

assentiantur, opus est.

See the manner and means how they are inferred by discourse out of the
general Customs or Principles of Reason, and the example thereof used by the
Author of the Dialogues of the Doctor and Student.

Presumption or Entendment of Law, whereupon certain of the secondary Rules
are grounded (as before is showed) are in two sorts: for species presumptionum
sunt duae: una, quae legitimis probationibus regulariter refutari potest, quam
commune^ licebit Ioach. Hopp. de iuris art lib. 2. sol. 466.
appellare: altera quae reprobari non potest, quae and specialis recte fortasse
dicetur. Certe magno Reip. bono constituuntur huiusmodi praesumptiones: nec
potest Ibidem.
fieri ut sine praesumptionibus ulla certa iura aut ullae certae leges
describantur.

Secondarie Principles are grounded either upon Entendment of Law, of which
sort some are such as do admit of no proof to encounter them, and rest upon
Entendment, but yetadmit proof to the contrary. Or discourse ofreason.

So likewise the Law upon like common presumption conceived of the acts and
behavior of men, intends this Principle.

Null bome sans cause voile fair act a prejudice ley Com. Mauxel. 6. a.
mesme.

And hereupon the Law presumes that eucry assertion and allegation proceeding
from any person which sounds to his prejudice and hurt, is so undoubtedly
true, as that there shall not be suffered any trauers or denial of the same.
Wherefore if in a Praecipe quod reddat brought of twenty acres of land against
one, and he, before the Stature of Conjunction feoffatis, had pleaded
Ioyntenancy with another of deed; or sithence the said Statute, if he had
pleaded Ioyntenancy by Fine with another; although the Piea be utterly false,
yet shall not the demaundant have any answer or trauers thereunto; because
that when the demaundant by his Writ has admitted him Tenant of the whole; and
he says that he was Ioyntenant with another; this other, if he be false,
may stop the Tenant by this Record; To say the contrary of his affirmation, and
thereby may gain the Moytie of the land, against him that has so pleaded. And
therefore, for that, that men are not wont to tell untruths in disadvantage of
themselves; and that the saying hereof if it were not true, will greatly be to
the prejudice and hurt of him that affirmed it; thereupon the Law presumes,
that it was true indeed; and will in no wise admit the trauers against the
same, or give the demaundant ability to impugn it; but hereupon presently,
the Writ shall abate, and no maintenance of the Writ for the cause aforesaid,
shall be allowed.

In like manner also matters of Record the entendment of Law does give an
impeachable credit. And hereof also this rule of Law is drawn.

Matters de Record import in eux (per presumtion delley, pur lour hautnesse)
credit. Com. Ludford 491. b.


And therefore none shall be permitted to say, that the Kings Pattent under the
great seal was made or delivered at any other time then that wherein it
bears Date. No more then a man may say, That a Recognizance or Stature
Merchant or Staple, was acknowledged, or any Writ was purchased at any other
time, then that wherein it bears Date. For an auerment that it was antedated,
or that it was delivered or acknowledged after the date, is an auerment tending
to the discredit of the great seal, or of the Justice of Officer of Record
which recorded the Recognizance, or the Statute Merchant, or such like.

In the dealings and affairs of Men, one Man may affirm a thing which another
may deny. But Lamberts Justice of peace. lib. 1. cap. 13.
if a Record once say the word, no man shall be received to auerre; speak
against it; or impugn the same: No though such Record contain manifest and
known falsehood, tending to the mischief and overthrow of any person.

And therefore whereas certain persons were 38. Ass. 21.
Outlawed in the Kings bench, in the time of Shard Justice, and their goods
forfeite, and their names likewise certified into the Exchequour with an
Abstract of their goods, It happened so that the name of one (by misprision of
the Clarke) was, among the rest certified likewise into the Exchequour, as
outlawed and that he had goods to the value of six pounds, whereas indeed
the same man was not outlawed. And thereupon a writ iussued to the Sheriff of
that County, where the said goods were supposed to be, to seize the same to
the use of the King, who returned that a Nobleman had seized the same goods;
And thereupon issued forth another Writ out of the Exchequour, to cause him to
answer the same goods so seized by him, who upon the Return of the second
writ, alleged, that the party whose goods he had seized, was not vtlawed:
And Green, one of the Justices of the Kings bench came into the Exchequer with
the person who was supposed out lawed, and there testified that he was not
outlawed; but showed, that that which was certified was done altogether by the
misprision of the Clerk: Where Skipwith returned him this answer. That
although all the Justices would now record the Contrary, that they could not
be permitted nor any Credit might be given thereunto, whenas there was a Record
extant, and not Reuersed testifying the same Out-lawry: yea the Law so mightily
vpholdeth the intended Credit of a Record, that it prefers the same before
the oaths of men, sounding to the Contrary, and in respect thereof, will not
permit a verdit to be received, which might impeach the same.

And therefore whereas one brought a writ of wast 9. Hen. 6. 56. b.
and assigned the wast in diverse particular things, and moreover in a Message
and Tenants in Wood-Church; where amongst other wastes assigued, the Plaintiff
showed, that the Defendant had done and permitted waste in the Hall of the said
Messnage, etc. The Defendant pleaded in this Action, that Woodchurch was a
Hamlet of A. and no Town of it self. Which Plea includes a Confession of the
wast to have been done in such manner as was declared. And upon this plea, the
parties were at issue; with the which the Jury were charged: And further it
was given them in charge, that if they found that Woodchurch was a Town of it
self, and no Hamlet of A: as the Plaintiff had supposed, that then they should
assign damages severally for every waste Committed. The Jury at length found,
that Woodchurch was a Hamlet of it self, and assessed damages for certain of
the particular wastes supposed severally, as they ought. And as touching the
wast supposed to be done in the said Hall, they said there was no such
Message. The Judges rejected their verdit, because it was contrary to that
which was employed by the Plea of the Defendant of Record: and so enforced the
Jury to give damages for a wast: which (indeed) was not done contrary to the
Conscience of the Iuries; notwithstanding that some of them made protestation,
that in so doing they might be perjured: Which wholly was done only to uphold
the Credit of the Record; and that the verdit (of Record) might not be
contrary, to that which was employed by the Plea of the parties.

Moreover, there is a Rule of Law wholly grounded upon Entendment which is this.

Livery del fait sera intend in le lieu cu le date fut.

The delivery of a Deed shall be intended to be where it bears date.

Which Rule the Law vpholdeth for certain truth, (although in very deed it may
be at sometimes untrue) And therefore will not permit any proof which may
impeach the intended truth, of the said proposition. For Confirmation whereof,
a notable case Cited in the 31. Hen. 6. and by way of Argument 31. Hen. 6. Com.
Fogassa. 7. b.
alleged in Fogassa his Case, may be produced; which was in this manner. An
Action of Debt was brought upon a Deed; The Defendant denied the same;
whereupon the parties were at issue; And the witnesses produced to prove the
Deed were examined where the Deed was delivered: who answered: At York; which
was in another County then where the said Deed bare Date; And hereupon the
Desendant Demurred: And after upon Consideration, Judgment was given against
the Plaintiff in overthrow of the Action founded upon that Deed; which cannot
be intended to be delivered else where then at the place where it bears Date.

Many Examples may be further produced to like effect, to prove that diverse
Rules there are received in the Law which upon presumption and Common
Entendment, to eschew some notable mischief or inconvenience, are so holden
for Truth, that in no wise they shall be incountred; although indeed, as
occasion may fall out, they do contain manifest and apparent falsehood. But
these already in that respect alleged may abundantly suffice for example.

Of like nature also there are in the Law other The Second sort of Secondarie
Rules grounded upon Entendment.
kind of Rules or principles; which although, they do concern contingent
matters; and therefore may sometimes be impeached, and found untrue; Yet do
they carry a kind of Credit also upon Presumption or Entendment of Law,
although not so vehement as the former.

Wherefore although the Law does receive them Prima facie, and at the first
show, as likely, and gives Credit unto the Assertion contained in them, Yet
Nevertheless does it admit proof to the Contrary, and so suffers such
Praesumption or Entendment, which vpholdeth such Rules, to be impeached, and
controlled by a Contrary trial by pregnant proof, and so does permit any
Auerment to be made against the same. For Example: It is a Rule in Law that a
Verdict sera intenda touts 20. Hen. 7. 11 b. Coningsby.
foits vray tanque il est reuers pur ceo que il est issint troue perferment de
12. homes.

A verdict shall be intended always true, till it be reuersed, for that it is
so found by the oath of twelve men.

And hereupon it is agreed for Law, That if a 5 Hen. 7. 22. b.
Judgment be given erroniously, the party grieved thereby shall not only,
have his writ of Error to redress the same, but also a supersedeas to
Countermaund Execution thereupon. But if Judgment be given upon a verdict
although the same verdict be untrue, and the party greiued do bring his writ
of Attaint, Yet nevertheless he shall not in that case have a Supersedeas to
stay Execution, for the intended truth, which the Law supposes in the said
verdict. And yet the Law permits the falsehood in verdicts to be laid open,
and punishes them with great severity 33. Hen. 8. 196. Brooks case. 4 Edw.
6. Com. 49.

If a Writ of Conspiracy be brought against one, 20. Hen. 7. 11. b. Coningsby.
for that he gave evidence before the Justice of Peace at their Sessions,
concerning the suspicion of a Felony supposed to be done by the Plaintiff, upon
which Evidence, the Plaintiff was indicted of the said Felony; and after found
Not guilty by a lurie of twelve Men; It is no plea in this writ of
Conspiracy, for the Desendant to say, that the Plaintiff was guilty of the
Felony, For that were to encounter the Verdict; which shall be intended true.

And although the Law do give Credit, to all verdicts; Yet does it not
foreclose the party greiued thereby, but permits him to impugn it, and to
impeach it of falsehoode, if he can, by his writ of Attainct.

Also there is a Rule in the Law, That

Feesimple ou auter estate certain convey a un sera Com. Wrotsley. 193. b.
intend de continuer in le person in que il est repose, toats foits durant
mesme l'estate.

An estate of inheritance or other estate certain conucied to a man, shall be
intended to continue in the person wherein it was reposed always during the
Continuance of the said estate.

Although this for Law be Prima facie intended true; yet nevertheless
thereunto this must be added viz.

Sine soit mre Comment auterment ceo est deuest.

If it be not showed otherwise how it is devised.

By thus much said, it is sufficiently made manifest, that some propositions,
Rules and Grounds of the Law are intended true; but yet proof is allowed to
encounter the same.

So hither to has bin spoken of the Verity of Propositions; whereof some are
indeed and nature manifest true, and grounded on necessary Reason; and other
some are true also, but upon matter contingent. Contingent verity was said to
be of too kinds. The one grounded on common Presumption and entendement of the
Laws, which like wise was subdivided into two branches. Some of them such as
do not admit any Contradiction to impugn them; For the certain supposed
truth (though indeed not always found, in them, yet always deemed by them)
allows no Control; The other sort of Rules resting upon Entendement, are
such as are Prima facie supposed true, but yet no otherwise supposed true then
till the contrary be proved, and they impeached of false-hood: Of both which
there has been showed sufficient examples.

Now therefore in order follows the second The second principal kind of
Contingent Propositions.
principal part of Contingent Propositions or Grounds framed upon observation
of Nature, and disposition of things, collected and drawn by discourse of
Reason, because it cannot be equally evident to every Man's capacity. And for
as much as the said Discourse and manner of Reasoning, through the weakness of
Man's understanding, and difficulty of the matter, may fail and be oftentimes
deceived in some Circumstances which may and daily do occur through the
variety of particular matter, which again (in Reason) may offer a Contrary
resolution; Therefore are those Grounds not universally true, but subject to
many and manifould Exceptions. And yet nevertheless true in all such Cases as
are not comprehended under those Restraints or Exceptions. Of which kind we
mentioned some in the beginning; As namely.

1. Sublata Causa tollitur Effectus.

2. Qui tacet Consentire videtur.

3. Quod initio non valet, tractu temporis non conualescit.

4. Quando duo Iura in vno Concurrunt, aequum est ac si esset in diuersis.

Every of which many other of the like nature; though they be of themselves,
upon the first view of great Probability; yet nevertheless, being with more
earnest Consideration pondered, are found not so firm as they seem, but are
subject to some controulment, and to be impeached with sundry instances and
Exceptions. Of such like the number is in manner infinite: at the least many
thousands in our Law, which are published in the French.

Nest Loial pur ascun de enter in le terre del auter 12. Hen. 3. 2. b. Eliot.
sans son license.

It is not lawful to enter in another man's ground without License.

Descent de Estate dinheritance in terr, toll le entry de ceste que droit ad.

The descent of an estate of inheritance in Lands takes away his entry which
has right.

But these few shall suffice in this place for an Example.

Wherefore for as much as the Mind of Man is beautified with two faculties or
powers in quality different, though flowing from that which is in Nature
indivisible; whereof the one we now call for distinction sake (Capacity) and
the other (Discourse).

By the former of which we apprehend, as with the in ward eye, the natural
light and resplendency of many Primarie Propositions, and known Motions; whose
clearenesse and evidence causes every one to yield thereto their consent.

And by the later we do Collect, reason, argue, and infer of those former
Motions and Resolutions, certain Secondarie Propositions descended and derived
from the first, as branches from the Root, or Rivers from the Fountain; which
by how much the more they are drawn from their sping, by so much the more (by
reason of the variety of interposed Circumstances) they are oftentimes
obscured and made less clear and evident.

And since that every Science is not of like Certainty, by reason of the
variable condition of the subject Ethice vero supponitur quasi morali
scientiae, qui tractat de moribus.
whereupon it is imploved; so that rightly of Moral Philosophy (consisting
wholly of man's changeable and inconstant conversation, and from whence indeed,
the knowledge of all Laws are in Bract. l. r. c. 1. 4. b.
a generality derived, and thereto to be referred) said, the Philosopher
Aristotle right well in excuse of his Arist. Ethic. l. 1. c. 3.
purposed Method in the delivery of the same, That Doctrina discernens honesta
and turpia, tantis dubitationum fluctibus concutitur, ut multis lege tantum and
opinione, non natura, constitutum esse ius videatur. It follows me thinks,
of necessity, that it is scarcely possible to make any secondary Rule of Law,
but that it shall fail in some particular case: whence springs this often
used assertion, Non est Regula quin fallat: And therefore the Ordainers and
Interpreters of Law, respect rather those things which may often happen; and
not every particular circumstance, for the which though they would, they should
not be able by any positive Law to make provision.

By reason whereof they do permit, the Rules, Axioms, and Propositions of the
common Law, upon discourse and disputation of reason, to be restrained by
exceptions; which are grounded upon two causes. The one is Equity: The other is
some other Rule or Ground of Law, which seems to encounter the Ground or Rule
proposed: wherein, for conformities sake, and that no absurdity or
contradiction be permitted, certain exceptions are framed, which do not only
knit and conioyne one Rule in reason to another, but by means of their
equity, temper the rigor of the Law, which upon some certain circumstances
in every of the said Rules might happen and fall out: Et omnia been
coaequiparat, as says Bracton. Bracton. l. c. 5.


And therefore the Author of the Dialogues between the Doctor and Student
describes equity Lib. 1. cap. 16.
according to this the effect thereof here mentioned: which is that it is no
other thing, but an exception of the Law of God or of Reason from the general
Rules of the Law of man, when they by reason of their generality, would in any
particular case, judge against the Law of God, or the Law of Reason: The which
exception is secretly understood in every general Rule of every positive Law.
And a little after, in the same place affirms, That equity follows the Law
in all particular cases, where right and justice requires, notwithstanding
that the general Rule of the Law be to the contrary.

And the exception so framed upon any Rule or Ground to the which it is
annexed, does not impeach the credit of the said Ground; but being included L.
quaesit F. de sando instructio.
therein, as aforesaid, Format Regulam in omnibus casibus non exceptis.

But lest some men might think, that whatsoeeuer is spoken in the said
Dialogues touching equity might be only understood of that equity which either
enlarges or restrains statute Laws (and of which Mr. Plowden in his
Appendix unto the Argument of the case of Eston and Studd, in his second
Commentaries so largely out of Aristotle and Bracton discourses. There
follows in the same place of the said Dialogues, and in the Chapter next
ensuing are proposed two Axioms, Grounds, or Rules, with their exceptions,
there put for example, and which do tend to the purpose and proof of that
whereof we now speak.

And because that those said Rules there mentioned are last of all here for
example before proposed, it shall be requisite first of all to furnish every
of them with examples.

But yet for the better understanding of that which is behoofefull to be known
concerning equity in General, we are to note that every Rule with his
exceptions or (to speak otherwise in words) every received difference in the
Law (being indeed nothing but a Rule or Ground and his exceptions) does either
flow from equity, or else result of the combining of two Rules together, as
before has been declared.

The use therefore of equity is triple in our Law: The triple use of equity in
the Laws.
For

1 Either it keeps the common Law in conformity by means here mentioned.

2 Or it expounds the Statute Law.

3 Or thirdly gives remedy in the Court of Conscience in cases of extremity
which otherwise by the Laws are least vnredressed.

Wherefore as all men endewed with the right use of reason, and conversant in
the knowledge of any Law, must of necessity confess, that every Law does stand
upon permanent Rules, as of Iron not to be bent or broken upon this or that
occasion, or to be infringed upon this or that occurrence (for else there need
no Court of Law, but all should be one with the Court of Conscience, and have
their proceedings framed according to the Arbitrary conceit of the Justice) So
likewise nevertheless, upon every circumstance of time, person, place, and the
manner of doing, there falls out such matter of equity, that if Law should
be pursued according to the settled Rules thereof, Summum Ius (as Cicero says)
would prove Summa iniuria: wherefore Law without equity were rigor. And yet
again, of the other side, if all Laws should change and be controlled as
often in every case as equity would require, then should there be (as
aforesaid) no Law certain. And therefore it stands with good reason, that
the common Law in some cases, should allow and follow equity, as far forth
as the constancy of the Law would permit, and for the better conformity of one
Rule thereof with another: which common Law again in other cases should refuse
equity for the better avoiding of confusion.

Notes collected out of Authors touching exceptions of Rules, and from whence
they spring.
Equity therefore in all the use thereof, and in every of the threefold before
mentioned observations has a double Office, Effect, or Function.

Sometimes it does amplify.

Sometimes again (when reason will) it does diminsh or extenuate.

A description of the former is that which Bracton Lib. 1. c. 4.. 5.
yields, Aequitas est rerum conuenientia quae in paribus causis paria
desiderat iura, and omnia been coaequiperat, and dicitur aequitas quasi
aequalitas. Com. 467


This enlarges the common Law; for it teaches to proceed in the same from one
case to another like thereunto; and so to proceed, that Si aliqua nova and
inconsueta emerserunt, and quae prius usitata non fuerint Bracton lib. 1. cap.
2. (...). 7.
in regno; si tamen similia evenerint, per simile iudicientur; cum bona sit
occasio a similibus procedere ad similia.

And therefore these cases differing never so much in circumstance, so that
they do concur in reason, should be ruled after one and the self same
mannner. For, Vbi est eadem ratio, idem ius statuendum est. But hereof we shall
hereafter have more ample occasion to speak, when we take in hand the last of
Aristotle's, before remembered, observations; namely Similitudinum collectionem,
or cognitionem.

This equity moreover in Satutes enlarges the letter to cases not
comprehended within the words; if nevertheless they do stand in equal
mischief.

Lastly in all cases of mischief, for redress whereof Positive Law or
ordinary Rules of Law are defective; equity extends forth her hand in the
Court of Conscience to help therein the said defect of the Laws.

The second kind of equity does again of the other side restrain the ample
or general rules of the common Laws by ministering exceptions, in like manner
as is before remembered.

And in statute Law it does also limit the ouerlarge letter, drawing it wholly
to, and keeping it within the bounds of the intent and meaning of the makers.

In the Court of Conscience it gives likewise comfort, considers all the
circumstances of the fact, and is as it were tempered with the sweetness of
mercy, and mitigateth the rigor of the common Law; and leaving the inflexible
stiff Iron rule, takes in hand the Leaden Lesbian rule: which being rightly
swaied in cases of extremity, and herein, enioyning the common Law of her
strait proceeding, issues this sentence full of comfort to the afflicted,
Nullus recedat a Cancellaria sine remedio. 4. Hen. 7.


Wherefore if the same equity be used in such cases only as are of extremity
(as indeed it should) it causes the Chancellor, into whose hand the managing
thereof within this Realm is committed to be in high estimation of honor: so
that In eius Cicero in Orat. pro Murena.
sort iuris dicendi gloriam conciliat magnitudo negotij, gratiam aequitatis
largitio; in qua sort sapiens Praetor offensionem vitat aequabilitate
decernendi; benevolentiam adiungit lenitate audiendi.

And thus much by the way has been spoken of equity, upon the occasion of
speech of exceptions which do restrain Rules and Axioms, that the original
fountain from whence such exceptions do spring, might the better and more
manifestly be conceived.

And therefore thus much thereof suffices, reserving the rest to his due and
native place.

Now we will proceed with the first example published in the said Dialogues of
the Doctor and Student, concerning the exceptions attributed and annexed unto
Maxims, Rules and Grounds.

There is says he a general prohibition in the Laws of England; That

It is not lawful for any man to enter into possession The Ground.
or freehold of another without authority of the owner, or of the Law.

This Ground may be proved by many particular cases and authorities: for the
Law of property would that every man's own should be private and peculiar unto
himself; and therefore it is said, That

Nest loyal al un de enter en mon terre sauns mov 12. Hen. 8. 2. b. Elliot.

If I put my horse into your stable, and you will not deliver him unto me; if I
enter and break your stable, I shall be punished for entering and breaking the
stable, but not for taking my horse.

If I command one to deliver you certain cattle out of my Park, it is not
lawful for you to enter into my Park with him whom I commanded to deliver
them: for you may receive them though you stay without the Park.

If I deliver my goods unto a man, I cannot justify the entering into his house

action of trespass.

If a Priest have offerings in a Chapel, the freehold of which is in me, he
cannot justify the entry and breaking the Chapel to take out his offtings.

Garren, et de la emporter.

If a man spring a Pheasant in his own Warren, and let his falcon fly at her,
and she flies into another Warren and there takes the Pheasant, he that
owes the Hawke cannot enter into the others ground to take her.

Having proved the former ground with these sufficient former authorities, let
us now descend unto the examination of such exceptions of the said proposition,
as may exemplify our former speeches; whereof some certain being orderly
delivered and confirmed with some authorities of book cases, I hold it
sufficient so to make manifest our meaning at this present; leaving a more
exact consideration thereof to more fit place and opportunity.

We are therefore to conceive that there is an infallible rule of Law, That

Le Common wealth est deste prefer devant ascun private wealth.

The Common wealth is to be preferred before any private wealth.

By reason whereof lest contradiction between the said proposed rule and this
now in hand should ensue upon some circumstance which may fall out; therefore
the said last specified ground, concerning the benefit of the Common wealth;
does minister an exception for the better understanding of the aforesaid rule
proposed, namely, That

Home poit justify son enter en le franktenement ou The first Exception.
sur le possession de un auter si soit pur le benefit del Common wealth.

A man may justify his entry into another freehold, if it be for the good
and benefit of the Common wealth.

And therefore these cases following depending thereupon are produced to prove
and manifest the same.

For felony or suspicion thereof a man may break a house to take the Felon;
For it is the good of the Commonwealth, to have him taken: With such like.

Moreover because there is another Rule of Law, That

Null prendra benefit de son tort demesme.

No man shall take benefit of his own wrong.

And sometimes it falls out that men, through malice to have others in
danger, would not stick to lay a train to entrap them to the intent, that
they might, by some color, for their further vexation, prosecute suite against
them; To uphold the Conformity of Law upon those two grounds, that one of them
do not encounter the other, there is a second Exception to the former Rule
namely, That

Si home soit le Cause pur que un torcious Entry est The second Exception.
fait sur son Possession, il nauera de ceo Remedy: mes le party que ad issent

If a Man be the cause that a wrongful Act or Entry be made upon his

and he fastneth stakes upon the ground in the water, and builds an house; by
reason whereof the water comes not to the Mill as well as in time past, the
Miller enters unto the others ground and breaks down the stakes, and
thereby the house falls; If the other bring an Action of trespass against
him, for this, he may show that he did it, to avoid wrong done to himself,
and justify the deed.

suffer any Repleauin to be made, but standing in the gate of the Close where
the Cattle were impounded, shot at him that came to make the Repleuin,
whereupon he broke the Close in another place, and drew forth the said beasts:
For which breaking the Plaintifes Close, he brought an Action of trespass; but
upon this matter disclosed it was taken for a good justification.

In an Action of trespass, the Defendant said, that because the Plaintiff
would have the defendant within his Danger, he Commanded one of his servants
to drive the Defendants beasts into the Plaintifes Corn, And the Defendant
as soon as he had notice thereof, entered into the Plaintifes Close and drove
them out; This was taken for a good Plea, and not amounting to the general
issue.

In an Action of Trauerse for entering into the Plaintifes close, the Defendant
justified, for that he ryding in the kings high way, which lay near to the
Plaintifes house, the Plaintiff set upon the Defendant, when he came near
against the Plalntifes house, and assaulted him with bow and Arrows, Whereupon
he forsook his horse and fied into the house, and so through it into his
Close, and after returned into the high way; And this was taken for a good
Justification, if he had showed further that the highway was in the same town
where the house was, and showed in what town the house was, and that the door
of the house was open etc.

Moreover where there is a ground or rule of Law, as has been often before
remembered, That

Hitherunto have we expressed certain exceptions of the fore specified Grounds
which are derived from the reason of some other Grounds and Rules of the Law,
and which reason would should be added, as restraints unto the said former Rule
of Law first remembered for conformities sake, and that the Law no way be
impeached of contrarieties. Now rests also that we deliver some few other
exceptions unto the said general Rule drawn likewise from the fountain of
equity; which are such as do ensue.

Since it were void of all reason and conscience Exceptions ministered by
equity.
that a man should punish a wrong done unto him, by the which he either
sustaineth little or no detriment or damage, or at leastwise more benefit then
he sustaines prejudice: Therefore this exception unto the said general Rule,
is among other likewise allowed for law. That.

Loa le party sur que possession home fait tortions The fist excep tion.
entry est plus benefit per tiel entry que prejudice la home bien iustifiera la
dit tortions entry.

Which the cases following do likewise at large sufficiently confirm.

Justification.

Again, the like equity does minister one other exception of the like quality;
for it were unconscionable and unreasonable that a man should be punished for
a wrongful entry, whereas he is compelled so to do, and cannot without his
great prejudice eschew the same: And therefore it is holden for Law, That

Si home enter sur le possession de un auter, lou il ne The sixth exception.
poit auterment fair sans son grand prejudice, ceo ne sera deem tiel entry de

Si home ad Querck cressant in midds de trois 13. Hen. 8. 16. b. Brown.

And thus much has been said touching the first Ground proposed in the said
Dialogues of the said Doctor and Student, which has been proved in particular
with cases, and thereunto have been annexed certain exceptions which have
likewise been fortified with book cases and authorities whereby the former
assertions have not only been exemplified, but also thereby it does plainly
appear, That almost every disposition in the Laws, de qualitate or de iure is
in conference of Maxims, and rests between the Rule and the exception,
which is either ministered by reason of equity, or upon some other Rule or
Axiom. So that every difference showed between cases, is nothing else but the
Rule and his exceptions; the effect whereof briefly is set forth by Morgan,
who says: That

Maxims ne doient este impugn, mes touts temps Com. Colib. 27. a.
admit mes les maimes per reason poient este confer et compare l'un oue
leauter, coment que ils ne variont: Ou per reason poit este discuss quel chose
est plus precheni al Maxim ou mean perenter les Maxims and quel nemy: mes le
Maxims neunque poient este impeach ne impugn, mes touts ditsdoient este
observe et tenus come firm Principles de eux mesmes.

For the better understanding whereof, we may note that all matters of debate
which may be referred to the controversies or questions de qualitate or de
iure, as has been said, have either commonly a Maxim of the one part, and a
Maxim of the other; or several resons of each part derived from sundry
Maxims; or else that there is a Maxim of the one part, and there is equity
and reason which does minister an exception to that Maxim or general Rule: So
that all disceptation herein is, as has been said, in conference or comparing
of Maxims and Principles together discoursing, which thing is directly under
the reason of the said Maxim; and what matter or circumstance may make a
difference, and will be by exception exempted ftom the same; as more at large
hereafter in the declaration of the use of these Maxims may be made manifest
and apparent.

Now rests moreover to prosecute the second Axiom or Principle proposed in
the said Dialogues, namely, that which follows there in the seventeenth
chapter of his first book, that is to say:

It is not lawful for any man to enter upon a descent. The second Ground.


Which ground being expounded by Littleton in his chapter of discents to extend
only to discents of an estate of inheritance and freehold, and not of a
reuersion or remainder, all which follows after in the said chapter, are
nothing but cases of exceptions unto the said grounds, as it is evident unto
every one that considers the same, and therefore shall it here be needless
long to insist thereupon. Nevertheless it shall be expedient to show some
exceptions thereunto, especially some certain, of such of them as being
exceptions unto the said Rule, are again restrained with other exceptions.
Because there is a Rule of Law, that

Laches ou folly ne sera impute a un enfant de luy First exception Littleton
Garranty 279.
prejudice.

Therefore lest contrariety might happen in consequence of reason between the
said Rule of discents, and this Rule last remembered: there is ministered by the
means of this later Rule, an exception unto the said former ground namely, that

If an infant have right of entry, he may enter upon Littleton discents cas.
402. 20. Hen. 6. 28. b.
a descent.

This exception, although it does import great probability of truth, yet is
the same like unto the Ground in this respect, namely, that it is also subject
to be restrained with another exception, viz.

If an infant, or such privileged or excepted person have a right of entry,
and a descent of those lands is had to one that has a more ancient right; the
party having such ancient right, shall be remitted: and both the right and
entry of the infant taken away.

And this exception ensues of another general Rule of Law, which is, That

An ancient right shall always be preferred before an other mean right or
title.

The said exception upon exception grounded upon the last remembered Rule, may
be plainly proved by this case.

If Tenant in Tail do discontinue and after do 11. Ed. 4. 1. b.
disseize his discontinuee, and during that disseisein the discontinuee dies,
his heir within age; and after the Tennant in tail does die seized; and this
land descends unto the issue in tail, the heir of the discontinuee being
still within age; This is a remitter, and the entry of the heir of the
discontinuee is tolled, notwithstanding that the Ground and Principle is, that
the laches of the enfant shall not prejudice the enfant. And the cause is the
ancient right the issue had.

Moreover the former General Rule touching discents The second exception.
that toll entries, has among other, also this, exception.

A descent had during the Couerture, shall not Litt. fol. 59. cas. 403.
toll the entry of the woman or her heirs after the Couerture dissolved. 9.
Hen 7. 24. a. 2. Ed 4. 24. a. 7. Ed. 4. 7b. 20 Hen, 628, b.


But because there is a General Rule of Law, That None shall be favored in
any Act wherein folly may be imputed to him.

From whence is derived also this more special Rule or Ground.

Couerture shall not aid a woman where the taking Com. z^ueb. 366. a.
of a Husband which respects not her benefit 42. Ed. 3. 12. b. 9. Hen. 7. 24.
a.
may be imputed to her folly.

Hereof ensues this exception upon exception to the said former remembered
Rule, That

where folly may be imputed to the woman for 41. Ed. 3. 12. b. 9. Hen 7. 24 a.
Litt fol. 95. cas. 404.
taking of such a Husband as will be heedlesse of her benefit, there a descent,
during the couerture, shall bind the woman and her heirs. 3. 4. Phil. Mar.
144. n. 57.


Much more might be said of like effect, but this for example sake shall
suffice.

Now rests briefly to say something touching the first proposed Latin
Rules: Of which the form was this,

Sublata causa tollitur effectus. Com. 72. b. Com. 268 a. Com. 294. a.


This Rule is not absolutely true; for the Philosopher from whence it is
borrowed, does understand it, De causis internis, non de externis.

The Civil Lawyers do restraineit in this manner Prataus.
Haec autem Gnosis sine Regula, de causa finali, non de causa impulsiva
intelligitur.

The common Law of the Realm, thus;

Sublata una causa, si alia remanet, non tollitur effectus.

The second Rule; which was this, Qui tacet consentire videtur, is verified
with this exception.

Si ad eius commodum and utilitatem spectat, praesens Prataeus l. 7. c. 3. fol.
911.
and tacens pro consentiente habetur.

The third Rule was this,

Quod initeo non valet, id tractu temporis non convalescit.

Which Ground may be confirmed with many cases, yet is the same Ground
restrained with this exception, because That

Habet locum in his tantum quae statim debent valere, Decius.
and nullam suspentionem habent.

If a man make a lease for life of land unto I. S. and 37. Hen. 8. Brook.
after does make a lease for years unto I. N. of the Leasses 48. Com. Smith
and Stapleton 433. a. Com. Greisbrooke 422. a.
same land to begin presently, This lease being made by word, is void; for the
freehold in the first lease is more worthy, and by law intended to be of longer
continuance then the term in the second lease: yet if the first lease die, or
surrender before the second be expired, the residue of the term is good.

If the father devise his land unto his daughter and 5. Ed. 4. 6. Per Billing
quod fuit concessum and Abridge per Fitzb. tit. Assiss. 27.
heir apparent, and after leaving his wife enceinct, or w th child with a
son, upon the death of the father this devise unto the daughter is void, for
that she is his heir; but after, when the son is borne, it is good.

The fourth Rule of the said Latin rules before set down, was this,

Quando duo iura in uno concurrunt, aequum est ac si esset in duobus.

This Rule has exception grounded upon another Rule, that is, That
Vigilantibus and non dormientibus iura subi eniunt. Com. 57 b.
Or to the same effect; V^icuiou: sua mora nocet.

And therefore

In causes de negligence on laches diverse droits concurrant in un person ne
seront deem si come ils sussent in diverse persons.

Where, if Tenant pur auter vie be, the remainder Com. St. well 372. b.
for life over to another, the remainder in see to the right heirs of the
Tenant pur auter vie, If the said Tenant pur auter vie be disseised, and the
disseisor levy a fine with proclamations, and the five years do pass, and
after Cesti que vie dies; and after also dies he in remainder for life; he
which was Tenant pur auter vie shall not have other five years after the death
of the Tenant for life in remainder to pursue his right for the sea simple.

Upon like reason, if a Bishop be seized of an Aduowson in the right of his
Bishopric, and the Church become void, and six months do pass; the Bishop
shall not have other six months as Ordinary, the same Church being in his
Diocese, as he should have if the same Church were of the Patronage of another
person, although he be in one respect Patron, and in another Ordinary.

Hitherto have we entertained discourse as touching the verity of Axioms,
Rules, and Grounds; which, as has been showed, is either necessary or
contingent.

Contingent verity was divided into two branches; the one resting upon the
entendment of Law; the other being derived from the disposition and nature of
humane things, by debate and discourse of reason.

Of the first sort there are two kinds; for some propositions there are,
although of themselves but only probable, yet nevertheless are supposed of
such certainty, that no averment shall be received to enounter the same.
Othersome, although they be by the Law intended true, Prima facie, yet
nevertheless the same Law allows an averment, and admits proof to
impeach the same.

Those moreover which rest upon discourse of reason, are subject to diverse
exceptions, the material cause whereof is, the infinite variety of
circumstances that in all humane actions do happen.

The form and nature of the exception is perceived and known by this effect
following; in that it restrains the ground unto which it is connexed.

The efficient causes are two, viz. Equity or some other Ground of the Law
importing contrariety. And the end thereof is conformity and coherency of Law
agreeable unto Justices whose minister the Law is.

Moreover as occasion has bin offered in the declaration of the causes from
whom Exceptions of Rules do spring, there has been showed the use of equity
in the common Law, Statute Law, and Chancery, by the two effects thereof,
application and restraint; the one enlarging, the other abridging.

Wherefore now rests to speak of the second principal part, concerning the
form of Axioms, namely, generallity: The consideration whereof, brings to
memory, that God in his most excellen work, of the frame of transitory things,
though he has furnished the world with unspeakable variety, thereby making
manifest unto all humane creatures, to their great astonishment, his
incomprehensible wisdom, his omnipotent power, and his unsearchable providence,
yet, being the God of order, not of confusion, has admitted no infiniteness
in nature (howsoever otherwise it seem to our weak capacities) but has
continued the innumerable variety of particular things under certain
specialls; those specialls under generals; and those generals again under
causes more general, lincking and conioyning one thing to another, as by a
chain, even until we ascend unto himself, the first chief and principal
cause of all good things. And this is that which Plato out of Homer, was wont
to call Jupiters golden Chain.

The eye whereby we do see and view, and the in ward hand whereby we do
reach and apprehend these things, is man's understanding, which is wholly
employed about universality as about his proper object, by means whereof, in
all things rational, being discovered by the use of reason, man's understanding
for the attaining of knowledge proceeds from the effect to the cause, and
again from the cause to the effect; that is from the particular to the
special, and from the special to the general; and so to the more general,
even to a principal and primary position or notion, which needs no further
proof, but is of it self known and apparent. And so again from such chief
and primary Principles and propositions to more special and peculiar
Assertions, descending even to every particular matter.

But that, of this which has been said, some example might be showed,
especially in this matter, which we now have in hand, namely, concerning the
Grounds and Rules of the Law of England; let one of the proposed Grounds first
before mentioned stand here for an example, viz.

Nihil est magis rationi consentaneum, quam codem modo quodque dissolvere quo
constatum est.

This principle being a Rule of reason containing great probability, and being
of the number of those that before we said to have been derived from the
observation of the nature of things, which though it be subject to manifold
exceptions, yet nevertheless as a general Rule, the same is verified in many
special Axioms; and they again diversely subdivided into many more peculiar
propositions; as the example of these following may make manifest.

1 Cesty que est charge pur Record doit luy discharger per Record.

2 Cesty que est charge per fait doit luy mesme discharge per fait, ou per
auter matter cy haut.

3 Cesty que est charge fors que pur parol, poet este discharge pur parol.

Of which general Propositions there can be made no better Reason then by the
commemoration of the said first aforeshewed general Rule.

Moreover, the first of the last above remembered comprehends under the
generality thereof certain other more special Rules:

As

In det sur arrerages de account que est matter de Record, le party doit
discharger luy pur matter cy haut, and nemy per specialty, on fait ou auter
matier que nest cy haut. 6. Hen. 4. 6. a. 3. Hen. 4. 5. a. 11. Hen. 4. 79. b.
13. Hen. 4. 1. a. 8. Hen. 5. 3. b. 3. Hen. 6. 55. a. 4. Hen. 6. 17. b. 20. Hen.
6. 55. b.

In det sur recovery, home ne sera discharge mes per matter cy hout: ou a tiel
effect. 6. Hen. 4. 6 a.

Under the second Rule or Ground before proposed touching a discharge where the
party is charged by matter of specialty; those special Rules following are
likewise comprehended.

In null casehome ne poit avoid single obligation, sans auter specialty de auxy
haut nature. 1 Hen. 7. 14. b 5. Hen. 7. 33. b. 11. Hen. 7. 4. b.

Home que ad enfreint covenant ne pledera matter in discharge de ceo sans sait.
3. Hen. 4. 1. b. 1. Hen 7. 14. b. 21. Hen. 6. 31. a.

Home ne dischargera luy mesme d'un annuitie que charge son person sant
specialty. 5. Hen. 7. 33. b. 33. Hen. 8. 51. a. Dyer.

The first rule of these last remembered Grounds, namely, touching obligations,
is again divided into diverse particulars; as for example.

Arbitrament ne dischargera home de un duty due per unobligation. 8. Hen. 7. 3.
b. 6. Hen. 4. 6. a.

Si le obligee deliver l'obligation al obliger come acquittance, and puis ceo
prift de luy, and comence suit sur ceo; cest delivery ne sera discharge del
obligation. 1. Hen. 7. 17. a. 33. Hen. 8. 51. a. Dyar 22. Hen. 6. 52. b.

The other following concerning Indentures of Covenants, may likewise be
divided into other more particular assertions: but to avoyde rediousnesse,
these already showed abundantly manifest our meaning, and therefore may suffice:

The use of this kind of observation of the generallity The use of general
Rules and the observations of their specialls.
of Rules and Propositions is manifold.

First, things proposed in the generallity are best known and most familiar to
our conceit, since they be the proper object of our understanding, as before is
declared.

Secondly, they do better adhere and stick in memory, since Intellectiue
memory is (as the understanding is) employed about universal and general
things.

Thirdly, universal Propositions are the precepts of Art, and therefore they
are called perpetual and and eternal: for no Art, Science, Method, or
certain knowledge can or may consist of particularities: for the orderly
proceeding of every Art, Methodically handled, is from the due regard had of
the general, to descend unto the specialls contained underneath the same:
wherefore it ensues hereof, that general Propositions are the most speedy
instruments of knowledge: for experience, which wholly is gotten by the
observation of particular things (being deprived of speculation) is slow,
blind, doubtful, and deceivable, and truly called the mistress offooles.

Notes collected out of Authors touching the observation of general
Propositions.
IF perchance upon occasion of some former speeches here published touching the
vniuersallity of Grounds, there be demanded this question.

Why the Laws of England at the first and Question.
from time to time, had not been published after this Method of general and
special Rules with their exceptions.

I answer thereunto, that many ancient writers Answer 1.
attempted that kind of writing, and accomplished the same according to their
several and sundry gifts more or less perfect each then other: As by the
treatises of Glanvile, Braction, Britton, and others appears.

Secondly I say that forasmuch as daily new questions 2
came in debate whereof before had been no resolution, and wherein many times
the least variety of circumstances does alter the Law; therefore our Ancestors
thought it more convenient, to be rather governed by an unwritten Law, not left
in any other monument, then in the mind of man; and thence to be deduced by
disceptation and discourse of reason: and that when occasion should be
offered, and not before.

Thirdly, it is more convenient and profitable to 3
the state of the common wealth to frame Law upon deliberation and debate of
reason, by men skillful and learned in that faculty, when present occasion is
offered to use the same, by a case then falling out and requiring Judicial
determination: for then is it likely, with much more care, industry and
diligence to be looked unto; and much more time of deliberation is there taken
for the mature decision thereof, then otherwise upon the establishing of any
positive Law, might be imparted concerning the same.

Last of all, since all good Laws require perspicuity 4
and plainness; and that in generallity, for the most part, lurketh obscurity;
therefore there is nothing of more force and effect touching the making and
framing of a good Law, then the present occasion offered, since thereby it
brought to light, that which otherwise would not as much (many times) as be
thought upon, and gives occasion to dispute that which none would have thought
ever should have come in question. And therefore not without due consideration
among the Romans, Disputationes fori, and with us Demurrers have ever been
allowed as originalls of Law.

As touching the manifestation of Rules, all are affirmative or negative:
wherein though the affirmative be, for many causes, the more worthy; yet such
negation as implies affirmation (and therefore called pregnant) is not without
some use in the setting down and delivering of exceptions and general Rules.
And thus much touching the form of Rules, Grounds, and Axioms.

The efficient cause of Rules, Grounds, and Axioms is the light of natural
reason tried and sifted upon disputation and argument. And hence is it, that
the Law (as has been before declared) is called reason; not for that every
man can comprehend the same; but it is artificial reason; the reason of such,
as by their wisdom, learning, and long experience are skillfull in the
affairs of men, and know what is fit and convenient to be held and observed
for the appeasing of controversies and debates among men, still having an eye
and due regard of justice, and a consideration of the common wealth wherein
they live; for well says Aristotle, Hoc qu them perspicuum est, leges pro
ratione Reipub. esse Arist. l. 3. Pol. c. 7
scrilendas. And of this reason that we speak of, Tully has a noteable
saying. Ratio est societatis humanae Cic. 1. Offic.
vinculu^, ut ratio, quae dicendo, communicando, disceptando, indicando,
conciliat inter se homines, coniungit, and retinet naturali societate.
Wherefore since the Grounds of Law are the foundation of Law, or at leastwise
the Law it self delivered in manner of compendious and short sentences and
propositions; that which is the efficient cause of Law, must likewise be the
efficient cause of those Rules and Axioms.

Inasmuch then as Primaria efficiens causa iuris, Iohane^ Corasius de a^e (...)
lib. 1. cap 20.
est natura and ratio civilis, ex quibus potissimum leges emanant, and veluti
scaturiunt. The same nature and reason are likewise the principal and
original efficient cause of the Rules, Axioms, Grounds, and Propositions of
the Law; I mean Civilis ratio, that is reason respecting justice and the
common wealth.

This reason has in the written works of the Laws of this Land, either been
plainly published and expressed in the books of Law, upon deceptation of
cases in debate, and left unto posterity as the Lights, Rules, and Directions,
whereby the said cases so called into question, were at the last decided and
determined.

Or else it is not at all expressly published in words, but left nevertheless
employed and inclined in the cases so decided, and therein does as it were lie
hidden; and yet nevertheless to be easily, with industry collected and
inferred upon those Cases decided, and does necessarily follow upon the
resolution of the same, and being thence drawn, may abundantly serve to
infinite uses, in the determinating of other doubts? which daily do and may
come in debate. Wherefore since in the Law (as in other Sciences) all arguments
and disputation do either consist of express proof and allegation of
Authority (which are called Inartificiall Arguments) or else of application
and inference; as well the Rules to be collected upon Inference and
application of other Cases, are to be regarded and to be produced, as those
which are direct authorities. And forasmuch as in very few cases of doubt newly
rising in debate, and called into question and controversy, express proof
and pregnant authority can be found; the Lawyer is most beholding to Inference
and Application, where with he is instructed and taught, that Cases different
in circumstance, may be nevertheless compared each to other in equality of
Reason; so that of like Reason, like law might be framed. And by how much
Application and inference does more depend upon wit and Art, then the producing
of express Authority; by so much the more it excels the same, since the
Allegation of express Authority, rests wholly upon Industry and Memory in
publishing and noting that which he finds already framed to his hand

Express Rules, Axioms, Grounds and Positions of the former sort are
published in the book of Law, either in the Lattin tongue, as are the former
general Rules first mentioned, and also infinite other of that kind; or else
in the French; in which tongue the Reports of forepassed Cases are published
unto the use of posterity, and wherewith the said books of years and terms
(almost in every case therein found) are fully furnished. So that all, though
it shall be need esse to make manifest that by Example, which of it self is
evident; yet still to pursue the former Method and order hitherunto observed,
we shall easily perceive the same in this short case hereafter expressed.

Un home avoit a lay et ses heirs le nomination del Clerk d'un Esglise a un
Abbe, et le Abbe doit presenter ouster le Clerk nominate al ordinary, ore le
Roy ayant les possessions del Abbey ad present son Clerk al dit Esglise estant
void sans ascun nomination. Et le opinion del Court fut, que le party que
aueroit le nomination, auera Quare impedit verse le Incumbent tantum, sans ascun
deste nosme Patron: Car le Roy ne poit este sue come disturber. Tamen fut dit
que le Roy ne poit este Instrument al ascun home. Et Shelley dit que il est
Instrument a chacun home: Car per luy chacun Subject ad Justice a luy minister.

The Principles, Maxims, Rules, or Grounds expressed in plain words in this
case, and which are indeed the very reason of the Resolution therein taken, are
these.

1 Le Roy ne poit este sue Come disturber.

2 Lou le roy present per tort, Quare Impedit sera port verse L'incumbent sole
sans a scun deste nosme Patron.

3 Le roy ne poit este instrument al ascun home sccome son servant.

4 Per le Roy chescun subject ad Justice a luy minister.

5 Le roy est instrument a chacun home purminister a luy Justice.

So that the Reasons of every Resolution in any book Case being reduced into
short Sentences, Propositions or Summarie Conclusions are the Grounds Rules,
and Principles that we do mean and speak of in this place.

Such Summarie Conclusions, Corolaries, Reasons, Grounds, or Propositions
therefore as before declared are delivered in the books of Reports in two
manners.

Sometimes without any note or mark that they are Grounds or Rules, but only
as laid down and dispersed in the Arguments and Resolutions as short Reasons
of the opinion or determination there expressed as in the last example
appears.

Sometimes with a note or mark that they are Grounds, Rules, and Maxims, and
are expressly invested with such names, as in the entrance of this treatise has
appeared. And thus much of the Grounds or Positions expressed in the books.

Now as touching the second sort, which are to be collected, and inferred out
of the Cases left reported, we plainly may perceive the notable use of such
collection, in reading advisedly the Commentaries of Mr. Plowden, or other the
best books of Reports; or diligently observing any notable Argument made at
this day in any the Queens Courts in matter of Demurrer, where we may not
think that every case cited or alleged out of the books for proof of the
Controversy, is therefore alleged because it has express matter therein
published in plain words, and tending to the resolution of the point in
question: but at sometimes, and that most commonly, such proof is produced
upon inference, and yet nevertheless, sufficiently pregnant to approve the
matter whereunto it is rightly applied: which inference and application
proceeds wholly upon collected Rules and Axioms included in the resolution
of those Cases produced although the same be not expressly spoken or published
therein.

Wherefore notwithstanding, the best means of the collection of the said Rules
depending only upon Meditation, and resting wholly upon the sagacitie, wit,
industry, and judgment of the Student, (because every man's several conceit
is in it self sundry) may best be referred unto the Student himself: yet
nevertheless, shall it not be amiss here to manifest such direction therein
as may be observed with some fruit.

1 First, after the Case read, let us consider with our selves, and meditate in
our minds, to what several purposes the same case may be applied, and what
matter, or several matters the resolution of the said Case can confirm. Which
when we have considered of, it shall be good for our memory to commit them to
writing, in manner, and according to this example following.

Fut move si Tenant in tail d'un Manor, a que vilains 33. Hen. 8. 48. b. n.
1. Dyer.
sons regardant, en feoft un des vilains d'un acre per cel del Manor, et devy,
coment que le Manor descend al issue in tail, uncore il ne poit seiser son
vilain tanque le aer^ soit recover.

Upon meditation had of this Case, what it will prove, these Propositions or
Rules following may easily be collected.

1 Lou home ad forsque un action al principal chose la il nauer benefit del
accessory, tanque il ad per recovery continue le principal.

And because here the whole principal is not discontinued, but only one Acre,
thereof may be collected, That

2 Regardancy ou Apendancy nest solement al tout le Manor, mes chacun acre del
demeanes.

Moreover, because the principal in this Case, viz. the Acre discontinued,
cannot be recontinued without suite to be attempted against the Villen; it
follows in Reason, that he shall not be infranchised thereby: Whence also
this Axiom is to be confirmed or proved, That

3 Necessary suite ew verse un villen per le signor ne enfranchise le villen.

Here of has appeared that although none of these Propositions be expressed
in the resolution of the said Case, in the book wherein the same is left
reported; yet nevertheless are they necessarily employed in the resolution of
the said Case, as before has been declared.

But if the Case so read does consist of many points or several questions
sunderly debated, every of them may likewise be sunderly and apart considered
of, according to the manner before showed.

A second means, by Inference to collect, such Rules and propositions as are
before declared, is by way of Argument by Syllogism: For supposing the said
Case to be denied to be Law which we have read. Let us endeavor to draw the
immediate Reasons thereof into a syllogism for confirmation of the same. So
that thereby, forasmuch as all Rules out of the Law are of two sorts, that is,
either being the Reasons of the Case, or the Case contracted shortly it self,
by such manner of Argument, the Mayor, and first Proposition of the said
syllogisticall Argument, will be the general Reason of the said Case: the
Minor or second Proposition, will be the particular Reason: and the conclusion
will be the contracted case it self: Which also will serve as a secondarie
Rule to determine other Cases of equal Reason called into controversy. For
example herein, we will take the opinion of Hulls in 9. Hen. 4. 8. a in the end
of a Case there argued, where he holds for clear Law, That

Si un home fait fine pur un trespass don't il fut endite 9. Hen 4. 8. a.
son boache sera estopp a dire que il nest my culpable, sil soit eint implead
apres.

But because the same is denied in Hen. 6. we endeavoring to prove the same
by syllogism, shall not only confirm it, but also exemplify our former
speeches.

Maior] Null sera permit a denyer cest injury pur que il ad fait satisfaction,
ou ad suffer punishment.

Minor] Mes cesty que ad fait fine pur un offense ad fait ascun satisfaction et
in ceo ad este puny.

Conclusio) Il que ad fait un fine pur vne trespass ou auter offense sera estopp
a ceo denier apres.

Every of these propositions be est-soones confirmed not only with the Case
before spoken (for as they do prove the Case, being the immediate Reasons
thereof; so are they to be proved again by the Case as by their effect) but
also with sundry other Authorities found in the books of like effect.

A third observation of Propositions and Axioms 3
may be drawn from the consideration of the Titleing words; or words which do
yield matter of effect; whereof in the Case last remembered are such as do
follow; namely.

Fine, Estoppel, Enditement, Nonculpable, Party, etc.

And herein is to be meditated and considered what Rules may be derived and
collected out of the said Case, and be referred to every of the said Titles: As
namely,

Under Fynes.
1 FIne fait pur un offense prove, cesty que fait le fine voluntarunt, deste
culpable del dit offense.

2 Fine fait per un offense causera cesty que fait le offense que il ne ceo
denier a apres.

Under Enditement, these.
SI home soit Convince, d'un offense sur un Enditement, que est al suit le Roy,
il ne deniera le dit offense, sil soit apres de ceo implede al suit del Party.

Under Estoppell, these.
HOme sera estopp per matter de Implication que imply le contrary de son disant
de Record.

Under Non Culpable, these.
NOn Culpable ne sera plede per ascun lou per implication il ad confess le
cause del action.

Under party, these.
SI offense soit Commit cy bien al Roy que come al Party condemnation al suit
d'vn d'eux, aydera l'auter in son suit.

A fourth manner of observation is to refer unto 4
every Ground or Rule so collected, a Rule, more general, so proceeding from
the special Rule unto the general Reason, and from that general Reason unto
a more general: As out of the said first Case may be drawn this general rule.

Home ne sera permit a denier ceo que deuant il ad 9. Hen. 4. 8. a.
confess per implication de Record.

Under which Ground not only, the first proposed Case of 9. Hen. 4. 8. a. may
be comprehended; and diverse others of like effect and purpose, and which do
concur under the said General Rule; As for example.

He which is arraigned, after he has pleaded either Stamf. 155. a. cap. 62.
in Bar or in Abatement of the Appeal whereon he was arraigned, may plead
over Not guilty Stamf. 98. b. 22. Ed. 4. 39. b.
to the felony: Except the Bar or Plea do comprehend such matter as does
acknowledge the felony; as a Release or pardon. But if he do plead any such
Plea or Bar; viz. Release, or Pardon in any Appeal or Enditement, he cannot
plead over Not guilty to the Felony, because thereby he confesses the Felony
by implication.

If in a Praecipe, the Tenant say that he is Leasse 11. Hen. 4. 69. a.
Culpepper.
for life, and pray in aid, the demaundant says he has fee, which the
Tenant denies not, and therefore he is owted of the aid: If after he will say
he is Tenant for term of life, and vouch, he shall not be thereunto received.

These Cases with many other may be comprehended under the generality of the
last specified Rule, and are one in Reason, not under one immediate Reason, but
under this Reason, viz. Home ne sera admit a Contradize ceo que il ad confess
de Record.

Moreover there is another Case, one in effect of Reason, with the former
proposed Case, which because it is nevertheless, in circumstance more
general, therefore it cannot be comprehended under the last specified Rule, as
namely.

If a man be indicted of Trauers, and thereupon 7. Hen. 4. 35. b.
be found guilty by verdict at the suite of the king; If after, the party
against whom the Trauers was committed, bring action for the same Trauers; the
other shall not plead Not guilty thereunto.

In the former Grounds, and Cases thereupon, the party was concluded by an
employed confession; but in this last Case, he is convinced by an open trial or
verdict. And whosoever will comprehend both this and the former cases under one
Ground or Rule, must make the same more general then the former, in this
manner.

Home ne sera permit a denier tiel offense de que il poit este convince per
matter de Record.

And forasmuch as a man may be convinced of an offense as well by confession,
as by verdict; and that as well, by implicature confession, as by express
confession: Therefore every of the said former Cases may be concluded and
comprehended under the amplenesse of this last remembered Ground.

A special Ground may be reduced unto a Rule or Proposition general, by
seeking the Genus or general Notion of every Titling word found in the said
special Ground, As for example, the said Proposition before remembered, and
which has been exemplified with Cases, was this.

Home ne sera permit adenier ceo que devant il ad Confess per implication de
Record.

Upon the word (denier) it may be drawn more general, thus.

Home ne sera permit de Contrary son act demesne que deuant il ad conuz.

A more general Reason whereof may again be yielded, thus.

Seroit inconvenient que le ley alloweroit a dize, et a dedize vne mesme chose
de Record.

Upon the word (Confession) these Reasons also may be assigned more general
then that first ground.

Confession de un est le plus pregnant proof que poit este encounter luy.

A reason hereof: For, Le Confession de chacun que concern luy mesme sera
intendvray. For,

Null conuoit le offense melious que cesty que ad ceo commit et perpetrat.

Upon the word (Implication) these general Rules may be proposed.

Confession per Implication est cy sort oncounter le Party come Confession
experss. For,

Pregnant Implication est equivalent al matter express.

Upon the word (Record) somewhat likewise may be said of like effect; viz. thus;

Matter de Record que est grounded sur le act del Party mesme luy issint liera
que il ne contra dira ceo apres. For,

Le credit d'vn Judicial act ne sera impeach per ascun que est privy a ceo. For,

Matter de Record est plus hault testimony in ley.

Under the word (Fine) there was mentioned this Ground or Rule.

Fine que est fait pur un offense prove home culpable del offense.

Here hence these Propositions being more general, may be derived.

Null per Common presumption voit fair voluntary fine pur le offense de quel
il nest Culpable.

A reason whereof may be thus.

Poena culpam implicat. And Le Consequent importa son Principal.

Hereof you see what abundance of Rules and Propositions one Case contains;
and that we may descend from the particular case, to the special Reason, from
that to a more general, until we find out the very primarie ground of
natural Reason, from whence all the other are derived.

Herein this Caution is to be considered and had in mind, that in collection
of Grounds and Principles out of any proposed Case, the same may be Native,
and always appliable and reduceable to the immediate Reason of the said Case,
so that in any occasion of Argument, the same Case may be a pregnant and
efficient proof thereunto.

Furthermore collection of Propositions may be drawn and reduced from all the
principal places of Logical Invention.

1 As from the Causes unto the Effect.

2 And contrariwise from the Effects unto their Causes.

3 So likewise from the Consequent unto the Antecedent.

4 And from the Antecedent to the Consequent.

5 Moreover a Paris as from the Equal or Like

6 Amaiors from the more likely unto that which is less probable.

7 And again, from that which is less Likely or Probable to that which is
more Probable.

8 Finally, from the Contrary to his Contrary: since that Eadem est ratio and
proportio Contrariorum:

Notes of Authors touching the observation of Collection of Grounds and Rules
by Inference.
THe Reasons and Causes wherefore these Propositions, Rules, and Axioms (as
has been declared first in manner as aforesaid) are not only to be
considered, observed and collected, but always to be had, and carefully to be
kept in memory, And the end and scope whereto they serve and tend, will
manifestly appear, as well by the Observation of the right use of them, and
the manifold utility and great help, which rises by the daily meditation
therein, as likewise by the consideration and amendment of some inconsiderate
abuses which have crept into the daily handling of them, both in judicial
places abroad, and in private exercises at home.

The necessary use of them therefore consists in two parts.

1 The one serving to the obtaining of the knowledge of the Law.

2 The other in use and practice of the Law learned by these Propositions and
Rules, reducing them, as occasion serves to public and private behoof.

The first is Speculatiue.

This last Practique.

As touching the first, the profit hence springing may soon be seen and
discovered, if we call to our memory, that no manner faculty whatsoever to
be learned by the the light of Reason, can consist or be comprehended by the
capacity of man's vnderstansting, except (as before also in part has appeared)
it be furnished with certain Assertions, Precepts, Rules, and Propositions,
and the same adorned with these two qualities, Universality and Verity. And
as none may worthily take upon him the name of a Divine, which is ignorant of
the Principles of his Science; nor any man may well arrogate the title or
knows not the Precepts whereon his Art depends; or has not read the
determination of former doubts left reported in books, being the greatest part
of the written Law in his Land; And thence, not collected Conclusions for the
decisions of present and future controversies.

Moreover seeing the Law of this Land is wholly Rational (as has been said)
wherein, as in all other Sciences, the mind of man holds and keeps the
former published proceeding, by apprehension and discourse, collecting Primarie
and Secondary Conclusions and Grounds, it cannot be otherwise, but that the
observation of these Primarie and Secondarie Conclusions, must needs be the
best, most approved, profitable and speedy mean, for the attaining of the
right, sound, and infallible knowledge of the said Laws.

And if there be any way extant, or to be found by man's wisdom, to purge the
English Laws, from the great Confusions, tedious and superfluous iterations,
with the which the Reports are infested; or quit it of these manifold
contrarieties, wherewith it is so greatly ouercharged, so that the Coherencie,
constancy, and conformity thereof, is almost utterly lost, and not without
some blemish and reproach of our Nation and Commonwealth, in manner clean
abolished; Surely, as to me seems, there is likelihood by that way and
means to bring the same to pass, or by none. For, by Rules and Exceptions,
all Sciences are and have been published, put down and delivered: out of
Rules and Exceptions, a method is framed, by which means men may view a
perfect plot of the coherence of things: Even as in a large spread tree, from
the lowest root to the highest branche; from the most ample and highest
General, by many degrees of descent, as in a Petigree or Genealogy, to the
lowest special and particular; which are combined together as it were in a
consanguinitie of blood and concordancy of nature.

And yet therewithal perusing the particular differences and degrees of
distinction between them, in all the course of humane studies, there is none
that does more commend unto our cogitations the wonderful force of man's
wisdom, then does this discourse which treats of the Principles, Grounds,
Rules, and Originals of Law and Justice, being the chain of humane society,
without the which it cannot consist; and which, besides the exceeding pleasure
that the consideration thereof breeds in the well affected mind, is able to
bring us speedily to ripeness and maturitie in that profession. For,
Principium est dimidium totius, says Aristotle.

Short refined reasons of long perplexed Cases, do, through their soundness,
satisfy our judgments, through their breuity and shortness, wonderfully
delight the mind, through their pithinesse, they may be deemed incomparable
treasures, yielding a great show of wit, and wonderfully sharpening our
understanding, of infinite use, in all humane affairs, containing much worth
in few words, no burden to memory, but once obtained, are ever retained.

Since all Sciences do tend to Verity (as has been before often affirmed,
which is the object of the intellectual part of our mind; And since Verity and
Truth cannot be obtained or found without due knowledge of the causes; Tunc
enim (as says the Philosopher) unum quodque scire arbitramur, cum eius causas
and Principia cognoscimus. And not unfitly said the Poet,

Foelix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.
Then must the right and due observation of these and such like Principles
containing the Causes of things, be a direction to conduct and lead us to the
knowledge of that faculty and science, whereof they are Principles. For from
hence all artificial Demonstrations are, and have been drawn and deduced.

To adhere therefore and wholly to respect particular cases, without any
observation of the general Rules and Reasons, and to charge the memory with
infinite singularities, is utterly to confound the same; a labor of
unspeakable toil, and wherein we shall never free us from confusion; but
engender in our selves, that wrong opinion which many have (amiss)
entertained, that there is nothing certain in our Laws.

Finally, if the Law be every man's inheritance borne under the same, as notably
(besides our own Laws) says the Prince of Orators, Tully: Mayor M. T.
Cicero pro Ceci^a.
haereditas venit unicuique nostrum a iure et legibus, quam ab ijs a quibus
illa bona relicta sunt. Nam ut perveniat ad nos fundus, testamento alicuius
fieri potest: ut retineamus quod nostrum factum est, sine iure civili fieri non
potest. And all men's inheritance should be certain both for the private repose
of the people, and public good and quiet of the Common wealth. We must needs
think the Law of this Land full of defect, except we think and deem it to be
(as indeed it is) certain.

Who then can, without the consideration of these universal Maxims,
Propositions, Rules, and Principles, wherein certainty is alone contained,
attain unto the certain knowledge thereof? for as it has been truly
published; Principiorum est unumquodque sibi ipsi fides; Insomuch that cum
negantibus ea, non est dsputandum. 10. Eliz. 271. a. Dyer, 26.

Hitherto has been spoken what profit the careful consideration and
observation of Principles, Rules, and Maxims of the Law of this Realm does
give us, and what assistance we may find therein toward the study and
speculation of the same. It rests therefore now, that somewhat be said of the
commodity which may come to him, that shall manage and practice the same
Laws, and to what use this observation therein likewise serves.

Two kinds of Arguments are noted by Morgan.

Ily sont deux principal chooses sur que Arguments Com. Colthurst.
poient este fait S. nostre Maxims, and reason, la Mere de touts Leyes etc. I
think by the later of these, the use of Argumentation upon reasons drawn from
the Logical places of invention, are to be understood; As namely to argue and
reason in cases of debate, from the causes, effects, parts, consequents,
mischiefs, and inconveniences and such like; which aptly may be called
natural reason, because all Art therein observed, is but the imitation of
nature: which kind or course of Argument, is much used in ancient books, when
as there were fewest books of reports extant.

But by the former of these two specified kinds of Arguments, is meant as
manifestly appears, the help, Grounds, and Maxims do yield in that kind.
For the understanding therefore of the right use thereof, it behooves to
consider, that the same wholly does consili in the apt and convenient
application of the said Rules, unto such particular cases daily falling in
debate, as may be comprehended under the generallity of the same Rules, and may
in every respect berightly reduced thereunto; so that the Rule might serve as a
well-grounded reason of the matter called in question.

To this effect the Author of the Dialogues between the Doctor and Student,
after he had at large spoken of the credit and supposed certainty of a
Principle or Maxim of the Laws of this Land, adds further that such Maxims
be not only holden for Law, but also other cases like unto them, and all
things, that necessariy follow upon the same, are to be reduced to the like Law.

A second use of the observation of Principles in

We are taught (as says Aristotle) and as likewise has before been
remembered, by the election of Principles to abound in matter fit for
Argumentation. Our propositions may be framed as parts of Syllogism, or as
antecedent Propositions of Enthymemes, by which form of Arguments, this profit
and commodity is reaped, that he which rightly uses the same, in proof or
disproofe of any proposed matter shall not need to fall into any unnecessary
and extravagant matter, or digress from the point that hehath in hand. For if
the parts of our argument so to be concluded, do consist of Propositions which
are Principles in Law, and be in due and expedient manner framed and combined
together, the Conclusion, which is the point in question, will follow, either
necessarily or probably, according to the truth of the said Propositions, for
as we have before showed, that by reducing a case to a Syllogism, we might
find some of the principal Reasons and Propositions, whereupon the verity of
the said case, being the conclusion, depends; as trying out the cause by the
effect: So of the contrary part, to frame the effect by the cause; the same
Propositions will, as they confirm one case, so likewise establish all other
special cases, which shall happen to concur in equal and like reason, or be
reducible to, or under, the generallity of the said Proposition.

And although the Lawyer be not tied to this short course of Argument current
in schools, yet in whatsoever large discourse of Argument, if this form be
respected, though amplified and enlarged with Prosyllogismes, after the manner
of Rhetoritians or Orators, it will yield the fruit aforce remembered. There
are in our books extant of both, as namely, by Conisby, to prove that a man
might grant his lease for years without Deed, uses this plain and express
Syllogism; whereof every Proposition being a Ground and Principle in the Law,
the conclusion 14. Hen. 7. 3. b.
necessarily does follow.

1 Mayor) Chose que ico poy prender in lease sans fait poiet passer horse de moy
sans fait.

2 Minor) Et un lease de terre pur term d'anus est bon sans fait.

3 Conclusio) Ergo per mesme le reason il poit passer horse del Lessee, and ceo
sans fait.

Likewise a question grew whether the heir or executor were to have a furnace
fixed unto the soil, 20 Hen. 7. 13. b.
or such chattells as were annexed to the freehold after the death of the
Testator, or no; where the Reporter puts down the opinion of Reed chief
Justice, Fisher, and Kingsmill, that the executors should not have the same
under the frame of this form of Syllogism; whereof every Proposition is a
Rule of Law.

1 Mayor) Ceux chooses que ne poient este forfeit per vtlary in personal
action, ne este attache in Assise ne distraine per le signor pur Rent, tiels
chooses executours naveront.

2 Minor) Mes un furnace ou table fix sur la terre, ou posses, ou un pale, ou
un covering de un lict merisme, ou board annex al franktenant, ou house and
fenesters, and auters tiels semblables queux sont annex al franktenement, and
sont fait, pur un profit del inheritance, ne poient este forfeit per utlary, ne
attache, ne distraine.

3 Conclusio) Ex consequenti sequitur que executours naveront tiels chooses.

As touching the second sort of Argument by Syllogism, in the Commentaries of
Plowden the same is very frequent and usual. And herein to take example out of
the first case, because it first comes to memory, All the said Argument of
Griffith in the case of Foggosa, may be reduced into this Syllogism set forth
in the entrance thereof.

Mayor) Chascun agreement covient este perfect, plein and compleite.

Minor) Et le evidence icy ne prove le agreement deste perfect, ne plain, ne
compleite, mes plus tossed un Communication ou parlance que un agreement.

The conclusion is suppressed for that it apparently follows of the premises,
until the end of the argument; where at last it is expressed in this manner.

Conclusio) Et issint le agreement est imperfect a doner action pur le subsedy
per que le agreement intend per le statute nest accomply.

The Mayor Proposition is amplified with this Prosyllogisme.

Car agreement concernant personal chooses, est un mutual assent des parties,
and doit este execute oue un recompense, ou auterment doit este cy certain and
sufficient que doit doner action, ou auter remedy pur recompense, and sil
issent nest, donquene sera dit agreement mes plus tossed un nude communication.

And this Proposition he proves by the cases thereafter by him alleged.

The Minor Proposition of the first Syllogism is there enlarged where he
further adds.

Et issint in nostre case entant que estatute de an. 1. Regis nunc, cap. 3.
etc. until the end of the case.

The like may be observed in every good and effectual argument; but we stand
not upon example.

A third profit may be considered herein: for manytimes it falls out, that we
perceive a coherence which therefore we know are applyable to our purpose; and
yet nevertheless, except we draw the unity of reason so found and considered
in the said cases, unto a short sentence, Ground, Rule, or Proposition, wherein
they may concur, and do agree; we shall be driven with long circumlocution
and many words, to make manifest our meaning in the allegation of the same,
especially if the cases do not concur and agree in one mediate reason or
likeness, but are upon some conformity further off, to be resembled each to
other. As for example.

These three cases greatly do differ both in the circumstance of matter, and
in the immediate reasons, and yet nevertheless have some resemblance, and a
kind of conformity and likeness, between them each to other.

1 First they all concern the King.

2 Secondly the King in every of them is restrained from that power or benefit
that his subject has. For

1 In the first, he cannot arrest one as his subject may.

2 In the second he shall lose that debt which his subject, in whose right he
claims it, shoud recover.

3 In the third he shall not be received where the subject might.

And lastly in every of these cases, if the King should be admitted to do as
a common person might, the subject in suite with him should sustain great
prejudice. For

1 In the first he should not be permitted to punish the injury done to his
person.

2 In the second he should lose the benefit of waging his Law. And

3 In the third and last have his Action debated without his default.

The likeness of which cases cannot so well be conceived without many words,
except we reduce unto some general Axiom the unity and resemblance of reason
found in them. And therefore this Proposition without more might have sufficed
for all.

Where the subject by reason of some Prerogative that is in the King, should
otherwise be put to a prejudice; there the king shall not be allowed that
benefit which every of his subjects by law enjoys.

In which general Axiom or Rule, a general reason of all the said several
Cases does equally concur.

By this observation we may reap likewise a Bracton has borrowed Bracton li.
1. cap. 1. (...). 3.
out of the Civil Law, Omnia habere in memoria, ct in nulio errare, diuinum
est potius quam humanum. Wherefore when the Case is out of memory, and the
circumstances thereof quite forgot, the Reason yet remains, and is had in
memory. For, Memoria Intellectiua est vniuersalium, vt est ipsemet Intellectus.

It is not the Case ruled this way, nor that way but the reason which makes
Law; For, Non quid sit intelligere Math. Gribal dus deratione study Juris lib.
1. cap. 4.
sufficiat, sed cursit diligentius inquiratur. So that he which by observation
of these Grounds and Principles, remembers but the reason (as he easily may)
shall so sufficiently resolve all doubts of like degree, as if he had
remembered the express Cases from which the same Reason is deduced. Although in
argument, I confess not only the General Reasons, but likewise the special
Cases are as proofs produced and alleged.

Lastly, since the chosen and collected Propositions use behooves to be
committed to writing; we may easily without great trouble, by disposing of them
orderly, frame a Directory, in manner either of a methodicall Treause, or of an
Alphabeticall Table, fit and conuement both for the speedy finding of that we
would seek, and the ready having of that we can wish for, surpassing the
benefit of any Abridgement hereto fore extant.

And thus much touching the commodities growing by the consideration and
collection of Principles, Rules, Axioms, Grounds, and Maxims: and of the
scope and end whereunto they tend in managing of our Laws, as well for the
behoof of the Student, and for the use of the Practiser. And now remains
that a few words be said to forewarne both, of certain abuses ordinarily bred
herein.

1 The first Abuse is, that neither the Ground often times produced does come
near the Reason of the Case, in question; nor the Cases alleged to prove and
fortify that Ground, do directly confirm the same. A fault very usual in
public exercises; and may be redressed if we do call to mind that any Case
alleged ought not to be wrested to prove the Rule or Ground alleged; but
the Rule, Ground, or Principle ought to be the very immediate or secondarie
reason of the Cases whence, it is drawn, and which Cases are brought to
confirm the same, in such sort that all the Cases alleged do concur in
equality of reason, likeness, and proportion; and in full proof of the
Principle so produced. And that the Ground or Principle be a reason of the
question in variance, to subvert or confirm the same. Wherein also let this be
weighed, that a few Principles cannot sufficiently serve to supply all
occasions in that behalf, but the same must be drawn and deduced of all
Causes, Titles, and matters in the Law fit for argument and ves.

2 A second principal oversight is this. Many to prove their opinion in the
controversy proposed, frame their reason rightly from some notable Ground, and
known Principle or Rule, which though it be well applied, yet not regarding
the manifold Exceptions whereunto the same Principle is subject, they do set
it forth so general, that it gives their adversary some cause of challenge
and cavil thereunto, by obiecting some instance or cases upon exception of the
said Rule: and thereby does not only seem to enfeeble the same, in showing
the fallacies thereof; but sometime in show, weakeneth the whole reason and
argument grounded thereupon.

3 The third abuse of these Principles or Propositions, is, in the two much
frequenting and often needless use of them. For sometimes the obscurity of
the Cause, may require some other manner of argument, drawn from places of
invention, which may content and satisfy the mind of the hearers much better.
And sometimes the clearenesse of the matter it self, needs not such
preparation of proof and confirmation of those Principles and Rules. For then
is the most and best of them, when that both Propositions and Cases to confirm
the same, have great coherence with the question; when both the circumstance of
the Case in question, and the cause of doubt, do give occasion to use them; so
that which thereby is affirmed, may rightly be reducible to the purpose.

4 Finally, it sometimes falls out to be a fault overmuch to abound in well
doing. Omne Nimium vertitur in vitium, says the Proverb; for sundry times it
happens, that it is very convenient and direct to the matter to make argument
upon a well applied Prnciple, Rule or Ground, which by men of great learning
and reading is sometimes so sufficiently handled, with such abundance and ample
furniture of notable and direct Cases, that their endeavor herein deserves
high commendations: yet more convenient were it, that their pains were less.
For to what purpose behooves it, to heap Case upon Case, as it were one on
the neck of another, Pelion upon Ossa? Whereas many probable reasons, though
confirmed with few good Cases, breed greater contentation to the hearer, by
reason of the several proof made thereby then many Cases.

THE USE OF THE LAW, And wherein it Principally Consists.
THE Use of the Law, consists principally in those Three things:

1 To secure Men's persons from Death and Violence. 2 To dispose the property
of Goods and Lands. 3 For preservation of their good Names from shame and
Infamy.
FOr safety of persons, the Law provideth, Surety to keep the Peace.
that any man standing in fear of another, may take his Oath before a Justice
of Peace, that he stands in fear of his life, and the Justice shall compel
the other to be bound with Suerties to keeps the Peace.

If any man Beat, wound or maime Action of the Case, for Slander, Battery,
etc.
another, or give false scandalous words that may touch his Credit, the Law
gives thereupon an action of the Case, for the slander of his good name; and
an Action of Battery, or an appeal of Maime, by which recompense shall be
recovered, to the value of the hurt, damage or danger.

If any man kill another with malice, Appeal of Murder given to the next of
kin.
the Law gives an appeal to the wife of the dead, if he had any, or to the
next of kin that is Heir in default of a Wife, by which appeal the
Defendant convicted is to suffer Death, and to loose all his Lands and Goods;
But if the Wife or Heir will not sue or be compounded withal, yet the King
is to punish the offense by Indictment or Presentment of a lawful inquest and
trial of the Offenders before competent Judges; whereupon being found guilty,
he is to suffer Death, and to loose his lands and goods.

If one kill another upon a sudden Manslaughter, and When a forfeiture of
Goods, and When not.
quarrel, this is Man slaughter, for which the Offender must dye, except he
can read; and if he can read, yet must he loose his goods, but no lands.

And if a man kill another in his own defense, he shall not loose his Life,
not his Lands, but he must loose his Goods; except the party slain did first
assault him, to kill, rob, or trouble him by the Highway side, or in his
own House, and then he shall loose nothing.

And if a man kill himself, all his Felon: de Se.
Goods and Chattels are forfeited, but no Lands.

If a man kill another by misfortune, as Felony by mischance.
shooting an Arrow at a Butt or mark, or casting a Stone over an house or the
like, this is loss of his goods and Chattels, but not of his lands, nor life.

If a Horse, or Cart, or a Beast, or any Deodand.
other thing do kill a man, the Horse, Beast or other thing is forfeited to
the Crown, and is called a Deodand, and usually granted and allowed by the
King to the Bishop Almner, as goods are of those that kill themselves.

The Cutting out of a man's Tongue, or Cutting out of Tongues and putting out of
Eyes, made Felony.
putting out his Eyes maliciously, is Felony; for which the offender is to
suffer Death, and loose his lands and goods.

But, for that all Punishment is for Examples sake. It is good to see the
means whereby Offenders are drawn to their punishment; and first for matter
of the Peace.
THe ancient Laws of England planted here by the Conqueror, were, that
there should be Officers of two sorts in all the parts of this Realm to
preserve the Peace:

1. Constabularij Pacis. 2. Conservatores Pacis.

The Office of the Constable was, to arest The Office of the Constable.
the parties that he had seen breaking the Peace, or in fury ready to break
the peace, or was truly informed by others, or by their own consession, that
they had freshly broken the peace; which persons he might imprison in the
Stocks, or in his own house, as his or their quality required, until they
had become bounden with sureties to keep the peace; which obligation from
thenceforth, was to be sealed and delivered to the Constable to the use of the
King. And that the Constable was to send to the Kings Exchequer or Chancery,
from whence Process should be awarded to leauy the debt, if the peace were
broken.

But the Constable could not arrest any, nor make any put in Bond upon
complaint of threatening only; except they had seen them breaking the peace,
or had come freshly after the peace was broken. Also, these Constables should
keep watch about the Town, for the apprehension of Rogues and Vagabonds, and
Night-walkers, and Euesdroppers, Scouts and such like, and such as go Armed.
And they ought likewise, to raise hue and cry against Murderers, Manslayers,
Thieves and Rogues.

Of this Office of Constable 2. High Constables for every hundred.

were in ancient time all appointed by the Sheriff of the Shiere yearly in
his Court called the Sheriffs Turn, and there they received their oath. But
at this day they are appointed either in the Law day of that Precinct wherein
they serve, by the high Constable; or in the Sessions of the peace.

The Sheriffs Turn is a Court very The Kings Bench first instituted, and in
what matters they anci ancuntly had Inrisatction in.
ancient, incident to his Office. At the first, it was crected by the
Conqueror, and called the King's Bench, appointing men studied in the Knowledge
of the Laws to execute Justice as substitutes, to him in his name, which men
are to be named, Iusticiarij ad placita coram Rege assignati. One of them
being Capitalis Iusticiarius called to his fellows, the rest in number as
pleases the King, of late but three, Insticiarij holden by Patent. In this
Court every man above twelve years of age, was to take his Oath of Allegiance
to the King, if he were bound, then his Lord to answer for him. In this Court
the Constables were appointed and sworn; breakers of the peace punished by
fine and imprisonment, the parties beaten or hurt recompensed upon complaints
of damages, All appeals of Murder, Maime, Robbery decided, contempts against
the Crown, public annoyances against the people, Treasons and Felonies and
all other matters of wrong, betwixt party and party for Lands and goods.

But the King seeing the Realm grow Court of Marshalsee erected, and its
Jurisaiction within 12. miles of the chief Tunnel of the King, which is the
full extent of the Virge.
daily more and more populous, and that this own Court could not dispatch all:
did first ordain that his Marshall should keep a Court, for Controversies
arising within the Virge. Which is within xij. miles of the chiefest Tunnell of
the Court, which did but ease the Kings Bench in matters only concerning
debts, Conenants and such like, of those of the Kings household only, never
dealing in breaches of the Peace, or concerning the Crown by any other
persons, or any pleas of Lands. Insomuch, as the King for further ease having
divided this Kingdom into Counties, and committing the Charge of every County
to a Lord or Earl; did direct, that those Earls within their limits should
look to the matter Sheriffs Turn instituted upon the division of England
into Counties, the charge of this Court was committed to the Earl of the same
County, this was likewise called Curia Visus fra. pleg.
of the peace, and take charge of the Constables, and reform public
annoyances, and swear the people to the Crown, and take pledges of the
Freemen for their Allegiance, for which purpose the County did once every
year keep a Court, called the Sheriffs Turn. At which all the County
(except Women, Clergy, Children under 12. and not aged above 60.) did appear
to give or renew their pledges for Allegiance. And the Court was called, Curio
Franciplegij, A view of the pledges of Freemen; or, Turnus Comitatus.

At which meeting or Court, there fell Subdiuision of the County Court into
Hundreds.
by occasion of great Assemblies much bloodshed, scarcity of Victuals,
Mutinies and the like mischiefs; which are incident to the Congregations of
people, by which the King was moved to allow a subdiuision of every County
into Hundreds, and every Hundred to have a Court, whereunto the people of every
Hundred, should be assembled twice a year for surueigh of Pledges, and use of
that Justice which was formerly executed in that grand Court for the County;
and the Court or Earl appointed a Bayliffe under him to keep the hundred
Court. But in the end, the Kings of this Realm found it necessary to have all
execution of Justice immediately for themselves, by such as were more bound
then Earls The charge of the County taken from the Earls, and committed
yearly to such persons as it pleased the King.
to that service, and readily subject to correction for their negligence or
abuse; and therefore, took to themselves the appointing of a Sheriff yearly
in every County calling, them Vicecomit. and to them directed such writs and
precepts for executing Justice in the County, as fell out needful to have
been dispatched, committing to the Sheriff Custodium Comitatus; by which the
Earls were spared of their toils and labors, and that was laid upon the
Sheriffs. So The Sheriff is Judge of all Hundred Courts not given away from
the Crowns.
as now, the Sheriff does all the Kings business in the County, and that is
now called, the Sheriffs Turn; that is to say, he is Judge of this grand
Court for the County, and also of all Hundred Courts not given away from the
Crown.

He has another Court, called the County Court kept monthly by the Sheriff.
County Court, belonging to his office, wherein men may sue monthly for any
debt or damages under 401. and may have writs for to repleuie their cattle
distrained and impounded for others, and there try the cause of their
distress; and by a writ called Iusticies, a man may sue for any sum, and in
this Court the Sheriff by a writ, called an Exigent, does proclaim men sued
in Courts above, to render their bodies, or else they be Outlawed.

This Sheriff does serve the Kings The Office of the Sheriff.
writs of Process, be they Sommons, Attachments to compel men to answer to
the Law, and all writs of execution of the Law, according to Judgments of
Superior Courts, for taking of Men's Goods, Lands, or Bodies as the cause
requires.

The Hundred Courts, were most of Hundred Courts to whom they were at first
granted.
them granted to Religious Men, Noble men, others of great place. And also
many men of good quality have attained by chance, and some by usage within
Manors of their own liberty of keeping. Law days, and to use their Justice

Whosoever is Lord of the Hundred Lord of the Hundred to appoint two High

Court, is two appoint two high Constables of the Hundred, and also is to
appoint in every Village, a petty Constable with a Tithingman to attend in his
absence, and to be at his Commandment when he is present in all services of
his office for his assistance.

There has been by use and Statute Law (besides surueying of the Pledges of
Freemen and giving the oath of Allegiance, and making Constables, many
addictions of powers and authority given to the Stewards of leets and Lawdayes
to be put in ure in their Courts; as for example, may punish Inne-keepers,
Bakers, Butchers, Poulterers, Fishmonger, and Tradesmen of all sorts, selling
with under weights or measures or excessive prizes, or things unwholesome, or
ill made in deceit of the people. They may punish those that do stop straiten
or annoy the high ways, or do not according to the provision enacted repair
or amend them, or divert water courses, or destroy frey of Fish, or Of what
matters they enquire of in leets and Law days.
use engines or nets to take Dear, Conies, Phesants or Partridges, or build
Pigion houses; except he be Lord of the Manor, or Parson of the Church. They
may also take presentment upon Oath of the xij sworn Jury before them; but
they cannot try the Malefactors, only they must by Indenture deliver over
those presentiments of felony to the Judges, when they come their circuits into
that County. All those Courts before mentioned are in use, and exercised as
Law at this day, concerning the Sheriffs Law days and leets, and the offices
of High Constables, pettie-Constables, and Tithingmen; howbeit, with some
further addictions by Statute laws, laying charge upon them for taxation for
poor, for Soldiers and the like, and dealing without corruption and the like.

Conservators of the Peace were in ancient Conseruators of the Peace called by
the Kings writ for term of their lines, or at the Kings pleasure.
times certain, which were assigned by the King to see the Peace maintained,
and they were called to the Office by the the Kings writs, to continue for
term of their lives, or at the Kings pleasure.

For this Service, choice was made of Conseruators of the Peace and what their
Office was.
the best men of calling in the County, and but few in the Shire. They might
bind any man to keep the Peace and to good behavior, by Recognizance to the
King with suerties, and they might by Warrant send for the party, directing
their warrant to the Sheriff or Constable, as they please, to arest the party
and bring him before them. This they used to do, when complaint was made by
any, that he stood in fear of another, and so took his Oath; or else, where
the Conseruator himself did without oath or complaint, see the disposition of
any man inclined to quarrel and breach of the Peace, or to misbehaue himself
in some out-ragious manner of force or fraud. There by his own Discretion he
might send for such a fellow, and make him find Suerties of the peace or of his
good behavior, as he should see cause; or else commit him to the Goal if he
refused.

The Judges of either Bench in Westminster, Conseruators of the Peace by virtue
of their Office.
Barons of the Exchequer, Master of the Rolls, and Justices in Eire and
Affizes in their circuits, were all without writ Conseruators of the Peace in
all Shires of England, and continue to this day.

But now at this day, Conseruators of Justices of Peace ordained in lieu of

Peace, assigned by the Kings Co^missions in every County, which are moveable
at the Kings pleasure; but the power, of placing and displacing Justices of the
Peace, is by use Deligated from the King to the Chancellor.

That there should be Justices of Peace by Commissions, it was first enacted by
a Statute made 1. Ed. 3. and their Authority augmented by many statutes made
since in every Kings reign.

They are appointed to keep four Sessions The power of the Just. of Peace, to

The Justices of Peace are many in every County, and to them are brought all
Traitors Felons and other malefactors of any sort upon their first
apprehension, and that Justice to whom they are brought, examineth them, and
hears their accusations, but judges not upon it; only if heo find the
suspicion but light, then he takes bond with sureties of the accused, to
appear either at the next Assizes, if it be a matter of Treason or Felony; Or
else at the quarter Sessions, if it be concerning Riot or mis-behauior or some
other small offense. And he also binds to appear then those that give

of the accused is dept into according to Law for his clearing.

But if the party accused, seem upon pregnant matter in the accusation and to
the Justice to be guilty, and the offense heinous, or the Offender taken with
the manner, then the Justice is to commit the party by his warrant called a
Mittimus to the Jailer of the common Goal of the County, there to remain
until the Assizes. And then the Justice is to certify his Accusation,
Examination, and Recognizance taken for the appearances and prosecution of the
witnesses, so as the Judges may when they come readily proceed with him as the
Law requires.

The Judges of the Assizes as they be Judges of Assize come in place of the

the Common pleas, yet the Judges of Circuits have 5. Commissions by which they
sit.

The first is, a Commission of Oyer and Oyer and Terminer in which the Judges
are of the Quorum, and this is the largest Commission they have.
Termnier directed unto them, and many others of the best account, in their
Circuit; But in this Commission the Judges of Assize are of the Quorum, so as
without them there can be no proceeding.

This Commission gives them power to deal with Treasons, Murderers, and all
manner of Felonies and Misddemeanours whatsoever; and this is the largest
Commission that they have.

The second is a Commission of Goal Goal delivery directed only to the
Judges themselves, and the Clearke of the Assize.
Delivery; That is, only to the Judges themselves, and the Clearke of the
Assize assotiate, And by this Commission they are to deal with every Prisioner
in the Goal, for what offense soever he be there. And to proceed with him
according to the Laws of the Realm, and the quality of their offense; And
they cannot by this Commission do any thing concerning any man, but those that
are Prisoners in the Goal. The course now in use of Execution of this
Commission of Goal Delivery, is this. There is no Prisoner but is committed by
some Justice of Peace, who before he committed took his examination, and bound
his accusers and witnesses to appear and prosecute at the Goal delivery. This
Justice does certify these examinations and bonds, and thereupon the Accuser
is called solemnly into the Court; and when he appears hec is willed to
prepare a Bill of indictment against the Prisoner, and go with it to the
grand-Iury, and give evidence upon their oaths he and the witnesses, which he
does; and then the Grand Jury write thereupon either Billa vera, and then the
Prisoner stands indicted, or else Ignoramus, then he is not touched. The
Grand Jury deliver these The mannerof the proceedings of the Justices of
Circuits in their Circuits.
Bills to the Judges in their Court, and so many as they find indorsed Billa

to him, and they ask him whether he be guilty or not; if he The course now in

say not guilty, then he is asked how he will be tried, he answers, by the
Country. Then the Sheriff is commanded to return the names of 12. Freeholders
to the Court, which Freeholders be sworn to make true delivery between the
King and the Prisoner, and then the indictment is again read and the witnesses
sworn, and speak their knowledge concerning the fact, and the Prisoner is
heard at large, what defense he can make, and then the Jury go together and
consult. And after a while they come in with a verdict of guilty or not
guilty, which verdict the Judges do record accordingly. If any Prisoner plead
not guilty upon the indictment and yet will not put himself to trial upon the
Jury, (or stand mure) he shall be pressed.

The Judges when many prisoners are in the Goal do in the end before they
go, peruse every one. Those that were indicted by Grand Jury, and found not
guilty by the select Jury, they judge to be quitted, and so deliver them out
of the Goal. Those that are found guilty by both Iuries they Judge to death
and command the Sheriff to see execution done. To those that refuse trial by
the Country, or stand mute upon the ind ctment, they judge to be pressed to
death, some whose offenses are pilfring under twelve pence value, they judge to
be whipped. Those that confess their ind ctments, they judge to death,
whipping or otherwise, as their offense requires. And those that are not
indicted at all, but their bill of indictment returned with Ignoramus by the
grand lury and all other in the Goal, against whom no bills at all are, they
do acquit by proclamation out of the Goal; That one way or other they rid
the Goal of all the prisoners in it, But because some prisoners have their
books and burned in the hand and so delivered, It is necessary to show the
reason thereof. This having their books is called their Clergy, with in
ancient time began thus.

For the scarcity of the Clergy in the Book allowed to Clergic for the
scarcity of them to be disposed in Religious Houses.
Realm of England to be disposed in Religious houses, or for Priests, Deacons
and Clerks of parishes, there was a prreogatiue allowed to the Clergy, that
if any man that could read or were a Clerk, were condemned to death, the
Bishop of the Diocese, might if he would claim him as a clerk, and he was to
see him tried in the face of the Court.

Whether he could read or not the book was prepared and brought by the Bishop,
and the Judge was to turn to some place as he should think meet, and if the
prisoner could read them then the Bishop was to have him delivered over unto
him to dispose of in some places of the Clergy, as he should think meet.
But if either the Bishop would not demand him: or that the Prisoner could not
read, then was he to be put to death.

And this Clergy was allowable in the Concerning the allowing of the Clergy

The 3. Commission, that the Judges of Circuits have, is, a Commission directed
to themselves only to take Assizes by which they are called Justices of
Assize, and the Office of those Justices is to do tight upon Writs called
Assizes, brought before them by such as are wrongfully thrust out of their
Lands. Of which number of writs there was far greater store brought before
them in ancient times then now it is, for that men's seizons and possessions are
sooner recovered by sealing Leases upon the ground, and by bringing an
Eiectione firm, and trying their title so, then by the long suites of Assizes.

The 4. Commission, is commission to take Nisi 4. Commission is to take Nisi

Courts, the Kings Bench, Common Pleas, or the Exchequer Nisi Prius.
here above, and the parties in their pleadings do vary in a point of fact;
As for example, If an action of Debt or Trespass grown for taking away goods,
the Defendant denies that he took them, or in an action of the Case for
slanderous words, the Defendant denies that he spoke them.

Then the Plaintiff is to maintain and prove them, that the obligation is the
Defendants deed, that he either took the goods, or spoke the words, the Law
says, that Issue is joined betwixt them, which issue of the Fact is to be
tried by a Jury of Twelve men of the County, where it is supposed by the
Plaintiff the prises to be done, and for that purpose the Judges of the Court
do award a writ of Venire fac: in the Kings name to the Sheriff of that
County, commanding Uen fac. pr. 24. Freeholders.

certain day to try this issue joint, out of which four and twenty only
Twelve are chosen to serve, and that double number is returned, because some
may make default, and some be challenged upon kindred, alliance, or partial
dealing.

These four and twenty, the Sheriff does name and certify to the Court, and
withal that he has warned them to come at the day according to their writ.
But because at his first summons there falls no punishment upon the four and
twenty if they come not, they very seldom or never appear upon the first
Writ, and upon their default there is another Writ Distringas.

writ, which is the next day after the Nisi prius Iusticiarij nostri ad Assizas

execution of their Commission concerning the taking of Nisi prius.
etc. of which words the writ is called a Nisi prius, and the Judges of the
circuit of that County in that varatis and mean time before the day of
appearance appointed for the Jury above, have their Commission of Nisi prius,
authority to take the appearance of the Jury of the County before them, and
there to hear the Witnesses and proofs on both sides concerning this issue of
fact, and to take the verdict of the Jury, and against the day they should have
appeared above, which to return the verdict read in the Court above, return
is called Postea. Postea.


And upon this verdict clearing the matter in Fact, one way or other, the
Judges above give judgment for the party for whom the verdict is found, and
for such damages and costs as the Jury does assesse.

By those trials called Nisi prius, the Iuries and the parties are eased much
of the charge they should be put to, by coming to London with their Evidences
and Witnesses, and the Courts of Westminster are eased of much trouble they
should have, if all the Iuries for trials should appear and try their causes
in those Courts; for those Courts have little leisure. Now though the Iuries
come not up, yet in matters of great weight or where the title is intricate or
difficult, the Judges above upon information to them do retain those causes
to be tried there, and the Iuries do at this day in such causes come to the
Bar at Westminster.

through the Circuit, is to attend in person the Judges all that time they be

misbehauiour in his Office before them; and the Judges above may also fine the
Sheriff for not returning sufficiently Writs before them.

Property in Lands is gotten and transferred by one to another, those four
manner of ways.
1 By Entry. 2 By Descent. 3 By Escheat. 4 Most usually by Conueyance.
1 Property by Entry is, where a man Ospropertie of Lands to be gained by
Entry.
finds a piece of Land that no other possesses or has title unto, and he
that finds it does enter, this Entry gains a Property; this Law seems to
be derived from this text, Terradedit filijs hominum, which is to be
understood, to those that will till and manure it, and so make it yield fruit;
and that is he that enters into it, where no man had it before. But this
manner of gaining Lands was in the first days and is not now of use in All
Lands in England were the Conquerours and apprepriated to him upon the Conquest
of England, and held of him except, 1. Religious and Church Lands. 2. The lands
of the men of Kent.
England, for that by the conquest all the Land of this Nation was in the
Conquerours hands, and appropriated unto him; except, Religious and
Church Lands, and the lands in Kent, which by composition were left to the
former owners, as the Conqueror found them, so that no man but the
Bishoprics, Churches, and the men of Kent, can at this day make any greater
title then from the Conquest to his Lands in England, and Lands possessed
without any such title are in the Crown and not in him that first enters; as
it is by Land left by the Sea, this Land belongs to the King and Land left by
the Sea belongs to the King.
not to him that has the Lands next adjoining which was the ancient Sea
Banks, This is to be understood of the inheritance of Lands: viz. That the
inheritance cannot be gained by the first entry. But an estate of Franckiut.
for an other man's life by our Laws, may at this day be gotten by entry. As a
man called A. having land conveyed unto him for the life of B. dies without
making any estate of it, there whosoever first enters into the Land, after the
decease of A. gets the property in the Land for time of continuance of the
estate which was granted to A. for the life of B. which B. yet lives, and
therefore the said Law cannot reuert to him. And to the heir of A. it cannot
go, for that it is not any state of inheritance but only Occupancie.
an estate for another man's life; which is not deseendable to the heir, except
he be specially named in the grant: viz. To him and his heirs. As for the
Exccutors of A. they cannot have it, for its not an estate testamentory that
should go to the Executors as goods and Chatrels should, so as in truth, no
man can entitle himself unto those Lands; and therefore, the Law prefers
him that first enters, and he is called Occupans and shall hold it during the
life of B. but must pay the rent, perform the conditions, and do no wast. And
he may by deed assign it to whom he please in his life time. But if he die,
before he assign it over, then it shall go again to him whomsoever enters.
And so all the life of B. so often as it shall happen.

Property of Lands by descent is, where Property of Lands by descent.
a man has Lands of inheritance and dies not disposing of them, but leaving
it to go as the Law casts it upon the heir. This is called descent of Land,
and upon whom the descent is to light, is the question. For which purpose the
Law of inheritance prefers the first Child before all others, and amongst
children the male before the female, and amongst males the first borne. If
there be no Children then the Brother, if no Brothers, then sisters, if
neither Brothers nor Sisters, then Uncles, and for lack of Uncles, Ants, if
none of them, then Couzens in the necrest degree of consanguinity, with these
three rules of diversities. 1. That the Eldest Of descent 3. rules.
male shall safely inherit; but if it come to females, then they being all in
an equal degree of neerenes shall inherit altogether Brother or Sister of the
half blood shall not inherit to his Brother or Sister but only as a child to
his Parents.
and are called Parceners, and all they make but one heir to the Ancestor. 2.
That no brother nor sister of the half blood shall inherit to his brother or
sister, but as a Child to his Parents, as for example. If a man have two wives,
and by either wife a son, the eldest son ouerliuing his Father is to be
preferred to the inheritance of the Father being Fee-simple; But if he enters
and dies without a child, the Brother shall not be his heir, because he is of
the half blood to him, but the Uncle of the eldest Brother or Sister of the
whole blood, yet if the eldest Brother had dyed in the life of the Father, then
the youngest Brother should inherit the Land that the Father had, although it
were a child by the second wife, before any daughter by the first. The third
rule about discents. That land purchased by the party himself that dies, is
to be inherited; first, by the heirs of the Fathers side, then if he have none
of that part by the heirs of the Mothers side. But Land descended to him from
his father or mother, are to go to that side only Descent.
from which they came, and not to the other side.

Those Rules of descent mentioned before are to be understood of Fee simples
and not of entailed Lands, and those rules are to be restrained by some
particular customs of some particular places: as namely, the custom of Kent,
that every male of equal degree of Childhood, Brotherhood or kindred, shall
inherit equally, Customs of certains places.
as daughters shall being Parceners, and in many Borough Towns of England,
the Custom allows the youngest son to inherit, and so the youngest
Daughter. The Custom of Kent is called Ganel kind. The Custom of Boroughes
Burgh English.

And there is another note to be observed in Fee-simple inheritance, and that
is, that every heir having Land or inheritance, be it by common Law or by
Custom is chargeable, so far forth as the value thereof extends with the
binding acts of the Ancestors from whom the inheritance descends; and these
acts are colaterall encombrances, and the reason of this charge is, Qui sentit
commodum sentire debet incommodum sieve onus. As for Every Heir having land is
bound by the binding Acts of his Aneestors if he be named.
example, if a man bind himself and his heirs in an obligation or do
Covenant by writing for him and his heirs, or do grant an Anuity for him and
his heirs, which warrantie in all these cases, the Law charge the heir
after the death of the Auncestor with this Obligation; Covenant, Annuitie,
Warrantie, Yet with these three Cautions. 1. That the party must by special
name bind himself and his heirs, or Covenant, grant, and warrant for himself
and his heirs; otherwise, the heir is not to be touched. Secondly, that some
action must be brought against the heir, Dier. 114. Plowden.
whilst the Land or other inheritance rests in him vnaliened away; For if the
Ancestor dye, and the heir before an action be brought against him, upon those
Bonds, Covenants, or Warranties, do alien away the Land, then the heir is
clean discharged of the Burden, except the Land was by fraud conveyed away of
purpose, to prevent the suite intended against him. Thirdly, that no heir is
further to be charged, then the value of the Land descended unto him, for the
same Ancestor that made the instrument of charge, and that Land also not to be
sold outright, but to be kept in extent and at a yearly value Dier. 149.
Plowden. Dauy and Pepps case.
until the debt or damage be run out, nevertheless, if an heir that is
sure upon such a debt of his Ancestor, do not deal clearly with the Court,
when he is sued; that is, if he come not immediately by way of confession and
set down the true quantity of his inheritance descended, and so submit
himself; therefore, as the Law requires. Then that heir that otherwise
demeaneth himself, shall be charged of his Heir charged for his false plea.
his own other Lands and goods, and of money for this deed of his Ancestor. As
for example. If a man bind himself and his heirs in an obligation, and dies
leaving but 10. Acres of Land to his heir, if his heir be sued upon the bond,
and comes in, and denies that he has any by descent, and it is found
against him by the verdict that he has 10. Acres, this heir shall be now
charges by his false plea of his own lands goods and body to pay the 100l.
although the 10. Acres be not worth 10l.

exceeding politic, and suitable to the state of a Conqueror.

Seeing his people to be part Normans, and part Saxons, the Normans he brought
with him, the Saxons he found here: he bent himself to inioyne them by

which interest of marriage went still employed, and does at this day in every

The second was to the end, that his Reservation that his tenant should keep a

which is a part of that service called Knights service.
people should still be conserved in warlike exercises and able for his
defense; when therefore, he gave any good Portion of Lands, that might make the
party of ability or strength, he with all reserved this service. That that
party and his heir having such Lands, should keep a horse of service
continually, and serve upon him himself when the King went to wars, or else
having impediment, to excuse his own person, should find an other to serve in
his place; which service of horse and man, is a part of that service called
Knights service at this day.

But if the Tenant himself be an Infant, the King is to hold this Land
himself until he come to full age, finding him meat, drink, apparel, and
other necessaries, and finding a horse and a man, with the overplus to serve in
the wars, as the Tenant himself should do if he were at full age.

But if this inheritance descend upon a woman, that cannot serve by her sex,
then the King is not to have the Lands, she being of 14. years of age, because
she is then able to have an husband, that may do the service in person.

tenure de per sona Regis and Caput, being called the chiefest part of the

noted, that as this tenure by Capite in Knights service generally was a great
safety to the Crown, so also the Conqueror instituted Tenants by Grand

Revenues by continual Service of Ploughing his Land, repairing his Houses,
Parkes pales, Castles and the like. And sometimes to a yearly provision of
Gloves, Spurs, Hawks, Horses, and Hounds and the like; which kind of
reseruations are called also tenures in Chief or in Capite of the King, but
they are not by Knights service. But such things as the Tenants may hire
another to do or provide for his money. And this Tenure is called a tenure by
Soccage in Capite, the word Soccagium signifying the Plough, The institution of
Soccage in Capite and What it is now turned into moneys reuts.
howbeit in this later time, the Service of Ploughing the land is turned into
money rent, and so of Harvest works, for that the Kings do not keep their
Demeasne in their own hands as they were wont to Ancient Demeasne Texure, What?
do, yet what Lands were De antiquo Dominico Corona, it well appears in the
Records of the Exchequer called the book of Dommesday. And the Tenants by
ancient Demeasne, have many Innuities and Privileges at this day, that in
ancient times were granted unto those Tenants by the Crown, the particulars
whereof are too long to set down.

These Tenures in Capite, as well as that by Soccage, as the others by Knights
service have this property; that the ancient Tenants cannot alien their Lands
without license of the King, if he do, the King is to have a Fine for the
contempt, and may seize the land, and retain it until the fine be paid. And
the reason is, because the King would have a liberty in the choice of his
Tenant, so that no man should presume to enter into those Lands and hold them
(for which the King was to have those special services done him) without the
Kings leave; This license and fine as it is now disgested is easy and of
course.

By example and resemblance of the How Manors were at first created. Manors
created by great men in imitation of the policy of the King in the
institutions of tenures.
Kings policy in these Institutions of Tenures; the Great men and Gentlemen of
this Realm did the like so near as they could; as for example, when the King
had given to any of them two thousand Acres of Land, this party purposing in
this place to make his dwelling (or as the old word is) his Mansion house; or
his Manor house, did devise how he might make his Land a Complete habitation
to supply him with all manner of necessaries, and for that purpose, he would
give of the outtermost parts of two thousand Acres, 100. or 200. Acres or more
or Knights service tenure reserved to common persons.

reservation of rent to find a horse for the Wars, and go with him when he
went with the King to the Wars, adding vow of Homage, and the Oath of
Fealty, Wardship, Marriage, and relief. Knights Service Tenure created by the
Lord is not a Tenure by Knights service of the person of the Lord, but of his
Manor.
Relief is 5l. to be paid by every Tenant by Knights service to his Lord upon
his entrance respectively for every Knights fee descended.
This Relief is to pay five pound for every Knights Fee, or after the rate for
more or less at the entrance of every Heir, which Tenant so created and
placed, was and is to this day called a Tenant by Knights Service, and not by
his own person, but of his Manors; of these he might make as many as he
would. Then this Lord would provide that the Land which he was to keep for
his own use, should be ploughed, and his Harvest brought home, his House
repaired, his Park pailed and the like, Soccage Tenure reserved by the Lord.
and for that end would give some lesser parcels to sundry others, of twenty,
thirty, forty or fifty Acres; reserving the service of ploughing a certain
quantity or so many clayes of his Land, and certain Harvest works or days
in the Harvest to labor or to repair the House, Park, Pale, or otherwise, or
to give him for his Provision, Capons, Hens, Pepper, Commin, Roses,
Gillyflowers; Spurs, Gloves, or the like; or to pay him a certain rent, and
to be sworn to be his faithful Tenant, which Tenure was called a soccage
Tenure, and is so to this day, howbeit most of the ploughing and harvest
services, are turned into money rents.

or other profit to the Lord. The remainder of the two thousand Acres he kept
to himself, which he used to manure by his bondmen, and appointed them at the
Courts of his Manor how they should hold it, making an entry of it into the
Roll of the Remembrances of the Acts of the Court, yet still in the Lords power

gained a custom by use of occupying their Lands, they now are called
Coppie-holders, and are so privileged, that the Lord cannot put them out, and

Court, he was to be informed by oath of his Tenants, of of all such duties,

which is called a Court Baron, and herein a Tennant may sue for any debt or

Lords of the duties of rents and services unpaid to him from his Tennants. By
this course it is discerned who be the Lords of lands, such as if the Tennants

therefore awarded to the Sheriff, who not finding him returns Non est

Sheriff, who likewise not finding him makes the same return, then a Writ
called an Exigent is directed to the Sheriff, commanding him to Proclaim him
in his County Court five several Court days to yield his body, which if the
Sheriff do, and the party yield not his body, he is said by the Default to
be Outlawed, the Coroners there adjudging him Outlawed, and the Sheriff
making the return of the Proclamations and of the judgment of the Coroners,

Treason by outlawry, but upon attainder of felony by outlawry, since it has
been much doubted by the Lawbookes, whether the Lords title by escheat shall
relate back to the time of the offense done, or only to the date or left of

great, for by that means, the Land being so sure tied upon the heir as that
his Father could not put it from him, it made the Son to be disobedient,
negligent, and wastfull; often marrying withoutthe Fathers consent, and to grow
insolent in vice; knowing, that there could be no cheek of dis-inheriting
him. It also made the owners of the Land less fearful to commit Murders,
Felonies, Treasons, and Manslaughters; for that they knew, none of these acts
could hurt the Heir of of his inheritance. It hindered men that had intayled
Lands, that they could not make the best of their Lands by fine and
improuement, for that none upon so uncertain an estate, as for term of his
own life would give him a fine of any value, nor lay any great stock upon the
Land, that might yield rent improued.

But it is be noted, since these notable Of the new devise called a

Statutes and remedies provided by Statutes do dock Entayles, there is start
up a device called Perpetuity, which is an Entayle with an addition of a

should stand, would bring in all the former inconveniences subject to Entayles,

necessity to join both in a Sale of the Land, or a great part of it to pay

for any good purpose of well seating himself, by selling that which lies
far off to buy that which is nearer, or for the advancement of his Daughters
or younger Sons, should have reasonable cause to sell the Perpetuity if it
should hold good, restrains him. And more then that, where many are owners of
inheritance of Land nor Entayled, may during the minority of his Eldest son
appoint the profics, to go to the advancement of the younger Sons and pay
Debts by Entayle and Perpetuities, the owners of these Lands cannot do it, but
they must suffer the whole to descend to his eldest Son, and so to come to
the Crown by Wardship all the time of his Infancy.

Wherefore seeing the dangerous times Quere whether it be better to restrain
men by those Perpetuities from alienations or to hazard the undoing of houses

and untowardly Heirs, they might prevent those mischiefs of undoing their
Houses by conueying the Land from such heirs, if they were not tied to the
stake by those Perpetuities, and restrained from Forfeiting to the Crown, and
disposing of it to their own or to their Childrens good. Therefore, it is
worthy of consideration, whether it be better for the Subject and Sovereign
to have the lands secured to men's Names and Bloods by perpetuities, with all
inconveniences aboue-mentioned, or to be in hazard of undoing his House by
unthrifty posterity.

The last and greatest Estate of Lands in The last and greatest Estate in Land
is Fee-simple.
Fee-simple, and beyond this there is none of the former for Lives, Years or
Entayles; but beyond them, is Fee simple. For it is the greatest, last and
uttermost degree of Estates in Land; therefore he that makes a Lease for
life, or a gift in tail, may appoint a remainder when he makes another for
life or in tail, or to a third in Fee-simple; but after a Fee-simple he
cannot limit no other Estate. A remainder cannot be limited upon an estate in
Feesimple.
And if a man do not dispose of the Fee-simple by way of remainder, when he
makes the gift in tail, or for lives, then the Fee-simple rests in
himself as a Reuertion. The difference between a The difference between a

which is, where by Deed Lands are given to one and his heirs, and Liuerie and
Seizein made accordingly to the form and effect of the Deed, if a lesser
estate then Fee-simple be given and liuerie of seizein made it is not called a
Feofment, except the Fee-simple be conveyed.

A Fine is a real agreement, beginning thus, Haec est finalis Corcordia etc.
This is What a Fine is, and how Lands may be conveyed hereby.

that a man should have from another to him and his Heirs, or to him for his
Life, or to him and the heirs males of his body, or for years certain,
whereupon rent may be reserved but no Condition or Covenants. This Fine is a
Record of great credit, and upon this Fine arc four Proclamations made openly

Fine is called a Feofment of Record, because that Fine is a Feofment of Record.
it includes all that the Feofment does, and works further of his own
nature, and barreth Intailes peremptorily whether the heir does claim within
five years or not, if he claim by him that leauied the Fine.

Recoueries are where for assurances of Lands the parties do agree, that one
shall What Recoueries are.
begin an Action real against the other, as though he had good right to the
Land, and the other shall not enter into Defense against it, but allege that
he bought the Land of he who had warranted unto him, and pray that I. H. may be
called in to defend the Title, which I. H. is one of the Cryers of the Common
Pieas, and is called the Common Voucher. This I. H. shall Common Voucher one of

appear and make as if he would defend it, but shall pray a day to be
assigned him in his matter of Defense; which being granted him at the Day he
makes Default, and thereupon the Court is to give judgment against him which
cannot be for him to loose his Lands, because he has it not; but the party
that he has sold it to, has that who vouched him to warrant it.

Therefore the Demaundant who has Judgment for the Demaundant against the
Tenant in tail.
no defense made against it, must have Judgment to have the Land against him
that he sued (who is called the Tenant) and the Tenant is to have Judgment
against l. H. to recover in value so much Judgment for the Tenant to recover
so much land in value of the Common voncher.
Land of his, where in truth he has none, nor never will. And by this Device
grounded upon the strict Principles of Law, the first Tenant loses the Land,
and has nothing for it; but it is his own agreement for assurance to him that
bought it.

This Recovery barreth Entayles, and A recovery barreth an Escheat tail and
all reuersions and remaindments thereupon.
all Remainders and reuersions that should take place after the Entayles,
saving where the King is giver of the Fntayle and keeps the Reuersion to
himself; then neither the Heir, nor the Remainder, nor Reuersion, is barred
by the recovery.

The reason why the Heirs, Remainders, The reason why a Common Recovery
barreth those in Remainder and Reversions.
and Reuersions are thus barred, is because in strict Law the recompense
adjudged against the Crier that was Vouchee, is to go in succession of Estate
as the Land should have done, and then it was not reason to allow the Heir the
liberty to keep the Land it self, and also to have recompense; and therefore
he loses the Land, and is to trust to the Recompense.

This fleight was first invented, when The many inco^veniencies of estates in
tail brought in these Recoveries, which are made now common conveyances and
assurances for Land.
Entayles fell out to be so inconvenient as is before declared, so that men
made no Conscience to cut them off, so they could find Law for it. And now by
use, those Recoveries are become common assurances against Entayles,
Remainders, and Reversions, and the greatest security Purchasers have for their
monyes; for a Fine will bar the Heir in tail, but not the Remainder, nor
Reversion, but a common Recovery will bar them all.

Upon Feofments and Recoveries, the Upon Fines, Feofments, and Recoveries, the
estate does settle according to the intent of the parties.
estate does settle as the use and intent of the parties is declared by word or
writing, before the Acts was done; As for example. If they make a writing, that
one of them shall leavie a Fine, make a Feosment, or suffer a common Recoverie
to the other; but the use and intent is, that one should have it for his life,
and after his decease, a stranger to have it in Tail, and then a third in
Fee-simple. In this case the Lord sets an estate according to the use and
intent declared; And that by reason of the Statute made 27. HENRY 8. Concerning
the Land in possession to him that has interest in the use or intent of the
Fine, Feosment, or Recoverie; according to the use and intent of the parties.

Upon this Statute is likewise grounded Bargains Sales and Covenant to stand
seized to a use, are all grounded upon one Statute.
the fourth and fifth of the six Conveyances, viz. Bargains, Sales, Covenants,

Condition, Rent and the like, as the use has.

The use is but the equity and Honesty What a use is.
to hold the Land in Canscientia boni viri. As for example. I and you agree
that I shall give you money for your Land, and you shall make no assurance of
it. I pay you the money, but you made me no assurance of it. Yet the equity
and Honesty to have it is with me; and this equity is called the Use, upon
which I had no remedy but in Chancerie, until this Statute made 27. HENRY 8.
and now Before 27. H. 8. there was no remedy for a use, but in Chancerie.
this Statute conjoyneth and contains the Land to him that has the use. I
for my money paid to you, have the Land it self, without any other Conveyance
from you; and is called a Bargain and Sale.

But the Parliament that made the Statute did foresee, that it would be
mischievous that men's Lands should suddenly The Stat. of 27. H. 8. does not
pass Land upon the payment of money without a deed indented and Enrolled.
upon the payment of a little money be taken from them, peradventure in an
Alehouse or a Tavern upon straineable advantages, did therefore gravely
provide an other Act in the same Parliament, that the Land upon payment of this
money should not pass away, except there were a Writing Indented, made
between the said two Parties, and the said Writing also within six Months,
Enrolled in some of the Courts at The Stat. of 27. of H. 8. extends not into
Cities and Corporate Towns where they did use to Enroll Deeds.
Westminster, or in the Sessions Rolls in the Shire, where the Land lies;
unless it be in Cities or Corporate Towns, where they did use to Enroll
Deeds, and there the Statute extends not.

The fifth Conveyance of a Fine; is a A conueyance to stand seized to a use.
Conveyance to stand seized to uses, it is in this sort; A man that has a Wife
and Children, Brethren and Kinsfolks, may by writing under his Hand, and
Seal; agree, that for him, they or any of their Heirs, he will stand seized
of his Lands to their uses, either for Life in Tail or Fee, so as he shall
see cause; upon which agreement in Writing, their arises an Upon an agreement
in writing to stand seized to the use of any of his kindred. A use may be
created and the estate of the land thereupon exccuted, by 27. H. 8.
Equity or Honesty, that the Land should go according to those agreements;
Nature and Reason, allowing these provisions, which Equity and Honesty is the
use. And the use being created in this sort, the Statute of 27, HENRY the
Eight, before mentioned; conteyneth the Estate of the Land, as the use is
appointed.

And so this Convenant to stand seized A Convenant to stand seized to a use
needs no Enrolment as a Bargain and Sale to ^se use does, so it be to the
use of Wife, Child, or Cozen, or one he means to marry.
to uses, is at this day since the said Statute, a Conveyance of Land, and with
this difference, from a Bargain and sale; in that this needs no Enrollment
as a Bargain and Sale does, nor needs it to be in writing Indented, as
Bargain and Sale must, and if the party to whose use he agrees to stand
seized of the Land, be not Wife, or Child, Cousen, or one that he means to
marry; then will no use rise, and so no Conveyance; for although, the Law
allows such weighty Considerations of Marriage and blood to raise uses, yet
does it not admit so trifling Considerations, as of Acquittance, Schooling,
Services, or the like.

But where a man makes an estate of Upon a Fine, Feofment or Recoverie, a man
may limit the use to whom he lists, without Consideration of blood, or
money. Otherwise, In a Bargain and Sale or Covenant.
his Land to others, by Fine, Feofment or Recoverie, he may then appoint the
use to whom he lists, without respect of Marriage, Kindred, Money or other
things; for in that case, his own Will and Consideration, guides the equity
of the Estate. It is not so when he makes no estate, But agrees to stand
seized, nor when he has taken anything, as in the cases of Bargain and Sale,
and Covenant to stand to uses.

The last of the six Conueyances, is a Of the continuance of Land by will.
Will in writing; which course of Conveyance, was first ordained by a Statute
made 32. HENRY S. Before which Statute, no man might give Land by will; except
it were in a Borrough-Towne, where there was an especial custom, that Men
might give their Lands by will; as in London, and many other places.

The not-giving of Land by Will, The not disposing of Lands by will, was
thought to be a defect at the Common Law.
was thought to be a defect at Common Law, that men unawares or sudainely
falling sick, had not power to dispose of their Lands, except they could make
a Feosment, or leavie a Fine, or suffer a Recoverie; which lack of time would
not permit, and for men to do it by these means, when they could not undo it
again, was hard; besides, even to the last hour of death, men's minds might
alter upon further proofs of their Children or Kindred, or increase of
Children or debt, or defect of Servants, or friends to be altered.

For which cause, it was reason that The Court that was invented before the
Stat. of 32. H. 8. which first gave power to devise Lands by Will, which was a
Conveyance of Lands to Feoffors in trust, to such persons as they should
declare in their Will.
the Law should permit him to Reserve to the last instant, the disposing of his
Lands, and to give him means to dispose it, which seeing it did not fidy
serve, men used this devise.

The conveyed their full estates of their Lands in their good health, to
friends in trust; properly called Feoffees in trust, and then they would by
their wills declare how their Friends should dispose of their Lands and if those
Friends would not perform it, the Court of Chancery was to compel them, by
reason of the trust; and this trust was called, the use of the Land; so as the
Feoffees had the Land, and the party himself had the use, which use was in
equity, to take the profits for himself, and that the Feoffees should make
such an estate as he should appoint them; and if he appointed none, then that
the use should go to the heir, as the estate it self of the Land should have
done, for the use was to the Estate, like a shadow following the body.

By this course of putting Lands into The inconveniences of putting Lands into
use.
use, there were many Inconveniences; as this use which grew first for a
reasonable cause, viz. To give men power and liberty to dispose of their owns,
was turned to deceive many of their just and reasonable rights; As namely, a
man that had cause to sue for his Land, knew not against whom to bring his
action, nor who was owner of it. The wife was defrauded of her thirds. The
Husband of being Tenant by courtesy. The Lord of his Wardship, Relief,
Heriot, and Escheat. The Creditor of his Extent for Debt. The poor Tenant of
his Lease; for these rights and duties were given by the Law from him that was
owner of the Land, and none other. Which was now the Feoffee of trust, and so
the old owner which we call the Feoffor should take the profits, and leave the
power to dispose of the Land at his diseretion to the Feoffee, and yet he was
not such a Tenant to be seized of the Land as his Wife could have Dower, or
the Lands be extended for his Debts, or that he could forfeit it for Felony
or Treason, or that his Heir could be in wars for it, or any duty of Tenure
fall to the Lord by his Death, or that he could make any Leases of it.

Which frauds by degrees of time as The frauds of conueyances to use by degrees
of time, as they increased, were remedied by the Statutes.
they increased, were remedied by diverse Statutes; as namely, by a Statute of
1. HENRY, 6. and 4. HENRY, 8. It was appointed 1. H. 8. Stat binding Cesty and

Which frauds nevertheless multiplying daily, in the end 27. HENRY 8. 27 H 8.

the Parliament purposing to take away all those Uses, and reducing the Law to
the the ancient form of Conveying of Lands by public Liverie of Seizen, Fine,
and Recoverie; did ordain, that where Lands were put in trust or use, there
the possession and estate, should be presently carried out of the Friends in
trust, and settled and invested on him that had the Uses, for such term and
Time as he had the Use.

By this Statute of 27. HENRY, 8. the In what manner the Stat. of 32. H. 8.
gives power to dispose of Lands by will.
power of disposing Lands by Will, is clearly taken away amongst those frauds,
and so the Statute did Disponore justum cum Imperio; Whereupon 32. HENRY, 8. an
other Statute was made, to give men power to give Lands by Will in this sort.
First, it must be by Will in writing. Secondly, he must be seized of an
Estate in Fee-simple (For Tenant for an other man's Life) or Term in Tail,
cannot give Land by Will, by that Statute 3. he must be solely seized, and
not jointly with an other; and then being thus seized for all the Land he
holds in Soccage Tenure, he may give it by the Will except he hold any piece

together, he can give but two parts by If a Man be seized of Capite Lands and

And so if he hold Lands by Knights The third part must descend to the Heir

Service of a Subject, he can devise of the Lands but two parts, and the
third, the Lord by Wardship, and the Heir by descent is to hold.

And if a man that has three Acres of A Conueyance by devise of Capite Lands

Land holden in Capite by Knights Service, do make a jointure to his Wife of
one, and convey an other to any of his Children, or to Friends, to take the
profits, and to pay his Debts or Legacies, or Daughters Portions, then the
third Acre or any part thereof he cannot give by Will, but must suffer it to
descend to the Heir, and that must satisfy Wardship.

Yet a Man having three Acres as before, But a Conveyance by Act executed in

may convey all to his wife or Children by Conveyance in his Life time, as by
Feolment, Recoverie, Bargain and Sale, or Covenant to stand to vies, and to
dis-inherit the Heir. But if the Heir be within age, when his Father dies,
the King or other Lord shall have that Heir in Ward, and shall have one of the
three Acres during the Wardship, to sue Liverie and Seizen. But at full age the

a Jury by oath, must set down so much as shall make up the thirds, except the
Officers of the Court of Wards, can otherwise agree with the parties. If there
be no Wardship due to the King, then the other Lord is to have a supply by a
Commission out of the Chancetie, and a Jury thereupon.

But in all those cases, the Statutes do The Stat. gives power to the
Testator to set out the third himself, and if it be not a third part, yet the

And if it be not enough, yet they must take that in part, and only have a

Property in Goods.
Of the several ways whereby a man may get Property in Goods or Chattels. 1.
By Gift. 2. By Sale. 3. By Stealing. 4. By Waiuing. 5. By Straying. 6. By
Shipwreck. 7. By Forferture. 8. By Executorship. 9. By Administration. 10. By
Legacy.

1. Property by gift
BY gift, Property is when the property A deed of gift of goods to deceive
his Creditors is void against them, but good against the Executors Admin. or
Vender of the party himself.
of Goods may be passed by word or writing, but if there be a general Deed of
Gift made of all his Goods, this is suspirious to be done upon fraud, to
deceive the Creditors.

And if that a man who is in Debt, make a Deed of gift of all his Goods to
protract the taking of them in Execution for his debt, this Deed of Gift is
void, as against those to whom he stood indebted, but as against himself his
own Executors or Administrators, or any man to whom afterward he shall sell
or Convey them, it is good.

2. By Sale.
Property in Goods by Sale. By Sale What is a Sale bona fide and what not,
when there is a private reservation of trust between the parties.
any man may convey his own Goods to another, and although he may fear
Execution for Debts, he may sell them outright for money at any time before
the Execution served, so that there be no reservation of trust between them,
yet providing the money, he shall have the goods again; for that trust in
such case, does prove plainly a fraud to prevent the Creditors from taking the
goods in Execution.

3. By Theft or taking in Jest.
Property of Goods by Theft or taking How a Sale in Market shall be a bar
to the owner.
in Jest. If any Man steal my Goods or Chattels, or take them from me in
Jest, or borrow them of me, or as a Traitor or Felon carry them to the Market
or Fair, and there sell them, this Sale does bar me of the property of my
Goods, saving that if he be a horse he must be ridden two hours in the
Market or Fair, between Ten and five a clock, and Tolled for in the
Tolle-Booke, and the seller must bring one to avouch his sale known to thee
Tolle-booke-keeper, or else the sale binds me not. And for any other goods,
where the Sale in a Market or fair shall bar the owner being not the seller
of his Property.

It must be sale in a Market or Fair Of Markets and what Markets such a Sale
ought to be made in.
where usual things of that Nature are sold. As for example, if a men steal a
Horse, and sell him in Smithfield, the true owner is barred by this Sale; but
if he sell the Horse in Cheapeside, Newgate or or Westminster market, the true
owner is not barred by this Sale; because, these Markets are usual for flesh,
Fish, etc. and not for Horses.

So whereas by Custom of London, every Shop there is a Market all the days of
the week, saving Sundays and Holidays; Yet, if a piece of Plate, or Jewel
that is lost, or Chain of Gold or Pearl that is stolen or borrowed, be sold
in a Drapers or Scriueners Shop, or any others but a Goldsmith, the Sale
barreth not the true owner, Et sic in Simili.

Yet by stealing alone of the Goods, the Thief gets not such property, The
owner may Seize his goods after they are stolen.
but that the owner may Seize them again wheresoever he finds them; except
they were sold in Fair or Market, after they were stolen; and that bona fide,
without fraud.

But if the Thief be condemned of If the Thief be condemned for Felony, or
outlawed, or forfeit the stolen goods to the Crown, the owner is without
remedy.
the Felony, or outlawed for the same, or outlawed in any personal Action, or
have committed a forfeiture of the Goods to the Crown, then the true owner is
without remedy.

Nevertheless if fresh after the goods were stolen, the true owner makes

after the Thief and Goods, and takes the Goods with the Thief, he may take
them again; And if he make no fresh persuit, yet if he prosecute the Felon,
so far as Justice requires.

This is to have Arraigned, Indicted, and found guilty (though he be not Or
if he prosecuted the law against the Thief and convict him of the same
Felony he shall have his goods again, by a writ of Restitution.
hanged, nor have Judgment of Death) in all these cases he shall have his
goods again, by a writ of Restitution, to the party in whose hands they are.

4. By wayuing of Goods.
BY Wayuing of Goods, a property is gotten thus. A Thief having stolen goods
being persued flies away and leaves the goods, This leaving is called
Wauing, and the property is in the King; except the Lords of the Manor have
right to it, by Custom or Charter.

But if the Felon be Indicted or adjudged, or found guilty, or outlawed at
the suit of the Owner of these goods, he shall have Restitution of these
goods, as before.

5. By Straying.
BY Straying, property in live Chattels, is thus gotten. When they come into
other men's grounds, then the party or Lord into whose grounds or Manors they
come, causes them to be seized, and a With put about their necks, and to be
cried in three Markets adjoining, showing the marks of the Chattell; which
done, if the true owner claymed them not within a Year and a day, then the
property of them is in the Lord of the Manor whereunto they did stray; If he
have all strayes by Custom or Charter, else to the King.

6. Wrack, and when it shall be said to be.
BY Shipwreck, property of Goods is gotten. When a Ship laden is cast away
upon the Coasts, so that no living Creature that was in it when it began to
sink escapes to Land with life, then all those Goods are said to be wracked,
and they belong to the Crown if they can be found; except the Lord of the
Soil adjoining, can entitle himself unto them by Custom, or by the Kings
Charter.

7. Forfeitures.
BY Forfeitures, Goods and Chattels are thus gotten; If the Owner be outlawed,
if he be indicted of Felony, or Treason, or either confess it, or be found
guilty of it, or refuse to be tried by Peers or Jury, or be attainted by
Jury, or fly for Felony although he be not guilty, or suffer the Exigent to
go forth against him; although he be not outlawed, or go over the Seas
without license, all the goods he had at the Judgment, he forfeiteth to the
Crown; except some Lord by Charter can claim them. For in those cases
prescripts will not serve, except it be so ancient, that it has had allowance
before the Justices in Air in their Circuits, or in the Kings Bench in ancient
time.

8. By Executorship.
BY Executorship, goods are gotten. When a man is possessed of Gods makes his
Last Will and Testament in writing or by Word, and makes one or more Executors
thereof; These Executors, have by the Will and ceath of the parties, all the
property of their Goods, Chattels, Leases for Years, Wardships and Extents,
and all right concerning those things.

Those Executors may meddle with Executors may before probat dispose of the
goods, but not bring an action for any debt.
the Goods, and dispose them before they prove the Will, but they cannot bring
an action for any Debt or duty, before they have proved the Will.

The proving of the Will is thus. What probat. of the Will is, and in what
manner it is made.
They are to exhibit the Will into the Bishops Court, and there they are to
exhibit the Will into the Bishops Court, and there they are to be sworn and
the Bishops Officers are to keep the Will Original, and certify the Copy
thereof in Parchment under the Bishops Seal of Office, which Parchment so
sealed, is called the Will proved.

9. By Letters of Administration.
BY Letters of Administration, property in goods is thus gotten. When a man
possessed of goods dies without any Will, there such things as the Executors
should have had if he had made a Will, were by ancient Law to have come to the
Bishop of the Diocese, to dispose for the good of his Soul that dyed, he
first paying his Funerals and Debts, and giving the rest Ad pios vsus. Pij Vsus.


This is now altered by Statute Laws, so as the Bishops are to grant Letters
of Administration of the goods at this day to the Wife if she require it, or
Children or next of kin; If they resnse it as often they do, because the debts
are greater then the estate will beat, then some Creditor or some other will
take it as the Bishops Officers shall think meet. It grows often in question
what Bishop shall have the right of proving Wills, and (...)
granting Administration of goods.

In which Controversy the rule is thus. Where the Iutestate had Bona notabilia
in diverse Diocese, then the Archbishop of that Province where be dyed is to
commit the Administration.
That if the party dead had at the time of his Death Bona notabilia in diverse
Diocese of some reasonable value, then the Archbishop of the Province where
he dyed is to have: the apptobation of his Will, and to grant the
Administration of his goods as the case falls out; otherwise, the Bishop of
the Diocese where he dyed is to do it.

If there be but one Executor made, yet Executor may refuse before the Bishop,
if he have not intermedled With the goods.
he may refuse the Executorship coming before the Bishop, so that he has
not entermedled with any of the goods before, or with receiving Debts, or
paying Legacies.

And if there be more Executors then one, so many as list may refuse; and if
Executor ought to pay, 1 Judgments. 2 Stat. Recogn: 3 Debts by bonds and bills
sealed. 4 Rent unpaid. 5 Servants wages 6 Head workmen 7 Shop-booke and
Contracts by word.
any one take it upon him, the rest that did once refuse may when they will
take it upon them, and no Executor shall be further charged with Debts or
Legacies, then the value of the Goods come to his hands; So that he foresee,
that he pay Debts upon Record, debts to the King; Then upon Judgments;
Statutes, Recognizances, then Debts by Bond and Bill sealed, Rent unpaid,
Servants wages, payment to head workmen; and lastly, Shop-bookes, and contracts
by Word. For if an Executor, or Administrator pay debts to others before to the
King, or Debts due by Bond before those due by Record, or debts by Shopbookes
and Contracts before those by Bond, arrerages of Rent, and Servants wages, he
