A Proclamation for the apprehension of Edward Ekins.
FOrasmuch as Edward Ekins, late of Stanwick in Our County of Northampton,
Yeoman, having been a principal Malefactor (amongst diverse others) in a late
outrage committed in Our Park of Higham-Ferries, by violent entering thereinto,
killing and carrying away Our Dear, and beating and wounding Our Keepers
there, does now lurk and keep himself close in some secret place, and will
not submit himself to Justice, to the great abuse and insufferable contempt of
Us, and Our Regal authority; We have thought fit to publish the same to all
Our loving Subjects, not doubting of their care and forwardness in his
discovery and apprehension: And do hereby charge and command, all Justices of
Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Constables, Headboroughs, and all other
Our Officers, Ministers and Subjects whatsoever, to be diligent in inquiring
and searching for the said Edward Ekins in all places whatsoever, as well within
Liberties as without; whom if they shall happen to take, Our pleasure is, that
they cause him to be safely brought before one of the next Justices of the
Peace to the place, and of the County where he shall be found, which Justice We
do hereby command to take sufficient bond of him, with two able sureties, for
the personal appearance of the said Ekins in Our high Court of Star Chamber,
to answer the premises within some convenient time after his apprehension,
and not to depart without license of that Court. And if he refuse to enter into
such bond, or cannot find sufficient sureties in that behalf, That then the
said Justice do send him with sufficient guard to the Goal of the County, or
place where he shall be taken, there to remain in safe custody, and withal
presently to advertise one of Our principal Secretaries thereof, for such
further course to be taken with him, as We shall give direction; Letting all
Our loving Subjects know, that if any person or persons, after this Our
Proclamation published, shall directly, or indirectly conceal, harbor, keep,
retain, or maintain the said Edward Ekins, or shall not use his or their best
endeavor for his apprehension, as well by giving due advertisement thereof to
Our Officers, as by all other good means, We will (as there is just cause)
proceed against them, that shall so neglect this Our Commandment, with all
severity.

Given at Our Court at Cambridge, the fourteenth day of December, in the two
and twentieth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
