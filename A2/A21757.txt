By the Queen.
WHereas certain obstinate and irrepentant traitors, after their notorious
rebellions made against this their natural country, have fled out of the
same, and have remained in foreign parts, with a continual and wylful
determination (as it appears) to contriue all the mischief that they can
imagine, to impeache and subuerte the universal quietness and peace of this
Realm, whereof they do behold with deadly envy this their natural country,
by Gods special grace directyng her Majesty in her government, to have been of
long time most comfortably possessed, both inwardly at home, and with all
outward countries next adioynyng: and that now since they have wasted their
whole time for the prosecutyng of their rooted malice, by congregatyng
themselves together in routes, with shows of conuenticles, and of forces,
(wherein they have condemned and despised such of their former companions, as
have duetifully sought for mercy for their offenses) and by combination with
others of this country birth, of like disposition, being found as persons
vagarant and wylful fugitives, they have sought by and with them to excite by all kind of sinister means, diverse estates and governors abroad, to mislyke,
and to enter into enimitie against the Queens Majesty, her Realm, and
people: and that notwithstanding these their labors and practices, they see
that neither they have nor could prevail as they desired, by reason of the
great wisdom, honor, and grave consyderation of the said persons of estate,
whom they have much troubled and annoyed with their importunate suites and
clamours, and specially with their false, malicious, and traitorous
suggestions, and calumniations against the Queens Majesty, her government,
and this Realm: Therefore at the last being desperate of those their former
trauayles and practices, and fyndyng her Majesty's amity is had in good
estimation with other the great princes and estates her neighbors, and the
amity also of the same princes reciprocquely embraced by her Majesty, to the
honor and benefit both of her Majesty, and her alies and confederates, and
their countries and subjects, they are fallen into another crooked course of
malicious persecutyng the happy estate of this country and government, by
choosyng out of certain shameless, spiteful, and furious brains, having a
trade in pennyng of infamous libelles, not only in the English, but also in
Latin, and other strange languages. And by these means they have lately
caused certain seditious books and libelles to be compiled, and printed in
diverse languages, wherein their final intention appears to be to blaspheme,
and as it were to accurse their native country, with all manner of reprocheful
terms, against the peaceable government thereof, condemnyng generally the
whole policy of the present estate, as having no religion, nor piety, nor
justice, nor order, no good ministers at al, either for divine or humane
causes: and yet to abuse such as are strangers to the state, they have glosed
some of their late libelled books with arguments of discoueries of treasons,
intended, as they do craftily allege, by some special persons being
counsaylers, against her Majesty, and the state of this crown and Realm,
with reprocheful terms of most notorious false assertions and allegations:
bendyng their malice most specially against two, who be certaynely known to
have always ben most studiously and faithfully careful of her Majesty's
prosperous estate, and virtuous government, employing thereto al their cares,
trauayles, diligence, and watchyng, with the manifest loss and hynderaunce of
their own health, that no treason might approach to hurt her highness, nor
traiterous malice to disturb the quiet of her prosperous reign. These
cheefely, beside their general reproouing of al other, having charge in this
government, they study by their venomous and lying books, to have specially
myslyked of her Majesty, contrary to their manyfolde deserts, so approved by
long and manifest experience, which both her Majesty, and all the rest of her
good counsaylours and nobility, with other the states of the Realm, have had,
and daily have of the very same counsaylours, who also are the more to be
allowed of her Majesty, in that she sees, and of her own mere knowledge
truly understands, that all the particular matters wherewith the said
libellers labor to charge the said counsaylours, as offenses, be utterly
improbable and false, as in like manner generally, al others her Majesty's
counselors, ministers, and subjects of understanding, in every degree, do
repute, accept, and know the same to be: so as both of her Majesty, and of al
other her good counsaylers and noble men, this their attempt is understood to
be the work of canckred envy and malice, and the accustomed wont of such men
as be possessed with those spirits, when they can not, ne dare not openly
assail her princely Majesty by force or open doings, then to go about to
pull from her Majesty her faithful and trusty counsaylours, by false
calumnies, or with feigned and surmised tales, to make variance, if they
could, gelousie, and discord among her highness counsaylours, who hitherto
with much concord and good agreement, have, as it is well seen, served
prosperously her highness. And therefore her Majesty having regard to be
thankeful to almyghtie God for his blessyng of her with his protection in her
government these many years, and for that cause myslykyng to suffer the same
to be in this sort by such infamous libelles obscured, defamed, and
blasphemed, either presently, or in time to come, by the secret dispearsyng of
the same books and libelles, either within her Realm, or abroad in foreign
language: and in like manner, being unwilling to have such as be her well tried
and approved faithful servants and counsaylours to be thereby taxed,
altogether with manifest untruths impudently uttered, to the dishonor of
her Majesty, to whom they are counsailours: has therefore thought necessary,
and so by advice of others of her counsel and nobility, whose reputation is
also most certainly taxed by the said manifest slanders and untruths, she
wills that by this her Majesty's public declaration, it be known, that the
said books and libelles be of her Majesty, and of her counsel, esteemed,
judged, and condemned, to be the works of despisers of Gods true religion, of
obstinate traitors against her Majesty's person, estate, and dignity, and of
unnatural and malignant enuiers of the common good tranquillity of her Realm,
who the more to abuse some sympler sort of people, do deliver a show of
certain things pretended for the safety of her Majesty's person and estate,
the same being in deed most manifest and direct practices to ruin her
person, and to overthrow her estate: And therewith charge al manner of
persons, to despise, reject, and destroy such books and libelles, whenever
they shall come to their hands, for the malicious slanders and untruths
contained in them, and that no man wyllyngly do bring into this Realm,
dispearse, dispose, or deliver to any other, or keep any of the said books
or libelles without destroying, except the same person be one of her Majesty's
privy counsel, or otherwise for reasonable respects, be duly licensed to
have the same to peruse, and to reprove, according to the quality thereof,
upon pain to be by any public officer, who may have notice thereof,
apprehended, and thereupon to be punished as sowers of sedition, and abbettours
to the treasons uttered in the same.xxviij. die Septembr. 1573.

God save the Queen.
