By the King.
A Proclamation restraining the abusiue venting of Tobacco.
WHereas the Kings most excellent Majesty being informed of the abuses daily
arising of the ungoverned Selling and Retailing of Tobacco, by his Proclamation
lately published, did prohibit all his people, that after the feast of
Candlemas, which is now last past, none of them out of certain Cities and
Towns therein specified to have been appointed, and within those Cities and
Towns no other but certain persons named, as in the said Proclamation is
expressed, and such as from time to time as should be permitted, should sell or
deliver any Tobacco by Retaile, herein requiring due obedience until his
Majesty should make other declaration, as by the same Proclamation appears.

Sithence which, a great number of his Majesty's loving subjects have repaired
to some Lords, and others of his Majesty's Privy Council, being his Majesty's
Commissioners appointed to treat with them, and have humbly desired Letters
Patents of License to sell Tobacco by Retaile, whereunto his Majesty's said
Commissioners have consented: but because it is both convenient and necessary
that the number of those that be Licensed to sell Tobacco by Retaile, and also
their names be known, that in time convenient notice may be taken from them
how much Tobacco in each year they Retaile and Uent: that upon knowledge
thereof, his Majesty for preventing of the issuing out of the Realm too great
a proportion of the Stock of this Kingdom, may give order for the quantity of
Tobacco that shall be yearly brought in: And being resolved that any who from
henceforth shall presume to utter or sell Tobacco, not being Licensed, shall
severely be proceeded against: For these and for other causes, the King our
Sovereign Lord straightly defends and commands, that neither such as by
pretext of being formerly nominated as meet men to Retaile Tobacco, nor any
other from henceforth presume to sell or utter Tobacco by Retaile, until they
shall have obtained his Majesty's License in that behalf, any permission or
tolleration that may be pretended by the said Proclamation, or any other
signification notwithstanding, upon such pains of censure in the Court of
Star Chamber and elsewhere, as may be inflicted upon contemners of his
Majesty's commands publicly proclaimed. Wherein his Majesty is pleased, that
a part of the Fines set upon the Contemners of this Command, be conferred upon
those that give notice of the Offenders, so as they may be brought to judgment.

Given at Our Court at Newmarket, the thirteenth day of March, in the ninth
year of Our Reign. God save the King.
