JAMES By the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all and singular Archbishops, Bishops, Archbeacons, Deanes, and their
Officials, Parsons, Vicars, Curats, and to all spiritual persons. And also to
all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Constables, Churchwardens
and Head boroughes: And to all Officers of Cities, Boroughes, and Towns
corporate: And to all other our Officers, Ministers, and Subjects whatsoever
they be, as well within liberties, as without, to whom these presents shall
some, greeting:
WHEREAS we are very credibly given to understand, by a Certificate under the
hands of our trusty and welbe loved Subjects Sir John Tasburgh, and Sir Anthony
Drury Knights, Anthony Hobart, Owen Shepherd, John Smith, and Ieffery Ward
Esquires, Justices of the Peace within our County of Norfolk, That our poor
distressed Subject Thomas Peeke of the Town of Lodden, in our fore said County
Husbandman, has heretofore boene a man of good estate and account, and one
that all his life time lived in good sort and reputation amongst his
neighbors, but so it is that he is now fallen into great want and poverty, by
reason of a sudden and fearful Fire happing on the Eight and twentieth day
of March last past, in the night time (through the negligence of a lewd and
idle Servant) which consumed and burnt down to the ground his dwelling House,
and other houses of office* household stuff, Corn of diverse kinds, provision
of household and other Commodities, and some Writings of great moment, amounting
in all the whole loss to the value of Three hundred pounds, to the utter
undoing of our said poor Subject, who was heretofore a Farmer of about a
hundred pound a year, and able to maintain his charge of Wife, Children and
family in good credit and fashion and to give relief unto others: but so
miserable is his estate now, that he is not able to help himself, but being
liable to rebuild his said House again, is likely to continue the rest of his
days in great misery, unless some charitable course be forthwith taken for
his relief herein, whose miserable and poor estate we much pity, and have
thought good upon the humble request of all our foresaid Justices made unto Us
in his behalf, to commend the same unto the charitable consideration of all
our loving and weldisposed Subjects within certain Counties hereafter
mentioned, not doubting but that all good Christians well weighing the
premises, will be ready and willing as feeling members one of another misery,
to extend their charitable contributions toward his relief and Comfort of
their poor distressed Brother, in this his great necessity.

KNOW ye therefore, of Our especial Grace and Princely compassion We have
given and granted, and by these our Letters Patents do give and grant, unto
our said poor Subject Thomas Peeke, and to his Deputy and Deputies, the bearer
or bearers hereof, full power, license, and Authority, to ask, gather, receive
and take the Alms and charitable benevolence of all our loving Subjects
whatsoever, In habiting within our Counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex
Hertford, Kent, Middles^x, Cambridge and Surrey, with our City of Norwich, and
in our Cities of Canterbury, Rochester, and the Cinque Ports, with our City
of Westminster, and Borough of Southwarke, with our University of Cambridge,
and Isle of Ely, And in all other Cities, Towns Corporate, Privileged places,
Parishes, Villages, and in all other places whatsoever within our said
Counties, and not else where, for and toward the recovery of his said loss,
and the relief and maintenance of himself, and his poor Wife and Chidren.

WHEREFORE we will and Command you and every of you, that at such time and
times, as the said Thomas Peeke, or his Deputy or Deputies, the bearer or
bearers hereof, shall come and repair unto any your Churches, Chapels, or
other places, to ask and receive the gratuities and charitable benevolence of
our said Subjects, quietly to permit and suffer them so to do, without any
manner your lets or contradictions, And you the said Parsons, Vicars, and
Curats, for the better stirring up of a charitable devotion, deliberately to
publish and declare the Tenor of these our Letters Patents, unto our said
Subjects upon some Sabbath day, when as the same shall be tendered unto you.
Exhorting and persuading them to extend their liberal coutributions in so good
and charitable a deed. And you the Churchwardens of every Parish, where such
Collection is to be made (as aforesaid) to Collect and gather the Alms and
charitable benevolence of all our loving Subjects, as well Strangers as others:
and what shall be by you so gathered, to deliver it to the bearer or bearers of
these our Letters Patents and to no other person, when as thereunto you shall be
required. And lastly, whereas we are informed of the great abuse which is now
crept in amongst these poor people, who sell their Lycences unto some other
other person, whereby men's charity goes not the right may, but unto such as
deserve it least: That from henceforth our will and pleasure is, that if it may
appear unto you or any of you that the said Thomas Peeke, have contracted any
bargain, or made or shall make sale of these our Letters Patents, whereby the
benefit should pass from him to any other person, That thereupon these our
Letters Patents shall be void and of none effect. Any Statute, Law, Ordinance,
or Provision, heretofore made to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

IN witness whereof, We have caused these our Letters to be made Patents for
the space of One whole year next after the date hereof to endure.

Witness our self at Westminster the Thirteenth day of February, in the
Eighteenth year of our Reign of England, France, and Ireland: And of Scotland
the Four and Fiftieth. 1610. Steward.
