TO His worthy, and much respected Good Friend, Captain JOHN TYLER, at Lies.
SIR,
HAving heard of your Fame, and of your industrious and vigilant Endeavors
into the Mathematical rare Inventions, (even in your younger years,) and
especially into that famous and noble Art of Navigation; and that from the
mouth of a Credible Person, who was at that time a Teacher of the Mathematics
at London: have therefore made bold (tho unacquainted) to present You with a
second Edition of this Enchiridion, or, small Treatise; to be sheltered under
the Protection of Your Patrocinie: Whom, (I trust) is able to defend and assist
me, in Truth and Verity, against all malevolent and backbiting Opposers; who
through their blind ignorance, does falsely check us of Truths, and some small
oversights: as may be seen into the Tyde-Table of Lies, Printed into an
Almanac at Edinburgh, for this present year 1683: set forth by James Paterson
Mathematician. Wherefore, expecting your favorable Acceptance, of this small
Embryo, which shall ere long encourage me, to publish abroad a larger Treatise,
on that excellent Art of Navigation, for the special use of all our Loyal
brave Seamen and Mariners, whose painful Labors tend much for the Good of
this Ancient KINGDOM. Thus wishing You, and all the Worthy Fraternity of
Masters of the Trinitie-house at Lies, all happiness here in this World, and
Eternal Mansions of Joy in the World to come: I ever remain,

SIR, Your humble Servant, John Forbes, Printer to BON-ACCORD.

An Introduction to the perpetual Tyde-Table, or, Table of Ebbing and Flowing,
in the most special Seaports in Europe.
THere are diverse Motions of the Moon, being 15 in number; accounted by
Ricciolus, in his Almagesto Novo Astronomiae* lib. 4. cap. 18.

But here I intend to treat of those Motions that are most useful for Seamen
and Mariners, according as their daily practice does require.

SECTION I.
The first Motion of the Moon.
The first motion of the Moon, called the diurnall o^ daily motion, being the
revolution of the Moon from the East to the West, and from thence to the East
in 24 hours; or rather almost in 25 hours: so that the Moon in this motion is
slowest of all the side^iall Bodies, not following altogether the motion of
Primum Mobile in 24 hours: For if the Moon be observed to be in Conju^ction
with any fixed Star this night the next night following, she shall be found to
be distant from the same 13 degrees 10 minutes 35 seconds to which in the
Equator, answers to 52 min of time

This motion, being her propper middle motion i^ longitude performed under the
Zodiac, because a formerly I have mentioned she performs 13 degree 10 minutes
35 seconds by her middle motion, which is betwixt the slow and the swift, and
passes through the Zodiac, in 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes: and this space of
time, is called the Periodicall month.

But because the Sun moves daily in the Eccliptick, 59 min 8 sec. 20 thirds,
toward the East, therefore the Suns motion being subtracted from the middle
motion of the Moon in Longitude, there shall remain the distance of the Moon
from the Sun, 12 degrees 11 minutes 26 seconds 41 thirds.

SECT. II.
The Second Motion of the Moon.
The Synodicall month, or month of Conjunction, being longer then the
periodical Month, because the Moon being in Conjunction with the Sun, as
admit, in the first of Aries, the Moon having prescribed her motion through the
Zodiac in 27 days 7 hours 43 minutes, does not find the Sun in this point of
the Zodiac, because the Sun since the last Conjunction is passed toward the
East; therefore that there may be a Conjunction of the Sun with the Moon, she
is to pass a whole Sign almost, before she can come to be in Conjunction with
the Sun, and this is called, Lunatio vera. But if we have respect to the true
motion, the space of the middle Lunation being 29 days 12 hours, the longest
30 days, the shortest 28 days 23 hours: From hence it follows, that 12
Synodicall months makes a Lunar year to consist of 354 days, but the Solar
year consisting of 365 days 5 hours 4^ minutes, makes the difference 11 days,
being called the Epact: which is (...) ^^ference betwixt the Solar and Lunar
Year.

SECT. III.
The third Motion of the Moon.
The third motion is the motion of the Nods, of the circle of the Moon,
contrare to the order of the Signs; for the Orbite of the Moon, is inclined to
the plain of the Eccliptick by an Angle of 5 degrees in New and full-Moons, or
5 degrees. 18 min. in the quarters, which Latitude of 5 degrees, being the
greatest, is called, the Belly of the Dragon, because of the similitude they
have with a Dragon or Serpent, as is formed by the Peripherie of the Lunar
Eccliptick with the Peripherie of the Orbite of the Moon, the one being called
the North, and the other the South. The points wherein there is no Latitude, or
where the Orbite of the way of the Moon cutteth the Eccliptick, being
immediately opposed, are called the Nods, whereof the one is called the Nothern
and ascendent, because to us that are to the North ward, it is always higher,
ascending toward our Pole and Zenith, and therefore it is called Caput
Draconis or, head of the Dragon, marked thus The other Node or Intersection, is
called Southern descending, or, the Tail of the Dragon, marked thus These Nods
or points of the intersection, near about which falls out the Eclipses of the
Sun and Moon, are observed to move contrare to the Order of the Signs, the
middle motion of the same being 3 minutes 10 seconds 38 thirds at nearest, so
that they will obsolve their period of motion through the Eccliptick, about 18
years 228 days, 3 hours, 50 minutes. But according to Copernicus in 18 years,
223 days 6 hours, 12 minutes. This motion by some was thought to be equal, but
Tycho did find the same unequal, where you are here to observe that your
Golden Number, is composed of this motion, being the space of 19 years that the
Nods do make their revolution in 19 years, and how to find the same. As also
the Epact, whereby we may find the Age of the Moon.

SECT. IV.
How to find the Golden-Number.
AS also, to know at what time the Moon comes to the Meridian, First, find the
Golden-Number, which is had by adding one to the Year of our Lord, and divyding
the sum by 19, the remainder that rests over the division shall be the
Golden-Number; and ^he Quotient shall show how many revolutions are past since
the head of the Dragon was in the first of Aries. As suppose I desire to know
the Golden Num^er for the year 1683, to the which an Unite being ^dded, the
sum is 1684: which divided by 19, the ^emainder is 12 for the Golden-Number,
or 12 years ^re past since the head of the Dragon was in the first (...) Aries,
and the most part of that year, the same will remain in Leo, and enters Cancer
upon the 29 of October, having performed 88 Revolutions, as in the Quotient is
evident.

SECT. V.
How to find the Epact.
HAving found the Golden-Number, the Epact may be easily had for this year,
viz. 1683 by multiplying the Golden-Number by 11: (being the difference betwixt
the Solar and Lunar year) the product is 132, which divided by 30 the Quotient
is 4, and the remainder 12, which is the Epact for this year, 1683: where you
are to observe, that the Golden-Number begins always the first of January,
and the Epact the first of March.

SECT. VI.
How to find the Age of the Moon.
TO know the age of the Moon, add to the Epact of that year in which you desire
the Moons age, the months from March inclusive, with the days of the month;
and if the sum be less than 30, then the number is the age of the Moon, but if
the sum of the addition exceed 30, from the same substract 30, if the month
have 31 days, and if 30, substract 29, the remainder will be the age of the
Moon: the reason of this substraction was to return back the 11 days, which was
the difference between the Solar and Lunar year. Example, In the year 1683, I
would know the Moons age the 10 day of August, the month of August being the
6th, and the Epact 12, the days of the month 10: these three E 12 M 6 D 10
added together, the sum is 28, which shows the 18 of August, to be the 28
day of the Moon. And again, if you require the age of the Moon the 28 day of
August, these E 12 M 6 D 28 three numbers being added together, the sum is 46,
from which 30 being subtracted (because the month has 31 days) the remainder
is 16, so that the 28 of August 1683, is the 16 day of the Moon. This way being
frequently used by Seamen, is not so exact as may be required; therefore I
would advise Seamen to take notice of the Yearly Almanacks.

Having the age of the Moon, we may know at what time she comes to the
Meridian by the precedent Rule, where the first day, or 24 hours after the
Conjunction or Change, the Moon is 12 degrees distant from the Sun, in time 48
min. or 3 quar. 3 min. that ^he Moon comes latter to the Meridian the first
day, and so for every day to the Opposition or Full-Moon. Now to know at what
time the Moon comes to the Meridian, accept of this following Table, for this
and another use, as shall follow.

This following Table contains five columns, in ^he first and second ye have
the Increass and Decreass of the Moons age, as also, in the third and fourth,
^he hours and minutes that the Moon does come to the Meridian: for if the Moon
be increasing (a^ you may see by the letters Ie, at the head of the first
column) the hour^ and minutes against the same, is the time of the Moons coming
to the Meridian in the afternoon. But if the Moon^ be decreasing, (as you may
see at the head o^ the second column, by the letters De.) Then the hours and
minutes shows the time of the Moons coming to the Meridian in the Morning.

24 17 14 29 11 12 16 15 30 12 00 15

Example

The 5 day and the 20 day of the Moon, I desire to know the Moons coming to the
Meridian. I find for both these days 4 hours, showing that the 5 day, the Moon
comes to the Meridian at 4 hours afternoon, and the 20 day at 4 hours in the
morning: the columns of hours and minutes, are had by multiplying the Moons age
by 4, and divyding the product by 5, and if any remain over the division is the
numerator of the fraction, and for every Unite account 12 minutes, so you shall
have the hours and minutes of the Moon's coming to the Meridian, as in the Table
you may find. As for Example, the 7 day of the Moon, I desire to know at what
time in the afternoon she comes to the Meridian, so 7 multiplied by 4 the
product is 28, which divyded by 5, the quotient is 5 hours, and 3 remaining
over the division gives 36 minutes, so that the 7 day, the Moon comes to the
Meridian at 5 hours, 36 minutes in the afternoon.

Some Examples.

Having found by the Rules or Table the Moons coming to the Meridian, if there
be any place where a South Moon makes full-Sea as at the Isle of Wight, I say
that the 7 day of the Moon it will be Full-Sea, or high water at that place at
5 hours, 36 minutes. But if the flowings be to the Eastward, then you are to
substract 3 quarters of an hour for every point of the Compass, and the
remainder shall show you the time of high water at that place. As also, I
desire to know the time of full-Sea the 7 day of the Moon at Yarmouth where a
South-South East Moon makes full-Sea: from 5 hou. 36 min. substract one hou.
30 min. the remainder is 4 hou. 6 min. at which time it will be full-Sea at
North-Yarmouth. Again, if at Lies, where a South-West by South Moon makes a
full-Sea, you are to add 2 hou. 15 min. for 3 points of the Com^ass (because
Westward flowings) to 5 hou. 36 min. ^he sum shall be 7 hou. 51 min. at which
time it will be full-Sea at Lies.

SECT. VII.
How to find the rising and setting of the Moon.
LAstly, to know at what hour the Moon sets or rises for any day of her Age
for which purpose this small treatise was intended You may accept of the second
use of this Table, in which, first you may know how long the Moon will shine or
remain above the Horizon, from the Conjunction or Change to the Full, by
knowing the Moons age in the first column and against the same, in the third
and fourth columns you shall have the hours and minutes that the Moon does shine
or remain after the Suns setting, which being added to the setting of the Sun,
gives the setting of the Moon, Example, I desire to know the 8 day of the Moon
at what time she will set, I find in the Table the 8 day of her age, and in the
third and fourth 6 ho. 24 min. for so long will she shine after the Sun
sets* Then suppose the Sun to set at 5 hours in the afternoon, which being
added to 6 hou. 24 min. the sum shall show the time of her setting, at 11 hou.
24 min. at night. For the Moons rising after the opposition or full, look for
the Moons age in the second column and the hou. and min answering, being
subtracted from 12 hou. gives the hou. and min. that the Moon ryseth before
the Sun; which being subtracted from the Suns rising, gives the time of the
Moons rising. For Example, The 17 day of the Moon, I find answering 1 hour, 36
minutes, which being subtracted from 12 the remainder is 10 hou. 24 min. that
the Moon will rise before the Sun, so that the Moon shines 10 hou. 24 min. in
the morning before the Sun rise, and the Sun ^he same day rising at 7 a clock,
36 min. whereunto ^f I add 12 hou. else the substraction cannot be made, and it
makes 19 hou. 36 min: from which 10 hours 24 minutes being subtracted, there
resis 9 hou. 12 min. ^t which time the Moon ryseth before midnight, but ^or
saving a substraction, I have added the fifth co^umn, and against the days of
the Moons age you ^ave the complement of the hou. and min. to 12, and ^o one
substraction will serve. The reason of this Table was had from Plinius, in his
lib. 8. cap. 12, and from others as is mentioned by Ricciolus in his
^stronomie, lib. 4. cap. 4 Prob. 12. Which Rule although not exact, yet may
serve for vu^gar use, for ^s the Learned Kepler does observe concerning this
Rule of Plinius, that, Medium inter ejus enormia tenet.

A more exact and certain way may be had for the ^ime of rising and setting of
the Moon: by knowing ^he place of the Moon in the Ecliptic, which being ^ad
for the time you require the Moons rising and ^etting, you are to apply your
self to the last Table of the Suns rising and setting, and there finding the
^ign and Degree the Moon is into at the time required, ^r when the Moon comes
to the Meridian, by the ^^rst Table, with the Signs and Degrees: then looking
^or the Suns setting being in the same sign and de^ree, which being
subtracted from her coming to the Meridian, gives the time of the Moons
rising: and being added gives the time of her setting, als^ which shall be
evident by the following Examples for which purpose I have added a second Table
showing the Moons motion in signs, degrees, and minutes, for every day and hour
of her Age.

Observing the 12 Signs with their marks, and respective months, the first 6
being N. Northern and the last S. Southern: also, there are 12 words in a
verse, for the 12 months, each of them beginning with a vowel, except the
last, (P.) in Paradise, a consonant being for February, and signifying the 8
day of February that the Sun will enter Pisces^ ^or the rest add the number of
the beginning vowel of each word to 8, the sum shall be the day of the month
that the Sun enters the respective sign, as E in Evil, being the second
vowel, with 8 gives 10 the day of March the Sun enters Aries; as also, O, in
Objects being the 4 vowel added to 8 is 12, showing the Sun to enter Cancer the
12 of June, and so accordingly in all the rest.

10 59 21 11 32 22 12 5 23 12 38 24 13 11

The use of this Table is as follows, and first observing that the Sun and
Moon are both in one Sign and Degree at the Change and Conjunction which you
may have by your yearly Almanac or Ephemeris. As in the year 1683, I find the
Conjunction or Change to be the 14 of July at 2 in the morning, (the minutes
being omitted, as of no great concernment in this matter) then from 2 in the
morning to 12 at midday, there are 10 hours, to the which answers the hours
of the Moons age, 5 degrees, 29 minutes, which being added to 1 degree, 3 minutes
of Leo* the sign and degree the Sun and Moon was into at the change, the sum
is 6 degrees, 32 minutes and this is the place of the Moon the 14 of July at
noone. But with more certainty by an Ephemeris into the 7 degrees. of Leo the 14
day at noon. Secondly, I desire to know the Moons place the 25 of July. so then
between the 14 of July, and the 25 are 11 days inclusive, and in the table of
the days of the Moons age, are 4 signs 25 degrees. Lastly, seeing the Moon
comes to the Meridian the 11 day, at 8 hours, 48 minutes, to the which does
answer nearest in the table of hours, 4 degrees, 56 minutes, these four being
added together S. D. M. First the being in the 1 degrees. 3 min of being 4 1 3
Secondly from 2 morning to noon, being 10 hours, 0 5 29 Thirdly the 11 day at
noon, 4 25 00 Lastly for 11 days in the first table, 8 ho* 48 min. is 0 4 56
The sum is 9 6 28

And this much for the first way.

These 9 Signs 6 degrees. 28 min. shows the Moon to be in the year 1683, July
25th, into the 6 degree 28 minutes of Capricorn: minutes being omitted in both,
so the difference is but small; and no wonder that there be a difference: the
Ephemeris by calculation being more exact then that which we can expect from
this Enchiridion: where you are to observe, having found the place of the Moon,
which if it had exceeded 12 signs, ye were then to substract 12, and the
remainder counted from Aries inclusive, shall be the Moons place. But having
found the same to be in the 7 degree of Capricorn, and the Sun in the same; by
the last table of the Suns rising and setting, ye shall find the Sun being in
the 7 degree of Capricorn to set in the Latitude of 57 degrees. 10 min. at 3 hou 15
min. which being added to 8 hou. 48. min. the Moons coming to the Meridian,
shows the setting of the Moon, to be at 12 hou. 3 min. about midnight; and
being subtracted from 8 hou. 48 min. the remainder is 5 hou. 33 min. for the
rising of the Moon in the afternoon. And accordingly you may know the rising
and setting for any other day of her age, either increasing or decreasing. Upon
these grounds an Instrument may be made for performing of the same without
Tables. And this much for the second way.

The Third Way.

In the same year 1683, December 17 being the 10 day of the Moon, and coming to
the Meridian at 8 a clock in the afternoon: I find the Moon to be in 23 degrees
of Aries, having 5 degrees 16 minutes South-Latitude; which being subtracted
from 8 degrees, 58 minutes (the Suns Declination being in 23 of Aries.) is 3
degrees 42 minutes, which may be called the Moons Declination, or distance from
the Equinoctial Northerly, though not propperly, because the Latitude of the
Moon or Star, is said to be an Arch of a great Circle, contained between the
body of the Moon or Star, and the Eccliptick passing by the Eccliptick Poles:
and the Declination an Arch of a great Circle, contained between the body of
Sun. Moon, or Star; and the Equinoctial passing by the Poles of the World. But
the difference between the two Arches being small and of no great consequence
to this matter, we look in the tables of Declination for 3 degrees. 42 min. in
Aries, in which sign and degree the Sun being, sets about 6 hou. 10 min.
which added to 8 hou. the Moons coming to the Meridian the sum is 14 hou. 10
min. or 2 hou. 10 min. in the morning the Moon will set, and being subtracted
from 8 hou. the remainder 1 hou. 50 min. for her rising afternoon. Now by the
second way wherein there is no respect had to the Latitude of the Moon, we find
the Sun being in 23 degrees. of Aries to have his half semidiurnall Arch 6 hou. 56
min. which being added to 8 hou. the Moons coming to the Meridian gives 14
hou. 56 min. for her setting, and subtracted from 8 hou. gives 1 hou. 4 min.
this being an error ought to be seriously considered, as not being tollorable,
the half Semidiurnall Arch only being 6 hou. 10 min. and not 6 hou. 56 min. by
considering the Latitude Having formerly made mention, that the Moons Latitude
being added or subtracted from the Moons true Declination of Longitude, the
difference is of no great consequence, as I shall illustrate in these following
cases, supposing the Moons Longitude to be in the 15 degree of Taurus.

SECT. VIII.
A description of the following Sphericall Triangle.


Let there be an oblique Sphericall Triangle, as A, B, C, projected in the
plain of the Solistitiall^olure, either Orthographice, according to Ptolomies
^nalemma, or Steriographice, according to Gemma ^risius his Astrolob: the Arch
A, B, shall repre^ent the distance between the two Poles, to wit, of ^he
Diurnall and Annual Motion, being 23 degrees. 30 min. B, C, an Arch of the Co.

These two Tables I have composed; for showing of the difference between the
Moons Declination, (being had by the resolution of the former Triangle,) and
the place of the Moon in the Eccliptick; having either N. or S. Latitude. As
for Example, I have taken the Moons Longitude to be in the 15 degrees. of Taurus,
whose Declination is 16 degrees. 24 min In the first table, there are 5 columns,
First, the Moons Latitude to 5 degrees. of N. Latitude. Secondly, the Moons
Declination. Thirdly, the Declination of the 15 degrees. of Taurus being 16 degrees. 24
min. added to 5 degrees. of N. Latitude, gives 21 degrees. 24 min. the difference from
the Moons Declination 21 degrees. 8 min. being only 16 min. and that for the fifth
column, and so accordingly in all ^he rest. The second table, where the Moon
has South Latitude, the Moon being in the same degree of ^he Eccliptick,
according to her Longitude, ye have ^n the first column as formerly, the Moons
Latitude S. Secondly, the Moons Declination: and thirdly, the Declination of 15
degrees of Taurus, from which if ye substract ^he Moons Latitude, the remainder
shall be 11 degrees. 24 min differing from the Moons Declination 11 min. What I
have said here concerning N. or S. Latitude, in the Northern Signs, may be
applied to N. or S. Latitude in Southern Signs. But if it be required, when the
Declination with the Latitude added, is more then 23 degrees. 30 min. as I suppose
the Moon to be in the 25 degrees. of Gemini; having Declination 23 degrees. 26 min.
North, and the Latitude 5 degrees. 16 min. North, the sum is 28 degrees: 26 min: now
to know the 20 day of the Moon, at what time the Moon ryseth and sets.
Having found the Declination of the Moon by what formerly has been said, to be
28 degrees. 40 min, with the Poles Elevation 57 degrees. 10 min. we may find the
difference assentionall to be 57 degrees. 55 min, in time 3 hou. 52 min; which
added to 6 hou. the sum is 9 hou. 52 min. added to 4 hou. in the morning, the
Moons coming to the Meridian, gives 13 hou. 52 min. or, 52 min. past 1 hou.
afternoon; and subtracted from 4, leaves 6 hou 8 min. at which time the Moon
will rise the former day in the afternoon. As for the Horizontall refraction
and Parallax, being of no great concernment in this matter to handle any
further, I desist. Lastly, I would advise Seamen, that are versed in the
principles o^ Navigation, as in the Sphere and Globs, to furnish themselves
with Ephimerides, either Argol, or John Gadbury their Ephimerides, which will
continue these 28 years; wherein they may have the true place of the
Luminaries, with the Moons Latitude, for the Meridian or 12 a cloak each day.

SECT. IX.
A declaration, for the better understanding of these Everlasting Tables, for
the Ebbs and Floods following*
IF you be desirous at any time to know when i^ is a full-Sea, or high water at
any Port or Haven either in Scotland, England, France or Ireland, or any other
part of the World: If first by your own knowledge, or the knowledge of any
expert Mariner, you know, when you see the Moon in such a part of the
Firmament, that then it is ful-Sea at such a Port or Haven, then these Tables
shall be needless for you: But if you cannot so do, and would learn, then
resort to this Table: And first consider with your self, how many days old the
Moon is, the day that you desire to know the Tide: And in the middle of this
Table you shall find in the uppermost part thereof; this tittle, The Age of the
Moon: and right against the day of the Age of the Moon, you shall find on both
sides, the places and points of the Firmament, as South, South by West; South
South-West, etc. And next under that Line, are these letters, Ho. and Min.
which signifies Hours and Minutes: Then having in memory the Age of the Moon,
as aforesaid, go directly to the tittle of that place of the Firmament, to the
which when the Moon comes, makes a high Water, and there you shall find the
exact Hour and Minut when it is ful-Sea in that place,

As for Example.

Where it flows South by West, as at Aberdeen, I desire to know at what time
it will be full-Sea at that place, the 10 day of the Moon: I apply my self to
the Table, and I find the flowing at Aberdeen, South by West, then looking in
the Column of the Age of the Moon, I find the day of the Moon 10, and right
against the same upon the left hand I find 8 hours 45 minutes: at which time in
the Evening it will be full-Sea at that place: but if it be the 25 day of the
Moon, you shall find the same flowing to be at 8 hours 45 minutes in the morning.

Another Example,

Where it flows South-West by South, as at Lies, I desire to know at what
time it will be full-Sea at that place, the said 10 day of the Moon: I apply my
self to the Table, and I find the flowing at Lies, South-West by South: then
looking in the Column of the Age of the Moon, I find the day of the Moon 10,
and right against the same upon the right hand I find 10 hours 15 minutes: at
which time in the Evening it will be full-Sea at that place: but if it be the
25 day of the Moon, you shall find the same flowing 10 be at 10 hours 15 minutes
in the morning and accordingly throughout these following Everlasting
Tyde-Tables.

In which I hope to clear my self indeed.
A Mathematical Dialogue, BETWIXT James Paterson Mathematician at Edinburgh,
And John Forbes Printer to Aberdeen, and (...).
(Paterson.) I charge the Printer with several Errors in his Almanac, set
forth and printed by him for the Year 1683. And first, concerning the Eclipse
which did fall out upon the 17 day of Ianuar in the afternoon, wherein he is
deficient in giving the Digits Eclipsed; as also, in reference to the time of
the Eclipse duration.


(Printer.) Courteous Reader, I confess, being about my serious Employments in
the Printing Press, I could not have leisure to Calculate that Eclipse, but
made use of several Ephimerides; as Vincent Wing, and Samuel Morland, etc. And
Argolus does assert the Digits Eclipsed to be 10 and more, John Gadbury 9:
Paterson 8 dig. 13 min. as for the time, John Gadbury says, the middle will
be at 3 hou. afternoon, the end at 4 hou. 3 min, or after the going down of the
Sun: for in the Latitude of 57 degrees 10 minutes, being for Aberdeen, the Sun
seteth being in the 8 degree of Aquarius, at 3 hou. 57 min. but Paterson says
10 min. before 4 hou. at Aberdeen, which is near half an hour; (a Prodigy
which was never seen, the Sun to set at 3 hou. 30 min. at Aberdeen!) but by
reason of the refraction, the Sun may appear or show himself above the Horizon,
when he is not, If so the parall^x be lesser then the refraction; and so I may
truly and warrantably say, the Sun does set at Aberdeen, the 17 day of Januar,
at 4 hou. 18 min. afternoon. But granting I be redundant in some Minutes, but
not so grossly, and as to say, not so deficient as he is, in saying the Sun
being in the 8 degree of Aquarius, seteth at 3 hou. 30 min. but in truth, at 3
hou. 57 min. But what does this concern me? My Antagonist cannot say, there is
any wrong done to the Vulgar, or Horascopographier. But, as for that Eclipse
which by an Telescope of 6 foot long, I did observe at the seting of the Sun,
and did not find above two digits of the Suns body obscured, with no apparent
darkness, or shadow of change by that Eclipse: it was (as we all say,) to
Westward Inhabitants. But lastly, I shall lay down some certain things to be
observed in going about this Eclipse, and some things I shall demand of this
Mathematician, in which I hope he will satisfy me, except he be, Mathematicus
nomine tenus, (as I suppose) for I shall be as Laconick as I can, intending not
to trouble the Reader with frivolous Expressions. First, supposing the middle
time of the Eclipse to be at 3 a clock in the afternoon, according to John
Gadbury. First, Granting the true places of the Luminaries, with the
Mo^ns-Latitude, either by Calculation or Ephimerides. Secondly, I find the
right ascension of the Sun in 8 degrees of Aquarius to be 310 degrees, added to
45 degrees or 3 hours, gives 23 hou. 42 min. which shows the 25 degree of
Pisces to be on the Meridian or Medium Coeli; and the Ascendent 28 degrees. 28 min.
of Cancer: and consequently, the Nonagisimo degree falls in 28 degrees. 28 min.
of Aries, being East ward of the Meridian 33 degrees. 28 min. Thirdly, The
Declination of the 25 degrees. of Pisces, added to 57 degrees. 10 min. gives 59 degrees.
9. min, the Arch of the Meridian between the 25 degree of Pisces and the
Zenith. Fourthly, The Angle of the Ecliptic with the Meridian, being 66 degrees.
33 min. gives the Arch between the Nonagesim and the Zenith, by saying as R:
Sine 59 degrees. 9 min^^: Sine 66 degrees. 33 min: Sine of 51 degrees. 48 min. Fifthly,
Having the true Latitude of the Moon, with the Parallax of Altitude, and having
found the Parallacticall Angle, that is to say, the Angle made by the
Ecliptic, and Vertical drawn through the Center of the Moon to be 52 degrees. 11
min. Sixthly, The Altitude of the Sun being at 3 hours in the afternoon, in the
Latitude of 57 degrees. 10 min. is 5 degrees, 41 min. These being premised, I desire to
know of James Paterson, the Parallax of Altitude, Longitud, right Ascension and
Declination: whereby we may know the time of the visible Conjunction, the
beginning of the Ecl^pse, the middle, and end end; with the Digits Eclipsed:
whither above or under the Center of the Sun. There are here required the
resolution of several Triangles, wherein, ex tribus datis quartus requiritur,
either by Calculation, or Projection.


(Paterson.) Also he errs again in his Tyde-Table at Lies, as if the Moon were
not able to rule the Tide here as at Aberdeen.


(Printer.) As for the flowings at Lies, which he carps at, they are not set
down by my self, at upon my own account, but in so far, as they have been
approved of, by ancient Seamen, Masters and Coasters; asserting that at Lies,
a S. W. by S. Moon makes at nearest a full-Sea. This being a general
Observation, therefore does admit of some particulars; as the Wind blowing at
such and such an Art, causes the flowings to vary, sometimes an half point,
and sometimes more, in setting the flowings high, and other times low: yea, the
Seasons of the year, sometimes does alter and change the streams, as about
Lambas, the streams then are higher, then at certain other times, and
consequently the general Role does not hold altogether certain at all times;
but does sometime vary. It is holden as a general Rule by most of Seamen,
that 3 quarters of an hour does answer to a point of the Compass, the reason
fo this is, (as they say,) because a quarter of the Horizon, answers to a
quarter of the Equinoctial, and consequently, 8 Points to 6 hours: so that
they would have the Equinoctial equally divyded, as they do the Points of the
Compass. I confess, into a Parallel Sphere, it will hold true, but not into an
Oblique Sphere: As admit, in the Latitude of 56 degrees, S. W. by S. being 3
Points, or 33 degrees. 45 min. or 2 hou. 15 min. I find in the Equinoctial 29 degrees.
to which in time answers to 1 hou. 56 min. of difference, being 19 min. in
time. And this found out by a Sphericall right Angled Triangle, by saying, as
R: S: Lat:: Tang. Arch of the Horizon: Tang. of the Equinoctial Arch. The
neglect of this is an Error, although not admitted by many Seamen; but
constantly asserting that 45 min. in time does answer to a point of the
Compass. James Paterson, in his Corrected Tyde-Table, does make Lies to differ
from other Tables, sometimes a whole hour, sometimes less; and in some
agreeing, (to the great detriment and h^zard of Ships seeking Lies Harbor.)
not determinating the true place of the Moon, which makes a full Sea at Lies;
for if he shall have his recourse to the Theorie of the Moon, except only the
middle Motion, he shall involve himself into such a Laborinth, out of which he
shall never be able to extricate himself. Therefore by all that I have said, I
see no ground for his Corrected Tyde-Table: And no marvel, he not being bred a
Seaman, neither educate in Letters or Learning, as I am informed, and ^et calls
himself, Mathematicus; O horrid Impudence! ^ut being a while in Ireland, and
having gotten some smat^erings in the Mathematics, comes to Edinburgh, and
^ayeth himself forth for Mathematicus: if it be otherwise then is related,
certainly he will show himself in giving a solution to these five following
Problems, not ^y Assertion, but by Mathematical Demonstration, I call them
^irocinia Nautica.

PROBLEM I.

There are two Islands in the parallel of 40 degrees, distant from each other
70 Leagues, a Ship sailing from the Westermost Island, between the N, and E.
does meet with a Ship that had sailed from the Eastermost, between the N. and
W. and they are both in the Latitude of 41 degrees 30 minutes, and these two
Ships have sailed 100 Leagues, I demand by what Courses these two Ships have
sailed? and how many Leagues in every particular Course?

PROBLEM II.

There are 3 Islands, A, B, C, the Island A, and B, in the parallel of 40
degrees, and are distant from each other 30 Leagues, the third Island C,
distant from A, 45 Leagues, and bearing of A, North-West: a Ship steering her
Course East-South-East from C, so long, till she comes to the parallel of 40
degrees. I demand how far she has sailed from the Island C, before she bring
the two Islands A, and B, sub maximo Angulo, or greatest Angle?

PROBLEM III.

A Ship in the Latitude of 40 degrees, is bound Westward, and being at A, she
sets an Island B, bearing of her South, and keeping her Course West, being
at C, she sets the same Island bearing of her South by East, 5 degrees
Easterly. Again, being at D, South-South East 4 degrees Easterly. Lastly, being
at E, she sets the same to bear of her South-East by East 6 degrees, 15 min.
Easterly: and has sailed between D, and E, 2, 9 Leaug, more then between C,
and D. I demand how far B was distant from A, when bearing Southerly.

PROBLEM IV.

A Ship in the Latitude of 40 degrees, saileth so long between the North and
East, till she alters her Longitude 10 degrees, and has departed from her
first Meridian, 96 Leagus, 2 Miles: I demand how far she has sailed? and by
what Course?

PROBLEM V.

Mr. Norwood, in his application of Sphericall Trigonometrie, to the third kind
of sailing, by the Arch of a great Circle, which is demonstrated by him, and
others, to be the best way of sailing. ( Consideratis Considerandis) Therefore,
supposing two Places or Islands, lying in the parallel of 60 degrees, distant
from each other 20 degrees in Longitude; and there are two Ships, the one
sailing in the parallel, the other upon the Arch of a great Circle: I demand
whither or no, he that saileth upon the Arch of a great Circle, does make a
major, or, minor ratio, to the great Circle, then he that sailoth upon the Arch
of the Parallel, does to the Parallel in which he saileth?

In all these five Problems, I have given Letters Alphabeticall, by which any
Mathematician may form Triangles at pleasure, secundum data and requisita: And
this much as to this purpose in the Art Nauticall; and so I proceed to another
head.


(Paterson.) I have in the said Almanac for the Year 1683, described an
Instrument, called the Line of Chorde, with a Scale of inch, and half inch,
divyded in 8 equal parts, the former, serving for measuring of all right lyned
Angles, the latter, for measuring the length, breadth, and thickness on Paper;
and may serve for Foots, Else, Falls, R^ods, Miles, or Leagues: all which the
Printer has not in his Prognostication.


(Printer.) I confess I have not the Line of Chords, or equal par^s mentioned
in my Almanac, wha^thee, cannot a right lyned Angle, be measured by a line of
Sines, or Tangents, as well as by a line of Chords? especially by a line of
Sines, seeing Sines are halfs of Choras* so that what i^ performed by the
whole, may be performed by the half: and contra. As for your line of Chords,
with your use ye make of them; if there be no more, * Cabin-boy can say al^
much as you can say, without any detriment to the Mathematicall-Science. What
do ye say, as not being acquaint (as I suppose) with the Orthographicall
Projection, wherein the Object, either Sphere or Glob is supposed to be
projected in plano, at an infinite or indeterminate distance from the eye; from
whence comes or arises Ptolimie his Analemma, wherein the Solisticiall Colure
being seen directly, is circularly projected. The other five, to wit, the
Horizon, Equinoctial, and Ecliptic; with the hour of Sex, and Prime Azimuth o^
East and West, being seen perpendicularly, are projected in straight Lines: the
Eye being in the intersection of all those Circles in principio Arietis. The
other Circles that are seen Obliquly, are projected Eliptically, the parallels
to these five mentioned are projected in straight lyns, according to the nature
of their Primativs. These being premised the Primatives are divyded
accordingly, by Sines, and so are contracted; the nearer they aproach the
Solisticial Colure. From hence I say, that all the Problems performed by
Ptolemie his Analemma, may be performed by a Line of Chords: yea, all the
Problems performed by the Sines in the Scamans Callender, may be performed by
the Line of Chords. Lastly, I say, that a Line of Chords of four inches Radius,
will perform a Problem, either Astronomicall or Geographicall, better then a
Globe of two foot Radius. And in so far, I have exalted your Line of Chords, in
that wherein ye was deficient.

As for measuring right Lyned Angles by a Line of Tangents, I hold it a more
ready way, then by a Line of Chords; for in the one a Compass is required, for
drawing an Arch from the Angular Point, but in the other, no Compass or Arch is
required; save only the Radius, and therefore, a Tangent Line is more useful
then a Line of Chords. This Tangent Line is wonderful useful in the
Steriographicall Projection, which supposes the Object, be it Sphere or Glob,
contiguous with the Organ or Eye. But it may be said, that visibile positum
supra visorum non facit visionem. I answer, it is true in opacuous, thick, and
dark Bodies, but not in Diaphanus and Transparent Objects. This Projection is
of greater use and concernment then the Orthographicall, because in the
Orthographicall, the divisions of the Radius from the Center, does shorten and
become lesser and lesser toward the Peripherie, according to the nature of
Sines: but in the Steriographicall, they increase from the Center toward the
Peripherie, according to the nature of Tangents; so that the increment of the
one, does supply the decrement of the other: in this projection Circles
directly or obliquely seen, are projected in Circles, but perpendicularly in
straight Lines. I could enlarge and delate my self in this purpose, but fearing
my enlargement should seem tedious to the Reader, I shall at present produce
some Instruments, framed by this Projection, and where the Organ is placed. And
first, John Stoph^erus his Astrolob, where the Organ is placed at the
Intersection of Aries and Libra; so that the aforenamed five great Circles, are
projected in straight Lines, and the rest Circularly. John Blackgrave, his
Mathematical Jewel, yea, the Universal Mapps divyded into two Hemispheres,
where Meridians and Parallels, are circularly projected; the Equator in a
straight Line, but the Ecliptic in a Curve Line: I admire to see the same, as
having no ground for that projection; I pray you Mathematicus, let me know if
there be any ground for the same? nam cupio docere vel doceri. I desire to know
of you, if a Sphericall Triangle, such as formerly I have described, i^ in the
Solistitial Colure the same, or any other Oblique Angled Sphericall Triangle be
decircinated, peradventure without any term given? if the quantity or measure
of the sides and Angles may be had? I doubt not, but as Mathematicus ye can
perform the same; if otherwise, send to Aberdeen, and you shall have the
solution from me. And this much for the Steriographical Projectiion, the Organ
placed at the intersection of Aries and Libra. The second position, is at the
Poles of the Equinox, and from thence arises Stofler his Astrolob; from whence
Mr. Gunters Quadrant is taken: this Astrolob has the Equinoctial directly
seen, with all the Parallels, the Meridians Perpendicularly, and are projected
in straight-Lines; the rest of the Circles Obliquly, and projected in Circles.
The last is, when the Organ or Eye, is placed in the Zenith according to
Clayius his Astrolob, or according to Mr. Gunters Fundamental Diagram for
plain dyaling; in which he does project 10 great Circles, each of them having
two Surfaces* except only the Horizon; so there does arise 19 Faces, upon which
plain Dyalls may be described, the Horizon, with all the Almicanters, are
projected circularly from the primative, the Az^muthes in straight Lines, the
rest Circularly; all which is performed Practically by Mr Gunter his last
Edition: look Gunter Lib: 2. Cap: 3. Sect. 1. 2. 3. But if ye desire a complete
Demonstration of Mr. Gunter his Practice, consult Aguilonius in the 6 book of
his Optics. I doubt not but what is said, will put you to a studere, but
stud^isse had been more proper for a Mathematician. There is another projection
called Scenographical, keeping a middle between the former two, in debita
distantia: but because it consists in shortning and lengthning of Objects, as
they are diversely seen, being more proppe^ for Painters and Limners then for
Seamen, to speak further I desist. Only observe, that all Sphericall
Trigonometrie by calculation does depend upon the projections: consult
Theodosius de Sphericis.

As for your inch, and half inch, the one divyded into 16 equal parts, the
other into eight; it had been better, and more like an Artist, to have divyded
each of them* Diagonally in 100 parts, both for Navigation and Surveying: for
Navigation by dividing the Meridian Line according to Mercator his projection,
according to degrees of increasing Latitude: and in Surveying, as afterward in
the next shall be made manifest.


(Paterson.) I have several Measures, for length, bread^^ and thickness,
beginning from Barley Corn in reference to an inch, from thence to 12 inches
making a foot, and 5 foot to a pace, and 1000 paces to a mile, and so foreward;
as you may see into my Almanac, all which ye have not at all expressea into
your Almanac.


(Printer.) I do confess, I have not expressed any Measures into my Almanac,
neither is it required I should do so, being different because of their
Objects: for the Almanak is in reference to Celestial things, and the other to
Terrestrial. But let us proceed to the purpose, wherein he ^ayeth 5 foot
make^h a pace, and therefore I desire to know of him, if paces in all Nations
and Countries be equal, or unequal; equal (I say) they cannot be, because the
foots (...) diverse Nations are unequal; for the longer the foot be, ^r
shorter; the fewer or more ^oots goes to a pace: and herefore the paces are
^nequal, and if paces, then miles; and if miles, then no certain^ie can be had
for the mea^re of a degree upon the Arch of a great Circle; which is ^bsurd,
and not consistent with reason. But now, let us ^ome to find the method and
way, how the Ancient and Modern Geographers, did find out certain measures upon
^arth, in reference to the Heavens. I will begin first, ^ith the Egyptian
Geographers, as Eratosthenes, who lived ^6 Years before CHRIST; and Ptolomie
who lived ^o Year after CHRIST: They having chosen two places ^ing under or
near the same Meridian, differing only observation, at 2 or 3 degrees in
Latitude, which after^ards by a customary and standerd Measure of that King^^me
of Egypt, they did find five foot to go to a pace, and 1000 paces to a mile.
But the Learned Mr. Norwood did of late into his Book, called the Seamans
Practice, following the Ancient Geographers, in their practice, in measuring*
between York and London, find a degree upon the Meridian, to contain 367200
foot English; and a mile 6120, so that an Egyptian pace contains 6, 15
English, and an Egyptian foot 14, 75 English inches at nearest. But passi^g
the fraction we take in numero ro^undo, 6 foot to the English pace, and
consequently, 6000 foot to a mile in English measure. Now let us c^mpare Scots
with English, and first, ye say that 37 English inches according to your
standerd at Edinburgh gives an Ell; Then a Fall, o^ Pole being 6 Ell, gives
2^2 Inches, 222 by 4, the length of a Chain, the product is 888: which being
multiplied by 80, gives 71040: and divyded by 12, the quotient is 5920 Foots
short of 6000, by 80 Foot. Again, 42 Scots Inches in an Ell, as of the old
standerd, that is, 3 Foot and a half; the Pole or Fall being 21 Foot, the Chain
84 Foot, multiplied by 80, gives 6720 Foot, for the length of a Scots Mile;
which being reduced to an English Mile, say as 10: 9:: 6720: 6048 English, so
that here the difference is only 48 Foot, whereby the Scots Mile exceeds the
English: and no wonder, because 6000 does admit a Fraction, which will be near
equivalent to 48 Foot: and therefore, Mr Norwood's Practice does altogether
agree with a Scots Mile. But it may be said, or inquyred of me, the reason why
I say, as 10: 9:: 6720: 6048. I answer, because if an English Inch be divyded
in 10 parts, 9 of these does answer to a Scots Inch: Therefore, being to
reduce English to Scots measure, say as 9: 10; but Scots to English, say as 10:
9. These being premised, I would advyse Surveyers here, as in England^ to
divide their 4 Pole Chain into a 100 parts, which we call Links; and there will
answer 10 Inch to a Link, this Chain so divyded, is very profitable for
Surveying of Grounds, or Plating; and giving the Area, as ye say, 4 Pole in
Latitude, and 10 in Longitude, gives 160 square Poles for the Area: so also 1
Chain or 100 Links in breadth, multiplied by 10 Chains or 1000 Links in length,
gives for the Area 10 square Chains, or 100000 square Links; 75000 Links, 3
Rood, 50000 Links, 2 Rood; 25000 Links, 1 Rood: or 40 Pole, 625 Links square
for a Pole. This I have premised for the benefit of Surveyers, they making use
of the Diagonall-Scale, of Inch, and half Inch, or of any other Measure,
Diagonally divided.


(Paterson.) Also in my Advertisement, being the last in my Almanac, such as
desire Mathematicall-Arts or Instruments thereto belonging, especially a
Spirall-Lyne, which I have so framed, that you may work more Arithmetic in one
hour, then any other in two days with the pen.


(Printer.) Ye s^y ye have framed a Spiral-Line, so as the same had never been
framed before; I had a true relation, from one that was a teacher of
Mathematics at London 40 years ago, who told me, that one Mr. Brown a
Carpenter, who lived at London, in the Minaries, near Tower Hill, was the first
that did frame 3 Spiral-Lines upon a Circular Instrument, for
Artificial-Numbers, Sines and Ta^gents; having two Brass Indices or Legs, fixed
upon the Center, and opening in manner of a Sector, so that, when 3 Terms were
given to find a fourth, the one Leg was placed to the first Term, and the
other to the second; then turning the Legs upon the Center, (not being altered
or changed) the first to the third Term, the second shall give the fourth
required: whither the work be in Trigonometrie, Plain, or Spherical; or in
Arithmetic simply. This Instrument can be had at London, being more
serviceable then his, which is only for Arithmetic He says, that by this
Instrument, they may work more Arithmetic in one hour, then any other in two
days with the Pen* But I say, (in Arithmetical-Problems,) with the Pen shall
work more in one hour, then he and his Spiral Line shall do n 10 days. --

A POSTSCRIPT By way of Epistle to the Candid-Reader.
Courteous Reader,
IT was an excellent Saying of CICERO, All the Praise of inward Virtue,
consists in the Good of outward Actions. Therefore, not only is it my
Genious, but earnest desire to serve my Country, into every thing most useful
and necessary for the Good thereof: especially, into that Noble and Famous Art
of Navigation, without which, all Trade and Commerce in every Kingdom, should
quite languish and decay. I have therefore, in this small Treatise, explained
the three several Motions of the Moon, (viz.) her slow Motion, her middle
Motion, and her swift Motion; together with Tables for her true rising and
setting: also, showing her Motion, in Signs, Degrees and Minutes, for every day
of her Age: with Everlasting Tyde-Tables for the Ebbs and Flowings of the Sea,
according to the Points of the Compass, and the Moons daily Age; (with the
Hours and Minutes) not only for the Coast of Scotland, which was never yet so
fully mentioned by any; but also, for all other places in the World. And having
revised and compared the best Authors, who mention these Flowings, and finding
the most part of them differing from each other in the same; have therefore by
advyce of judicious Seamen, made use of the best, and surest of them:
Nevertheless, I humbly entreat any of our Experienced, Industrious, and most
Laborious Seamen, who have Navigated these places, that they will be pleased
to help any small oversights, (if there be any,) and send me information
thereof by a Line, and accordingly I shall be most careful to amend the same
in the next Impression: being most willing to extend my self for the
Advancement of that Noble Art, intending (if this Impression go well off for my
Encouragement, and be well taken,) to publish another Excellent piece of
Navigation very shortly. Lastly, You have here a Mathematical Dialogue,
betwixt James Paterson pretended Mathematician at Edinburgh, and Me, John
Forbes Printer to the City, and Kings University of Aberdeen: in which
Dialogue, I have converted Vulgar Fractions into Decimalls, and therefore any
intelligent Person may reap some knowledge, and I hope, be well pleased with
the same. For, without any just Ground, or Provocation given, James Paterson
did most ignorantly Rhyme against me, into his Almanac, for the year 1683, and
likewise into his Almanac for the year 1684: making a great noise, concerning
the mistake of two days for Hallow-Even, although Hallow-Day was exactly right,
both for the day of the Week, and day of the Month: for all the World knows,
Hallow Even to fall upon the night before Hallow-Day. But his Errors are more
gross, making the Flood of Noah in his Chronology, in all his Almanacks three
hundred years short: A very beastly Error, besides other gross Errors, which I
forbear at this occasion, any more to mention. For, as the good old Saying is,
Envy shoots at others, and wounds her self. Truly I am heartily sorry,
that both Mathematician and Printers are so evil Principled in the Grounds of
Christianity, as holy Ambrose says, Envy is nothing else, but a Grief of the
Mind, at other Men's Prosperity. And for my own part, I do declare it to the
whole World, I hate such unrighteous and base Practices. For Agnes Campbel
Spouse to Patrick Telfer, has caused Counterfit and Re-print my Almanacks into
her Printing House these several years bygone, sometimes Entituling them by
Aberdeens Almanac, and other times, according to Forbesses Almanac, besides
she has for the ensuing year 1684, caused Print an Almanac as it were set
fourth at Aberdeen, and Printed in Aberdeen, which is a most notorious
untrueth: impudently affixing thereto, some Lines in the End, of Dogrell Rhyme,
whereby she would have me to Patronise her base Execrations; as tho (...),
(contrary to Christianity and the good Conduct of Nature,) should wish any man
for any cause to hang himself. For, I seriously declare, tho I be but one of
the meanest of his MAJESTY'S Subjects: yet, I not only heartily pray for his
long Life, and good Health; which I hold more to be my Duty, then to drink: but
also, I have so much presumption, as to strive to follow my GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN
in this matter, who by his numerous Acts of Clemency, has (indeed)
sufficiently declared to all the World, that he exactly follows his Great
LORD and MASTER in this, that he wishes not the Death or Ruin of his Subjects;
but rather that they would Repent and Live. For as Horace said well, Subjects
follow the Example of their Princes, as certain Flowers turn according to the
Sun.

Almighty GOD, preserve Our Gracious KING,
And's Subjects Hearts to due Obedience bring.
And as for Robert Sanders, Printer in Glasgow, he has not only inserted a
notorious Untrueth into all his Almanacks these diverse years bygone, (saying
set forth at Aberdeen, as if the Famous College of Glasgow had not so much
Mathematics, as to set forth an yearly Almanac, which in him, was no great
Act of Prudence,) but also, contrare to the Good and Just Laws of this Ancient
Kingdom, he has caused Counterfit the City of Aberdeen's Arms, and affixed
them upon his most Erroneous, and Uncorrected Almanac, for the year 1684:
whereof I am ashamed to speak, that such an Almanac should be published in
this Kingdom; as may be seen into the Termly Quarters and Asspects, etc.
tending much to the Discredit of that Famous City of Glasgow: not deserving to
be called their Printer, Consideratis, Considerandis. All which unrighteous
Practices, proceeds more from Envy then sound Christianity; according to the
good old Saying, The Envyous man thinks his Neighbors losses to be his
Gains. And as the Apostle says, Titus 1. 15. Unto the Pure all things are
pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbeleeving is nothing pure; but even
their very Mind and Conscience is defiled. And as for their Lying which is
such a gross Sin, that the Holy Spirit of GOD, in the Scriptures does very
often expressly prohibet, as Rev. 21. 27. Rev. 22 15 and very many other places
in Scripture. Yea, King David himself says Psalm 63. 11. The mouth of them
that speak Lie shall be stopped, etc. I might very largely insis^ upon this,
only I shall desire the Guilty to be more studious, and serious with the Holy
Scriptures (...) GOD, which is the Rule of our Life. For, (...) very Heathen
Egyptians, they made a Law, that ever Liar should be put to Death. And Xenophon
says, that a Lie is not capable of Pardon.

Courteous Reader, having Patiently born with all these injuries and Wrongs
done unto me, for a long time, I could not (having this Opportunity) but clear
my self, in giving you a view thereof, for which I humbly crave your Charitable
Censure. For, as Augustine says, Patience being often provoked with Injuries,
breaks forth at last into Fury. I shall not (at present) Enlarge any farther,
but (as I did begin with my Antagonist James Paterson, who was the Principal
Occasioner of this Discourse) shut up all with that good Saying of Augustine,
Amongst the Foolish he is the greatest Fool, that knows little, and yet would
seem ^o know much. And therefore I Conclude thus:

^ames Paterson, your Wisdom is not great,
As may be seen into your Works of late:
For though you say that I do Art disgrace,
Not knowing where I do my Errors place;
^et sure I am, they should have a Clean-Pow,
Who always call their Neighbor Nittie-Now.
^or all the Errors you put to my Door.
^re less then yours, even by an hundred score.
^our Hallow Even, and your Corrected Table,
^re but two frolicks, coming from a Babble.
(...) for your Eclipses and Moon's-Aspects,
^ou are ashamed thereof in all respects.
^here's nothing then, whereof I shall think shame,
^ver to publish in my Countries Name.
But notice Sir, Here is a pretty Jest;
That Vulgar still esteems our Works the best;
As you confess, into your Almanac
For Eighty-foure, which is a pretty Knack.
It being holden for a real truth,
When men confess the same with their own Mouth.
Yea, fie upon it. You should Art disgrace!
And wrong GOD'S Word with such a brazen face;
Making GOD'S Works three hundred Years to sleep,
Since Noah's-Ark did float upon the Deep.
Which beastly Error, I shall make appear,
From Almanacks you have made Year by Year.
Now if this be the best part of your Pratticks;
Which do proceed from Irish-Mathematicks:
SCOTLAND will then have no more of the same,
But keep themselves by BON-ACCORD'S Good Name:
Who still shall have the Praise what e're befall,
Because your Errors are so gross, in all.
Your Spirall-Line, and eke your Line of Chords,
Both of them little Wit, or Skill affords.
Such learned Subjects, and such stately Knacks,
Are most unfit for Yearly Almanacks.
Whose Matter still should be for Vulgar use,
Neglecting which, you do your self abuse
Now if you will Rhyme more in the next Year,
My Answers then shall be apparent clear.
Your Almanacks by Mine. I pray to mend,
I Will say no more. I think it time to end.
F1I6N8I3S quod FORBES.

GOD SAVE THE KING.
