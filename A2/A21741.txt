By the Queen.
Forasmuch as it is notorious, in what sort, sithence the public arrest
first made of the Queens Majesty's subjects, and of their ships and goods
in the low countries of the king of Spain, in the later end of December, in
the year of our Lord God. 1568. her Majesty has been pleased to give sundry
orders for the preservation of the goods of the subjects of the said king,
being afterward arrested in this Realm, for the indempnitie of her Majesty's
subjects, without yeeldyng to make any sale of them, saving some small
portions, which otherwise would have perished, although sale was before made
generally in the low countries of the goods of her Majesty's subjects there
arrested: and how also afterward her Majesty was well pleased, that certain
of her marchantes should repair into the low countries, to treat with the
Duke of A^lua, Lieuetenant to the said king, who had already sold their
goods, for some treaty of a mutual restitution of al manner of things
arrested or stayed in any of the kingdoms and countries of both the said
princes, whereby not only the subjects of both parts, being owners, might be
relieved by recovery of their own, but thereby th occasion of unkindness,
that might for lack of restitution ensue betwixt both the princes, might also
be avoided. Whereupon did also follow, that certain persons in the name of
both the princes, have treated for the manner of restitution, wherein many
delays have been used by the ministers of the part of the said king. And yet
when by the frequent solisitation of her Majesty's ministers used, it was
thought that all the great difficulties of the treaty had been fully past, and
that the articles and couenantes were ordered to be fair written, or, as the
common speech is, put into mundum, so as it was on the Queens Majesty's part
daily looked, that the same should have been subscribed and sealed by the
ministers on both sides, and so order for restitution to have followed without
delay: her Majesty notwithstanding this her preceadyng, finds that contrary
to her expectation, the ministers that treated on the part of the king of
Spain, not only lacked sufficient authority to conclude, as reason was they
should, and as they had from the beginning thereof ben oftentimes remembered,
to procure sufficient commission: but also they did, when the conclution was
looked for, newly offer before her Majesty's counsel, to add such other
strange clauses and conditions, as could not be accepted in any reason,
without the manifest prejudice of her Majesty's honnour, and principally,
without a plain and open gate or way to defeat the very certainty of
restitution to her Majesty's subjects, with a special provision
notwithstanding for a certainty for the subjects of the king of Spain.
Whereof, though the said ministers were plainly and at good length enfourmed
by her Majesty's counsel, and most earnestly required to refourme the same, and
to make all the couenantes equal and reciproke for both parts: yet they would
not be induced thereto, pretending that without further authority from the
Duke of Alua, they could not alter those their new clauses. Wherefore, her
Majesty consyderyng the long delays herein used, the decays of the goods
here arrested, the lamentable complaints of her marchantes for lack of
relief, with this also, that in the low countries the goods of her Majesty's
subjects were already sold, by order of the Duke of Alua long time sythence,
and that in Spain also such as were of any value, were sold by order of the
kings ministers there, and the rest, for the most part, wasted for lack of
keeping: has by advise of her said counsel, as it were thereto urged by very
necessity, determined to cause a public sale to be made of the goods of the
said kings subjects arrested in any of her Majesty's dominions. In which
sale, her Majesty's determination and pleasure is, that al dexterity and
sincerity shall be used: and for that purpose, her Majesty has by advise of
her counsel, caused a competent number of expert, skilful, and honest
marchantes, as well English men, as strangers of sundry nations, to be
appointed, whereof also such of the subjects of the said king of Spain, as
conveniently could be found, have been named, called, and offered to be
parties if they will, who upon their oaths shall make open sale of all the
ships, goods, wares, and marchandizes arrested, to the most advantage and
advancement in price they can or may, without showing any affection therein
directly or indirectly, to them selves, or to any other person whatsoever. And
for the better execution thereof, her Majesty is pleased, and does license
every proprietarie or owner of any the said ships or goods so arrested or
deteyned here, as is aforesaid, or the factour, or lawful attorney of any
such owner, safely and freely to come into this Realm, at any time within
thirty days after the publication hereof, presenting them selves with all
convenient speed after their arriual, to such as shall be appointed to sell the
said marchandizes, and not doing or attempting any thing to the derogation or
hurt of her Majesty, her subjects, or Realm, but to depart after the said
sales made to them without they shall be otherwise licensed: and that they may
also lawfully buy al such goods, wares, an marchandizes, as by their marks,
or otherwise may be proved to belong to them, giving as much as any other
reasonably will for the same, and that all and every person and persons buying
any of the said ships, goods, wares, or marchandizes, may carry and
transport the same into any place or country beyond the seas, where it shall
seem good to them, if the same can not as profitably be sold here, paying al
duties and customs due and payable for the same. And for the further
declaration also of her Majesty's good disposition and intent, her Majesty
does by these presents notify to al persons, that notwithstanding the
proceadyng of this sale, none shall be refused that shall come from the said king
fully auctho^^^ed by commission, but shall be wyllyngly heard to treat further,
and conclude any thing that may tend to the benefit and good of both their
kingdoms and countries, and to the weal of the marchantes and subjects on
both parts. And forasmuch as it is suspected, that diverse persons have
imbecelled and conveyed, and yet do witholde diverse goods, wares, and
marchandizes belongyng to the subjects of the said king of Spain: her
Majesty does straightly charge and command al manner of persons within her
dominions, which have sythence the time of the foresaid arrest had any
ships, goods, or money, belonging to the subjects of the said king of
Spain, in his or their custody or possession, whereof there is no report yet
made, according to a proclamation set forth the last of June. 1570. shall
within forty days after the publication hereof, bring or send a tuft report
thereof, to such persons as shall be assigned or appointed for the sale of the
wares and marchandizes, upon pain that any making default of such report,
shall not only incur her Majesty's displeasure, but shall also after this
admonition, be charged and punished as concealors and deteynors thereof with
felonious minds and intentes.

Yeuen at her highness palace of Westminster, the fourteenth day of January,
in the fourteenth year of her Majesty's reign.
God save the Queen.
