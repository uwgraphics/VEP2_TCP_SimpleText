By the King. A Proclamation for the well ordering the Trade and Vent of Wines
thorowout the Kingdom.
THe Kings most Excellent MAJESTY having taken into consideration the manifold
abuses, in the mixtures, and falsifying of Wines, by Coopers and others, who of
late years have assumed the Trade of buying and selling of Wines in gross, and
by retail, being the proper Trades of Merchants, and Vintners of the Realm, to
the deceit and damage of His Subjects; and being minded to provide for
reformation therein, by reducing the Trade and dealing for Wines to the
Merchants and Vintners of the Kingdom according to ancient custom and right,
who the eleventh day of June last have thereupon assented and agreed to answer
His Majesty forty shillings upon every Tun of Wines, which they shall import
or sell in gross, or by retail:

His Majesty therefore intending the regulation of the said Trade of Wines,
and the prevention of such mixtures and other frauds and abuses therein; Is
pleased (with the advice of His Privy Counsel) to declare His Royal pleasure
therein, and does therefore hereby straightly charge and command, that no person
whatsoever, now using, or which hereafter shall use the Trade of a Cooper,
shall by himself, servants, or any other for him, or to his use, from
henceforth use the Trade of buying or selling of any sort of Wines whatsoever
within the Realm of England, Dominion of Wales, and Port and Town of Barwick,
upon pain of His Majesty's high displeasure, and such penalties and punishments
as shall be thought meet to be inflicted upon the Offenders, for their contempt
of His Majesty's Royal Commandment herein.

And to the end that hereafter none but good and wholesome Wines may be uttered
and sold within the Realm, His Majesty's pleasure is, that any two or more of
the sworn Searchers of the Company of Vintners of London, or any other persons
by them authorized under their common Seal, may enter into the Houses, Vaults,
Cellers, or other places of or belonging to any Merchants, Vintners, or other
Retailers of Wines within the said Realm, and there taste and try any Wines,
which they shall suspect to be falsified or unwholesome, and may carry away such
small quantities of the said suspected Wines, as may serve for the trial
thereof.

And whereas as well the Merchants of London trading to Spain, as the Governor
and Company of Merchants of London trading to France, and the Company of
Vintners of London have severally assented and agreed to answer his Majesty
forty shillings per Tun, for all such Wines of what sort soever, as they
shall import and sell in gross or by retail; His Majesty therefore wills
and commands all His Customers and other Officers in the Port of London, and
the Members thereof, that no Entries be made, or Wines landed, before a Bill of
Entry be signed by such as His Majesty has or shall appoint to receive the
said duty; And that no Merchants, Mariners, or other persons His Majesty's
natural born Subjects, Denizens or Strangers, that shall hereafter sell any
Wines in gross to Vintners or others, shall deliver any such Wines so sold,
before notice thereof be given to His Majesty's Officer in the said Port
appointed to receive the said duty, and his Certificate of satisfaction for
the same. And for such Wines as any Merchants or other Importers shall fail to
give such notice of, His Majesty's will and pleasure is, That in such case the
Merchants or Importers themselves shall answer and pay the said forty
shillings per Tun, and so proportionably for every lesser quantity, at such
time as His Majesty's Receiver, who is or shall be appointed in that behalf,
shall require the same, whom His Majesty does authorize to demand and receive
the said duty, and to take an account of the said Merchants or Importers of
Wines, to whom they disposed of the same.

And his Majesty's further will and pleasure is, that all Vintners and
Retailers of Wines within the City of London, and within three miles thereof,
for all such Wines as they, since the eleventh day of June last, have sold, or
shall sell in Gross, or by Retail, shall answer for his Majesty's use, to such
as are or shall be appointed thereunto, the said forty shillings per Tun, and so
proportionably for every lesser quantity: And for the due payment thereof, his
Majesty does authorize such persons as he has or shall under his great Seal of
England, assign to receive the said duty, and their Deputies to make search in
all Houses, Vaults, Cellers, and other places where any Wines imported, bought
or sold, shall be, or shall be suspected to be, which ought to pay the said
duty. And whereas diverse Vintners of London, and Westminster, and other
Retailers of Wines in the Realm of England and Dominion of Wales, have used of
late to utter their Wines in Bottles, and other unsized and unlawful measures,
and at excessive rates; His Majesty's will and Pleasure is, that from
henceforth no sort of Wines shall be sold in any house or other place
whatsoever, in Bottles, or other unsized or unlawful measures, but only by the
due and lawful measure appointed for Wines, and at no greater rates then are
or shall be hereafter allowed and set for the prizes of Wines yearly, according
to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm. And for the more equal ballancing and
regulating the said Trade of Wines thorowout the whole Kingdom, and the
prevention of all frauds and abuses therein, either in quality or quantity, his
Majesty does expect that all Merchants, and other Retailers of Wines in all
other his Majesty's Ports, Cities, Boroughs, Towns, and places whatsoever
within the Realm of England, Dominion of Wales, Port and Town of Barwick, do
and shall conform themselves in all things to the order, rule and government of
the Merchants and Vintners of London. And his Majesty does further declare his
pleasure to be, That no wines which shall be sold in gross in London, or
within three miles thereof, shall hereafter be drawn or taken out of any
Cellers, Vaults, Warehouses, or other places, by any Porters, Carmen, Coopers,
or any others, then by the Porters and persons thereunto authorized by the said
Company of the Vintners of London, upon pain of his Majesty's high displeasure,
and of such penalties as may be inflicted upon them. And whereas his Majesty is
informed, that for want of due regulation of Trade amongst Merchants and
others, trading to Spain, and the Dominions thereof, the prizes of the Wines
and fruits there are much enhaunced, and his Majesty's Subjects, and their
Ships, and Goods are oftentimes taken by Pirates, and exposed to many dangers,
through want of Consortship at Sea, his Majesty intending reformation therein,
has invested the Merchants of London trading to Spain, and the Dominions
thereof, with power to select yearly nine Merchants amongst them, for the well
ordering and government of their Trade both at home and in foreign parts, and
for the appointing of Ships from time to time. Wherefore his Majesty does
hereby declare His Royal will and pleasure to be, and does straightly charge and
command, that all his Subjects, Merchants of London trading to Spain, and the
Dominions thereof, do from henceforth conform themselves to all such reasonable
and lawful orders, as by the said nine selected Merchants, or the greater part
of them, shall from time to time be made, for the advancing of Trade into those
parts, with better regulation and safety: And this, as well under the penalties
thereby to be provided, as of his Majesty's displeasure, and such punishments
as shall be meet for their contempts. And whereas his Majesty has lately
granted to the Company of Vintners of London, the disposing and contracting for
all Wine Licenses, within the Kingdom of England, and Dominion of Wales, and
Town of Barwick; and being informed that diverse Vintners and Retaylers of Wines
are in Arrear, both in the payment of their fines and rents due to his
Majesty, whereby their Licenses are become void; His Majesty's will and
pleasure is, That if such as be in Arrear shall not pay their several
Arrearages before the first day of November next, then it shall be lawful for
the said Company of Vintners to dispose of their Licenses to whom they shall
think fit. And his Majesty does further require, authorize and command, as
well all Justices of Peace, Mayors, Sheriffs, Bailiffs, Constables,
Headboroughs, and other his Officers and Ministers, as all his Customers,
Controllers, Farmers of his Customs, Surveyors, Searchers, Waiters, and other
the Officers of all and every his Ports, and the members thereof, that they,
and every of them, in their several Offices and Places respectively, take care
that his Majesty's royal will and pleasure herein declared be from time to
time duly observed, upon pain of his Majesty's high displeasure, and the
penalties to ensue thereupon.

Given at the Court at Greenwich, the 15 day of July, in the fourteenth year of
his Majesty's Reign.
God save the King.

Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1638.
