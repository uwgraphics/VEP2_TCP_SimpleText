TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCE CHRISTOPHER DUKE OF ALBEMARLE, ON HIS VOYAGE TO
HIS GOVERNMENT of JAMAICA.
IT is resolved! His Word and Honor's past!
We must submit, and let the Hero go:
This Scanty Isle He long has Served and Graced,
And distant Worlds expect Him now.
No Grateful Laurels this allows,
To Crown the Noble Victor's Brows:
Supinely here His Generous Youth was lost,
Which should more memorable Glories boast;
Such as should more Renown His Name,
And still maintain alost His spreading Fame.
His Soul by Nature Bravely Rough and Great,
Scorns the Confinement of a Home-Retreat;
But soft Repose, that Court-Disease,
Infectious to the Great and Young,
Subdued His Martial Mind to Ease,
And Charmed Him with her Pleasures long.
Born for Great Action, but compelled to Sloth,
He yields to all the Splendid Baits for Youth.
II.
So the Young Victor did at Capua lie,
Tamely unnerv'd in Luxury;
While all his gilded Arms hung Useless by:
In daz'ling Riots wantoned with his Fair,
Despising Conquests, and renouncing War,
Till Glory waked him from the Enchanting Dream,
And pointing out his Youth a Nobler Theme.
He rowses now, and puts his Armor on,
Gives Order for his Warlike Steeds;
In vain the Lovely Charmer Weeps and Pleads,
He Will be no more by Idle Love undone;
In vain the shining Goblets take their Round,
And with Obliging Healths are Crowned,
The Ivory Tables bending with the Weight
Of Costly Fare, in O're-charg'd Plate:
He now for Fame Ignoble Ease disdains;
Bravely Resolved, he breaks the Lazy Chains.
III.
Well did Great Caesar know,
His Grandeur and Magnificence
To Newfound Worlds He could not show
So greatly to His Fame, as now,
In so Renowned a Prince:
Already to the utmost Bounds of Shore
His Mighty Name is gone before.
Great ALBEMARLE the Sea-born Nereids sung,
Upon that Memorable Day,
When all the Floods let loose their joyful Throng,
And bore the MARTYR'S SONS in Triumph over the Sea:
And still between the Monarchs Praise
The Fame of ALBEMARLE they raise;
Crowns to the Royal Youths they brought, and to the Victor Bays.
IV.
How must that Wondering World rejoice to see
Their Land so Honored, and themselves so Blessed,
When on their Shores (Great Prince) they Welcome Thee,
Whose Brave Hereditary Loyalty
Has been so many generous ways expressed?
What Homage must Your Ravished Subjects pay
For the vast Condescension You have shown?
What Treasures offer, how enough Obey,
Their Humble Gratitude to own,
When they behold a Prince so Great
From an Illustrious Court retreat,
To render all their Happiness complete?
A Prince whom no Ignoble Interest sways
To trust his Fortune with the Fickle Seas,
Although its Tributary Waves before
Allowed Him so immense a Store,
As if the Wonders of the Deep till now,
Of which we have so often been told,
Did never yet its meaning show,
Till yielding up the Miracle in Gold:
And it is Great ALBEMARLE alone
Has found the Secret of the Philosophic Stone.
V.
With Him, His Princess, whose High Birth
Must Adoration claim
Over all the Habitable Earth
That ever heard the Great Newcastle's Name.
How justly is our Verse a Tribute due,
Illustrious Patroness, to You!
Descended from a Prince and Poet too!
That Honor which no Mortal Power can give,
And is alone the Gods Prerogative;
Like that bright Virtue which does in You shine,
And, more than Mortal, renders You Divine.
Prepare, ye Sun-scorch'd Natives of the Shore,
Prepare another Rising Sun to adore,
Such as has never blessed your Horizon before.
And you the Brave Inhabitants of the Place,
Who have by Conquest made it all your own,
Whose Generous and Industrious Race
Has paid such Useful Tribute to the Crown;
See what your Grateful King for you has done!
Behold a Prince high in His Favor placed,
By Fortune Blessed, and lavish Honor Graced,
Loved by the Great, and Worshipped by the Crowd,
Of whom the Nation has so long been proud,
The Soldiers Honor, and the Brave Man's Friend,
The Muses best-lov'd Theme,
To whom their Noblest Verse they Recommend,
And to whose Virtues pay their Noblest Flame.
VI.
This Prince, thus Loved, we do resign to you,
Yet must but lend Him for a space:
Fond Parents lose their Darling so,
To Dangers thus they let him go,
With tender Tears, and many a soft Embrace;
Loath to forego the Treasure of their Heart,
And yet would have him Honor share,
With trembling Doubts and Fears at last they part,
With Vows and Prayers commit Him to Heavens Care.
We lend Him to eternize you a Fame,
That to the Coming Age your Land may boast,
Of all that e're Obeyed Great CAESAR'S Name,
He Honored yours the Most.
Prepare your Triumphs, and your Songs of Joy,
Let ALBEMARLE'S Great Name resound
To all your Happy Shores, and let the Sea
To the glad Echo's and the Nymphs convey
The grateful Tidings all around,
While the soft Breezes prune their Wings,
And gather all their Gentlest Air,
(In the Rich Groves, dressed with Perpetual Springs)
To Fan and Entertain the Hero there.
Let all your World be Glad and Gay,
To make His Joys Complete,
Eternal Zephires round Him play,
And Flowers beneath His Feet.
Thus for Our Honor, and for your Repose,
We are content Our Happiness to lose:
But, like the Souls to Bodies newly Born,
He is but Lent, more Glorious to Return.
FINIS.
