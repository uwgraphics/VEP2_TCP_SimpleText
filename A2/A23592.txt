The Prologue
IN so much that it is necessary to all creatures of christian relygyon / or of
falls relygyon / or gentyles and machomytes / to know there prince / or pryncis
/ y^ regne upon them / and them to obey. So it is comodious to know there noble
acts and deeds / and the circu^staunce of there lives. Therefore in the year of
our lord.M.CCCC.lxxxiij. year of the regne of king* Edward the fourth at
saint Albons / so that all men may know the acts namely of our noble kings
of England / is compyled together this book / and more over is translated out
of latin in to english / fro the beginning of the world y^ lygnage of Christ
/ from Adam till it be comen to Dauyd. And from Dauyd / y^ kings of Israel and
of Jews the high bishops in there days with y^ Iuges and prophets. The
four pryncypall reames of the world / that is to say of Babylon. of Percees.
of Greeks. and of Romans. And all the Emperors of Rome / or Popes / by order
/ and there names. And many a notable fader with certain of there acts. As more
plainly is declared in the chapter next after. And here ben reherced the names
of the Auctours / of whom these Chronicles ben translated most namely.
Galfridus Nunmoth monk in his book of Brute Saint Bid in the acts of
England. Itm^ Bid in his book of times. Gyldas in the acts of Brytayne.
William Malmesbury monk in the acts of kings of England and bishops.
Cassiderus of the acts of Emperors and bishops. Saint Austyn de ci. dei.
Titus Liuius de gestis Romano^. Martyn Penitency ary to the pope in his
Chronicles of Emperors and Bishops. And namely Theobaldus Cartusiensis
containing in his book the progress of all notable faders from the beginning
of the world unto our time / with the notable acts of y^ same. In this new
translacyon are contained many notable and meruaylous things. And those ben
alleged by auctoryte of many famous clerbes. And that every man may know how
these Chronicles ben ordered. Ye shall understand / that this book is dyuyded
in to vij. parts. Of the which the first part contained from Adam till Brute
came in to Brytayne. The second part conteyneth from Brute came first in to
England. unto the cite of Rome was burlded by Romolus. The third part
conteyneth sith Rome was builded unto Christ was born of our lady Ma^^. The
fourth from thens unto the coming of Saxons in to England. The fyfth part
from thens / unto the coming of the Danys. The sixte part from thens / unto
y^ coming of the Normans. The seventh part fro the Normans / unto our time /
which is under the regne of king Edward the fourth.rrij. re^^ / whoos noble
chronicles by cust^me may not be seen. And so in every part of these.vij.
parts ben showed the moost^ necessary acts of all the kings of England /
and their names written above in the margent / that every man may hynde them
soon. And before the king of Englondes acts ben written ^ there is written y^
lygnage of Christ from Adam till that Christ was borne of our lady with the hye
bishop and the Judge that were in y^ time / and certain of there acts necessary
/ till it be common till Christ was borne. And after that Christ was borne and
Peter was Pope of Rome is showed by order the names of all the popes and
emperors of Rome / before and after with certain of there acts breuyarly / and
many other diverse things and merueyles in those men's days falling. And it
is showed every thing in his place how many year it fell after y^ beginning
of the world / and how long before y^ Christ was borne. And when y^ I come to
Christ was borne / then it is written how long any thing fell after the
Natyuyte of Crist And this is the order of this book / and the things that been
spoken of.

ANd as to men desyryng / to have a very knowl^he / of these Chronicles / or of
any other / it is necessary / to know.vi. things. The first is the states of
things / and those ben two. One is fro the begynny^ge of the world unto
Christ / the which is called the state of Diuiacion. The second is from Christ
to the end of the world / the which is called the state of Reconsiliaco^n.
The second thing is the diuysyon of times and those ben three. One is before
the law of Moses / and an other is under the law of Moses / an other is
under y^ law of grace after crist dyed. The third is / the gouernynge of
kingdoms. And as for that ye must know / that all though there were four
pryncypal kingdoms that is to say. Of Babylon / of Perfecs / of Grekis / and
Romans. Never ^heles / as to y^ course of the world / and the order of holy
scripture / the first gouer^^^ge was under faders / from Adam unto Moses. The
second / under Iuges from Moses unto Saul. The third / under kings / from
Saul unto Zorobabel. The fourth vn^ bishops / from Zorobabel unto Christ. The
fourth is y^ dyuersyte of laws / and those were five. The first was / the law
of nature / and that was common to all men. The second is / the law or the
custom of Gentyles / when y^ under king Nyno began the people to worship falls
gods. The third is under the law written / rose y^ law of Jews / when
Circumcisyon divided the Jews from other people. The fourth is / under Christ /
rose the law of christian men / when faith and grace of the sacraments /
informed the life of men. The fyfthe under Machomete / rose the law of
Sarrasyns and Turks. The fyfth is / the nobleness / or vnnoblenesse in deeds.
And as to these / it is to know that.vij. persons ben read of / whom the
deeds many times are had in mind in hystoryes. That is to wit / of a prince
in his reame / of a knight in ba^ayll. of a Judge in his place / of a bishop in
the clergy / of a polytyk man in the people / of an husbonde man in y^ house /
and of an abbot in his church. And of these are written many times / the lauds
of good men / and the pnnysshementes of the cursyd men. The sixthe is the true
countynge of the years. And as to that / it is to be know / that there
were.viij. manner of nombrynge / or cou^tynge of the years. Three after the
Hebrews. Three after ye G^ekis. One after the Romayas. And one now after the
christian men. The she brewes / three manner of wise begins there year. After the
Hebrews there is the year usual / beginning at January / ye which they use
in couenau^tes and barge^s making. And the year leyffull beginning at March
/ the which they use in their cerymonyes. And the year Emergens from May
begy^nynge when they went from Egypt. they use in their chronicles and
calculacions. The Grekys nombreth there years three manner of wise. First to the
glory and Joy of there victory / counts there years from the destruccyon of
Troy The first / the second / the third / the fourth and. Then after the
chyualry began at the hylle of Olympus / they notefyed the years after the
same Olympiadu^. And what Olympiades is / ye shall know after in the book. The
third / when they began to have lordshyp of all the world / they notefyed
there years these manner of wise. In the year of the regne of Grekys the.iiij.
the.x. the.xv. and. as it is open in the book of Machabeorr. Theme after the
Romans gouernynge the world / counted and nombred there years (ab vrbe
condi^a) The last of all Christian men counts there years from the Incarnacyon
of Crist. And because we ben Christian men we use most to nombre / from the
begy^ nynge of the world / unto Christ was borne. And fro Christ was borne /
unto our time. And this order is observed and kept in all the book / of every
thing in his place as it is said before.

Explicit Prologus.
Hic incipit Fructus tempor.
Because of this books made / to tell what time of any thing notable was.
Therefore y^ beginning of all times shortly shall be touched. For the which
after doctors it is to be known / y^ four things were made first / and in
one time / and of one age. That is to wit / the heaven Imperyall / angels
nature / the matere of the four elements / and time. And that doctors call
/ the work of the creacion / the which was made before any day or night / of
the mighty power of god. And was made of no thing. Then after follows the
work of the diuysyon / the which was made in three of the first days / in
which is showed the high wysedom of the maker. Then after follows y^
arayenge of this work in the which is showed the goodness of the creature /
the which was made.iij. of the next days following (Vt patz clare in textu
gen^. priu^) The first day god made / and dyuyded the light from the
derkenesse. The second day god made / and ordained the fyrmament / and
dyuyded the water from the water. The third day god made in the which he
gadred the waters in to one place / and ye earth tho apperid. The fourth day
god made / in the which he ordained the son / the moon / and the sterres and
put them in ye fyrmament. The fyfth day god made / in the which he ordained
fysshes and fowls / and great whales in the water. The sixth day god or deyned
/ in the which he made be and man. The seventh day god made / and in that
day he rested of all works that he had ordained / not as in werkyng bey^ge
weary / but he sessid to make mo new creatures (Vide plura ge^.i.)

BE it know / that Adam the first man / of whom it is written in this first
aege next following / lived.ix. hundred year and.xxx. And he ga^e.xxxij. sons
/ and as many daughters.

Anno mundi.i. Et ante x^^ natu^^^ tatem.v.M.C.lxxxxix.
Here begins the first aege during unto the flood of Noe

Adam Eua



IN the first year of the world the sixth day / god made Adan in ye field
Damascen^ and Eua of his rybbes puttyng them in paradys. And badde them to keep
his commandment / y^ they should not ete of the fruit of life / under y^
pain of death. And the same day that they had sinned / anon he cast them out
of paradys / in to the loud of cursydnesse / that they should live there with
swetynge and sorrow till they dyed (Vide plura Gen^.i.) This Adam was an holy
man all ye days of his life / great penall^e and daily he did. And he
commanded his children to live ryghtwysly. And namely yt they should avoid in
all wise from ye company of Cayn and his childn Nor yt they should not marye with
none of them. This man Adam was our first fader. And for oo sin he put us
out of Paradys. But through his holy co^uersacion and penance / he gave us en
ensample to come to ye kingdom of heaven. And he yt will not follow his holy
co^uersaco^n and example / for oo sin ryghtwysly / he can not compain on
him / as we do many. Seth sone to Adam was borne after ye beginning of the
world.C. and xxx years / and lived.ix.C. and.xij. But Moses ouerskypped an
hundred of those / in the which Abell wept in ye vale of Ploracyon nyghe
Ebron. This Seth for ye oil of mercy to be gotten / went to paradys. Delbora
was sister to Abell. Abell was slain of Cayn his brother. This Abell ye first
martyr began the church of god. This man after Austyn made ye cite of god /
and he was the first cytezyn of ye cite. And by cause yt he was ryghtwys our
lord received his offrynge. Calmana was sister and wife to Cayn. This Cayn was
a cursyd man / and he made the first erthly cite that ever in this world was
in the which he put his people for dread / in so much as he used rauyn and by
olence. For he trusts such thing to be done to him / as he did to other /
therefore he put him and his in to a syker place. This man slew his brother
Abell for envy / and he was punysshed of god / and wandered about in a
dispeyre. And after was slain of Lameth a blind man.

ANos of the line of Christ lived.ix.C. year and.v. This ^^nos began to call
the name of our lord. It might hap he found some words of prayer / or made
some images for god to be worshypped / as now is in y^ church. Chanam lived
after.ix.C. year and.x.

Anno mundi.vij.C.lxxxxv. Et ante xp^i natiuitate^.iiij.M.iiij.C.iiij.
MAlalcel of the line of Christ lived.viij.C.lxxxxv. year Iareth of y^ same
line lived.ix.C.lxij Enoch of the same line lived.iij.C. year.lxv. This Enoch
was a ryghtwys man / and pleased god. And for his great holiness our lord
translated him in to paradys where he lives with Hely / in great rest of body
and soul / till the coming of Antecryst. Then they shall go forth for the
confortaco^n of good men. And they shall be crowned with the crown of
martyrdom.

MAtusale of Crystis line / lived.ix.C.lxix. years. This matusale was the
oldest man y^ ever any scripture has mind of. For when he had lived nyghe
five hundred year / our lord said to him. Build the an house and thou wylt /
for yet thou shall live.v. hundred year. And he answered and said. For so little
a time as.v. hundred year. I wylbuylde no house. But rested under trees and
hegges / and there slept / as he was wont to do for a time.

Anno mundi.M.iiij.C.liiij. Et ante xp^i natiuitate^.iij.M.vij.C.xlv.
LAmeth was of aege.vij. hundred lxxvij. This Lameth the first against nature
and good manners / ordained that a man might have two wives / in doing his
auowtry. And he was sore punysshed of them ^ for they gave hy^ many a strype.
For it is so / that by what thing a man synneth / by the same he is
punysshed. This Lameth slew Cayn wylfully not. But when he was old and blind
/ he was ladde of a child / ye which trowed / that he had seen a wild best
/ and said to his master / that he should shote / and so he slew Cayn.
Wherefore he beat the child so sore that the child also was deed. And it is to
be known that all crafts / or scyences lyberall / or hand crafts / or of
physyke serving to the curyosyte of man / are read / y^ they were fou^den of
the children of Lameth And for they dradde the peril to come of the flood and
of the fire / therefore Tuball graued the same crafts in two pylers. The one
was of Marbyll / and the other of tyle or brycke. Tuball found first the
craft to work gold and silver / and yren. And was the first grauer that ever
was. Iabe found first Tentoria for shepeherdes / and pauelyons for other men.
Iuball found first the craft to play upon an harp and organs and other
musycall Instruments he vsid. Noema found first the craft for to weue lynnen

conuenyent pain this time was ordained to the world. For then lechery
habou^ded the which defouled man's body. And there by water the earth was
washed and cleansed / in sign of the promise / that god made to man / that
there should never be such a flood again. And the Rain bow has two
pryncypall colors the which represente the two Iugementes The water color
represents the flood that is passyd. The fire color betokens the
Judgment to come / and fire / by the which we certainly abide in the end of
this world / by cause ^ouetyse shall habou^de / by fire it shall be burnt.
Gold and silver by the fire is wont to be clensyd.

Here begynn the the second aege of the world during to Abraham.

Noe.



THis Noe was a ryghtwys man and found grace against god^ When Noe was five
hundred year of aege / he had gotten Cham. Sem. ^. I^phet. That time by the
commandment of god / he began to make a ship. And he made it parfyt in an
hundred year. And the hundred year complete ^ our lord god appeared again to
him (...) commanded him / that he with his wife and his children / and the
wives of them should enter the ship with all manner of beestes / and all manner
of fowls also etc. And anon the flood came and stood above all hills. ^v.
cubytes (Vide pluragen^. vijus.) After the flood a great dronkenesse betyde
unto Noe. And thorugh occasyon of that dronkenesse be blessed his two sons.
Sem and Iaphet^ for the faders honor that they had to him and for the honest
shame / that they covered mekely there faders memb^es / when he was slepynge.
And his sone Cham for his scornynge and his irreverence he cursyd. And here
after saint Austyn is made ^ the first mencyon of boundage / and of noblynesse
contrary to it. For Noe said / y^ Cham should be servant in bondage to Sem and
Iaphet / for his irreverence. Nevertheless ye shall not trow / that all that
descended of Cham were unnoble men and of no power. For they began first to be
mighty men of y^ earth. As it is open of Nemroth and y^ king of Canaan and
Asco^. Nor all of Sem and Iaphet were virtuous and noble and mighty men / when
almoost eueryche one fell in to y^ crime of ydolatry / and were often times
oppressyd of other men. But this blessing and this cursynge has a respect to
virtue and vice / for y^ which a man is called truly a noble man or an
unnoble man. For he y^ is virtuous is a noble man and he y^ is vnuertuous is
not noble. The same manner of wise / tho y^ follows the faith of Abraham /
rather were called his childern than the Jews / the which carnally descended
from him. Nevertheless they had a spirytuall preuylege of god / for y^ faders
merys^^ and his blessing. And of these.iij. sons of Noe he being alive after
thistory of Philois were born.xxiiij M. and.vij. C^nen without wy^men and
childern And they had on them three princes Nemorth. Iectan. and Suphen.

SEm sone to Noe the second year after y^ flood gate Arphaxat / and other
while he is called Melchisedech The which first after the flood made y^ cite
of Salem and now it is called Jerusalem. Cham his brother opteyned Affricam /
and gate sons tweyne. Chus and Mesraym. And these two gate sons and daughters
and many a Regyon was of them / and many of them to us ben unknown for they
enhabyte and have their ma^syons in the occidentall Ynde. Iaphet was brother
unto Cham and was blessed of his fader / and this Iaphet had.vij. sons. as
Gomoi. Magog. Maday. Ianam. Tuball. Mosog. and Iras. And these.vij. gate sons
and doughtes / and of them came many a regyon (Vide plura Gen^.xv.) Arphaxat
sone to Sem lived.cccc. and xxx. year. And gate Elam. Assure. Ludde / and Aram
/ and they gate many a sone and daughter (vt ^z geu^) This Assure / by cause he
would not rebel against god. in the edefyenge and building of y^ toure of
Babylon / as Nemroth did / therefore he was driven unto the land of Sennaars
land / which was right strange to him / and was not before enhabyted / The
which was called after his name Assuria. And there he edefyed and builded a
cite afterward named Niniue / y^ which was the Metropolon of all the kingdom
of Assuriu^. Chus sone to Cham was fader to Nemroth. This Nemroth was a gyaunt
of.x. cubytes long. And he began to be mighty in the world / and he is called
a boystous hunter before god This man began that wretched vice of coueytousnesse
by his tyranny / with the which vice ever more after this world is fulfilled.
And the pryncypalest kingdom that he had was Babylon. And he had Archade.
Edissa. Selencia / and the land of Sennaar. Sale sone to Arphaxat lived.cccc.
and.xxxiij. years. And of him in scripture is no thing written / but that
Moses nombred him in the line that comes of Christ. This Sale gate a sone y^
was named Heber / The which after the Hebrews / had the spyryte of
prophecye. And of this Heber the Hebrews ben named. For the Hebrews tongue
bode allone in his house in the confusyon of the langage. And that langage was
called man's langage / the which every man used before y^ toure of Babylon was
builded. This ^eber had two sons / and one was called Iectan through ensample
of Nemro^h descendynge from Cham took the Pryncehode upon the children of Sem.
And he had.xiij. sons. But these people after Ierom are not known of us /
for fernesse of the country / or mutacyon and chaungynge of the people / or
else of some other manner cause.

PHaleg lived two hondreds and.xxxix. years. This Phaleg was the younger sone of
Heber / and in his days was made the confusyon of langages / For in his house
abode the old tongue allone / and that was Hebrewe. Wherefore after saint Austyn
/ in him apered a great stedfasnesse of ryghtwysnes. For this house was free of
that pain / as not consenting to the building of the toure. (Et s^dm Aug)
there was.lxxij. generacyons / and so there were.lxxij. langage Iactan brother
to Phaleg of Sem Nem roch prince of Cham Sulphen of Iaphet / these three princes
with there people gadred them together in y^ field of Sennaar / dredynge the
flood to come again said. Let us build a toure / of the which the heyght
shall reche to heaven etc. Gen^.xij. Our lord saw the folysshnes of the
people. Meruayllously for y^ pain of there sin / he confounded the tongue of
them. In so much y^ none understood what an other said. And so they were
disperpled and asond^ed by all y^ worl de Of the malice of this Nemroth books
ben written full. And after the confusyon of the langage / he went to the land
of Persees / and there he enstruct^ and taught them to adoure and worship the
fire as god. And he left his sone Belus in Babylon the which Belus succeeded
hy^. And so from thens his progenye opteyned that kingdom unto the t^^e of many
a year after. In this time began many kingdoms. And the most of all those
kingdoms was the kingdom of Scitarum. But there were so many rude and
boystous people in it that (...) te was never had in worship. And it was a
strong and a mighty (...) of dystaunce. And about this time began the
kingdom of Egypt the which with diverse and many alteracyons often times was
changed. And also it is spoken of many times in (...) Noblynesse or gentylmen
abowee this said time began. And this noblynesse or gentylmen was orderned for
many causes. ^ The first cause was necessyte. For when mankind grew (...) and
men were prompte and ready to do (...). it was very necessary to withstand the
great malice of the ^usyd people against good men. Thereof a man is called a
gentylman / or a noble man as before other in virtues notable. Whereof Ierom
says. I see no thing else in noblesse / or in gentylmen but that they are
bounden in a certain necessyte that they shall not recede fro the virtue and
the gentylnesse of there noble aun^^tours The second was y^ diverse worshyp^ge
of the people. For no man worshype then / but as his natural reason gaf. And
they knew not ryghtwysly what they should worship / all though they lived
peasyble among themself. For they were so dull of wit / y^ they co^de pondre
no great thing / but that was publysshed by y^ common people. Wherefore it was
expedyent for there peace to be kept / that they should have princes of noble
birth The third cause proceeds of some synguler strength. Many times the
comynalte were grieved through enmyes coming upon them. And then they said y^
who some ever would deffende and keep them from these peryles / he should have
y^ right of nobleness for him and his heirs for ever more. And in this manner
of wise many are ^adde to be noble men. The fourth cause of noblynesse / was
great habundau^ce of goods. Sometime the people were holden with great penury
of mete and drink. And then they took them and theyrs to some rich man / y^
through that covenant / they should tempre the great straytnesse of there hungre
/ and after that they should know him as there lord and a noble man. Also
there be found certain noble men by the prouysyon of god though they were but
few of the which some abode in virtue / as Dauyd / and some failed anon / as
Saul and Jeroboam. Also it is radde / that many were noble men by tyranny and
vyolence. Of the which some were destroyed anon. And some abode in
stablenesse / as Paynemes might.

SAruk lyneally descended from our forn fader Adam to Abraham And Nachor was
his sone / and he lived an hundred and.xlviij. year. And about this time
ydolatry began to to encreace myghtely. And if ye reuolue and look the
hystoryes / ye shall find / that three things pryncypally brought men to the
sin of ydolatry. That is to understand. The affection which they had to
deed men. Dredde and flaterynge against there princes. And the dilygence of
artyfycers and crafty men about scultures or grauynges. Wicked fendes then^e
entered in to the ydollis / and gave answe res to the people. And these wicked
spyrytes confermed the error of the people myghtely. In so much / that what
some ever manner of person / would not conform him to the reason / he should
grievously suffer the pain of death. Also there was added and put to these
things the dysceyuynge laud and praysynge of Poets / the which wretches and
also dampened men in to heaven with all t^eyr gaye aourned wrytynges exalted /
And that same time / when deuylles began for to speak / so fayrly / and so
mekely to man. The good lord of his great and habundaunt mercy / sent his
aungelles / that they spolde sheke to his elected men in vysybly / lest that
all man kind should perysshe with this myscheuous error.

BElus sone to Nemroth this time was king of Babylon. And he was the first
king of this world / And this man was he / whom the error of the people
first trowed / should be a god / wherefore diverse people named him dyuersly. And
some called him Bell / some Baall / some Baalim / some Beelphagor / and some
Belsabub. And this unhappy error stood in mankind more than two thousand
years. Ninus sone to Belus the second king of Babylon or of Assuriorum /
reigned.liiij. years. And this Ninus desired for to have lordshyp and worship.
And to that entente that he might be lord of all the country about him / he
gave bataylle to all that dwelled nyghe about him. And by cause that time the
people were rude and had not the conning of fighting nor armor / anon he
subdued unto hy^ all Asiam. And there was made y^ first Monarche in y^ rest
party. And wha^ his heart was sorry for the death of his fader Belus / he made to
be made to him for his comfort an image of his fad. to whom he gaf so mighty
reverence / that what someuer gylty man had fled to y^ image / there should
no man do unto him no hurt / and he pardonned hy^ of all his trespass. And
through his ensample many a man began to worship y^ deed image / of their dear
friends. Then these malicyous spirytes / seeing y^ curyosyte of the people /
hid them within them / and gaaf answers unto y^ people / and said they were
gods. And commanded them to do reverence unto them as gods. Thus y^
unhappy sin of ydolatry was brought in / the which repugned myghtely to
gods mageste. And in so much this madness grew. that he shol de suffer the
pain of death / that said / they were men / but gods.

neuewes. And it is said / by cause he would not worship the fire / as Nemroth
had taught / he was banysshed the country. And the common opinion of the
Hebrews is. Nemroth reigned there the which was called an other name /
Amraphel the king of Sennaar / whom long time after this Abraham overcame (vt

AFter the death of Iayr Judge of Israel / the people of Israel added new
sins to their old. And our lord took them in to the power of the Philistyens
and to the childern of Amon.xviij. year. And they were gretely oppressyd / and
then they cried to our lord. Then Repte was espied with almighty god / and
faught against Amon and sedycyous people of the hylle of Effraym. And for an
vnprudent voys / he slew his own daughter folyshly / and did sacrefyce to
god with her (Iudicu^.xi. et.xij.) Ozy this time was bishop in Israel / and
he was of the seed of Aron / by the line of Eleazari / the which deed / through
the prouysyon of god the bysshopryche tomed to the line of Ythamar an. C.
and.xx. year / in the which line Hely was the first high bishop. And Abiathar
was the last / Ebassam was Judge in Israel.vij. year and he was the.xij. Judge
and he was named otherwise Boos the which wedded Ruth. Abralon the.xix. Judge
of Israel was Judge.x. year. And under these times the childern of Israel were
quyete. And therefore none notable things were done in these days. Abdon
the.xiiij. Judge governed in Israel.viij. years. And about this time the
hystorye of Ruth was written. Authamanis this time was king of Asserium / and
Priamus king of Troy sone to Lamidon that builded his cite again
merueyllously strong. And began battle with the Greeks unto his own hurt.
And he had a sone was called Hertor a ley^full gentle sone by his ^y^
Eccuba. This man was faithful and wy se / and Iuromparable of strength and
noblynesse This Priamus had an other sone that was called Paris / the which
took away fro the land of Greeks He lena wife to Menelaius the king. Agamenon
the king brother to Menela^us the leder of all the Greeks host faught against
Troy / and at the last he wanne the cite falsely / and to the Greeks most shame
and sclaunder that might be / For certainly that might be called an unhappy
battle where no man gives loving to the Greeks / but every man reports
shame.

Eneas was king in Ytaly three year. And this Eneas after Troy was destroyed of
the Greeks / came in to Ytaly with.xx. ships / and did mighty batayles
there. And this man had wedded Priamus daughter Elinsaram. And he was made a
god thorugh the error of the common people / and of this man came Julius cezar
and Octauianus augustus Vlixes an eloquent man among all the Greeks / after
many perils on the set wen te home to his Penelopem / the most faithful and
the most chaste woman that is radde of. And the Greeks perysshed wretchedly
after that they had destroyed Troy / both on the water and on the land as they
went homewarde again. And that was the pryncypal date of there wry tynge after
that victory. For they wrote there historyes and other writing (sic an^ pri^
vel sc^o i^. post Troiam captam) And that was the third year of Abdon Judge of
Israel.

Incipit regnum Britanie. nunc di^^tur Anglia.
Here may ye see how England first began at Albion.

Albion.



Before that I will speak of Brute / it shall be showed / how the land of
England was first named Albion / and by what encheson it was so named.
OF the noble land of Si^^ie / there was a ryall king and mighty and a man of
great reno^mee / that called was Dyoclesyan / that well and worthily him
governed and ruled through his noble chyualry. So that he conquered all the
lands about him / so that almoost all the kings of the world to him were
attendaunt. It befell thus / y^ this Dyoclesyan spowsed a gentle damoysell y^
was wonder fair / that was his emys daughter Labana. And she loved hy^ as
reason would / so that he gate upon her ^xxxiij. daughters / of the which y^
eldest was called Albine. And these damoysels when they came unto aege became
so fair y^ it was wonder / whereof Dyoclesyan anon let make a sompnynge /
and commanded by his letters y^ all the kings that held of him should come
at a certain day / as in his letters were contained to make a feast ryall. At
which day thither they came / and brought with them Admyralles princes and
dukes / and noble chyualry. The feast was ryally arrayed / and there they lived
in Joy and myrthe enough / that it was wonder to wit. And it befell thus /
that Dyoclesyan thought to marye his daughters among all tho kings that were
at that solempnyte. And so they spoke and did / that Albine his eldest
daughter and all her systers rychely were married unto.xxxiij. kings / that
were lords of great honor and of power at this solempnyte. And when the
solempnyte was done / every king took his wife and ladde them in there own
country and there ma de them queen's. And it befell thus afterward that this
dame Albene became so stout and so stern / that she told little price of her
lord / and of him had scorn and despyte / and would not do his will / but she
would have her own will in diverse matters. And all her other systers euerychone
bare them so evil against there lords that it was wonder to wit. And for as
much y^ them thought that there husbondes were not of so high parentage come
as there fader. But those kings that were there lords / would have chastysed
them with fair manner upon all love and frendshyp / y^ they should amend there
selfwylled co^dycyons: But al was for naught / for they did there own will in
all thing that them lyked. and had of power. Wherefore those.xxxiii. ky^ges
upon a time / and often time. beat there wives. For they wend. that they would
amend their tatches. and there wickedness. But of such condycyons they were /
that for fair speech and warning / the did all the wors / and for betynges
eftsoon much the wors. Wherefore the king that had wedded Albyne. wrote y^
tatches and condycyons of hsi wife Albine / and the lettre sent to Dyoclesyan
his fader. And when the other ky^ges her de. that Albines lord had sent a
letter to Dioclesian. anon they sent letters sealed with there seals. the
condycyons and tatches of there wives. When the king Dioclesian saw and herd
so many playntes of his daughters. he was sore ashamyd / and became wonder
angrye and wroth toward his daughters. and thou ghte. how he then might
amend it that they so mysdyde. And anon sent his letters unto the.xxxiii.
kings. that they should come to him / and bring with them their wives every
chone at a certain day. For he would there chastyse them of their
wickedness / if he might in any manner wise. So the kings came all at
that time and day y^ tho was set between him and the kings. Dyoclesyan
resceyued them with much honor / and made a solemn feast to all that were
underneath his lordshyp. And the third day after that solempnyte / the king
Dyoclesyan sent after his.xxxiij. daughters that they should come and speak
with him in his chamber. And when they were come / he spoke to them of there
wickedness and of there cruelte / and spyteuously them repreued and blamed /
and to them he said. That if they would not be chastysed / they should his love
lose for ever more. And when y^ ladies herd all this / they became abashed
and gretely ashamed. And to there fader they said / that they would make all
am^ndes / and so they departed out of there faders chamber. And dame Albine that
was the eldest sister ladde them all to her chamber / and tho made to void
all that were therein so that no person was among them but she and her systers
to gyder. Tho said Albine. My fair systers / well we know that the king our
fader us has reproved shamed and dispysed / for by cause to make us obedyent
unto our husbondes. But certes that shall I never whiles that I live / sith y^
I am come of a more higher kings blood than mine husbonde. And when she had
thus said / all her systers said the same. And tho said Albine. Well I wot
fair systers that our husbondes have complained unto our fader upon us
wherefore he has us thus foul reproved and dispysed / wherefore systers my
counsel is / that this night when our husbondes ben a bed / all we with one
assente for to kytte there throtes / and then we may be in peace of them. And
better we mow do this thing under our faders power than over where else. And
anon all the ladies consented and granted to this counsel. And when night
was comen / the lords and ladies went to bed / And anon as there lords
were a sleep / they kytte all their husbondes throtes / and so they slew them
all. When that Dyoclesyan their fader herd of this thing / he became
furyously wroth against his daughters / and anon would them all have burnt.
But all y^ barons and lords of Sirrie counseyled not so for to do such
streytnesse to his own daughters / but oonly should void the land of them
for ever more / so that they never should come again / and so he did. And
Dyoclesyan that was there fader anon commanded them to go in to ship and
delyuerd to them vytaylles for half are re. And when this was done all the
systers went in to the ship and saylled forth in the sea / and betoke all
there friends to Apolin that was there god. And so long they saylled in the sea
till at (...) last they came and arrived in an (...) that was all wilderness.
And when (...) Albion was come to that land and (...) systers. This Albine
went fr^ste forth out of the ship and said to her (...) systers. For as
much said she as I am the eldest sister of all this company (...) first this
land has taken and (...) much as mine name is Alb^^ (...) that this land be
called Alb^^ (...) mine own name. And anoue all (...) sters granted to her
with a good (...) Tho went out all the systers of (...) pe and took the land
Albron as (...) ster called it. And there they went (...) down / and found
neither men (...) man ne child / but wild beest^^ of (...) uerse kinds. And
when the (...) were dyspended and they failed they (...) de them with herbs
and (...) in the season of the year and so they lived as they best might. And
after (...) they took flesh of diverse beestes and became wonder fat. And
so they desired man's company and man's kind y^ them failed. And for bear
they wered wonder courageous of kind / so that they desired more man's
company than any other solace and myrthe. When the devil that perceived /
wen^e by diverse countrees and took a body of the ay^^ and liking natures shad
of men / and came in to the land of Albion / and lay by tho^ wy^men and
shadde tho natures upon them and they conceived / and after brought forth
gyau^tes. Of the which one was called Gogmagog / and an other Longherigam And
so they were named by diverse names / and in this manner they came forth and were
borne horrible gyau^tes in Albion And they dwelled in caves and in hills at
there will. And had the land of Albion as them lyked / unto the time that Brute
arrived and came to Totnes / that was in the isle of Albion. And there this
Brute conquered and scomfyted the gyauntes above said.

Explicit prima pars.
Here begins now how Brute was gotten / and how he slew first his mother and
after his fader. And how he conquered Albion that after he named Brytayne after
his own name that now is callid England after the name of Engyst of Sa^onte.
This Brute came in to Brytayne about the.xviij. year of Hely.

BE it known that in the noble cite of great Troy / there was a noble knight
and a man of great power that was called Eneas. And when the cite of Troy was
lost and destroyed thorugh them of Greece. This Eneas with all his meyne fled
thens and came to Lombardy. That tho was lord and governor of y^ land a
king that was called Latyne. And an other king there was that was called
Turocelyne / that strongely warred upon this king Latyne / that oftentimes did
him much harm. And when this king Latyne herd y^ Eneas was come / he
received him with much honor / and him with held for as much as he had
herd of him / and wist well that he was a noble knight and a worthy of his
body and of his deeds. This Eneas helped king Latyne in his war / And
shortly for to tell / so well and so worthily he did that he slew
Turocelyne / and dyscomfyted him and all his people. And when all this was done
/ king Latyne gaaf all that land that was Turocelynes / to this noble man
Eneas in marriage with Lauyne his daughter / the most fairest creature that any
man wist. And so they lived together in Joy and myrthe all the days of there
life time. And after Ascanius sone to Eneas wedded a wife / and upon her he gate
a sone that was called Silueyne. And this Silueyne when he could some reason of
man / vnwetynge his fader and against his will aqueynted him with a damoysell
that was cosyn to Lauyne / that was king Latynes daughter the queen that was
Eneas wife / and brought the damoysell with child. And when Ascanius his fader
it wist / anon let inquire of the wysest masters and of the grettest clerks
/ what child the damoysell should bring forth / and they answered and said /
that she should bring forth a sone that should kylle both his fader and also
his mother. And so he die de. For his mother deyed in berynge of him. And when
this child was borne / his fader let call him Brute. And the masters said
that he should do much harm and sorrow in many diverse places / and after he
should come to great honor and worship. This king Ascanius deyed when god
would / and Silueyne his sone received the land / and made him wonderly well
beloved among his people. And so when Brute that was Silueynes sone was.xv.
year old / he went upon a day with his fader for to play and solace. And as
Brute should have shot unto an heart / his arowe myshapped and glaced / and so
there Brute slew his fader.

How Brute was driven out of the land / and how he held him in Greece.
ANd when this myschaslce was befall / all the people of the land made sorrow
enough and were sore an angered And for encheson thereof they drove Brute out of
the land / and would not suffer him among them. And when he saw that he
might not there abide / he went from thens in to Greece / and there he
found.vij. thousand men that were of the lygnage and kynrede of Troy that
were come of great blood as the story tells / as of men and wymmen and
childern / the which were all hold in thral dome and bondage of the king
Pandras of Greece / for the death of Achilles that was betrayed and slain at
Troy. This Brute was a wonder fair man and a strong and a huge of his aege
and of glad chere and semblaunt / and also worthy of body / and was well
beloved among his people. This king Pandras herd speak of his goodness and
his condicyons / and anon made him dwell with him / so that Brute became
wonder preuy and mo che beloved with the king / so that long time Brute
dwelled with the king So at the last they of Troy and Brute spoke togyders of
kynrede and of lygnage and of acquayntaunce / and there playned them unto Brute
of there sorrow and of there bondage / and of many other shames that the king
Pandras had them done. And unto Brute they said upon a time. Ye be a lord of
our lygnage and a strong man and a mighty / ye be our capytayne and lord /
and governor / and we will become your men / and your commandments do in
all manner of things / and bring us out of this wretchedness and bondage /
and we will fight with the king for truth with the grace of the great god /
we shall him overcome / and we shall make you king of the land / and to you
do homage / and of you we shall hold ever more. Brute had tho great py te of
their bondage y^ they were brought in. And pryuely went them from the kings
court / and tho them that were of Troy / went and put them in to woods and in
to mountains and them there held And sent unto king Pandras / that he
should give them leave sauely for to wend out of the land / for they would no
longer dwell in his bondage. The king Pandras wexed tho sore anoyed / and tho
swore that he should slay them euerychone / and ordained a great power and
went toward them all for to fight. But Brute and his men manly them defended
and fyersly fought and slew all the kings men that none of them escaped and
took the king and held him in person / and ordained counsel between them
(...) they might done. And some said (...) he should be put to death / and some
(...) that he should be exiled out of the land And some said / that he should
be (...) te. And tho spoke a wise ^^yght that was called Mempris and said to
(...) te and to all tho of Troy. If king (...) dras would yield him and have
his life. I counseyll that he give unto Brute that is our duke and our sovereign
his daughter Gennogen to a wife / and in (...) with her an hundred ships well
(...) de / and all his tresoure of gold (...) of come and of wine and as mock
as we need to have of 00 thing and other And then go we out of this land
(...) ordeyne us a land else where. For we ne none of our kynrede that come
after us shall never have peace in this land among them of Greece. For we have
slain so many of there ^u^ghtes and of other friends that evermore wa^^ and
contake should be among us. Brute tho and all his folk consented well to that
counseyll. And this thing they told to king Pandras. And he for to have his
life granted as much as they axed / and anon gaf unto Brute Gennogen his
daughter to wife and an bondred ships with asmoche as them neded of all
vytaylles / as before was ordained Brute tho took his wife and all his men / that
forsook the land of Greece and went them unto the sea and had wind and weder
at there will / and came the third day in to an I Will that was called Lorgres.
This Brute anon sent of his men a land for to espy the manner of the
country. And they found an old cite all wasted and forlet / that nas therein
another man ne woman / ne no thing dwelling / and in the myddell of this cite
they found an old temple of a fair lady yt was called Dyana the goddess.
And they came again unto Brute and told him what they had seen and found. And
they counseled him to go and do sacrefyce unto dame Dyana / for she was wont
to give answer of what thing that ever men prayed her / and namely unto them
that her honored with sacrefyce. Brute went unto that image and said. Dyana
noble goddess that all thing haste in thy might and power / wyndes / waters.
wodes / feldes / and all thing of the world / and all manner of beestes that
therein ben. To you I make my prayer / that ye me counseyll and tell / where /
and in what place. I shall have a couenable dwelling for me and for my people
/ and there I shall make in honor of you a well fair temple and a noble /
wherein ye shall always be honored / When he had done his prayer. Dyana
answered in this manner Brute said she go even forth thy way over the sea in to
France toward the west / and there ye shall find an isle that is called
Albion / and that isle is becompassed all with the sea / and no man may come
therein but it be by ships / and in that land were wont to dwell gyau^tes /
but now it is not so / but all wyldernes. And that land is destenyed and
ordained for you and for your people.

How Corin became Brutes man / and how king Goffar was dyscomfyted.
Then when Brute had this answer of Dyana y^ gods. Anon he let the
ancres wind up and sailed in to the high see. And when he and his men had
saylled.xx. days and moo / they found fast beside a cost of the sea a
thousand men of the lygnage and kynrede of Troy. And there sovereign and there
master of all was called Corin. And when Brute wist whens they were / he tho
took them with much Joy in to his ships / and ladde them forth with him.
This Corin there became Brutes man and to him did homage. And so long they
saylled forth in the sea till they came unto Gascoyne. And anon they arrived
in the haven of Lyegers / and there they dwelled.viij. days them for to rest.
and there saylles to amend there y^ it was need. Tidings soon came to king
Goffer that was lord of that land how that much people of strange land
were arrived in to his land in the haven of Lyegers wherefore he was sore
angered and anoyed / that they came and arrived in his land without his
license and his leave. And anon ordened him a great power for to drive out
Brute and to destroy him and all his people. But it was so that king Goffar
was dyscomfyted and all his people. And himself fled into France / there for
help and socour. And in that time reigned in France.xij. kings / and an.xi.
of them assembled a great power for to help Goffar and for to fight against
Brute. This Goffar dwelled with them of France half a year and more. And in
the mean time when Goffar was in France. Brute and his company destroyed all
the land of Gascoyne / and let take all the tresour that king Goffar had /
and there let bring it all in to his ships. And this Brute found in that
land a fayry place and couenable / and there Brute made a fair castle and a
strong. When that this was done / king Goffar came from France and.xi.
kings with him and brought with him.xx.M. men for to fight with Brute and his
company / and Brnte had but.vij.M. and.ccc. men. And nevertheless when the two
hosts met together. Brutes folk thorugh help of him self and of Turin his
cosyn / and of Corin that well and manly him defended / and fought so till that
little time they had slain of the F^^nshmen two thousand and mo. Anon all y^
were a live fled away. And in this battle Turin Brutes cosyn was slain.
And Brute let en tere him worthily when he had space and leyser in the castle
that he had made / and tho let call that same castle Toures / for by cause
of the name of Turin that there was entered. And yet unto this day there is a
noble cite that is called Toures. And king Goffar wist that Turin was deed he
came again with his men / and after yaue a strong katayll unto Brute. But
Brute and his men were so weary for fighting / yt they might no longer endure /
but to megre him and all his. And then Brute yede in to his castle with his
men / and made the gates fast for to save them / and for to cake counsel
among them what were best for to do. Brute and Corin gaf counsel and ordained
pryuely / that Corin should go out and busshe him in a wood till on the morn /
so y^ in the morning when that Brute should fight with his enemies / then
Corin should come with his folk in the one side / and slay and do all the
harm that he might. And in a morning in the dawning of the day Brute went
out of the castle / and fyersely faught with his enmyes / and they manly
deffended them. But within a little time Brute and his folk slew.viij.
hundred of king Goffars men. then came Corin with the busshement and smote
to ground he and his company all those that would stand or abide. so that the
king Goffar and his company were dyscomfyted / and fast they began to flee.
And Brute and Corin with there company fyersely them pursewed / and slew mo of
them in the fleing than they did in the battle. And in this manner Brute had
the victory. And nevertheless Brute made much sorrow for his cosyn Turin that
there was slain / and other also that he had lost of his men. That is to
say.vij. hundred and.xv. The which nobly he entered in the same castle of
Toures / there where he had entered Turin his cosyn.

How Brute arrived at Totnesse in the Isle then called Albion and of the
battle that was betwixt Corin Gogmagog.
SO when all this was done Brute would no longer there dwell / for to fight /
nor for to lose no moo of his people. For king Goffars people might every day
encreace moo and moo. And Brutes lessened. And therefore he took all his men and
went unto the sea and had wind and weder at their will. And the fyfth
day after they arrived in an haven at Totnesse / and came in to the isle of
Albion. And there neither man nor woman as the storytelle^^ they found but
Gyauntes. And they dwelled in hills and in caves. And Brute saw the land was
fair and at his liking. And was good also for him and for all his people / as
Dyana the goddess had him be^yght. And therefore was Brute wonder glad / and
let assembled upon a day all his folk / to make a solemn sacrefyce and a
great feast in honor and reverence of Dyana the goddess / of the which he
had counseyll first for to come in to this land. And then when that they
had there solempnyce done / as they upon a day sat at there meet / there
came in upon them.xxx. gyau^tes and slew of Brutes men.xxx. Brute and his men
anon sterte up and faught with the gyauntes and slew them euerychone /
except one that was called Gogmagog. And he was master of all the Gyauntes.
And he was stronger and higher than any of the other. And Brute kept him for
because that he should wrestyll with Corin that was Brutes man. For he was
greter and higher than any of Brutes men from the gyrdelstede upward. Gogmagog
and Corin undertook there for to wrestyll. And so togyders they went / and
wrestlyd a long time / but at the last Gogmagog Held Corin so fast that he
brake two rybbes of his side / Wherefore Corin was sore angry. And there he took
Gogmagog betwixt his arms and cast him down upon a roche / so that Gogmagog
brake all to pieces /and so he deyed an evil death. And therefore ye place is
called unto this day the saut of Gogmagog. And then after Brute yaue all
that country unto Corin. And there Corin called it after his name Cornewayle.
And his men be called Cornewaylles / and so should men of that country be
called for evermore / And in that country dwelled Corin and his men. And they
made towns and houses / and enhabyted the land by there own will.

How Brute builded London / and called this land Brytayne / and Scotlonde
Albyne. / and Walys Camber.
London.


BRute and his men went forth / and law abowte in diverse places / where that
they might find a good place and couenable / that they might make a cite for
him and for his folk. And so at the last they came by a fair River that is
called Tamys / and there Brute began to build a fair cite / and let call it
new Troy / in mind and remembrance of the great Troy / from the which place
all there lygnage was comen. And this Brute let fell down woods / and let
eere and sow lands / and also let mawe down meadows for sustenaunce of him
and of all his people. And then he departed the land to them / so that
eueryche of them had a part / and a certain place for to dwell in. And
then Brute let call all this land Brytayne after his own name / and his
folk he let call Brytons. And this Brute had gotten on his wife Gennogen three
sons / that were worthy of deeds. The first was called Lotrin / the second
Albanak / and the third Cambar. And Brute bare crown in the cite of Troy.xx.
year after y^ time that the cite was made. And there he made the lawe^ y^ the
Brytons hold / and this Brute was wonderly well beloved among all men. And
Brutes sons also loved wonderly well together. And when Brute had sought all y^
land in length and also in bread he found a land y^ Joined to Brytayne /
that was in the north and that land Brute yaue to Albanak his sone. And let
call it Albanie after his name / that now is called Scotlonde And Brute found
an other country toward the west / and yaue that to Cambar his other sone /
and let call it Cambar after his name / and now is called Walys. And when
Brute had reigned.xx. year as before is said / then he deyed in the cite of
new Troy.

How Lotrin that was Brutes sone entered with much honor / and governed the
land well and worthily.
AFter Brute reigned Lotrin his sone / that was the second king in Brytayne.
The which began to regne the second year of Samuel. And this Lotrin was
crowned king with much solempnyte and glory of all the land of Brytayne. And
after when he was crowned king. Albanak and Cambar his two brethern went again
in to there own country and there they lived with much honor and worship.
And Lotrin there brother reigned / and was king and governed it well and wisely
/ for he was a good man and wonderly well beloved of all his land. And it
befell so that Albanak dwelled in his own land with much honor and worship.
And then came king Humbar of Hunlonde with a great power and aryued in
Albyne / and would have conquered the land / and began to war upon king
Albanak / and him slew in batall. When Albanak was slain / the people of that
land fled unto Lotrin and told him for he was king of Brytayne / how that
his brother was slain / and prayed him of his help and of his socour for to
avenge his brothers death. Lotrin there anon let assemble all the Brytons of
Kente / of Dover in to Derewent of Northfolke and Southfolke / of Keftefen /
and Lyndessey. And when they were assembled they spedde them fast toward there
enemies for to give them battle. And Lotrin had sent to Cambar his brother
that he should come unto him with all the power that he might make him for to
help / and so he did with a good will. And so they came togyders / and took
there ware p^^^ely for to go and seek Humbar where they might him find. And so
it befell that this Humbar was beside a water that was a great river with his
folk (...) for to dysporte. And there came Lotrin and Cambar his brother with
all there people suddenly or that any of that other wist. And when Humbar saw
them come he was sore adiadde / for as much as his men wyste it not before /
and also they were unarmed. And anon Humbar for dread lepte in to the water
and drowned himself and so he deyed and his men were all slain so that no^e of
them escaped. And therefore is that water called Humbar / and ever more shall be
/ for by cause that this king Humbar therein was drowned. And after that Lotrin
went to his ships and took there gold and silver as much as he found unto
himself. And all that other pylfre he gaaf unto other folk of the host. And
they found in one of the ships a fair damoysell that was king Humbars
daughter / and she was called Estrylde. And when Lotrin saw her / he took her
with him for her fayrnessse / And for her he was ou^er taken in lone. and would
have wedded her. This tidings came to Corin / and anon thought to avenge him
upon Lotrin. For as much as Lotrin had made covenant for to spowse Corins
daughter / that was called Guentolin. And Corin in have went unto him unto
new Troy / and thus he said to Lotrin. Now certes said he / ye reward me full
evil / for all the pains that I have suffered and had many times for Brute
your fader. And therefore sith it is so I will avenge me now upon you. And he
drew his fawcon on high and would have slain this Lotrin the king. But the
damoysell went between tho and made them to be accorded in this manner. That
Lotrin should wedde or spowse Guentolin that was Corins daughter / and so
Lotrin did. And netheles when that he had spowsed Guentolin Corins daughter /
pryuely he came to Estrylde / and brought her with child / and gate upon her a
daughter / the which was called Abram. And it befell so that anon after Corin
deyed / and after when he was deed. Lotrin forsook Guentolin that was his wife /
and made Estrylde queen. And there Guentolin that was his wife went from thens
all in great ire and wrath unto Cornewayle / and there seized all the land
in to her own hand / for as much as she was her faders heir she undertook
feautes and homages of all the men of the land. And afterward assembled a
great host and a great power of men / for to be avenged upon Lotrin that was
her lord / and to him came and yaue him a strong batayl and there was Lotrin
her husbonde slain and his men dyscomfyted / in the.v. year of his regne.
Guentolin let take Estrylde and Abram her daughter / and bound them both
hand and foot / and cast them both in to a water / and so they were drowned.
Wherefore that water was ever more after called Abram / after the name of the
damoysell that was Estryldes daughter. And English men call that water
Seuerne / and Walshmen call it Abram unto this day to. And when this was done
Guentolin let crown her queen of all the land / and governed the land full
well and wisely unto the time y^ Madan her sone that Lotrin had gotten upon her
was of.xx. year of age / y^ he might be king / and so the queen reigned.xv.
year. And then let she crown her sone king / and he reigned and governed
the land well and worthily. And she went in to Cornewayle / and there she
dwelled all her lives time.

How Madan reigned in peace all his life.
MAdam sone to Lotrin reigned on the Brytayns.xl. year / the which began to
regne the.xv. year of Saul And this Madan lived in peace all his days / and
got two sons. Mempris and Maulin. Then he deyed and lies at new Troy.

was fairest and best of condicyons. The king there fader became an old man /
and would y^ his daughters were married or y^ he dyed. But first he thought to
assaye which of them loved him most and best. For she y^ loved him best should
best be married And he axed of the first daughter how well she loved him. And
she answered and said / better than her own life. Now certes said her fader /
that is a great love / Then he axed the second daughter / how much she
loved him And she said more and passing all the creatures of the world. Per

shall tell you. As much as ye be which / so shall ye he loved. The king her

THus it befell afterward / that the two eldest (...) would not abide till
Leyr her fader was deed. but warred upon him whiles that he was on live / and
did him much sorrow and shame / wherefore they took from him holy the reame /
and between them had ordained / y^ one of them should have king Leyr to
soiourne all his life time with.lx. knights and squyres / that he might
worshypfully ride and go whether that he would / and in to what country that
him lyked to play and to solace. So that Maugles king of Scotlonde had
king Leyr with him in the manner as is above said. And or the other half year
were passed. Gonorill yt was his eldest daughter and queen of Scotlonde / was
so anoyed of him and of his people / that anon she and her lord spoke together
/ wherefore his knights half and his squyres fro hy^ were gone / and no moo
lefth with him but oonly.xxx. And when this was dove / Leyr began to make much
sorrow for by cause that his state was empeyred. And men had of him more scorn
and despyte than ever they had before. Wherefore he wist not what to done. And
at the last thought that he would go in to Cornewayll to Rigan his other
daughter. And when he was come / the earl and his wife that was Leyrs daughter
him welcomed / and with him made much Joy / And there he dwelled with.xxx.
knights and squyres. And he had not dwelled scarsly.xij. months there / y^
his daughter of hy^ was weary and his company. And her lord and she of him had
great scorn and despyte / so that from.xxx. knights they brought unto.x. And
afterward had he but five / and so they left him no moo. Then made he
sorrow enough. and said sore weeping. Alas that ever I came in to this land
and said. Yet had it be better to have dwelled with my first daughter. And
anon he went thens to his first daughter again / but anon as she saw him
come / she swore by god and by his holy name / and by as much as she might /
that he should have no moo with him but one kynght / if he would there abide.
Then began Leyr to weep, and made much sorrow / and said tho. Alas / now have
I to long lived / that this sorrow and myscheyf is to me now fallen. For now I
am poor / that sometime was rich. But now have I no friend ne kynne that to
me will do any good. But when I was rich all men me honored and worshyped /
and now every man has of me scorn and despyte. And now I well wot that
Cordeyll my youngest daughter said me troth / when she said. As much as I had
so much should I be loved. And all the while y^ I had good / so long was I
loved and honored for my riches. But m^ two daughters glosed me tho^^ now of
me they set little price. And soth told me Cordeill / but I would not believe
it ne understand. and therefore I let her go fro me as a thing that I set
little price of and now wot I never what for to do f^^th my two daughters have
me thus deceived / that I so much loved and now must I needs seek her that is
in an other (...) / that lyghtely I let her go from me without any reward of
yeftes. And she said / that she loved me as much as she ought to love her
fader by all manner of reason. And tho I should have ared ^er no more. And those
that me otherwise behoteth thorugh there falls speche^ now have me desceyued. In
this manner Leyr long time began to make his moon And at the last he shope him
to the se^ and passed over in to France and ared and aspyed where the queen
might be found. And men told him where she was. And when he came to the cite
that she was in pryuely he sent his squy^e unto the queen / for to tell her
that her fader was come to her for great need. And when the squyre came to the
queen / he told her every deal of her systers from the beginning unto the
end. Cordeill the queen anon took gold and silver plente / and tohe it to
the squyre in counsel that he should go and bear it to her fader / and that he
should go in to certain cite / and him array and wasshe / and then come aye^
to her. And bring with him an honest company of knights.xl. at the lest with
there meyne. And then he should send to her lord the king / and feyne that
he we re come for to spehe with his daughter / and him for to see and so he
did. And when the king and the queen herd that they came / with much honor
they him received. And the king of France tho let send thorugh all his
reame / and commanded that all men should be as entendant to king Leyr the
queen's fader in all manner of things as if were unto himself. When king Leyr
had dwelled there a month and more he told to the hynge and to the queen his
daughter / how his two eldest daughters had him served. Agampe anon let
ordeyne a great host of Frenshmen and sent in to Bry cayne with Leyr the
queen's fader for to conquer his land again and his kingdom And Cordeill also
came with her fader in to Brytayne / for to have the reame after her faders
death. And anon they went to ship and passed the sea and came in to
Brytayne and fought with the felons / and them scomfyted and slew / And tho
had he his land again / and after lived three year and held his reame in peace
and afterward deyed. And so Cordeill his daughter then let enter him with
much honor at Leycestre.

Brytayne / now called England / for the time of them is not certainly known /
what time of the world the kings folowen reigned. Therefore they shall be
together / till it be comen unto Guentolen king of Brytayne / now called
England.

How Reynolde that was Conedag^ sone reigned after his fader / and in his time
it rayned blood three days in tokenynge of great death.
ANd after this Conedag reigned Reynolde his sone / yt was a wise knight and an
hardy and ^urteys / yt well and nobly governed the land / and wonder well made
him beloved of all manner of folk. And in his time rayned blood y^ lasted three
days. As god would and soon after there came a great death of people / For
hosts without nombre of people fought / till that almighty god thereof took
mercy and pity and tho began it cesse. And this Reynolde reigned.xxij. year and
deyed and lies at York.

How Gorbodian reigned in yeas that was Reynoldes sone.
AFter this Reynold that was Conedags sone / reigned Gorbodian y^ was this
Reynoldes sone.xv. year / and then he deyed and lies at York.

How Gorbodian had.ij. sons and how that one slew ye other for to have y^
be^ytage / and how Ydoyne there mother slew^ y^ other / whefore the land was
destroyed.
SO when this Gorbodian was deed / his two sons that he had / became stout
and proud / and ever warred together for the land. And that one was called
Ferres / and that other Porres. And this Ferres would have all the land / but
that other would not suffer him. This Ferres had a felonous heart and thought
through treason to slay his brother. But pryuely he went in to France / and
there abode with the king Sywarde till upon a time when be came again / and
fought with his brother Ferres / But full evil it happed tho / for he was
slain first. When Ydoyne there mother wist that Pours was deed / she made great
sorrow / for by cause that she loved him more than y^ other. And thought him
for to slay pryuely. And pryuely she came to her sone upon a night with two
knyues and therewith kytte his throat / and the body in to small pieces. Who
herd ever such a cursyd mother / that slew with her own hondes her own sone.
And long time after lasted the repreef and shame to the mother / that for by
cause of yt one sone she murdered the other / and so lost them both.

How four kings curtously held all Brytayne / and what were there names ye
shall here after.
AS the two brethern were deed / they left not behind them another sone ne
daughter / ne none other of the kynrede that might have the heritage. And for
as much as y^ strongest men drove and scomfyted the feblest and took all there
lands / so yt in every country they had great war and stryf under them /
but among all other things / there were among them in the country / yt
overcame all yt other / and through there might and strength they took all the
lands / and every of them took a certain country / and in his country let
call hy^ king / and one of them was called Scater / and he was king of
Scotlonde / and yt other was called Dawa her / and he was king of Loegers /
and of all the land yt was Lotrins / that was Buttes sone / the third was
called Rudac / and he was king of Walys / and the fourth was called Cloten /
and was called king of Cornewayle. But this Cloten should have had all the
land by reason / for by cause that there was no man that wist none so right an
heir as he was. But they that were strongest let little by them that were of
less estate / and therefore this Cloten had no more land among them but
Cornewaylle.

Of king Donebant that was Clotens sone wanne the land.
THis Cloten had a sone that was called Donebant / that after the death of his
fader became an hardy man and a fair and a curteys / so that he passed all the
other kings of fayrenesse and of worthynesse / and anon as he was knight he
wist well yt when his fader lived / he was most ryghtful heir of all the
land / and should have had by reason. But the other kings that were of a
much more strenghte than he was / took from him his land. And afterward this
Donebant ordened him a great power / and conquered first all y^ land of
Loegers and after he would have conquered all the land of Scotlonde and Walys.
And Scater came with his men and yaue him battle. And Rudac came again with his
Walysshmen for to help him. But so^ it befell that Rudac was slain / and also
Scater in plain battle. And so Donebant had the vyctory / and conquered all
the land / and well mayntened it in peace and in quyete / that never before it
was so well mayntened.

How Donebant was the first king that ever bare crown of gold in Brytayne.
THis Donebant let make him a crown of gold / and wered y^ crown upon his
heed as never king did before / and he ordened a statute / y^ and a man had
done never so much harm and myzt come in to the Temple / there should no man
him mysdo / but go there in sauete and in peace / and after go in to what land
or country that him pleased without any harm / and if any man set any hand
upon him / he then should lose his life. And this Donebant made the town of
Malmesbury / and the town also of the Vyse. And when he had reigned well and
worthily.xi. year / then he deyed and lies at new Troy.

How Brenne and Belin departed by twene them the land after the death of
Donebant there fader. And of the war betwixt them.
ANd after yt this Donebant was deed / his sons y^ he had departed the land
between them / as there fader had ordained / so that Belin his eldest sone had
all y^ land of Brytayne from Humber Southwarde. And his brother Brenne had all
the land from Humber unto Scotlonde. But for as much yt Belin had the better
part. Brenne therefore wexed wroth / and would have had more of the land / and
Belin his brother would grant him no more / wherefore co^take and war arose
among them two But Brenne the younger brother had no might ne strength against
Belin / and therefore Brenne through counsel of his folk went from thens in to
Norweye to the king Olsynges / and prayed him of help and socour for to
conquer all the land upon Belin his brother / upon yt covenant that he would
have his daughter to wife and the king Olsynges him granted / And Belin anon
as his brother was gone to Norweye he seized in to his hand all the land of
Northumberlonde / and took all the castelles and let them he arrayed and kept
the costs of the sea / that Brenne should not arryue in no side / but that he
were taken. The king Olsynges let assemble a great host / and delivered his
daughter to Brenne and all the people that he had assembled. And this damoysell
Samie had long time loved a king that was called Gutlagh / and to him she
told all her counsel / how yt Brenne should her have / and her led with him
for ever more / and so he should lose her but that she might forsake Brene. And
when Gutlagh had herd this tidings / he lay for to aspye Brenne with as many
ships as he might have. So the two fletes met together / and long time
they faught / so that Brennes men turned again and were dyscomfyted. And king
Gutlagh took Samie and put her in to his ship. And Brenne shamefully fled
thens as a man dyscomfyted. And this king Gutlagh would have gone in to his
own country / but there came upon him such a great tempest that five days
lasted / so that thorugh that tempest he was driven in to Brytayne with three
ships and no moo and tho that kept the costs of the sea took Gutlagh and
Samie and all his folk and them presented to Belin. And Belin put them in
prison.

How Belin drove out of his land king Gutlach of Denmark and Samie.
IT was not long after yt Brenne came again with a great navy / and sent to
his brother Belin / that be should yield again his land to his wise and his
folk / and his castelles also. O^elles he would destroy his land. Belin
dradde no thing his malice and would no thing do after that he had said.
Wherefore Brenne came with his folk and fought with Belin. And then Brenne was
dyscomfyted and his folk slain / and himself fled with.xij. men in to
France. And this Belin that was Brennes brother went then to York / and
took counseyll what he should do with king Gutlagh. For king Gutlagh proffered
to become his man / and for to hold his land of him / yeldynge yearly. M.li.
of silver for evermore / and for surenesse of this covenant to be kep^e.
Gutlagh should bring hy^ good hostage / and to hy^ should do homage and his
folk / and yet he should swear upon a book yt it should never be broke ne
failed. Belin tho by counsel of his folk granted him his arynge / and so
Gutlagh became his man. And Belin undertook of him his homage by an oath and by
writing ye same couenau^tes. And upon these couenau^tes king Gutlagh took
Samie and his folk and went thens / and turned again to Denmark. Ever more
after were the couenauntes holden and the treuage paid / till the time that
Honelus was king of Denmark and also of this land thorugh his wife Gildeburh
that he had spoused for she was right heir of this land. This Belin dwelled
tho in peace / and worshypfully him held among his barons and he made four
ryall ways / one from the eest in to the weest / and that was called Watlynge
street / and an other from the north unto the south / and that is called Ikelme
street. And two other ways he made in bossynge through out the land that one
is called Fosse / and yt other Fosse dyke. And he mayntened well the good laws
yt Donebant his fader had made. and ordened in his time / as before is said

How acordement was made between Brenne and Belin thorugh Cornewenther mother.
BRenne that was Belins brother had long time dwelled in France / and there
had conquered a great lordshyp through marriage. For he was duke of Bourgoyne
thorugh the daughter of the duke Fewyn yt he had spoused yt was right heir of
ye land. And this Brenne ordened a great power of his folk / and also of
France / and came in to this land for to fygh with Belin his brother. And
Belin came against him with a great power of Brytons / and would tho have ye^en
him battle. But there mother Cor^ewen that tho lived had herd y^ that one
brother would have destroyed that other / and went between her sons and the^
made acorde with much pain So that at the last tho two brethern with much
bliss went together in to new Troy / that now is called London / and there
they dwelled a year. And after they took there counsel for to go and conquer
all France. and so they did / and burnt towns and destroyed the land both
in length and in bread. And the king of France yaue them batayl with his
power / but he was overcome / and yaue truage unto Belin and to his brother.
And after yt they went forth unto Rome and conquered Rome and all Lombardy and
Germany / and took homage and feaute of earls barons and of all other. And
after they came into this land of Brytayne / and dwelled there with Brytons in
Joy and rest. And tho made Brenne the town of Brystowe / and after he went
over to his own lordshyp / and there dwelled he all his life. And Belin dwelled
at new Troy / and there he made a fair gate that is called Belynges gate
after his own name. And when this Belin had reigned nobly.xi. year he dyed and
lies at new Troy.

How king Cormbratus slew the king of Denmark / for by cause yt he would not
pay his truage as he should.
ANd after this Belin reigned his sone Cormbratus a good man and a worthy. And
the king of Denmark would not pay to him his truage that is to say / a
thousand pound as he had sworn by oath for to pay it / and also by writing
record to Belin his fader. Wherefore he was evil apayed and wroth / and
assembled a great host of Brytons and went in to Denmark and slew the king
Gutlagh / and brought the land in subgeccyon all new. And took of the folk
feautes and homage / and after went again in to his own land. And as he came
forth by Dehency / he found.xxx. ships full of men and ^^^^men beside y^
cos^e of the sea. And the king axed what they were. And an Earl that was
master of them all curteysly answered unto the king and said. That they were
exiled out of Spain / and so that they had traueyled half a ye re and more in
the sea / to wit if they might find any king in any land yt of them would
have pity or mercy to gyne them any land in any country wherein they might
dwell and have rest / and become his lyege men / and to him would do homage
and feaute while that he lived / and to his heirs after him / and of him and
of his heirs hold that land. And when the king this herd / he had pity of
him / and yaue them an isle all wilderness / there that no man was dwelling
sauf oonly wild beestes. And the Earl thanked much the king and became his
man and did him homage and feaute / and took all his folk and went in to the
same isle. And the Earl was called Irlamall / and therefore he let call the
land Irlonde after his own name. This king Cormbratus came again in to his
land and reigned.xxv. ye re / and after he deyed and lies at new Troy.

AFter Euseby Rome was made in y^ hylle of Palatin the fourth year of Acham
king of Jews of two brethern Romulus and Remus.xi. kal Maij. the.vij.
Olympiades beginning. Josephus and Bid sayen the.vi. Olympiades / and so they
dyfferre a year. Nevertheless it is read other men to have reigned about that
place myghtly in Ytaly. That is to wit Ianus. Picus Famus. Latinus / the
which unto Eneas reigned about two hundred year. And then afterward from
this Eneas to Romulus / it was reigned under.xv. governors. iiij. C. xxxij.
year. After that fro the cite was made unto the last year of Tarquyne the
proud / it was reigned under.vij. kings about two hundred and.xliij. year.
Then afterward under Senators and Counselors / unto Julius Cezar Emperor
/ by four hundred.lxiiij. year. Romulus the first of Romans / of whom they
ben called in latin Romans / made the cite to be named Rome after his name. The
which gad^ed together the people on every side an hundred of the sage men and
wysest he chose / through the counsel of whom all thing he dysposed / the
which he named Senators for y^ time of there aege And he made there names to be
written in golden letters / wherefore the write noble faders and things so yet.
Also he called. M. men of arms the which he named Milites (a numero
millenario) But these were no noble blood. Therefore as saint Austyn says (de
ciuita. dei) and also there was long war betwixt the Sabyns and them. For
Romulus took many wymmen of the noble blood of Sabyns / and married them to
that unnoble blood. Of this Romulus Orosius writes much evil (vt patet in
libro suo) About this time Merodach the king of Babylon send great gifts to
Ezechie the king of Jews (vt pz.iiij. regum. xx.) And then the kingdom of
Babylon begone.

EZechias the.xiiij. king of Jews a good child of a cursyd fader reigned with
a parfyte heart to our lord. And he restored the house of god / and there was
none like him before nor after among the kings of Jews / therefore our lord
god glorified hy^. For when Sennacheryb the king of Assuriorum came against
Ezechias with a mighty host / our lord stroke his people and slew an. C.

MAnasses king of Jews reigned. lv. year / and he was an evil child of a
good fader / for be did more cursedly than any y^ was before him. For he slew
the prophets of god / that the streets in Jerusalem were all blody. And he
made Ysai the prophet to be sawen the pieces with a saw of tree. Wherefore the
king of Assuriorum wasted the Jury / and took Manasses and put him in prison.
And after Manasses repented his trespaas and cried for mercy to our lord / and
was herd. Then he was restored to his kingdom / and he amended his life (vt

this time reigned in Rome.xlij. year / the which was a great worshyper of falls
goods. He fulfilled Rome soofull / y^ he might have no place for him self to
dwell in. This man put January and February to the beginning of the year
(Vide plura in august. de ciui. dei.) Above all reason it is meruaylle yt such
men so excedyng in wit in all things that was ylle receded fro the knowledge
of very god. Amon king of Jews reigned two year / the which was naught in his
living. and he was stryken of his servants / and he deyed without any
repentance.

deyed. And he was a very holy man. And he prophesied to the destruccyon of
Jerusalem. Tulius Hostilius was the shyrde king in Rome. And saint Austyn
says in his book deciuitate dei. that from Rome was made unto August the
Emperor / there was so contynuell bataylle / that if was take for a meruaylle

which was contynuell peace. And this Tulius by cause he had rest / he did
cursedly to his neighbors and then he was slain and all his household with
a stroke of lyghtnyng. Nabugodonosor this time was king of Babylon / a manly
man and a victorious For he was the scourge of our lord to punysshe the sins
of many people. This man was king of Babylon and after he conquered the
kingdom of A^^suriorum and made it one monarche. But many ways scripture
speaks of this man / now good / and now evil. And for by cause scripture
concludes that be ended his life in the loving of god by the prayer of Danyell
and in the knowledge of one very god / some doctaurs say. he is saved / and
some say it is doubt. Ancus Marcius the fourth king of Rome reigned.xxiij.

SAlathiel of the line of criste was sone to Iecony the king of Jews. the

says. Seruius Tulius the sixte king of Rome was of a bond condycyon on the
moders side. For she was a captyue maid. but she was of the noble blood / This
man had great loving and nobly he bare him in every place / Three hills to the

Balthazar were brethern / the which reigned one after another and were kings
in Babylon. And Balthazar was y^ last king of Babylon / y^ which was slain
of Darius and Cirus (Plura vide daniel.v.

prophesied Ysayas / and he destroyed Babylon / and slew Balthazar king of
Babylon / and he worshyped greatly Danyel / the Jews he send home again / that
they should build the Temple of god (Vt pz Eldre priuus) Babylon that strong
castle was destroyed and his power was take from him as it was prophesied.
This was the first cite and the gretest of all the world / of the which
Incredyble things are written / and this that was so strong in one night was
destroyed / that it might be showed to the power of god / to the which power
all other ben but a sperke and duste. For it is said forsooth that it was
Incredyble to be made with man's hand or to be destroyed with manes strength /
whereof all the world might take an ensample and it would or might be
enfourmed. Tarquinus Superbus was the.vij. king of Rome / and he reigned.xxxv.
year. This man conceived first all the torments which are orderned for
malefactors. As e^le person wells / and galowes / fetres and manacles thaynes
and colors and such other.. And for his great pride and cruelnes god suffered
hy^ to myschyef / and in what manner of wyle it shall be showed. He had a sone
of the lame name / the which defoyled a worthy man's wife / they called him
Colla^^ and his wife was called Lucres. This Tarquinus yt was this.vij. kings
sone aforesaid came unto the ladies house able^^te her husbonde to supper and to
lodging And when all were a sleep he rose with a sword in his bond / and
with strength and fere he rauysshed the woman. And when he was gone the next
day after / she send unto her fader and to her husbonde / for she was of
great kynne / and thus she said to them. The kings sone came hither and as
friend / of whom I had no mystrust / and thus he has defoylled my chastyte and
lost my name for evermore. Then her friends saw her weep and pytously
complain / and they comforted her as well as they could / and said it was no
vylany unto her / for it was against her will. She answered and said / yet shall
there never woman excuse her by Lucres for though she consented not to this deed
/ yet shall she not dye without pain for y^ deed. And with y^ word she had a knyf
ready under her mantell / with the which she smote herself to y^ heart. And for
this cruelnes and this pyteous death the people of Rome arose and exiled the
king for evermore and all his progenye. And thus seasyd these kings of Rome
and never was none after.

Of the governance of Rome till the Emperors began.
AFter this Tyrau^t was deed the Romans ordened y^ there should never be king
more in Rome. But they would be governed fro yt forth by Consules. So when tho
kings had reigned.ij. hundred year and.xl. they made this statute / yt two
Consules should be chosen / and they should govern the cite and y^ people. and
for this cause these two were chosen / y^ if any of them would make any excess
/ the other should govern hy^. For there was no thing obeyed / but if they
consented both. Also they should not stand in there dygnyte passing one year /
for this cause. That for dominacion of long time / they should not usurp upon
them more than was right. In all this time the Empire of Rome was not dylated
passing.xij. mile. The first Consules y^ were made / they called Luciu^ and
the other Brutu^ / and these two men did great things in there time. But yet
the people bare heavy of their domynacyon / Wherefore they chose an other man /
the which should have more auctoryte than they / and they called him Dictator.
In this same time there was a great dyscen cyon betwixt the people and the
Senate wherefore they chose Trybunas with there Iuges over the people / and
defended them fro wrong as says Ysyd. For the Dictator when he was chose he
lasted.v. year / and the Trybunas were remeued every year. But ye must
understand y^ ye shall not have here after all the Consules named y^ governed

ZOorobabell after the commandment of god founded the Temple and made it
parfyte / but it was long after (vt pz Esdre.vi.) After the people of
Jerusalem came fro Babylon / these two ruled Ihesus the high priest as go
uernour / and Zorobabell as duke. And this manner of guydynge was kept unto
Herodes time / that the high priests should be pryncypall / and the dukes
under them. But the dukes were ever of the trybe of Judah / after the prophecye
of Jacob. And under that good gydynge of priests it is not read / the people
to have receded fro y^ very true faith / as they did before in the time of
Jews and of kings. For then many times they tanne to ydolatrye. Eldras the
priest of the kynrede of Aron this time exceded men in holiness / thorugh whose
great wisdom all the Jews state was helped. Cambyses the sone of Siri reigned
on the kingdom of Persarum / the which commanded myghtely the Temple of
Jerusalem should not be builded again. His fader commanded it should be
builded. This Cambyses made a cursyd Judge to be fleyed or hylte a live / and
made his sone to sytte on his faders shynne / that through that dread he should
dread falshede and Judge ryghtwysly. This Ca^byses had many names in holy
scripture in the book of Esdre. Arthaxerses or Assurus in historia Judith / yt
was done under him he called Nabugodonosor / or Olyfernes the prince of his
chyualry subdued many lands to his lord. And at the last he came unto
Bethuleem / and there was slain of Judith a woman / (vt pz Judith.ij.
et.xiij.) Enereydes reigned in Perses half a year. Darius reigned at the Persees
/ the which by the mocyon of Zorobabell commanded the work of the Temple to
be taken again. And commanded his princes that on no wise they should let it
/ but should help it in all that they could (Vide plura in Esdre.vo de.vo

ABiuth sone to Zorobabell of the line of Christ was about this time. For of
him and of other folowyn ge unto Joseph / no thing is had in scripture / but
that Math. theuangelyst nombreth them in the Genelogy / and therefore the
certain time of them duly can not be know. Ioachim, this time bishop after
Josephus was called Iosedech / under whom Jerusalem was builded again (vt
dicit. et hoc idem patet Neemie.xij.) In the.ij. hundred and xliiij. year after
that Rome was made / the Romans ordained two Consules in the stead of their
king / the which should govern one year alone / leest that by taryenge they
should be proud / and that the one should coirecte the other if ^e exceded or
e^^ed. Brutus was the first Consul / and Lutius the second. And then was
there a man that was called Dictator / the name of an offyer / ye which should
go with the people against there enmyes. Titus Puphis. Marcus consules. Then
after the Romans co^playned greatly on the condycyons of the Consules. And then
the power was put to.x. men / to an exceeding cost to the common people. For
euerych one of them went like a king / and need caused them to leave that
dygnyte. And they trusted never to rest the war was so strong against them.
Arthaxerses was king of Persarum / under whom Esdras came to Jerusalem. And
Neemias was butelere to the same king. Whom afterward he sent to build the
walls of Jerusalem. Zerses reigned after him two months. Segdianus.vij.
months / and little they did.

How Lud was made kynhe after the death of Ely his fader.
AFter y^ death of Ely reigned Lud his sone and governed well the land and
much honored good folk / and tempred and amended wicked folk / this Lud
loved more to dwell at Troy than in any other place of the land. Wherefore
the name of new Troy was left / and tho was the cite called Ludstone. But y^
name is changed through varyaunce of letters / and now is called London. And
this king made in the cite a fair gate / and called it Ludgate after his name
/ And the folk of the cite are Londoners And when he had reigned.xi. year he
dyed and lies at London. And he had two young sons / that one was called
Adraghen / and that other Tormace. But they could neither speak ne go for

/ that was Cassibalanius brother / and made him king of Brytayne / now called
England.

Many men there were sold / and many men ran in to the fire wylfully
Corinthus his same year was destory de of the Romans / the which was the
rychest country of the world. Ptholomeus this time reigned in Egypt / and was
famylyer with the Romans. And so long he and his predecessors reigned as
they kept fydelyte to the Romans. And know every man / that there was none
other cause that the power of the Romans increased so strongely above other
people / but virtue / the which habundantly reigned in them / and namely
ryghtwysnesse / which above all thing they used. And as long as they kept
mesures and loved ryghtwysnesse / so long they were never overcome. And as
soon as they were corrupted / it is radde / they were euercomen. It is had in
a certain reuelaco^n of god showed to saint Brygyte that our lord god bears
witness to these old Romans. That none in this naturell life lived more
ryghtwysly. And what lyghtes of faith they showed in the time of Christian
religyon shall be showed afterward.

Regnum Iudeorum restituitur.
ARistobolus was the first king and priest in the Jury / this man reigned one
year alone / and took to him the Dyademe of the kingdom. And he held him not
content with that y^ his fader gaf him in his testament. But he put his mother
in prison and his brethern. And therefore he perysshed wretchydly with his
brother Antigonus / the which was of his counseyll and helped him. (Vide
magistru^ in histo^^^) Anntigonus brother unto the king was slain through the
enuyt^e of the queen. Alexander was bishop after Aristobolus / and he
stood.xxvij. year. And he was all a syraunt / all though he appeared sobre in
the beginning. But he made it known what he was in his stomach / for he
slew his own brother. And in.xij. year he slew.l. thousand of the old sage
faders of great virtue / by cause they told him his mysgydynge. Then when he
should deye / he left two sons behind him. Hircanu^ and Aristobolu^. But
certainly he said his wfy should regne / for she stood in the grace of the
people. Seruius Flaccus. Lucius. Fabius. Plubius this time were Senators at
Rome. This time bataylles among them self began. Of the which the first
cause and the beginning was Giac^us a mighty man / well known with noble
Romans / began to seek a cause against them. And by cause y^ he might do no
thing alone to them / he me^ed the common people to them saying / That all
the lands and possessions sh^lde de be denyded equaly / and also the m^neye
^e^. And for that cause there was an Insurreccyon / in the which Graccus was
slain / and many myscheues fell after (Vide Orosium) In the time of these men
/ there was a child borne at Rome / having four feet / four arms / two
faces / and four eyes. The hylle of Ethna spytted out flammynge fire horrible
/ and destroyed the places nyghe about it. And these men berynge rule. Cartago
was commanded to be restored. And it was fulfilled of the Romans people. And
there was mighty battle in the cite of Rome. Fabius with a little host
overcame the king of Armenye. And there were drowned an bondred and four score
thousand men in the water of Reine. Ptholomeus Alexander was king in Egypt.
In his time was borne Lucerius a Poet / the which afterward was mad for
love of wy^men and slew himself. Ptholomeus sone to Cleopatre reigned after him
/ under whom Salustius the noble writer of hystoryes was borne. Ptholomeus
Dyonisius was after this man And in his time Virgyll and Oracius were borne.

Anno mundi.v. M.C.xxxiiij. Et an te xp^i natiuitate^.ix.C.v.
Jacob naturell fader to Joseph of the line of Christ is reherced in Luke and
Mathe / and little of him is had in scripture. Alexandra wife to Alexander was
bishop in the Jury.ix. yerre / and showed much tyranny / all if she was made
bishop by her feyned holy relygy on. And Hircanu^ her sone she provoked to the
bysshopryche / and she ordained that he should regne after. This woman in the
line of the bishops is put for the countynge of the years. Not as she used the
office of a bishop / for it was not leyfull to her. Hircanus sone to Alexandra
reigned.xxxiij. year. This Hircanus after the decesse of his mother succeeded in
the kingdom / in the which he had little prosperyte / for percyalte of the
people. For anon he was ouercomen / and afterward he was restored through the
help of the Arabees. And then he was made trybutary to the Romans. And so
he was in peace a little time. But not in the name of king. At the last he dyed
wretchedly / for he was begyled thorugh the fraud of Parthorum / the which
Antigonus hired against him (vide plene magestru^ history) The heresye of y^
Pharysees about this time began. And among them were three sects in y^ Jury.
Pharacey. Saducey. and Essey. All these were dyuyded from the common use of the
Jews /and were enfecte with many errors for they said that they were holyer
than other men. For they lived strey^lyer than other men did (Vide plus alias)
Virgyll the most excellent of Poets was magnefyed this time / and meruaylous
things he did. And among other when that Neopolis was vexed with deedly pain
of mighty worms. Virgyll cast a worm of gold in to a ponde or a water / and
it lay a certain season there. And when it was take up in to y^ town / all the
cite was made full of worms. And till the worm of gold was put in to the
water again / they had Iufyte worms. And when it was in the water all the
worms went away. Also it is weyten in the chronicles of Rome / that Virgyll
by conning condescended or thycked the air / so that he walled his gardeyne
with the air. And he made a bridge of the air / by the which he might pass
every time that he list. Also he asked Marcellu^ Neopolitanu^ / neuewe unto the
Emperor / if he would have a bird taught to kylle all by^des or a fly taught
to drive all flies out of the cite. And this Marcellu^ told this to the
Emperor. And he desyted to teache a fly to kylle all flies. For the common
people were sore anoyed with flies And many other meruayles he did (vide
magistru^ Rodulfu^ Cesteru^) Oracius Flaccus / and Salustius Crispus historicus
were at this time. Quin^us Cepio. Gaius Lucius this time were C^^sules at Rome.
Pompeius. Marcus Crassus and Julius Lezar this time were Dictatours at Rome.
For as it is said / before there were many dygnytees at Rome / of the which
some dured one year / some two year. And among all the dygnytees the
Dictatours exceded / for it dured five year. But when the common people and the
lordshypes of Rome encreasynge were made three Dictatours. And this time was
Pampeius. Julius and Marcus Crassus Dictatours. And by cause Pompeius was of
great honor and aeged / he bode at Rome to keep the common people of Rome.
Marcus Crassus was send to subdue and fight with y^ regyon of Perthus. And
through treason he was taken and slain. Julius Cezar was send to the weste
part of the world to subdue them. And he has with him vij. legyons of people.
And when yt he had subdued Lombardye and France / his five year were spended /
the which were assygued to him and no longer. There by his own auctoryte he
took other five year upon him / in the which he subdued Cassybolon king of
Brytayne / and the Frenshmen that rebelled against him / This same Julius after
he had conquered the countries / unto Rome he rodeagayne / for to be received
with certain worship as conquerours were before hy^ but it was denied him and
also the entree of the cite / by the Instygacyon of a lord called Pompei.
Wherefore this Julius Cezar was annoyed / and with force of might entered the
cite / and robbed the common treasour and ladde it with him / and departed it
among the.vij. legyons that were his servants. Then went he in to Spain
to fight against this Pompei. For Pompei had the governance of Cariago. But
after that Iourneye in Ytalie Pompei and he encou^tred together. In the which
bataylle Pompei fled unto the king of Egypt / and that same king for
special love that he had unto this Julius Cezar smote of Pompeus heed and
sent it to Julius Cezar. Yet for all the enuyte y^ was betwixt them two Julius
wept when that he saw this Pompeius heed. This Julius was exceeding in wit
before other men / and he faught in battle.lij. times. This man alone exceded
Marcus Crassus / the which is said to have foughten.xxxix. times. This man
took first the Empire of Rome upon him / when Pompei and other noble men of the
Romans were slain. And at the last the fyfth year of his Empire / this Julius
Cezar the ruler of all this world was slain in the counsel house through
treason of his lords. Cathon the most named philosopher / seeing Julius
Cezar have the victory / whom he favored not / at a town called Vticam did
slay himself (iuxta illud Mauult cato mari: qua^ deroget vrbis honorari) But
for y^ after Austyn he was not excused of sin. This time the Jury was
trybutarye to the Romans for percyalyte of two brethern Aristobolus and
Ercanus both of them for envy of other cast them to the Romans y^ they might
regne. This time three sons appeared in heaven toward the ^est part of y^
world the which by little and little were brought in to one body. A great
sing it was that Africa. Asia / and Europa should be brought in to one
monarche / and that the lordshyp of Anthony the Senatoure and L^cius Anthontij
should turn in to one lordshyp. Marcus Cicerio Tullus the most noble
Rethoryeen was Counsull of Rome this time.

How that the Brytons granted unto Cassybolon which then tofore y^ was
Luddes brother the land. In whoos time Julius Cezar came twyes for to conquer
the land of Brytayne.
AFter the death of king Lud reigned his brother Cassybolon and became a good
man and much beloved of his Brytons / so that for his goodness and curteysy
they granted him the reame for ever more to him and to his heirs. And the
king of his goodness let nourysshe worthily both the sons that were Lud his
brother. And after made the eldest sone earl of Cornewayle / and the youngest
sone he made earl of London. And while this king Cassybolon reigned / came
Julius Cezar that was Emperor of Rome in to the land with a power of Romans
/ and would have had this land through strength / but Cassybolon overcame hy^
in battle through help of the Brytons / and drove him out of this land. And
he went again to Rome and assembled a great power an other time / and came
again in to this land for to give bataylle to Cassybolon / but he was
dyscomfyted through strength of the Brytons / and through help of the Earl of
Cornewayle and the Earl of London his brother / and through help of Gudian
king of Scotlonde / and Corbonde the king of Northwalys / and of Brytayll
king of Southwalys. And in this bataylle was slain Neunon y^ was Cassybolons
brother / wherefore he made much sorrow / And so went Julius Cezar out of this
land with a few of Romans y^ were let a live. And then Cassybolon went
again to London and made a feast to al folk y^ tho hy^ had helped. And when
that this feast was done / then every man yede in to his own country.

Of the debate that was betwixt Cassybolon and the Earl of London / and of the
truage that was paid to Rome.
ANd after it befelle thus upon a day / that the gentylmen of the kings
household and the gentylmen of ye Earls household of London after meet went
together for to play. And through debate that arose among them Enelin that was
the Earls cosyn of London slew Irenglas that was the kings cosyn Wherefore the
king swore that Enelin should be hanged. But the Earl of London that was
Enelins lord would not suffer him / wherefore the king was gretely wroth and
vtred toward the Earl / and thought him to destroy. And pryuely the Earl
sent letters to Julius Cezar / that he should come in to this land for to
help him / and him avenge upon the king / and he would help him with all his
might. And when the emperor herd this tidings he was full glad / and
ordained a strong power / and came again the third time in to this land / and
the Earl of London helped him with viij. thousand men / and at the third time
was Cassybolon overcome and dyscomfyted and made peace to the Emperor for three
thousand pound of silver yeldynge by year for truage for this land for
evermore. And then half a year after passed the Emperor Julius Cezar went
again unto Rome / and the Earl of London with him. For he durst not abide in
this land. And after Cassybolon reigned.vij. year in peace / and tho he deyed
the.xvij. year of his regne and lies at York.

How that the lords of the land after the death of Cassybolon and for by cause
he had none heir made Andragen king.
AFter the death of Cassybolon / for as much as he had none heir of his
lefull body begoten / the lords of the land by the comyns assente crowned
Andragen earl of Cornewayle and made him king. And he reigned well and worthily
/ and he was a good man / and well governed the land. And when he had
reigned.viij. year then he deyed / and lies at London.

Joseph of the line of Christ was about this time borne / and after was
husbonde unto our lady. Anthigonus was bishop this time in the Jury. This
Anthigonus was sone unto Aristoholy / and on every side he was false. For he
obeyed not to the Romans / and a great plage he brought unto the land for to
destroy Hircanus his vnde / that he might regne king / and so Hircanus was
expulsed / and Flaccus was slain / and Herod was exiled. But when Herod came
unto Rome and told the Senators all these things / the Emperor created him
king sendynge with him anhoste / the which took Jerusalem. And Anthigonu^ the
bishop taken / led to Anthony the Senator / the which made him syker / and
so was Herod confermed in to his kingdom. And he a stranger reigned on the
Jews / and so the kingdom of the Jews cessed as Jacob had said. Titus Liuius
historicus / and Duidius were this time.

Incipiunt imperatores augusti. et dictus est augustus quia augebat populum.
OCtauyan was Emperor of Rome.lvij. year.vi. months and.x. days. This
Octauyan neuewe to July when he was a young man took y^ Empire upon hy^. His
flourysshynge youth he spended in war. Five thousand bataylles he did. And
shortly after many bataylles / he brought all the world in to one Monarche /
y^ man had no fellow And in his days peace was in all the world through the
prouysyon of the very god. That the temporal peace might glorifye ye natyuyte of
our saupour Christ Ihesu. This Octauyan was the fairest man y^ might be / and
high in wit / the most fortunate in all things. And he lacked not the vice
of his flesshely lust. This man made all the world to be mesured. And in
the.lij. year of his regne was our lord Ihesu Christ borne / the Savior of
this world / the which grants eternal peace to his lovers. Hic nota dscdin
Ieronimu^) that Anna and Emeria were systers. And of Emeria was borne Elyzabeth
mother to Johan y^ Baptyst. And she was first wedded to Ioachim of whom she
took Mary mother of Christ. The second husbonde was Cleophe / and he gate on her
Maria Cleophe / the which was wedded to Alphe of whom proceeded James y^ less
Simon Cananeus. Judas Tadeus / and Joseph the which is called Barsabas / The
third time Anna was wedded to Salome / of whom she took Mary Salome / the
which was wedded to Zebe^e and of them came James the more / and Johan the
Euangelyst. The first Mary wedded Joseph brother to Cleophe before said. This
time Sibilla Tiburnna prophesied of Christ / and said to the emperor August /
that he should not trow y^ he was not god after the folysshenes of the
paynyms. And there she showed hy^ a fair virgyn in heaven holding a child in
her arms / and said to hy^ / this child is gretter than thou / and therefore
do hy^ worship. The monarche of Rome about this time myghtly increased. And
when it was so that by all the world in diverse prouynces bataylles were
raised suddenly all men meruayllynge they were sessed and put them holy to the
pr^nce of Rome that openly it might be showed that such an universal peace came
never by labor of bataylle but of the power of the very god / that in his
natyuyte peace should regne in all the world Herod Ascolonita was king in the
Jury.xxxv. year. This Herod ydumeus was the first strange king that reigned
on the Jews. The master in historijs says / he was a noble man / and faith
full in the beginning / and in all thing he had him nobly. He was very
gentle unto the Romans and to the people that loved peace. And in his old
aege / when he would much please the Romans herd of the birth of Christ /
d^e dynge to be expulsed of his kingdom as a stranger / wretchedly he fell
and slew the Innocents and diverse of his own children. And at the last was
hateful to all people / and fell syke and deyed wretchedly. Mary the mother of
Christ was borne before the Natyuyte of Christ.xvi. year or there about.

Of Kymbalyn that was Andragens sone reigned after his fader.
AFter ye death of Andragen reigned Kembalyn his sone a good man and well
governed the land in much prosperytee and peace all his life time. And in his
time Ihesu Christ was borne of that sweet virgyn Mary. This king Kymbalyn had
two sons. Gynder and Armager good knights and worthy. And when this Kymbalyn
had reigned.xxij. year / he deyed and lies at London.

Here at Crystis Natyuyte begins the sixte aege during to the fynall
Judgment / having years as god knows
Cristus natus est.
Here begins the sixte aege during to the end of the world.



THat day our lord Ihesu Christ was borne / a well of oil beyond Tybre by
Rome sprange and ran al day. The golden image fell the which Romulus had
made / and put it in his palace saying. This image shall not fail unto a maid
bear a child. When Herod disposid him to slay the children of Israel / he was
commanded by the letter of the emperor to come to Rome to answer to the
accusacyon of his childern Alexiu^. and Aristoboli. And there were three Herodes
greatly spoken of for there ill deeds. The first was called Ascolonita / and
under this man was borne Christ / and the childern of Israel were slain. The
second was called Antipas sone to ye first Herod / under whom John Baptyst
heeded / and Christ suffered death. And ye third was called Agrippa sone to
Aristoboli / sone to the first Herod / the which slew James and prysoned
Peter. The first Herod when he saw his sons Alexiu^ and Aristoboli through
the pretens of his letter by the Emperor send / strive for ye succession of
his kingdom / he disposid and made Antipater that was his first begoten sone
to be before them / and when they were talking of the death of there fader he
cast them away / and they went to the emperor to compain of yE wrong of
there fader. And in ye mean time the three kings of Coleyne came by Herod unto
Jerusalem / and when they came not again by hy^ / he thought yt they were
ashamed for to come again by him for because yt they were disceyued / and yt
they found not the child as he demed / therefore in the mean season he cessed
to slay ye childern of Israel / and so went unto Rome for the cytacion of
the emperor. And he took his way by ye cite of Tarsu^ / where he burnt the
ships in ye which the three kings of Coleyne should have saylled in to there
own country. Then after a year and certain days / this Herod came from Rome
again / accorded with his sons And for the confyrmaco^n of his kingdom he was
made much bolder / and then he slew all the childern of Bethleem yt were of
two year of aege and under that had space of one night of aege / and among
these was there one of his own childern. And Aristoboli and Alexiu^ were had
in suspeccion / in so much as they promised a harbor a great reward yt he
should take and kytte there faders throat when that he did him shave. And when
this Herod herd this he was grieved and there he slew both his sons. And
Herod Agrippa his sone he ordained to be king. Wherefore Antipater his oldest
sone was about to poison his fader / the which Herod Agrippa understood / and
prysoned there his brother / that which the Emperor herd and said that he
had lever be an hog of Herodes / than for to be one of his sons / for his
hogs he spares / and his sons he sleeth. And when that Herod was.lxx. year
of aege he was stryken with a great syknesse in his hondes and in his feet and
in his members / that no leche might come to him for stenche / and so he deyed.
So Antipater his sone in prison herd tell of this and Ioyed gretely / and
there fore that cause he was slain. Then strove Archelaus and Herodes for
the succession of the first Herod. The Emperor there through counseyll of the
Senators / the half of the Jury and Idumea gaaf to Archelaus under name of
Tetrarche. And the other part he divided in two. Galylee he gaaf to Herod
Antippa. And Ituriam and Traconidem he gaaf to Philyppe Herodes brother. And
that same year Christ came from Egypt / And Archelaus was accused many times
of the Jews / and was exyled in to Vyennam in to France. And in that place
were set four Tetrarchees / to the repreuynge of the vnstablynesse of the
Jews. And that same year Octauyan the Emperor deyed.

Anno Xpristi.x.
.I.N.R.I. Crux Xpisti.


IHesus Christ at.xij. year of aege herd the doctors in the Temple Our lord
Ihesu Christ at.xxx. year of aege was baptized. Ihesu Christ the lord of all
things at.xxx. year of aege and.iij. months deyed for his servants.
Anninus Rufus was bishop in ye Jury about this time. Valerius Graceus was
after him.xi. year. This man openly sold the bysshopryche / and he that most
yaaf had it. And there was money in a little while. Poncius Pylatus was Judge
and Proctour in the Jury under the Emperor. And under this man John Baptyst
began for to preche. And our lord suffered death the which was dampened to death
vnryghtwysly for dread of the emperor. Tyrus a certain king gate a child on Pyla
a poor manes daughter / the which man hight Atus / and this child of his
moders name and his belsyre put togyders was called Pylatus / This Pylatus ye
fourth year of his aege was sent to his fader. The which king of his lefull
wife had gotten a child even of the aege with Pylate and by cause this lefull
gotten child as they proceeded in aege exceded this bastard Pylatus he was full
of euuye / and slew his brother the lefull gotten child. Wherefore forth with
his fader sent him to Rome for pledge for his trybute yt he paid to Rome /
entendynge he would never redeem him. In the which time the kings sone of
France was pledge for his trybute / the which exceded him in strength and
chyualry also he slew him. Therefore the Romans sent Pylate as a profitable
man for the common well to the isle of Ponto to tame ye cursyd people / the
which slew every Judge that came to them And he yt cursyd man governed yt
unhappy people / what with thretynge and with promise / and with law / and
with yeftes yt none of them durst contrary do to his pleasure / wherefore he
was called Pylate of Ponto. Herod Antipa young in his conuersacyons / with
yeftes and messages drew him to him and made hy^ prince of the Jury under him.
And this time Pylate gadred much money / and He rode not knowing / he went
to Rome that he might receive of the Emperor that Herod had given him.
Wherefore Herod and Pylate were enmyes together / unto the passion of our lord
/ when yt Pylate send Ihesus unto Herod clothed in a white clothe / then
they were made friends. Ouidius Naso in Ponto about this time deyed the fourth
year of his exyle. Tyberius this time was Emperor at Rome / and he reigned
xxiij. year / and he lived in the year that our lord Ihesu Christ deyed / and
somewhat after. This man was in all his works gretely auysed yt there should be
no thing suddenly done / wise in wars / studyous in books / fair of speech /
fresshe in wit / save he would of times feyne hy^self to do things yt he
would never do of other. This Emperor understood and trusted in Christ / and
worshyped him for god. Some men say at the last he was cruel against people /
but it was a great reason of pity / that he was ever gracyous to his subgettes
and poor men. And he had peace all his days / and all the people that said
against christian folk with out any mercy he destroyed / and he exyled Pylate
for ever. Then he decessed and a worse succeeded him. After Euseby it is
written / our lord at.xxx. year of his aege chose his.xij. apostles / the
which made our Creed / yt is our believe. And they made it after the
Resurreccyon of Christ / and after the holy ghost was send unto them. When they
had chose Mathia the apostle / and each of them made a part as it is showed
hereafter. And this Mathia was chose between the day of the Ascencyon and
Wytsondaye in the place of Judas Scaryot the traitor / of the which Judas in
a history is read thus. There was a certain man in Jerusalem that hight Ruben /
and after saint Ierom he was of the trybe of Ysachar. And his wife hight Cyborea
/ the which on a certain night when he would lustely know his wife / she dremed
yt she should here a child of myscheyf / and ye child should be a traitor to
his king and to all the people of yt regyon / and when y^ child was borne and
called Judas / his fader and his mother abhorred as well to slay there child /
as to nourysshe a traitor to the king and all his people / thefore they put
him in to a panyer / or a lepe in to ye see / and he flowed to the isle of
Scaryoth / where ye lady of yt place had no child by her husbonde / and she
feyned her to be which child / but she failed. And after in a little season the
same lady and queen conceived a child of her husbonde / and when yt he was of
aege. Judas many times angered him and caused him to weep / the which the queen
saw / and beat Judas many times / and after she knowledged yt Judas was not
the kings sone ne hers / wherefore Judas slew the kings sone / and he dradde
the pain of the law / and fled with certain exiles to Jerusalem. And when he
came there / he gate him in to Pylates court that was Judge. And by cause yt oo
cursyd man draws to an other / therefore he drew to Pylate and stood greatly
in his favor. And upon a certain day when Pylate looked out of his palace in to
an orcharde of a man's yt was called Ruben yt was very fader to Judas. Pylate
desired to have apples / and Judas went to gadre apples / and Ruben ran to
Judas for to let hy^ because he took his apples with out any leave. And when
they had chydde this Judas smote his fader on the heed with a stone and slew hy^
/ and Judas fled away secretly after yt deed / but it was said yt Ruben dyed
suddenly. Then Pylate gat to Judas all the goods yt Ruben had and Ciborea
Rubens wife / yt was mother to Judas. And he dealed not curtesly with her as a
man should with his wife / and for yt she wept and wayled / for she had put her
sone to ye see / and yt she was married against her will. It was perceived yt
Judas had slain his own fader and wedde his own mother. Then^e Ciborea his
mother and wife meuyd hy^ to leave his sin / and then he followed Christ / and he
forgave him his sin and made him his proctour and apostle. And how falls he
was to Christ / it needs not to reherce. And yt same year Mathewe was chosen /
and the holy ghost was send in to them as it is said before The appostles or
they were sparpled in to all the world / they gadred them together in to
Jerusalem and made ye Creed here following / that is our believe.

Petrus Credo in deu^ patrem omnipotente^ creatorem celi et terre. Andreas Et
in ihesum xp^m filium eius vnicum dominum nostrum. Ioha^nes Qui conceptus est
de spiritu sancto natus ex maria virgin. Iacobus Passus sub pontis pilato

Credo in spiritum sanctum. Matheus Sanctam ecclesiam catholicam. Simon
Sanctorum communionem remissione^ peccatorum. Judas Carnis resurreccionem.
Mathias Et vita^ eternam Amen.
IHesu Christ our savior rose fro death to life and said to his discyples All the
power in heaven and in earth is given unto me. And goo ye thus in to all the
world and preche / and teache unto every creature / and I shall be with you
unto the end of the world. Here he chose hy^ lxxij. discyples. And he
had.xij. apostles the which he send in to all the world to preche. Ne it is
not read that there were more ordres among the discyples of Christ / of whom
the priests and bishops in the church of god yet keep the form. For to the
apostles the bishops succeed / and to the dyscyples priests. To the which
two ordres / all the church is given as a goodly Ierarche (Vt patet in Decreto

Here begins the order of Popes of Rome / and contynueth as the line of
Christ did before. For in them god left his power.
Anno domini.xxxiiij.
PEter a Jew the first pope was a blessed man and a glorious apostle of
Christ. He was heed of the church. xxxvij. year. And he held his bysshopryche
in the eest.v. year and said mass he made our lord / and alone said the Pater
noster. Then after he came to Antiochiam and there he abode.vij. year
techynge the way of troth. And Spmon Magus he confounded away. That season he
preched to the people that were circsscysed / the which were in Ponto of
Galati. Capadocia. Asia. Bithinia. Then herd he that Simon Magus deluded the
Romans / through the love of the faith / he came to Rome in the fourth year of
Claudius the Emperor And there he preached the word of god / and showed the
falshede of Simon Magus and turned many a man to the faith / Then he send
his precher by diverse prouynces / by whom christian relygyon was myghtely
increased. He ordained the feast of Lenton before Eester / and Aduent / and the
Emerynge days to be fasted of all christian people / in to the myrrour of the
first and second coming of our lord Ihesu. Then when he had be pope at
Rome.xxv. year.vij. months and.viij. days / he was slain of Nero (Eius pl^a
opera vide ac^^bus apl^orum) Gaius this time was Emperor at Rome and
reigned.iij. year and.x. months. This Gaius was first bicyous in lyurnge / for
two of his own systers he mysused / and on one of them he gate a daughter /
which child he set betwixt ye knees of Iupyter in the temple / and feyned
afterward y^ Iupyter had gotten her. Wherefore he did cry through the country
that all men should worship her as a goddess / This man also made an image
like himself / and sent it to one Patronie Presydent at Jerusalem under y^
Romans co^maundynge him y^ he should compel the Jews to do worship thereto.
And fore these enormities and many other / our lord suffered him to be slain
at Rome in his own Palace.

Of king Gynder that was Kymbalyns sone / that would not pay the truage to
Rome for the land that Cassybolon had granted / and how he was slain of a
Romayne.
ANd after y^ death of this Kymbalyn reigned Gynder his sone a good man and a
worthy / and was of so high heart y^ he would not pay to Rome y^ trybute that
king Cassybolon had granted unto Julius Cezar. Wherefore them perour y^ was
tho / that was called Claudius Cezar was sore anoyed. And ordained a great
power of Romans / and came in to this land for to conquer the trybute through
strength / and for to have it on the king. But this king Gynder and Arinager
his brother assembled and (...) a great host (...) of Brotons and yaue battle
to the Emperor Clawdius / and slew of y^ Romans great plente. The Emperor
had afterward one that was called Hamon y^ saw the people there were fast
slain / and pryuely cast away his own arms / and took y^ arms of a deed
Bryton / and armed him with his armor / and came in to the bataylle to the
kyuge and said in this manner. Sir be of a good heart for gods love / for the
Romans that been your enmyes anon shall be slain and dyscomfyted euerychone.
And the king gaaf no keep to his words / ne to his speech / for by cause of
the arms that he had upon him / and de myd that he had been a Bryton. But the
traitor ever held him next the king And pryuely under the sholder of his
arms he smote the king / wherefore the king deyed and fell down to the
earth / When Armager saw his brother so deed / he cast away his arms and
took to him his brothers arms / and came in to the battle among the brytons
and had them hetfly for to fight / and fastlaye a down the Romans. And for
the arms they wend it had be king Gynder that before was slain / y^ they wist
not. Then began the Brytons fyersly for to fight / and slew the Romans. So
at the last the Emperor forsook the field / and fled as fast as they might
with his folk in to Wynchestre. And the false traitor Hamon that had slain
the king / fast anon began for to slay with all the have that he might. And
Armager the kings brother pursued him full fyersely with a fyers heart / and
drove him unto a water and there he took him. And anon smote of both hand
and feet and heed / and he^ed the body all to pyeces / and then let cast him
in to the water. Wherefore y^ water was called Hamons haven. And after there was
made a fair town that yet stondeth / that is called Southampton. And after
Armager went to Wynchestre for to seek Claudius Cezar the Emperor of Rome.
And there Armager him took. And Claudius the emperor thorugh counseyll of the
Romans that were with him left a live / made peace with Armager in this manner as
ye shall here. That is to say. How that Claudius the Emperor should give unto
Armager Gennen his fair daughter for to have unto his wife. So that this land
from that time forward should be in the Emperors power of Rome / upon such
covenant / that never afterward no Emperor of Rome should take none other
trybute of this land / but oonly france. And they were accorded. And upon this
covenant Claudius Cezar sent to Rome for his daughter Gennen. And as she was
come Claudius Cezar yaf her unto Armager to wife. And Armager spowsed her at
London with much solempnyte and mythe. And then was Armager crowned and made
king of Brytayne.

Of king Armager in whose time saint Peter preched in Antioche with other
apostles in diverse countries.
THis Armager reigned well and worthily / and governed the land right
worshypfully. And Claudius Cezar in remembrance of this accord / and for
reverence and honor of his daughter / made in this land a fair town and a
castle / and let call the town after his name Claucestren / the which now
is called Gloucestre. And then when all this was done the Emperor took his
leave / and then^e went to Rome again. And Armager then was king / and
governed the land well and worthily all his lives time. And this Armager gate a
sone on his wit which was called Westmer. And while that this Armager reigned
/ saint Peter preched in Anthioche. And there he made a noble church. In the
which he sat first in his chair. And there he dwelled.vij. year. And after
he went to Rome / and was made pope / till that Nero the Emperor let martyr
him. And then preched openly all the apostles in diverse lands the right
faith. And when Armager had reigned.xxiiij. year / he deyed / and lies at the
auncyente cite of London.

How king Westmer gaf to Berynger an ylonde forlet. And there this Berynger
made the town of Berwyke.
ANd after this Armager reigned his sone Westmer / that was a good man and a
worthy of body / and well governed the land. It befell so yt tidings came to
him upon a day / that the king Roderyk of Gascoyne was come in to this land
with an hughe host of people / and was dwelling in Stanys more. And when
king Westmer herd those tidings / he let assemble an huge host of Brytons
/ and came to the king Roderyk and yaue him battle. And king Westmer slew
king Roderyk with his own hondes in plain bataylle. And when king Roderyks
men saw that there lord was slain / they yielded them all to king Westmer /
and became his men for ever more. And he gaf them a country that was forleten
wherein they might dwell. And thither they went and dwelled there all their
lives time / and.ix. hundred men there were of them and no moo left at that
battle. Their governor and prince was called Berynger And anon he began a
town that they might therein dwell and have resort / and let call the town
Berwyk upon Twede. And there they enhabyted and became rich. But they had no
wy^men among them / and the Brytons would not give their daughters to the
strangers. Wherefore they went over see in to Irlonde / and brought with them
wy^men / and there they them spowsed. But the men could not understand their
langage ne y^ speech of these wy^men / and therefore they spoke together as
Scotts. And afterward through chau^gynge there langage / in all France they
were called then Scotts and so should the folks of that country be called
for ever more.

How king Westmer let arere a stone in the entering of Westmerlonde / there
that he slew Roderyk / and there he began first housynge.
ANd after this battle that is above said when Roderyk was deed / king
Westmer in remembrance of his victory let arere there beside the way a great
stone on high / and yet it stondeth / and ever more shall stand. And he le te
grave in the stone letters yt thus said The king Westmer of Brytayne slew in
this place Roderyk his enemy / And this Westmer was the first that builded
house and town in Westmerlonde / and at that stone begins Westmerlonde /
that Westmer let call after his own name. And when Westmer had so done / he
dwelled all his life time in that country of Westmerlonde / for he loved yt
country more than any other country / and when he had reigned.xxv. year / he
deyed and lies at Karleyll.

Of king Coill that was Westmers sone that held his land in peace all his
lives time.
AFter this / his sone king Coill reigned / a good man and a worthy / and of
good condycyons / and well governed his land. And of all men he had love and
peace. And in his time was never contake / debate / nor war in Brytayne. And
he reigned and was king in (...) all his lives time. And when he had reigned.xi.
year he deyed and lies at York.

Claudius was Emperor at Rome next after Gai^s. And he reigned.xiiij. year
and.viij. days. This man came in to great Brytayne now called England / for
to challenge the trybute which they did deny unto ye Romans. And after
great bataylles there was between the Emperor Claudius and Armager king of
Brytayne. And after accordement made / y^ this armager should wedde Claudius
daughter / and after they two should ever live in peace. In token whereof / this
Claudius named the cite where they were wedded after him / and called it
Claudicestre / where we now it call Gloucestre. This Claudius had three wives.
And on Petiua the first wife he gate a daughter that hight Antonia The first wife
decessed / and he wedded Messalinam / and gate a sone that hight Britanicus /
and Octauia a daughter. The third he wedded Agrippina / having a sone that
hight Nero. Claudius wedded his daughter Octauia to Ne to his wives sone. This
Claudius for love that he had to Agrippina his last wife / he slew Messalina
his first wife / leest she should have help Britanicus her sone and his to ye
Empyer. Yet Agrippina the last wife of Claudius dradde / leest her husbonde
would have proferred Britanicus / and have deposed Nero her sone / therefore she
poisoned her husbonde Claudius / and Nero was promoted to the Empire. And this
same Nero yaue his mother such a reward again. For he poisoned Britanicus and
slew his own mother and his wife Octauia. James the more the apostle this time
was slain of Herod Agrippa / and Peter was prysoned (Vt pz ac^.xij.) The body
of saint James was brought by miracle in Galeciam of Spain. Nero after
Claudius was Emperor / and he reigned xiij. year and.vij. months. This Nero
was a cursyd man / and made great waste in the Empire. He would not fysshe but
with nets of gold and ropes of sylke. A great part of the lords of Rome he
slew. He was enemy to no men but to good men. He slew his brother and his
wife his mother and his master. He slew also Peter and Poule / he would never
were one cloth two times. All his horse and his mules were shod with silver /
and at the last he did set a great part of Rome on fire / some say / the
Romans complained the streets were to narowe. And as he had brent a great
part of Rome. ^. cro said there is space to build the shetes wyder. Then
the Senators with the common people came upon him to slew him / and he fled
by night in to the subarbes of the cite and hyde hy^ / and he herd karles and
beggars saying. And they wist where the Emperor were he should never escape
them. Nero thought it should be great derogacion to his name and he were
slain of karles. And on a great stake he ran himself to the heart and deyed
/ and there was buried. And deuylles kept his body many a day after and did
great hurt to the people / till by a miracle of our lord the body was found
and taken away / and then ye deuylles boyded. Seneca was this time master
to Nero. Iuuenalis poeta. Lucanus poeta. James the less the apostle bishop of
Jerusalem was slain of the Jews the.vi. year of Nero. Marcus the eua^gelyst
was martred the first year of him.

Circa annu^ xp^i.lxxiiij.
LInus Ytalicus was pope of Rome.x. year and.ij. months and.xiij. days. This
Linus and his successor Cletus / through their holy conuersacyon were made to
mynystre the ^resour of the church to the people Peter being a live. And
Peter attended to prayenge and prechynge. It it read of this Cletus / that he
wrote first in his letters (Salutem et apostolica^ benedictionem) Before this
time was many a Dyscyple of Peter slain under Nero. Galba this time was
Emperor / and he reigned.vij. months. This man was made Emperor by the power
of Spain in the same land Nero living. And after the death of Nero brought to
Rome / and there was slain of a man that, came with whete to Rome. He smote of
his heed and bare it to him that was Emperor next / seeing all his men / and
none of them helping him. In this man's days came the great Rethoricyen to
Rome fro Spain / and was the first that ever taught the science openly / his
name was Quintilian. Otho reigned after him / and he reigned but.iij. months.
For one Vitellus that was Presydent of France challenged the Empire. And in
Ytalye betwixt these two were three great bataylles. And in the fourth battle
Otho saw he should be overcome and in great dyspeyre he slew himself.
Vitellus reigned after Otho and he reigned.viij. months / for he was follower of
Nero most special in glotony / and in singing of foul songs / and at
festes etynge out of mesure / that he might not keep it. Vespasianus reigned
next tfter him.ix. year and.x. months and.xij. days. The well governed men
of Rome seeing the cursyd succession of Nero sent after this Vespasian unto
Palestyn. For there he was and his sone Titus which had besyeged Jerusalem.
And when he herd that Nero was deed / by whom he was sent to Jerusalem / and
herd of these cursyd men regnynge. At the Instau^ce of these men / not
wyllyngly / took upon him the Empire. And anon as he was come to Rome / he
overcame the tyrau^t Vitellus and let him be draw thorugh Rome / and after in
to Tybre till he was deed / and then let him sail without sepulture / for
this y^ people desired. This man was cured of waspys in his nose anon as he
byleued in our lord Ihesu / And that was the cause why he went to Jerusalem /
to venge Cristis death. He fought.xxxij. times with his enemies / And deyed the
year of grace.lxxix.

Anno dm^.lxxxiiij.
CLetus a martyr was pope.xi. year This Cletus was a Romayn / and greatly he
loved pylgrymages to saints saying it was more profit to ye health of man's
soul to visyte the place that saint Peter was in / than for to fast two year.
He cursyd all tho men lettynge such pylgrymages / or counselors contrary
thereto. At the last he was martryd by Damician the Emperor. Titus sone to
Vespasianus was Emperor this time and reigned three year. And he abode still at
Jerusalem after the eleccyon of his fader and destroyed the cite. And slew
there as the storye says with battle and hungre.xi. hundred thousand Jews.
And a hundred thousand he took and sold.xxx. for a penny. By cause they sold
Christ for.xxx. pens / and brought thens all thing that was precious / and put
them in his house at Rome / which was called Templu^ pacis / But now is that
place fall down for the most party / and all these great Iewelles ben
dystrybuted to certain chirches in Rome. This Titus was so full of virtue that
all men loved him / so ferforth / that they called him the most delectable of
men. He was full lyberall to all men / in so much that he said often times /
that there should no man go from an Emperor with an heavy heart / but he
should somewhat have of his petycyon. He would be sorry that day in the which
he had granted no man no benefyte. When that he was deed. every man that was
in Rome wept for him / as that they had lost their fader. Domician brother to
Titus reigned after him.xxiiij. year and.v. months First he was easy / and
afterward full unreasonable. For much of the Senate was destroyed by his
malice / and also much of his kynrede. He began the second persecuco^n after
Nero against christian men / in the which persecucyon Johan the Euangelyst was
exiled in to Pathius after the Emperor had put him in to a tonne of oil
brennynge and hurt him not. So this man was not the follower of his fader
Vespasian / ne his brother Titus / but rather like Nero and his kynrede. And
for these wicked condicyons he was slain in his own palace at Rome in
the.xxvij. year of his aege / Clemens a martyr was pope.ix. year and he
succeeded Cletus. This Clemens first of saint Peter was ordained to be
successor to him. And for peril he would Linus and Cletus should be popes
before him / leest that through that ensample prelates should ordeyne under them
who some ever they would. This man made the life of martyrs to be written by
regyons. And he made many books He ordained that a child should be confermed
as soon as it might / namely after it was crystened. And at the last he was
martred under Traian. Nerua was Emperor after Domician oo year and two
months. And when he was chosen he meued the Senate to make a law / that
thing which Domician commanded to be kept should be broken / By the which
mean saint Johan the Euangelyst was losed out of his exyle / and suffered to
come again to Ephase. This man did an other thing right comendable that he
assigned so wise a man as Traian was to govern the people after him. Nota.
Traianus Hispanicus was Emperor.xix. year. This Traianus many man said. He was
the best among all the Emperors / but in one thing alone he was vicyous. In
so much as he for the love of the false gods was abowte to destroy the
christian faith. Iugynge in himself so most to please god. Some men say not by
him self but by other he pursewed the christian faith / and in the end of his
life he did but few to death. And all his loving I set at naught. But at
saint Gregory meued with pity weeping / and prayed unto our lord for him /
that he would have mercy upon him / and by his prayer have him out of hell /
in to which place he was dampened. And now if that he be saved or not / a great
alteracyon is among doctors. And to us that write Chronicles / it is no part
of our charge to determyn. But all the eest part of the world. Babylon.
Selencia / the utter parts of the Ynde. Germayne the second after Alexander
he held under. In all these things so pyteous and so mekely he guyded him to
every man as a king. He was gentle / and to no man ungentle / the which is
read of few / All his days he lived / that men said he was the most worthy
man in all his Empire. And thought and said ever more / that no man was more
unworthy to be Emperor than he.

Anno dm^.C.liij.
ANacletus a martyr was pope.ir. year. And he was a Greek. He monysshed all
christian men that priests should be worshypped above all other men. Saying /
that priests doing sacrifyce to god should be borne out / and not vexed / but
be worshypped. And priests when they said mass the should have witness with
them and namely bishops. Also he decreed that clerks should were no berdes
no^ long here. Also that a bishop should be consecrated of three / and
diverse other thing. At the last the.xij. year of Traianus he was martred and
buried by the body of saint Peter / Plintius the second Orator and
philosopher wrote much things. This man meued Traianus yt he should withdraw
the sentence yeuen against christian folk / written to him that they should do no
ylle but take heed to the virtue / but that they should rise before day and
worshypp there god secretly in the night. Euaristus a Greek and a martyr was
pope.x. year and.vij. months after Anacletus. This man ordained yt man and
woman should be wedded openly / and that they should be blessed openly of the
priest and fader and mother. And he was martred the third year of Adrian and
buried by saint Peter. Alexander a Romayn was pope.viij. year and.v. months.
This Alexander the most part of the Senators he converted unto our lord.
And he constytuted and ordained / that holy water should be sprynkled in to
christian men's houses. And he ordained that the bread that priests use to
sing with should be made of pure and clean bread and that in a little
quantyte. At the last he was martred under Adryan that was the Emperor. And
many of them he converted to the faith. Sixtus a Romayne was pope.x. year
and.iij. months. This man ordained (Sanctus Sanctus Sanctus etc^) should be
said in the mass And that the holy things of the church should not be
touched but of mynystres of the church. Also that ye corporax should not be
made of sylke / but of pure lynnen clothe wouen / and not dyed / and that a
woman should not touch the holy vessel of the awter / ne the palle. Also he
ordained / that if any bishop were vacant / that no bishop should be received
in to his benefyce / but with ye popes letters. Also y^ no mass should be said
but upon an awter / and at the last he was martred. Adrianus was Emperor.xxi.
year. This Adrian in many things is commended to christian men / other while he
was gracyous / and certain of them that would not do sacrifyce to the false
gods he slew. He was an universal man all most in all science. Peace he had
all his days / but with the Jews and many a law he made. And then he
commanded that christian men should not be dampened to death but with due process.
Jerusalem he subdued again / and forhadde that no Jew should dwell therein by
no wise. Christian men he suffered there to dwell. Against his will he came to the
Empire / but he governed him very well. When the Senators prayed him to call
his sone Emperor after him / He said / it is not enough to me y^ against my
will I have reigned / which I have not deserved. For the Emperor of Rome
should go by succession of blood / but to such men as have deserved it through
their merytees. Many times he reigned vnuertuously that is a king borne / and
virtue should come before his kingdom Eustachius otherwise called Placidus and
Therospita his wife / and two of there sons / of whom meruayllous things ben
read / were martred by the co^maun dement of Adrian. This Placidus was mayller
of the Emperors knights. Jerusalem was restored by Adrian and made larger /
so yt the place where Christ deyed was within the walls / the which was
without before. And this is ye third building again of that cite / for it
was thryes destroyed. Of the Caldees in the time of Zedechee / of Antiochus in
the time of Machabeorr / and of Titus in the time of Vespasian.

Anno dm^.C.xliiij.
THelesphorus a Romayne was pope.xi. year This man ordained this angels ympne
to be song in the mass (Gloria in excelsis deo etc^) and the gospel to be
read before the sacrynge / and on Crystmasse day three masses to be song. And
he ordained there should no mass be song before three of the clock. And at
the last he was martred and buried at saint Peter's. Ignius a Greek was pope
four year. This man ordained that a child should have a godfader and a
godmoder at the time of baptysynge / and also one at confyrmacyon. Also that no
Archebysshop / except the pope should condemn his Suffrygan but if the cause
were showed in the prouyncyall counsel of bishops. Then he was martred and
buried at saint Peter's. Anthonius Pius was Emperor xxij. year with his sons
Aurolio and Lucio This man was myghtly wise and naturelly fair of speech / the
which lightly in oo man is not found. Nota. Exceeding men in wisdom comynly
are not fair speched / nor peasfull namely of nature / ne contraryous.
Exceeding men in fair speech comynly are less than wise. This man was meued
with both these proprytees. Therefore many kingdoms the which receded from
other Emperors / wylfully to this man turned again. And to christian men was none
so gentle. He said through the ensample of Cipio. I had lever keep one here of
a man / than slay an hundred of mynenmyes. And some martyrs were made under him
/ but they were made under the commandment of the Emperors before. And the
christian people were so hateful unto the bishops and to the priests of the
Temple of the false gods / that they provoked the princes always against them.
For they supposed that the christian faith should destroy them. Therefore it was
no meruaylle / all though the prince was vnpleased / for they said All there
gods were deuylles / if lower Iuges pursued christian folk and martred them.
This time.x. thousand martyrs were crucified in Armenia / in an high hylle
called Arath. Pompei^s trogus isto tempore histor^as a nino vsque ad octauianum
deduxit.

Anno dm^.C.li^ij.
PIus ytalicus was pope.xi. year and.iiij. months and.xv. days / This man
ordained the feast of Ester ever more should be hallowed on the sunday. And
also an heretyke coming fro the sect of the Jews should be received and
baptized. Then he was martred and buried in saint Peter's. An^cetus was pope
after Pius almoost.x. year this man made many decrees of the Canon and for
bysshopes (Vt in cause Violatores. etc^.) Galienus a leche gotten in Pergamo was
in great fame at Rome The which not alonly expowned the books of Ypocras but
he put many of them to his books. And of this man is said / for his dyscrete
abstynence the which he used / he lived an hundred and.xl. years. He never ete
nor drank his fylle Nota abstinenc^am. He never took raw fruytes. Always he
had a sweet brethe. He deyed all oonly through aege and no sykenesse. Marcus
Anthonius the true / and Lucius Comodus were Emperors.xix. year. These took
the Empire after Anthony the meke / and then began two Emperors to regne but
Lucius Comodus decessed. And Anthony was Emperous alone / the which was a
victoryous man and a noble but that he made the fourth persecuycon to kylle
christian men. This Marcus was of so great sadness and steadfastness that for no
chance he lough never / ne changed no chere / another for gladness ne for
sorrow. And when he was a child / he was of such manhood / that on a
certain tr^^e when he looked his tresourand had (...) that which he might give
his knights and his men when he went to fight against the Germayn^ / the
Sclauons / and Sarmathus / he would hurt ne grieve no body / but had lever to
selle his wives golden vessel and her arayment / her beddynge / and all her
ryall stuff / than take tax of the Senators / or of his prouynce under him.
But he gate the victory of his enmyes / and recovered all again / and released
the prouynces of there trybutes. And those that would selle him his wives
tresour again / he restored them there money / and those that would not / he
never grieved them. But the tables of there dettes betwixt him and them he burnt
openly in the market place and thanked them / that they helped him in his
necessyte.

How king Lucie reigned after his fader / that was a good man / and after he
became christian.
AFter this king Coill reigned Lucie his sone / that was a good man to god and
to all the people. He sent to Rome to Eulentre yt then was pope / and said. He
would become a christian man and receive baptym in the name of god and tome to
the right faith and believe. Eulentre sent two Legates / yt were called Pagan /
an other Elybain in to this land and baptized the king and all his meyne /
And after went from town to town and baptized the people till all the land
was baptized. And this was in the year an hundred.lvi. after the Incarnacyon of
our lord Ihesu christ. And this king Lucie made tho in this land two Arche
bishops / one at Caunterbury / an other at York / and other many bishops y^
yet ben in this land. And when these two Legates had baptized all this land /
they ordained prestes for to baptyse children / and for to make the sacrament /
and after they went again to Rome. And the king dwelled in his land / and
reigned with much honor.xij. year / and after dedye and lies at Gloucestre.

How this land was long without a king / and how the Brytons chose a king.
THis king Lucie had none heir of his body begoten / yt was afterward great
harm and sorrow to the land. For after this king Lucies death / none of the
great lords of the land would suffer an other to be king / but lived in
war and debate among themself.l. year without king. But it befell
afterward yt a great prince came from Rome in to this land that was called
Seuerie / not for to war / but for to save ye right of Rome. But nevertheless
he had not dwelled half a year in this land but that ye Brytons slew him. And
when they of Rome wist that Seueri was so slain / they sent an other great
lord in to this land that was called Allec that was a strong man and a
mighty of body and dwelled in this land long time and did much sorrow to
the Brytons. So that after for pure malice / they chose a king among them
that was called Astelepades. And assembled a great host of Brytons / and went
to London to seek Allec / and there they found him and slew him and al his
fellows. And one that was called Walon deffended him fyersly / and fought long
with the Brytons / but at the last he was dyscomfyted / and the Brytons took
him and bond his hondes and feet and cast him in to a water. Wherefore yt water
was called ever more Walbroke. Tho reigned Astelepades in peace / till one of his
Exles that was called Coill made a fair town against the kings will / and let
call the town Colchestre after his own name. Wherefore the king was full
wroth and thought to destroy him. And began to war upon him and brought great
power of men and yaaf the Earl battle. And the Earl defended him fyersly with
his power and slew the king himself in that battle And tho was Coill crowned
and made king of this land. This Coill reigned and governed the land well and
nobly / for he was a noble man and well beloved among ye Brytons. When tho of
Rome herd that Astelepades was slain / they were wonder glad / and sent an
other great prince of the Romans that was called Constance. And he came to the
king Coill for to challenge the trybute that was wont to be paid to Rome. And
the king answered well and wisely and said / yt he would pay to Rome all that
right and reason would with good will And so they accorded tho with good will and
without any contake. And so both they dwelled together in love. King Coill
yaaf to him his daughter Eleyne for to have her to his spowse / that was both
fair and wise / and good and well lettred. And this Constance spowsed her
there with much honor. And it befell soon after that this king Coill deyed
in the.xiij. year of his regne / and lies at Colchestre entyred.

Of king Constance that was a Romayne / that was chosen king after the death
of Coill / for as much that he had spowsed Eleyne that was king Coils
daughter.
AFter this king Coill Constance was made king and crowned / for almoche as he
had spowsed king Coils daughter yt was heir of yt land. The which Constance
reigned well and worthily governed the land. And he begat on his wife Eleyne a
sone yt was called Constantyne. And this king bare true faith And truly did
unto them of Rome all his life. And when he had reigned.xv. year / he deyed and
lies at York.

How Constantyne that was king Constance sone / and the sone of Saint Eleyne
governed and ruled the land / and was Emperor of Rome.
AFter king Constance death reigned Constantyne his sone and the sone of saint
Eleyne y^ found the holy cross in the holy land. And how Constantyne became
Emperor of Rome. It befell so in y^ time there was an Emperor at Rome yt was
a Sarrasyn and a tyrant / that was called Ma^ence / that put to death all yt
byleued in god / and destroyed holy church by all his power and slew all
Christian men that he might find And among all other he let martyr Saint
Katheryne. And many other christian people that had dread of death fled and
came in to this land to king Constantyne. and told him of the sorrow that
Maxence did to the Crystyanytee Wherefore Constantyne had pity / and made great
sorrow / and assembled a great host and a great power / and went over unto
Rome / and there took the cite and slew all that there was in that were of
mysbyleue that he might there find / And tho was he made Emperor and was a
good man and governed him so well that all lands to him were attendaunt for to
be under his governance And this devil and tyraun Marence that time was in
the land of Greece and herd these tidings and suddenly became wood / and
suddenly he deyed and so he ended his life. When Constantyne went from this
land unto Rome / he took with him his mother Eleyne / for the much wisdom
that she could / and three other great lords that be most loved / that one was
called Hoell an an other was called Taberne / and the third Morhin. And took
all his land to keep unto the Earl of Comewayle that was called Octauian. And
so anon as this Octauian wyste that his lord dwelled at Rome. Incontinent he
seized all the land in to his hand / and therewith did all his will among
high and low / and they held him for king. When these tidings came to
Constantyne the Emperor / he was wonder wroth toward the earl Octauian. And
sent Taberne with.xij. M. men for to destroy the earl for his falsenesse. And
they arrived at Portesmouth. And when Octauian wist that he assembled a great
power of Brytons and dyscomfyted Taberne / and Taberne fled thens in to
Scotlonde. and ordained there a great power / and came again in to this land an
other time to give battle to Octauyan. When Octauian herd that / he assembled
a great power and came again toward Taberne as much as he might / so that
those two hosts met togyders upon Stanesmore / and strongely smote together
and tho was Octauian dyscomfyted / and ^ledde thens unto Norwaye. And and
aberne seassed all y^ land in his hand / towns and castelles / and as much
as they there had. And syn Octauian came again from Norway with a great power and
seized all the land in his hand and drove out all the Romans / and was tho
made king and reigned.

How Marimian that was the Emperors cosyn of Rome spowsed Octauians daughter /
and was made king of this land.
THis Octauian governed the land well and nobly but he had none hey^^ ^aue a
daughter that was a young child that he loved as much as his life And for as
much as he wexed syke and was in point of death / and might no longer regne /
he would have made one of his neuewes to have be king / the which was a noble
knight and a strong man that was called Conan Meriedok / and he should have
kept the kings daughter and have married her when time had been. But the lords
of the land would not suffer it / but yaaf her counsel to be married to some
high man of great honor / and then might she have all her lust / and the
counsel of the Emperor Constantyne her lord. And at this counsel they
accorded / and those tho Cador of Cornewaylle for to go to the Emperor for to
do this message. And he took ye way and went to Rome / and told the Emperor
this tidings well and wisely. And the Emperor sent in to this land with hy^
his own cosyn y^ was his uncles sone a noble knight and a strong / that was
called Maximian. And he spowsed Octauians daughter / and was crowned king of
this land.

How Maximian yt was themperours cosyn / conquereed the land of Armorycam /
and yaaf it to Conan Meriedok.
THis king Maximian became so ryall that he thought to conquer the land of
Armorycam / for the great richesse yt he herd tell yt was in that land / so
y^ he ne left man yt was of worthynes / knight / squyre / ne none other man /
that he ne took with him to the great damage to all the land. For he left at
home behind him no man to keep the land / but took them with hy^ fro this
land.xxx. thousand knights that were doughty men's bodies / and went over
to the land of Armorycam and there slew the king that was called Imball /
and conquered all the land And when he had so done / he called Conan and said.
For as much as king Octauian made you king of Brytayne / and through me ye
were let and dystroubled that ye were not king. I give you this land of
Armorycam / and you thereof make king. And for as much as ye be a Bryton. I
will that this land have the same name / and no more be called Armorycam / but
be called Brytayne. And the land from whens we be comen shall be called much
Brytayne. And so shall men know that one Brytaytayne fro that other. Conan
Meridok thanked him greetly / and so was he made king of little Brytayn. And
when all this was done. Maximiam went from thens unto Rome / and tho was made
Emperor after Constantyne. And Conan dwelled still in little Brytayn with much
honor / and there let ordeyne.ij. thousand ploughmen of ye land for to
culture the land to harowe it / and for to sow it / and feffed them rychely
after yt they were. And for asmoche as king Conan and none of his knights / ne
none of his other people would not take wives of ye nation of France / he tho
sent in to great Brytayne to the Earl of Cornewayle y^ men called Dionothe /
y^ he should chese thorugh out all this land.xi.M. of maidens. That is to
say.viij.M. for the mean people / and.iij.M. for the gretest lords that
should them spouse. And when Dionoth understood this / he made a commandment
thorughout all the land of Brytayn. And as many as the nombre came to he
assemblid together of maidens / for there was no man y^ durst withstand his
commandments / for as much that all the land was take him to ward and keep
/ to do all thing that hy^ good lyked. And when these maidens were assembled
/ he let them come before him at London. And let ordeyne for them ships
hastily / and as much as them neded to that vyage. And took his own daughter
that was called vrsula / that was the fairest creature that any man wist. And
he would have sent her to king Conan / that should have spoused her and made
her queen of the land But she had made pryuely to god a vow of chastyte /
that her fader not wist / ne none other man else that was living upon earth.

How Vrsula and.xi. thousand maidens that were in her company went toward
little Brytayne / and all they were martred at Coleyne.
THis Vrsula chose unto her company.xi. thousand maidens / y^ of all other she
was lady and maystresse / And all they went to ship at one time in the water
y^ is called Tamyse / and commanded her kynne and her friends to almighty god
/ and saylled toward little Brytayn. But when they were come in to the high
see / a strong tempest arose as it was gods will / and Vrsula with her
ships and her company were drive to Hundlonde through tempest and arrived in
the haven of the cite of Coleyne And the king of the land that was called
Gowan / was tho in the cite. And when he wist the tidings that so ma ny fair
maidens were there arrived. He took Elga his brother and other of his household
with him and went to the ships to se^ y^ fair company. And when he saw them
so fair / he and his company would have ouerlayne them and sake fro them there
maydenhode. But Vrsula that good maid / cou^seylled / prayed / warned / and
taught them that were her fellows y^ they should defend them with all their
might / and rather suffer death than suffer there body to be defor / led. So that
all tho maidens became so steadfast in god / that they defended them through his
grace / so that none of them had power to do them shame. Wherefore the king
Gowan was sore ano^ed that he for wrath slew them eueryone anon right / and
so were all tho maidens martred for the love of god / and lies at Coleyne.

How king Gowan came for to destroy this land / and how a man of great power
that was called Gracian deffended the land.
AS all this was done king Gowan that was a Sarrasyn called his brother Elga
and said to him / that he should goo conquer the land that all those fair
maidens were borne in. And he ordened tho a great power of Pehites / of
Denmark / of Orkenay / and of Norway And they came in to this land / and
burnt towns and slew folk / and cast a down chirches and houses / and
robbed all the land in length and bread / and put to death all tho that would
not forsake the right believe and crystendome / for as much as there was no
sovereign y^ might them help. For the king Maximian had take with him all the
worthy men when he went to conquer little Brytayne And in the same time that
ye here now tell was Saint Albon martryd through the wood tyrau^t Dyoclesian /
in the same place where is now an abbaye made of saint Albon whiles y^ he was a
paynym. But he converted hy^ to god through the predicaco^n of a clerk and a
wise man y^ was called Ancyble / that was herbourghed a night in his house. And
this was after thyncarnacyon of Ihesu Christ.ij. hundred.xxvi. year. And men
shall understand y^ saint Albon suffered his martyrdom before y^ saint Edmonde
was martryd / and therefore is saint Albon called the first martyr of England
This Gowans brother and his folk that were sarrasyns went through y^ land and
destroyed all thing that they found / and no thing they spared. When these
tidings came to Rome how y^ king Gowan had begone for to destroy this land /
the Emperor of Rome sent a strong man and of great power y^ was called
Gracian with.xxiiij.M. well fighting men / for to cast out those sarrasyns of
this land. And all they arrived at Portesmouth. Maximian might not come
hy^self / for as much as he was chosen Emperor after the death of Constantyne
that was saint Eleynes sone. when this Gracian was arrived with his host / he
let aspye pryucly where king Gowan might be found. And he set upon them
suddenly as they lay in their beds / and dyscomfyted him and slew them in
there beds euerychone / that none of them escaped / sauf Gowan that fled in
to his own country with much sorrow and great pain. So oneafter it befelle
that Maximian was slain at Rome through treason. And when Gracian wist that
tidings he let crown him king of this land.

How Gracian made hy^ king when Maximian was slain / and afterward y^
Brytons slew hy^ for his wickedness.
THis Gracian when he began to regne / he became so wicked and so stern / and
so much sorrow did to the Brytons y^ they slew hy^ among them Tho when
king Gowan understood y^ Gracian was slain and done to death he assembled a
great power and came again in to this land. And if he had first done harm tho
did he much more. For tho destroyed he all this land / and the christian
people y^ were in much Brytayne / so that no man was so hardy for to name god
/ and he that so did anon he was put to strange death. But the bishop of
London that was tho y^ was called Gosselim escaped / and went thens to them of
Rome to seek socour / to help to destroy the sarrasyns y^ had destroyed this
land. And y^ Romans said / that they had been so often enoyed for there
sendynge people in Brytayne / all for to help the Brytons / and they would
no more so do / and so the Bishop Gosselin went thens without any secour or
help. And tho went he to the king of little Brytayne y^ was called Aldroye /
and this was the third king after Gowan Meryedok / as before is said. The
bishop prayed this Aldroye of help and socoure / and the king had pity in
his heart when he herd how the bishop fled / and how that the christian men
were so slain in great Brytayne through y^ paynyms and sarrasyns / he granted
him Constantyn his brother him for to help with power of folk. And then did
arraye horse / armor and ships / and all things y^ neded to y^ vyage. And
when all thing was ready / he called the bishop / and to him said I take you
here Constantyne my brother upon this covenant. That if god give him grace the
paynems and the sarrasyns to destroy / y^ ye then make him king. And the
bishop granted with good will. Constantyne and the bishop took leave of the
king Aldroye and betoke him to god / and took there men.xij. thousand and
went to there ships / and saylled toward great Brytayne and arrived at
Totnesse. When the Brytons herd these tidings y^ to them came socour / they
were strongely helped / and ordained them anhuge nombre of people and came to
them and received them with much honor. Gowan anon as he wist of these
tidings / he assembled all the Sarrasyns and came against them and yaue them
battle. And Constantyne slew hy^ with his own hondes. And all those other
Sarrasyns were dyscomfyted and slain y^ none of them escaped / but those that
were converted unto almighty god.

How Constantyne yt was the kings brother of little Brytayne was crowned king
of great Brytayune / for his great virtue and his great worthynesse.
Anon after the battle they went to London and crowned there Constantyne and
made him king of this land. And the bishop Gosselyn set y^ crown on his
heed and anointed him / as it befalls for a king to be. And tho began
crystendome again in this land / And anon this king Constantyne as he was
crowned. anon after he spowsid his wife through counsel of the Brytons And he
begat three sons on her. The first was called Constance / and y^ other
Aurilambros / and the third Vter. This Constance the elder brother / when he
ca ma to aege / he made him a monk at Wyncestre. This Constantyne there fader
through treason was slain. For it befell on a time / that a Pehite came to hy^
upon a day in message as it were. And said that he would speak with foe king
pryuely in counsel. The king let void his chamber of the men y^ were there
within / and there abode no moo but the king and the Pehite. And he made a
cou^ tenaunce as though he would have spoken with the king in his eere. And
there he slew him with a long knyf. And after that he went meruaylously out
of the chamber in to an other chamre so at the last no man wist where he was
become. When the kings men west that their lord was so deed they made then so
much sorrow that they wist not what to do. For as much as his two sons
Aurilambros and Vter were so young / that they might not be king / and the
third was a monk as is said before. But Vortiger that was Earl of Westsex
thought pryuely in his heart through queyntaunce for to be king him self. And
went to Wynchestre where that Constance was monk / and said unto him.
Constance said he your fader is deed and your two brethern that been with
Gosselyn the bysshopp of London to nourysshe be so young / that none of them
may be bynge. Wherefore I counsel you / that ye forsake your habyte and come
with me. And I shall make such a mean unto the Brytons that ye shall be made
king.

Of Constance that was king Constantynes sone / that was a monk at
Wynchestre / and how he was made king after his faders death thorugh counseyll
of Vortiger that was earl of Westsex / for as much as Aurilambros and Vter his
two brethern were but young of aege. And Vortiger let slay him for to be king
himself.
THis Vortiger cou^selled this Constance so much / till he forsook his abbot
and went with him. And anon after he was crowned king by thassent of the
Brytons. This king Constance when he was crowned and made king / he wist ne
knew but little of y^ world ne could nothing what knyghthode axed. And he
made Vortiger his chyef master and cou^seyller / and gaaf him all his power /
for to ordeyne and do as much as to the reame aperteyned. So that himself
nothing entremedled / but oonly bare the name of king. When Vortiger saw
that he had all the land in his ward and gouernall / he thought a preuy
treason to slay Constance the king / that he might himself be crowned and made
king and regne. And let send after an hundred knights of Pehites / the
worthyest of all the land / and them held with him for to dwell / as to be
kepers of his body / as he would go thorugh the land to ordeyne things that
apperteyned to a king. And this Vortiger honored so much the hundred knights
and so much yaue them of gold and silver / and so rich Iewelles / robes /
horses / and other things plentee / wherefore they held hy^ more lord than
they did the king. And Vortiger told them / if he might be king / ye as it
were through treason / he would make them rychest of the land. So at the last
through great gifts y^ he had given largely / they cried through y^ court that
Vortiger were better worthy to be king than Constance. Wherefore Vortiger made
semblaunt as he had been wroth. And he departed thens from the court / and
said he must go else where for things that he had to do. And so the
traitor said for by cause that they should slay him / that is to say
Constance. Whad this Vortiger was gone / it befell soon after / that tho
hundred knights of Pehites brake the doors of y^ kings chamber and there
they him slew / and smote of his heed and bare it to Vortiger there that he
dwelled. And so when Vortiger saw that heed / he wept full tenderly with his
eyes / and nevertheless he was somdeale glad in his heart of his death. And
anon this Vortiger took those hundred knights of Pehites / and badde his
servants bind their hondes behind them / and ladde them to London / and
there they were dampened unto death as falls traitors. And anon after all the
Brytons of the land by the common assente crowned Vortiger and made him king
of the land.

Anno dm^.C.lxxiiij.
SOther a martyr was pope after Anicetu^.ix. year y^ which decreed that a
No^ne tholde not touch the palle of y^ awter / nor put in sense thereto. And y^
she should were a wymple about her heed. And many perils he saw about
matrymony. Therefore he ordained y^ no woman should be called a leful wife / but
if she were blessed of the priest. Elentherus a martyr was pope after Sother
xv. year / the which ordained y^ christian men should refuse no meet reasonable
y^ was man's mete (Nota) Also that no man vnaccused in a crime / should be put
from his dygnytee or degree till he were conuycted / thorugh ensample of Christ
the which kept still Judas Scaryoth not accused / and Christ knew him gylty.
And what someuer he did among the apostles for the dygnyte of his service
abode ferme and stable. And he sent also Legates unto Lucie the king of
Brytayne / the which baptized him and his people. And Fagus and Domianus
legates / the which the pope sent first / preched in England / and this
crystendome dured in Brytayne two hundred year / unto the time of Dyodesian the
Emperor when saint Albon was martred. Marcus Anthonius / and Lucius Comodus
were Emperors / but Marcus ^eyed anon / and Lucius Comodus reigned. Comodus
was called prouffytable of scorn / for he was to every man vnprouffytable. He
was yeuen utterly to lechery. Many Senators and Christian men he made to be
slain. He dampened his own wife to death for aege. He deyed a sodeyne death with
struglynge among maidens. Helius Pertinax after this man was Emperor.vi.
months / and was a man of great discrecyon / whom Julian the great lawer
slew. And he entered the Empire / and was slain the.vij. monethe of Seuerus.
Victor a martyr was pope after Elenthertu^.x. year. And for the dyscorde of the
paschall time he called a counsel in Alexander / where he was prescute that
time / and many other / Where he decreed that Eester day should be kept on the
Sunday / but he must keep the change of the moon of Apryll and that was to
dyfferre fro Jews / for many bishops of the rest abode that time / the same
day that the yewes did halowe that feast. Also he ordained y^ in the time of
need / childern might be crystened in every place / and in every water.
Zepherinus a martyr and a Romayne was pope after Victor.ix. year. This man
ordained that Christian people of xij. year of aege and above / should receive
his god on Eester day ones oo year. Also he ordained that all the vessels of
the awter should be glasseor tynne / and not tree / as in old time the
consecracion of the gloryons blood was made in tree vessel. And this time past
/ and the worship of the church grew / and glasen vessel were forhode (Vt
patet de conse. de pri. ca.) Origenes the noble clerk was this time / and he
wrote so much / that saint Ierom said I have read of Origenes wer^es.^^s
iiij. thousand volumes without pyscles. He translated the Bible from Hebrewe
in to Greek / and did many other great things. And of this Origenes /
Sampson. Solomon / and Tratan / is a great questyon among doctors if that
they ben dampened or saved. Therefore those things y^ without peril we ben not
bound to know / nor y^ church is not certifyed of them. And therefore let
them be alonly committed unto god. Cali^us a martyr and a Romayne was pope
after Zepherinus.v. year / and he ordained the Cimiteri (in via apia) where
many a thou sand martyr is buried. Also he ordained the feast of the Emerynge
days to be kept. Anthonius Aurelius was Emperor.iij. year. And this man
lacked no kind of lechery / and at the last he was slain among a great
multitude of people / for his myscheuous lyurnge. Anthonius Marcus reigned after
him.vij. year. This man lived bostynatly (...) therefore he was slain as was
his predecessor. Alisander was Emperor after Anthonius and reigned.xiij. year.
This man at the Instaunce of his mother a christian woman and the techynge of
Origenes the which came to Rome to co^^trte her / was made so good unto
christian men y^ he suffered them to have there cou^seylles and their prayers by
themself / but nevertheless in this time the cursyd off years of him made many
martyrs.

Anno dm^. CC.xliiij.
TRbanus was pope after Cali^^us.viij. year / and old and young he was very
virtuous. And all the hallowed vessels of the church he made of gold or
silver. This man left his popechede and went to Agrippa and.xi. thousand
virgyns with him. And the clergy said he left not his dygnytee for holiness /
but for appetyte of tho virgyns / and waste him not in the book of popes. And
there he a virgyn was martred with those virgyns. Poncianus a martyr succeeded
Vrbanus. And he ordained y^ psalms should be said day and night in the
church of god. And that a priest should say Confiteor before the mass.
Anteros a martyr was pope after this man / this man ordained y^ a bishop might
be remeued from one unto an other. And he made the life of martyrs to be
written. And he was slain and buried in the Cimitery of saint Calixt.
Maximianus was chosen Emperor at Maguncia of the host / and not by the
Senators / and reigned three year / and destroyed the church myghtely / and was
slain for Origene Gordian reigned after him.vi. year and of him is little
written / but he was slain (Hijs diebus Celus dux Colchestrie in asclepto
regnat in brita^nia a^nts quasi. xxx. vsque ad aduentu^ Constancij. Lati M
vacat) Phylyp was Emperor after him / and this Phylyp chose to him Phylyp his
sone / and they reigned.xvij. year / and were the first Emperors y^ were
crystened / and after slain of the host / They bequeued all there tresour in
there death / that it should be disposed to poor men. And saint Laurence at the
assygnacyon of his master the pope / departed this tresour about Rome / the
which was great cause of his martyrdom (Vt quide^ dicu^t) Decius was Emperor
three year / and in all things a tyrau^t. For he entered thempyre when he and
the host had slain the two Philyppes his lords and after y^ he was slain
with his sone. Fabianus a martyr and a Romayne was pope after Anteros.xij. year
/ this was a very holy man. For when Christian men stood to abide the eleccyon of
the pope / suddenly a white douue or a culuour descended on his heed / saying
unto him / thou shall be pope of Rome. This man ordained every year y^ Creme
should be hallowed upon Sherethursdaye. Also he divided regyons to deakens / the
which should write the life of martyrs. And at the last Decius slew him.
Cornethus a martyr and Romayne was pope after Fabianus.iij. year. This man took
up the bodies of Peter and Poul / and with great honor put them in worshypfull
places with beata Lucina. Lucius was pope after Cornelius three year / and of him
little is written. Gallus with his sone Volucianus were Emperors two year / and
they fought with Emilianus / and were slain And Emilianus the third month
was slain. Valerian was Emperor with his sone Galyene.xv. year. This man was
virtuous and manly in the beginning / but after was given to vice / and much
wretchedness. And so was his sone Galiene. This Valerian went unto y^ land
of Perse. And therefore the great blood of martyrs which he had shed was
taken of the king of Perse. And when he had take him / he put out both his
eyes and kept him in great bondage. And to this entente he kept him / that
when so ever he should ride / this Valerian should lie down / and he should
set his feet upon his back when he would take his horse. This herd Galiene
his ^one y^ was left at Rome. And that caused him that he was not so cruel
against Christian men. And here was the.viij. persecucyon of the church made by
the Emperor. And made the Romans to lose there kingdoms / the which were
never recovered again to the Emperor / And general pestylence was through out
all the world for there trespass. Stephanus a martyr after Lucius was
pope.iij. year / this man ordained y^ no man should use none hallowed clothes
but to the worship of god. Sixtus a martyr and a Romayne was pope after
Stephanus two year. This man ordained that the mass should be said upon an

victory in every place gloryously. And when he was desceyued by cursyd men /
and pursewed christian men myghtly / and namely in France / for there he abode /
and after that he had never good fortune. But was slain. And this was the
nynth persecucyon of the church and christian faith / Tacitus was Emperor after

Dyoclesian and Maximian came after these three Emperors / tho one reigned in the
Eest / and the other in the Weste. The first thing that Dyoclesian did / he
burnt all the christian men's books that might be found. The two tyrauntes
did more harm to Christian men than ever did any other. For.x. year lasted the
persecucyon. And as we read / within.xxx. days.xx. thousand men were slain

and suffered the pain of death for the faith of the church of god. His body
lay unburied three days for dread of the curse of god. And after thorugh
auysyon of saint Peter and Marcell / he was buried at saint Peter's foot.
Marcellus was pope after Marcellmus.v. year. This man ordained that a general
counseyll might not be ordained without the auctoryte of the pope (Vt pz.xvij.
di. c. sinodu^) Also he chose.xv. Cardynalles in the cite to burye christian men.
At the last when he hades kept beestes long time in a house closed in with
them by the commandment of Maximian / be deyed for fault. Eusebius a martyr
was after this man two months and certain days. This man of a lay man was
made pope / and he ordained that no lay man should accuse his bishop but if
he went fro his faith (vt pz.ij. ix. vij. c. la^cos) Nota. This time saint
Albon was martred in Brytayne. This Albon when he was a pagan / he lodged a
certain man / the which converted him to the faith / and after was Iuged unto
death. And much people he turned unto our lord / that were nygh the water /
the which he made dry through his praeyr. And he suffered death nygh the cite of
Verelom (Vide plura in vita sancti Albam) Melchiades a martyr succeeded
Eusebius.iiij. year. This man forbode that men should fast ou Sunday or on
Thursdaye in so much as paganes fast on those days. At the last he was
martred as all his predecessors were. And understand ye that there
were.xxxiij. popes of Rome martred each one after other. Peter was the first /
and this Melchiades was the last. And then it was laudable after Gregory / a
man to desire a bysshopryche. Galerus was Emperor after Dyoclesian two year /
and an other with him called Constancius. So was the Empire in those days
divided. This Constancius after he had conquered all spain / he came in to
great Brytayne / and there he wedded a kings daughter on whom he gate great
Constantyne. And this same Constancius deyed in Brytayne / and lies at York /
as Martyne says in his Chronicles / and left on live Constantyne that was
gotten on Eleyne / and was king of Brytayne and of France.

SIluester was pope after Melchiades. This was a glorious Confessor / and many
ways he worshyped the church of god / what in writing / what in miracles. He
received the patrimony of saint Peter. That is for to say / the kingdom of
Ytalye with the cite of Rome / of Constantynople the Emperor / and to the
worship of the hole universal church of god he turned it. He baptized Eleyne
and the Jews / and then he decessyd an holy Confessor. Constantyne the
mighty was Emperor this time. This Constantyne was a glorious man and a
victoryous in bataylle. In gouernynge of the common people he was very wise. And
in the necessyte of the believe he was without compayre. Devout. His pity and
his holiness ben so written in the books of holy doctors / that without doube /
he is to be nombred among Saints. And the Greeks say / that in the end of
his life he was made a monk. And more ye may here of him in the Chronicles of
England. For he was king in England. Helena the queen mother to Constantyne
repaired again the holy Cross this time. And she made.ixx. Colleges / and she
glorified the state of all holy church. Nicholas bishop of Myrree seete an
holy man was this time. Athanasius was this time bishop in Alexandre a
glorious doctor / made the (symbalum Quicunque vult saluus esse. and^.) Marcus
was pope after Siluestes two year and.viij. months / this man ordained ye
Creed should be openly song in the church. And y^ the bishop of Hostience
should consecrate the pope / and y^ he should were a palle / Julius was pope
after Marcus.xi. year / this man was exiled.x. year / and after suffered death
under Constantyne y^ second. Constantinus with his two brethern reigned.xxiiij.
year. And in his last end he was perverted by the heresye of the Ariens by a
bishop called Eusebi. And he pursued the church of god strongely. The end of
this man was this. As he should god to Constantynople unto a great counsel /
in the which counsel he thought to have condemned the bishop and the
clerks of true believe / he went before unto a chamber to avoid such things
as nature required / and anon suddenly his bowels fell from him / and thereby
was deed as ye now here. Liberius was pope after Julius.xix. year and.vij.
months. Then was the second dyscorde of ye church between Liberius and
Felix / for the heresye of y^ Ariens the which favored Liberius. Then
Constancius the emperor called again Liberius from his exile / by cause he
favored this heresye. And the church deieced Liberius and took Felix for pope
/ and the other was expulsed as an heretyke of the church. But Felix obtained
not / for the Emperor put in Liberius and expulsed Felix. Felix was pope after
the death of this Liberius. And he declared Constancius the Emperor an
heretyke / and anon after he was martred. And here was the first that ever the
church of Rome had an Infamed pope. For all the predecessors of this
Libertus were saints and yaue holy ensamples. Iulianus Apostata was after
Constancius Emperor two year and.viij. months / He was called Apostata / for
he fled this Constancius / which slew his brother. And for fere of death was
made a christian man and a monk. But afterward by the counsel of Nygromancers
/ he asked y^ devil whether he should be Emperor or not. The devil said that
he should be Emperor upon a condicyon that he should forsake his christian faith
and be viter enmye to christian men. And so he did. For he yaue leave to the
Jews that they should build again the Temple in spyte of the christian men. And
he took all the goods that christian man had and destroyed many of them.
Iominianus was Emperor after him.viij. months. For when Iulianus was deed
the host chose him Emperor. And he was a christian man. And he said it was not
leyffull to a christian man to be lord over so many hethen people. They answered
and said. Rather than he should forsake the Empire they would he crystened. And
thus took he the dygnyter. But soon he was deed / and in a meruayllous manner.
For he was laid in a close house after his Iourneye made all of stone / newely
whyted with lyme / in the which they made to his comfort as they thought a
fire of char^oole. And of the air of these two in the morrow he was found
deed. Valentinian with his brother Valent was Emperor after. Iominianus.xi.
year. For he departed the Empire / and gave his brother the eest / and kept
himself the west part / This Valentinian was a lord with Iulianus Apostata.
And it happed him on a time for to goo in a Temple of false gods for to do
sacrifyce. And mynystres stood there with water hallowed after the gyse with the
which they shynkled the lords. This Valentinian smote the mynyster that cast
the water upon him and said. He was rather defoyled by it than cleansed. For
this Iulianus did exile him. But our lord god for his open confession of his
name rewarded him with the Empire. His brother Valent fell in to the opinion of
the Ariens and deyed in that heresye. This same Valent lived four year after
Valentinian with Gracian the emperor. This time lived saint Ambrose.

Anno dm^. CCC.xliiij.
DAmacius was pope after Felix xviij. year and two months / this was an
eloquent man in meter. And he wrote many stories of popes and martyrs He
ordained that Gloria patri should he said in ye ends of the psalms. And that
was at the prayer of saint Ierom. And through the mocyon of this pope Jerome
translated the Bible from Hebrewe in to Latin / and then he decssed a
confessor. Valens with Gracian and Valentinian were Emperors four year / In
this time were chirches opened again and christian men had leave to renew the
service of god that was defended before with Emperors enfected with heresye as
was Valens and other / wherefore ye church had no lyberte when Valens was on
live. A Synodus of a hundred and.l. bishops were gadred under Damasius pope at
Constantynope against Macedonium an heretyke / the which denied the holy ghost
to be very god. And then^e was the Creed made / that is song on holy days in
the church. Augustinus a Cartaginen^ of Africa was this time He was as noble
a Rethoricien as might be. And in all phylosophye and poetrye incomparable.
And all thing that any philosopher found in his yougth / he understood with
little labor. And about this time he was sent to Mediolanum where he was
turned anon of saint Ambrose and baptized. This man grew unto a noble doctor
of ye church. And not long after that he was bishop of Yponen^. And there he
lived.liij. year / and much dyuynyte he wrote (vt patet in librissuis)
Siritius was pope after Damasius. xv. year / he dampened heretykes / and little
else is written of him. Thodosius sone to Gracian with Valentyne his uncle were
Emperors.xxvij. year / This man was a christian man and gracyous / and in
governance like to Traianus / soon wroth and anon reconsyled. This man on a
day when he would have gone to have herd mass / saint Ambrose forbadde him
the entree of the church / till he had penance and made satysfaccyon for the
sleenge of.xxx. knights the which he slew in anger at Constantynople.
Wherefore they made a law that the sentence of a prince should be deferred.
xxx. days of those y^ should do execusyon if they might fall in the grace of
the prince within the.xxx. days. About this time was a child borne in the
castle of Emons / from the nauyll and above divided in two bodies / having
two heedes and two wits / so that the one slepynge or etynge / the other
slepte not ne ete not. And when they were two year of aege / the one decessyd /
and the other lived three days after. Claudius poeta was this time. Arcadius
and Honorius reigned.xxx. year. And in their time Rome was nere destroyed by a
king called Alaticus. Of y^ which destruccyon rose a great blasphemye of the
Romans. For they said they fared never well sythen Christ came to Rome / and
bereued them there goods by the prechyng of Peter and Poul. And yet this
Arcadius subdued all his enmyes by the power of god / and shed no blood.
Against this blasphemye saint Austyn made y^ solemn work / the which they
call (de ciuitate dei) Honorius was Emperor with Theodosius his broders
sone.xv. year and he was a man of holy life. For two wives he had / and yet with
both he deyed maiden. He loved specially the church and hated heretykes.
Ierom deyed this time at Bethleem the year of his aege.lxxxi. Sanctus Heracides
the which wrote Vitas patru^ to lapsu^ episcopu^ was this time. Johannes
Crysostomus was exiled of Endochia the wife of Arcadius / and through heete of
the son he was deed Anastasius was pope after Siritius three year. This man
ordained that every man should stand at the redynge of the holy gospel. And
that he that was a maimed man should not be priest. Innocencius was pope after
Anastasius / this man ordained that syke men should be anointed with holy oil.
And at mass the kiss of peace to be yeuen / And he dampened Pelagyen an
heretyke and many other things did (vt patet.xxvi. q. i.)

Anno dm^.CCCC.xiiij.
ZOzimus was pope after Innocencius two year and.viij. months This man
ordained that clerks shalde be no tauerners ne selle no wine / and that a
bound man should be made no priest without the license of his lord.
Bonifacius a Romayne was pope after Zozimus four year. This man ordained that
a woman should not touch the palle of the awter ne should not was she the
awter. Celestinus a Romayne was pope after Bonifacius.viij. year and ix. days
/ the which ordained the psalm before mass (Iudica me deus. etc^.) And at
the beginning of the mass should be said a verse of a psalm / and at the
Grayle / and that the Offertorye should be said before the sacrynge. This same
man sent saint Patryke to Irlonde to convert that land / and Palladius
deaken of Rome to the Scotts to be converted. And in the fourth year of this
man there was a general Synody at Ephysina of three hundred bishops against
Nestorium an heretyke. Theodosius the younger with Valentinian his neuewe
reigned.xxvij. year. In his time was the feast ordained / which is called
Aduincula sancti petri. And in his time deyed saint Austyn / in the year of his
aege.lxxvi. And this time was raised the.vij. slepers / the which sleped two
hundred years. This man deyed at Consta^tynople and there was buried. This time
the Saxons entered England / and anon by little and little they grew up
myghtely. And at the last they opteyned all the land. Sixtus a Romayne was
pope after Celestinus.viij. year. This was a holy man and a meke And little of
him is written but that he builded Sancta Maria mayor. Leo Tuscus a Confessor
was pope after Sixtus. This man was as holy as any man. Five times in a day or
more he would say mass. And on a time after it befell when a certain woman
kyssed his hand / he was tempted with her / And for the trespaas that he had
done / unto his penance he made his hand to be stryken of. And when the noise
rose upon him that he might not say mass as he was wont to do / then he
was right sorry. And all oonly betoke him in prayer to our lady to help him And
our lady restored him his hand again and then he said mass as he was wont
for to do. And so that myrade was openly showed to all people. And in the
time of this pope. Marcian the Emperor being there / was congregate at
Calcedany the fourth universal Synody of.vi. hundred and.xxx. bishops
against Eusticem the abbot of Constantynopoliton and (Alterandruen episcopu^.
qui negauerunt in rp^o ve^am carnem fuisse. et etiam negabant carnis nostre
resurrectionem) And after he had made many notable sermons and epystles he
decessed. Marcianus and Valentinianus were Emperors this time. vij. year. In
whose time was the great Synody before reherced / when Eusticem and Dyoscorus
were condemned.

IN the time that Marcianus was Emperor Vortiger was king in Brytayne now
called England. In whose time the Sarons came in to Brytayne and made many
kings. That is to wit as is plain by the Chronicles.vij. And by cause it is
tedyous to man's reason to reherce many diverse names together / as.vij. kings
of England and in one time / the Emperors and Popes. Therefore the Chronicles
of England shall be set together / till that we shall treat of Alured. In
whose time the Danes came in to England. And the Popes and the Emperors and
other kings in the same time shall be set together.

Circa annu^ dm^. CCCC.xlix.
How the wardeyns that had those childern to keep that were Constantynes ladde
them to little Brytayne / for the treason and the falsenesse of Vortiger.


THis time came the Saxons that were pagans first in to Brytayne now called
England under Vortiger the which was crowned king of this land. This time
those that had these two childern in keeping the which were Constantynes sons.
That is to say Aurilambros and Vter / through ordynance of Gosselin y^ was
bishop of London after the faders death / that is to say Constantyne / durst
not dwell in this land with those childern / but conveyed them unto the king
of little Brytayn For as much as he tho wist the treason of Vortiger / that
tho was made king. Thorugh whom Constance the elder brother was slain /
wherefore the hundred knights of Pehites were put to death and bore all the
blame / as y^ Vortiger had not wist thereof ne consented. And so the kepers of
those two childern / dradde lest Vortiger should put them to death through his
treason and falsenesse / as he had done the brother before. And therefore they
were ladde over in to little Brytayn / and the king them received with much
honor and let them to nourysshe. And there they dwelled till they became
fay^^ knights and strong and fyers. And thought to be avenged upon Constance
their brother when they saw their time / and so they did as ye shall here
tell afterward. It was not long afterward that the tidings came over see
to the kynrede of the hundred knights of Pehite^ that were dampened and put to
death through Vortiger in this land / therefore they were wonderly wroth and
swore that they would be avenged of their kynnes men's death. And came in to this
land with a great power / and robbed in many places / and slew and did all
the sorrow that they might. When Vortiger it wist / he made much sorrow and
was sore anoyed / And in an other place also tidings came to him / that
Aurtlambros and Vter his brother assembled a great host to come into much
Brytayne / that is to say in to this land / for to be avenged upon Constance
their brothers death. So in that one half and in that other / he was brought in
to so much sorrow that he ne wist whether to go.

How Engist and an.xi. thousand men came in to this land / to whom Vortiger
yaa^e a place that is called Thongcastell.
ANd soon after this sorrow / tidings came to Vortiger that a great navy of
strangers were arrived in y^ country of Kent / he wist not whens they were ne
wherefore they were come in to this land. The king sent anon a messager thither
/ that some of them should come and speak with him / for to wit what folk
they were and what they axed / and in to what country they would / There were
two brethern masters and princes of that strong company / that one was called
Engist and yt other Horn. Engist went to the king and told him the cause
wherefore they were come in to this land and said. Sir we ben of a country yt
is called Saxony / that is the land of Germayne / wherein is so much sorrow /
y^ of the people ben so many that the land may not them sustain. And the
masters and princes that have the land to govern and rule. They made to come
before them men and wymmen that boldest ben among them for to fight / and
that best may trauayll in to diverse lands. And so they should them give horse
and harneys / armor / and all thing that them needs And after they shall
say to them / that they go in to another country where that they mow live /
as their Auncetrees did them before. And therefore sir king / if ye have ought
to do with our company / we ben comen in to your land / and with good will you
would serve and your land keep help and defend from your enmyes if that ye
need. When Vortiger herd these tidings / he said gladly he would them
withholde / upon such covenant / if they might deliver his land of his
enmyes / he would give them reasonable lands where they should dwell for ever
more. Engist thanked him goodly / and in this manner he and his company a.xi.
thousand should dwell with the king Vortiger. And much they did through
their boldness / they delivered his land of his enmyes clean Tho prayed
Engist the king of so much land that he might make to hy^ a cite and for his
meyne. The king answered / it was not to do without the counseyll of Brytons.
Engist prayed him eftsoon of as much place as he might compace with a thonge of
a skin whereupon he might make a Maneer for him to dwell on. And the king
hy^ granted freely. Tho took Engist a bulls skin / and kytte it as small as
he might all in to ^o thonge all a round. And therewith compaced he as much
land as he might then make upon a fair castle. And so when this castle
was made / he let call it Thongcastell for as much as the place was marked
with a thonge.

Of Ronowen that was Engistes daughter / and how the king Vortiger spowsed her
for her beauty.
SO when this castle was made / and full well arrayed. Engist pryuely did
send by letter in to the country where he came fro / after an ho^dred ships
filled with men that were strong and and also well fighting in all bataylles
/ And that they should also bring with them Ronowen his daughter / that was
the fairest creature that a man might see. And when those people were come that
he had sent after / he took them in to the castle with much Joy. And
himself upon a day went unto y^ king / and prayed him there worthily that he
would come and see his new maneer that he had made in the place y^ he had
compassed with the thonge of the skin The king anon granted him freely.
And with him went thither / and was well apayed with the castle and with the
fair work / and together they ete and drank with much Joy. And when night
came that the king Vortiger should go in to his chamber to take there his
nyghtes rest. Ronowen that was Engistes daughter came with a cup of gold in
her hand / and kneled before the king and said to him (Wassaylle) And the
king knew not what it was for to mean ne what he should answer there upon /
for as much as himself / ne none of all his Brytons could no engl^sshe speak
ne understand it / but he spoke in the same langage that Brytons done yet.
Nevertheless a latiner told it to the king the full understanding thereof /
(Wasshayll) and that other should drink (hayll) And that was the first time
that (wasshayll) and (drynkhayll) came up in this land. And from y^ time unto
this time / it is well used in this land. The king Vortiger saw the
fayrnesse of Ronowen / and his arms laid about her neck / and thryes swetely
kyssed her / and anon right he was enamoured upon her y^ he desired to have
her to wife / and asked of Engist her fader. And Engyst granted him upon this
covenant / y^ the king should give him all the country of Kent / that he
there might dwell in and his people. The king him granted pryuely with a good
will. And anon he spowsed the damoysell / and that was much confusyon to
himself. And therefore all the Brytons became so wroth / for by cause he
spowsed a woman of mysbyleue. Wherefore they went all from him / and no thing
to him took / ne halpe him in thing that he had to done.

How Vortimer that was Vortigers sone was made king / and Engist driven out.
And how Vortimer was slain.
THis Engist went in to Kente and seized all y^ land in to his hand for him
and for his men / and became with in a lytill while of so great power / and so
much people had / yt men wist not in little time which were the kings men
and which were Engistes men. Wherefore all the Brytons had of him dread / and
said among them. But if y^ they ne took other counsel between them / all
y^ land should be bytrayed through Engist and his people. Vortiger the king
had begoten on his first wife three sons. The first was called Vortimer. The
second Catagien / and the third Passent. The Brytons euerychone by one assent
chose Vortimer to be their lord and sovereign / and cou^seyler in every
battle / and crowned him and made him king / and would not suffer Vortiger no
longer to regne / for cause of the alyau^ce betwixt Engist and him. The Brytons
ordained a great host to drive out Engist and his company of the land / and
yaue him three bataylles. The first was in Kente there he was lord / the
second (...) at Te^^orde / and the third in a shyre a this half Colchestre in
a more. And in this battle them met Catagien and Home Engistes brother / so
that each of them slew other. But for as much as the country was yeuen
long before to Horn through Vortiger / tho he spowsed his cosyn / there he
made a fair castle that is called Horncastell after his own name. And
Vortimer was so anoyed for his brothers death / that anon he let fell down
the castle to the ground. And after he ne left night ne day till he had
driven out Engist and his people of the land. And then Ronowen his daughter
made sorrow enough. And quentely spoke to them that were next the king
Vortimer and pryuyest with him. And so much she gave him of gifts / that he
was enpoysened / and deyed at London the fourth year of his regne / and there
he lies.

How the Brytons chose an other time Vortiger to be their king / and Engist
came in to this land / and how they fought togyders.
AFter Vortimers death / the Brytonr by their common assente eft soones made
Vortiger their king upon this covenant / y^ he sholdde never after suffer
Engist ne none of his eft sons to come in to this land. And when all this was
done. Ronowen the queen pryuely sent by letter to Engist y^ she had enpoy
sened Vortimer / and y^ Vortiger her lord bare again y^ crown and reigned. And
that he should come again into this land well arrayed with much people for to
avenge him upon the Brytons / and for to wy^ne this land again. And when
Engist herd these tidings / he made great Joy. And appareylled him hastily
with.xv. thousand men / y^ were dughty in every battle / and came in to this
land. And when Vortiger herd tell that Engist was come again with a great
power in to this land / he assembled his Brytons / and tho went against Engist
for to ye^e hy^ battle and his folk. But Engist dradde him sore of the
Brytons / for they had driven him before and discomfyted him with strength.
Wherefore this Engist prayed hy^ of a love day / and said he was not comen in
to this land for to fight / but for to have his land again if he might accord
with the Brytons / and of them to have love and grace. The king Vortiger
through counsel of his Brytons granted him a love day. And thus it was
ordained through the Brytons / y^ the same day should be holden fast beside
Salisbury upon a hylle. And Engist should come thither with four hundred
knights without moo. And the king with as many of the wysest men of his
land. And at that day the king came with his counseyll as it was ordained /
But Engist had warned his knights pryuely / and them commanded that every one
of them should put a long knyf in his hose. And when he said Fair syres now
is time to speak of love and peace every man. Anon should draw out his knyue
and slay a Bryton. And so they slew a M.lxi. knights / and with much sorrow
many of them escaped. And the king Vortiger there himself tho was taken / and
ladde to Thongcastell and put in prison. And some of Engistes men would that
the king had be ^ente all quycke And Vortiger tho for to have his life /
granted them as much as they would axe / and yaue up all the land / towns /
castelles / cytees / and borughs to Engyst and to his folk. And all the
Brytons fled thens in to Walys / and there they held them still. And Engist
went thorugh the land and seized all the land / with fra^^chyses. And in
every place let cast a do^ne chirches and houses of Religyon And wasted and
destroyed crystendome thrughout all this land. And let change the name of
this land called Brytayne / that no man of his were so hardy after that time
to call this land Brytayne / but call it Engist land. And then he
departed all the land to his men / and there made.vij. kings for to strength
y^ land that the Brytons should never after come therein. The first kingdom
was Kent / there that Engist himself reigned / and was lord and master over
all the other. The other king had Southsex that now is called Chichestre. The
third king had Westsex. The fourth had Eestsere The fyfth had Estangill /
that now is called Nortfolke. Southfolke. Merche merik / that is to say /
therldome of Nicholl. The sixth had Leycheter shyre. Northampton shyre.
Herforde / and Huntyngdon. The seventh had Orenforde. Glouchestre. Wynchestre.
Werwyke. and Derby shyre.

How that Vortiger went in to Walys and began there a castle that would not
stand without mortar tempred with blood.
AS Engist had departed all the land in this manner between his men / and
delivered Vortiger out of prison and sufffed him freely to go whyther that he
would. And he took his way and went in to Walys there y^ his Brytons dwelled /
for as much as y^ land was strong and wicked to win. And Engist never came
there ne never knew it before that land. Vortiger held him there with his
Brytons / and a^^d counseyll what him was best to do. And they yaue him
counseyll to make a strong castle that he might himself there in keep and
defend if need where. Masons in have tho were fette / and began to work upon
the hylle of Breigh / but certes thus it befell that all the work y^ the
masons made a day / down it fell the night / and they wist not what it might
be. Thereof the king was sore anoyed of that chance and wist not what to do.
Wherefore he let send after the wysest clerks and also learned men than were
thorugh out Walys that might be found / for they should tell wherefore the
fou^dament so failed under the work / and that they should him tell what was
best for to do. And when these wise men long time had studied they said to the
king / that he should do seek a child borne of a woman that never had with man
to do. And that child should be slain / and tempre with his blood the mortar
of the work. And so should the work ever endure withouten end.

How the king let seek Merlyn thorugh out all Walys / for to speak with him
AS the king herd this / he commanded his messagers anon to go through out
Walys to seek y^ child if they might him find / and that they should him
bring forth with them unto him. And in record and in witness of this king
he had take them his letters that they ne were distroubled of no man ne let.
And tho the messengers went thens / and spedde so fast y^ they came in to a
town that was called Carmardyne / And as they passed forth there way they
found two children of.xxilij. year of aege chiding together with hasty words.
And one of them said to that other. Donebat said he ye do all wrong to chyde
or strive with me for ye have no wit ne no reason as I have. Certes Merlyn
said he / of your wit ne your reason I make no force. For men tell comynly
that ye have nothing of god almighty sith ye had never fader / but every man
knows who was your mother. The messengers of y^ king Vortiger when they herd
the strive betwixt the two gromes they axed of them that stood beside them
whens that Merlyn was borne / and also whom him nourysshed. And the folk them
told / that a great gentle woman him bare in Carmardyne that was called
Adhan. But never might no man wit who was his fader. When the kings
messengers herd these tidings they went anon to him y^ was Wardey ne of y^
town and told hy^ the kings will and showed hy^ his letter wherefore they
were come thither. Merlyn and his mother were fetched before y^ Wardeyne of the
town. And he commanded them y^ they should go to the king as it was ordained
by his messengers. Merlyn and his mother went thens and came unto y^ king and
there they were received with much honor. And the king axed of y^ lady if that
child were her sone and whom him begat. The lady answered full tenderly
weeping and said. She never had company of worldly man. But sir said she As I
was a young maiden in my faders chamber / and other of great lygnage were in my
company / that oftentimes went to play and solace. I be left alone in my
chamber / and would not go forth for brennynge of the son. And on a time
there came a fair bacheler and entered in my chamber there y^ I was alone. But
how he came in to me / and where. I wist it never / ne yet know I not. For y^
doors were fast barred and with me he did (...) of love. For I ne had might
ne power / him to defend from me. And often he came unto me in the foresaid
manner / so that he begat this child. But never might I wit what he was.

Of the answer of Merlyn wherefore the king axed why his castle might not
stand that he had begone ne pro^e.
SO when Merlyn had herd all that his mother had said. He spoke to the king in
this (...). (...) how I was begoten / axe ye no more. For it falls not to you
/ ne to none other to wit. But tell me the cause wherefore I am to you brought
and wherefore ye have sent after me. Truly said y^ king / my wise
counseyllers have done me to understand / that the mortar of a work that I
have begone / behooves to be tempred with your blood / or the fundament shall
fail for ever more. Sire said Merlyn. Will ye slay me for my blood to tempre
with your mortere. Ye said the king / or else my castle shall never stand
as my counseyllers do me to understand. Tho answered Merlyn to the king. Sir
he said / let them come before me those wise counseyllers / and I woll preue
that they sayen not well ne truly. And when the wise men were comen. Merlyn
axed if his blood were the cause to make this work to stand and endure. All
tho wise men were abashed and could not answer. Merlyn tho said to the king.
Sir I shall tell you the cause wherefore your work thus fails and may not
stand. There is under the mountain there that ye have builded your toure a
great ponde of water / and in the botome of the ponde under the water there ben
two dragons / and that one is white / and that other reed / that fight together
against your work / Do ye mine deep till your men come to the ponde / and cause
your men to take away the water all out / and then ye shall see the dragons
as I have you tollde / that together fight against your work / and this is the
cause wherefore your fundament fails. The king anon let dygge under till
that men came to the ponde / and let do away the water / and there they
found two dragons as Merlyn had told them y^ egerly fought together. The white
dragon egerly assailed the reed / and laid on him so strongely that he might
not endure / but withdrewe him and rested in the same ca^e. And when he had a
while rested him / he went before and assailed the reed dragon angrely / and
held him so sore that he might not against him endure / but withdrewe him and
rested. And after came again the white dragon and strongely fought with the
reed dragon. and bote him evil and him overcame. that he fled from thens
and no more came again.

Of the sygnyfycacyon of those two dragons that were in the botome of the ponde
that fought together.
THis king Vortiger and his men that saw this battle had great marvel / and
prayed Merlyn to tell him what it might betoken. Sir quod Merlyn I shall tell
you. The reed dragon betokens yourself / and the white betokens the folk
of Saxon that first ye took and held in your land that fight against you /
and you have driven and enchaced. But Brytons of your lygnage overcame them and
drove them away And sythen at the coming again of the Saxons they recovered
this land and held it for ever more. And drove out the Brytons and did with
this land all their will / and destroyed crystendome through out this land. Ye
had first great Joy with their coming / but now it is corned to you great
damage and sorrow. For tho two brethern of Constance that was king the which
ye let slay shall come before a quinzeme passed with a great power from little
Brytayne / and shall avenge the death of their brother. And they shall brenne
you first with sorrow / and after they shall slay a great part of Saxons / and
shall drive out all the remenaunt of the land. And therefore abide ye here no
longer to make castle nor other work. But anon go else where your lives all
for to save To god I you betake / truth I have said to you of things that
shall befall And understand ye well that Aurilambros shall be king. But he
shall be enpoysoned / and little time shall he regne

Of king Aurilambros how that he pursewed Vortiger and Engist / and how they
deyed.
MErlyn and his mother departed from the king / and turned again to Carmardyn.
And soon after tidings came to the Brytons that Aurilambros and Vter his
brother were arrived at Totuesse with a great host / And anon y^ Brytons
assembled them and went to receive Aurilambros and Vter with great noblesse.
And had them unto London / and crowned Aurilambros and made him king / and
did unto him homage. And anon he axed where Vortiger that was king might be
found / for he would be avenged on his brothers death / and after he would
war upon paynems. And they told him that Vortiger was in Walys / and so
they ladde him thytherwarde. Vortiger wist well that tho brethern came him to
conquer / and fled thens in to a castle that was called Gerneth that stood
upon an high mountayrie / and there him held. Aurilambros and Vter his
brother and their folk had besyeged the castle full long time / for the
castle was strong and well arrayed. So at the last they casted wild fire
and brent houses and men and all their array / and as much as was within the
castle. So that Vortiger was burnt among all other / and so he deyed with
much sorrow. Tho was Engist in Kente and reigned there / and herd this
tidings / and anon fled and would have gone in to Scotlonde for to have had
socoure. But Aurilambros and his men met with him in the north country and
yaue him battle. And Engist and his men defended whiles that they might. But
he and his folk were dyscomfyted and slain. And Octa his sone fled unto
York. And Aurilambros him followed egrely. And Octa a little while withstode
him. But afterward he put him to his mercy. And Aurilambros received him / and
to him and to his men gaaf the country of Galeway in Scotlonde / and there
they dwelled / The king Aurilambros went thorugh out the land / and put
away the name of Engistlonde / that Engist after his name had called it
before. Tho let he it call again great Brytayne / and let make again
chirches / houses of relygyon / castelles / cytees / and borughs* and towns
that the Saxons had destroyed. And came to London / and let make the walls
of the cite / which Engist and his folk had cast down / The Brytons ladde
him unto the mount of Ambriam that sometime was an house of relygyon / that tho
was destroyed through the paynems. Whereof a knight that was called Ambri some
time was founder of that house. And therefore the same hylle was called the
mount of Ambrian. And after it was called Ambresbury. And shall be so for ever
more.

How Aurilambros did redress the land of great Brytayne / that which was
dstroyed thorugh the Saxons before said.
HOw the king Aurilambros let amend and redress the house of Ambresbury /
and there in put monks. But now there ben Nonnes a little fro the place that
was called Salysbury / are that the Saxons slew the Brytons / where Engist and
they should have made a love day. In the which time were slain a thousand
knights.lxi. through treason of Engist. The king thereof had great pity and
thought to make in mind of them a monument of stone y^ might endure to the
worlds end. And of this thing they took there counsel what thereof was best
for to do / Tho spoke to the king the bishop of London y^ was called Ternekyn
y^ he should require after Merlyn. For he could best tell how this thing might
best be made. And Merlyn after was sought and found and came to y^ king. And
the king told him his will of the monument yt he would have made. Merlyn
answered to the king and said. There ben great stones in Irlonde / and long
upon the hylle of Kyan y^ men called Gyauntes karoll. And if they were in this
place as they ben there / they would endure for ever more in remembrance of
those knights that here be entyred. Per may foy said the king As hard stone
ben in my land as in Irlonde. Soth said Merlyn. but in all your land ben none
such For gyauntes set them for great good of themself. For at every time
that they were wound or in any manner hurt / they wysshe the stones with hot
water / and then they wysshe them therewith and anon they were hoole.

How the Brytons went for to seek the great stones in Irlonde.
As Soon as the Brytons had herd of this thing / they yede and swore among
them they would go seek those stones. And took with them Vter the kings brother
to be chyef captain and.v. thousand men / and Merlyn cou^selled the^ for to
go unto Iolonde and so they did / And when the king of Irlonde y^ was called
Guillomer herd tell that strangers were arrived in his land / he assembled
a great power and fought against them But he and his folk were dyscomfyted /
The Brytons went before till they came to the mount of Kyan / and cly^med up
unto the mount. But when they saw the stones and the manner how they stood /
they had great meruaylle and said between themself / that no man should them
remeue for no strength ne engyne so great they were and so longr. But Merlyn
through his craft he remeued them and brought them in to their ships and came
again in to this land. And Merlyn set the stones there that the king would
have them. And set them in the same manner that they stood in Irlonde / And
when the king saw that it was made he thanked Merlyn / and rychely him
rewarded at his own will. And that place let call it Stonhenge for ever more.

How Passent that was Vortigers sone and the king Guillomer came in to this
land / and how a traitor that was called Cappa enpoyseneu the king
Aurilambros.
ANd men shall understand that Passent that was Vortigers sone lived the same
time / and came in to this land with a great power / and arrived in the north
country and would be avenged of his faders death Vortiger / and strongely
trusted upon the company that he had brought with him out of y^ land of
Germayne / and had conquered all the North country unto York. And when king
Aurilambros herd this / he assembled a great power of Brytons and went for to
fight with Passent / and he dyscomfyted Passent and all his people. But Passent
escaped thens with some of his men / and fled thens in to Irlonde and came to
king Guillomer and prayed him of help and socour. The king granted him with
good will and said / that he would help him / upon that covenant that I my
self must go with you with all my power in to Brytayne. And I would (...)
aduenge upon the Brytons the rather / for they came in to my land and took the
stones with strength y^ is called Gyau^tes karoll. The king Guillomer le te
ordeyne his ships and went to the sea with.xv. thousand men / and arrived
in Walys and began to rob / and much sorrow he did. It befell so that king
Aurilambros lay syke at Wynchestre / and might not help himself. So that he
sent in his name Vter his brother with a power to help Walys. And
thytherwarde he went as much as he might. The king of Irlonde and Passent
herd tell that Aurilambros was syke / and to him there came a Sarrasyn that
was called Cappa and said. Sire dwell ye here all in peace with your host /
and I behyght you thorugh my quayntesye y^ I shall slay the king Aurilambros
that is syke. Then said Passent / if ye do so I shall you rychely auau^ce.
The traitor Cappa put upon him an habyte of religyon / and let shave him a
broad crown and came unto the kings court / and said that he would help the
king of his malady. Tho said ye traitor Cappa unto the king. Sir be of good
comfort. For I shall give you such a medycyne that ye shall sweet anon right
and list to sleep and have good rest. And the traitor yaaf him such poison
to sleep anon right / and deyed in his slepynge. And the traitor said that he
would go out in to the field till he were awaked / and so escaped he away. For
no man had to him suspeccyon / for by cause of his habyte that he was clothed
in / and also for his broad shaven crown. But when the kings men wist that he
was deed / they became wonder sorry / and fast sought the traitor / but they
might not find him. For that Cappa turned again unto the host from whens that
he came.

When Aurilambros deyed a sterre in the morn was seen with a clear light / and
at the bought of the beeme was seen she heed of an horrible dragon.
SO when the king Aurilambros was deed and enpoysoned at Wynchestre. On the
morn after he was deed about the time of Pryme there was seen a sterre great
and clear / and the beeme of that sterre was bryghter than the son And at the
bought of the beeme apperid a dragons heed / and out of his mouth came two huge
lyghtes / yt were as bright as any fire brennynge / and that one beeme toward
France and straight over the sea thytherwarde. And out of that beeme came.vij.
beemes full clear and long as it were the light fire. This sterre was seen of
many a man / but none of them wyste what it betokened. Vter that was the kings
brother that was in Walys with his host of Brytons / saw that sterre and the
great light that it yaue / they wondered thereof greatly what it might betoken And
let call Merlyn and prayed him for to tell what that it might betoken.

Of the betokenynge of the sterre.
MErlyn saw that sterre / and beheld it long time. And sythen he quoke and
wept tenderly. And said. Alas alas yt so noble a king and worthy is deed And I
do you to understand that Aurilambros your brother is poisoned / and y^ I see
well in this sterre. And yourself is betokened the heed of the dragon y^ is
seen at the bought of the beeme / that is your self yt shall be king and
regne. And by the beeme that stondeth toward the Eest is understand yt ye
shall get a sone that shall conquer all France / and all the lands yt
belongs to the crown of France / that shall be a worthyer king and of more
hononr than ever were any of his auncetours. And by the beeme y^ stretched
toward Irlonde is betokened that ye shall get a daughter that shall be queen of
Irlonde. And the.vij. beemes betoken that ye shall have.vij. sons. And every
one of them shall be king / and regne with much honor. And abide ye no
longer here / but go and give battle to your enmyes / and fight with them
boldly for ye shall overcome them and have the victory. Vter thanked hertely
Merlyn / and took his men and went toward his enmyes / and they fought
together mortally / and so he dyscomfyted his enmyes and them destroyed. And
himself slew Passent that was Vortigers sone. And his Brytons slew Guillomer
yt was king of Irlonde and all his men. And Vter anon after that battle took
his way toward Wynchestre / for to do entyere Aurilambros king that was his
brother. But tho was the body bor^ unto Stonhenge with much houour / that he
had done make in remembrance of the Brytons that there were slain through
treason of Engist / that same day that they should have been accorded. And in
the same place they entyered Aurilambros the second year of his regne with all
the worship that might belong to such a king. On whoos soul god have mercy.
Amen.

Of Vter Pendragon / and wherefore he was called so ye shall here. And how he
was overtake with the love of Igrey ne that was the Earl of Cornewaylles wife.
AFter the death of Aurilambros Vter his brother was crowned / and reigned well
and worthily. And in remembrance of the dragon that he was lykened to / he
let make two dragons through counseyll of his Brytons. And made that one for to
be borne before hy^ when he went in to battle / and that other for to abide
at Wynchestre in the bishops church. And for that cause he was called ever
after Vter Pendragon / And Octa that was Engistes sone commended Vter but
little that was made new king. And against him began to meue war. And
ordained a great power of his friends and of his kynne / and of Ossa his
brother / and had taken all the land from Humbre unto York / But those of
York held strongely against them / and would not suffer them to come in to
the cite / neither to yield the cite to them. And he besyeged y^ town anon
right / and yaue thereto a strong assawee. But they of the cite them kept well
and strongely. And when Vter herd thereof / he came thither with a great
strong power for to help and rescowe the town and put away the syege / and
yaue a strong battle. And Octa and his company them defended as well as they
might. But at the last they were d^scomfyted and the most party of them
slain. And Octa and Ossa were taken and put in prison at London. And Vter
himself dwelled a while at York / and after he went to London. And (...) the
Eester after he would bear crown and hold a solemn feast. And let somone
all his Earls and Barons / that they should come to that feast. And all those
that had wives should bring them also to that feast. And all the seygnoury
came at the kings commandment as they were commanded. The feast was rychely
arrayed and holden. And all worthily set to meet after y^ they were of astate
So that the Earl Gorloys of Cornewaylle and Igreyne his wife sat next unto the
king. And when the king saw the faytnesse of that lady and the beauty that
she had. He was anon rauysshed for her beauty / and often he made to her nyce
countenance in lokynge and laughing. So at the last the Earl perceived the
preuy lokynge and laughing and the love between them. And rose up from the
table in wrath / and took his wife / and called to him his knights and went
thens in wrath / without taking leave of the king. The king anon sent after
him that he should come again and go not thens in dyspyte of him. And the earl
would not come again in no manner of wise. Wherefore the king was wroth / and
in wrath him defied as his deedly enmye. And the earl went thens in to
Cornewaylle with his wife in the castall of Tyntagyll. And the king let
ordeyne a great host and came in to Cornewaylle / for to destroy the earl if
that he might. But he had put him in such a castle that was strong and well
arrayed called Tyntagyll / and would not yield him to the king. And the king
anon besyeged the castle / and there dwelled.xv. days that never might speed
/ and ^uer he thought upon Igreyne / and upon her laid so much love / that
he wist not what to do. So at the last he called to him a knight that was
called Vlfin that was preuy with him and told him all his counsel / and axed
of hy^ what was best for to done. Sir said he / send after Merlyn anon / for
he can tell you the best counseyll of any man living. Merlyn anon was sent
after and came to the king. And the king told him all his counsel and his
will. Sir said Merlyn. I shall do so much through craft that I can / that I
shall make you come to night in the castle of Tyntagyll / and shall have all
your will of that lady.

How Vter begat on Igreyne / that was the Earls wife of Cornewaylle Arthur
king.
MErlyn through craft that he could changed the kings figure in to the lykenes
of the earl / and Vlfin Garlois his Chambrelayne in to the figure of Jordan
that was the earls cham brelayne / so that each of them was transfygured in to
others lykenes And when Merlyn had so done / he said to the king. Sir said he
/ now ye may go suddenly to the castle of Tyntagyll and axe entree there and
have your will. The king took prpuely all the host to govern and led to a
knight that he much loved / and took his way toward the castle / and with
him took Vlfin his chambrelayne and Merlyn / and when they came thither the
porter demid it had been his own lord. And when time came for to god to bed
/ the king went to bed with Igreyne the earls wife and did with her all his
will. And begat upon her a sone that was called Arthur. And upon the morrow
the king took his leave of the lady and went again to his host. And the same
night that the king lay by Igre^ne in bed that was y^ earls wife the kings
men gaaf a great assawie unto the castle. And the earl and his men manly them
defended. But at the last it befell so / that in the same assawie the earl
himself was slain and the castle taken. And the king anon turned again to
Tyntagyll and spowsed I greyne with much honor and made her queen. And soon
after time came that she should be delivered and bare a child a sone that was
called Arthur. And after ga^e on her a daughter that was called Amya. And when
she came to aege / a noble Baron that was lord of Lions wedded her. When Vter
long time had reigned / there came upon him a great sykenesse as it were a
sorrow. And in the mean time those that had to keep Octa that was Engistes
sone and Ossa has brother / that then were in prison / they let them go for
great yeftes y^ they them yaue and went with them. And when tho two brethern
were escaped and were in to their own country again / Then they ordained
them a great power of folk / and began for to war again upon the king.

How king Vter chose Aloth to keep the land of Brytayne / while that he was
syke / for as much as he might not lo^ (...) syknesse.
ANd for as much as king Vter was syke and might not help hy^ self / he
ordained Aloth sone of Eleyne that tho was chosen for to be wardeyne and
chyeftayne of all his folk. And so he anon and all his Brytons assembled a
great host and yaue battle to Octa and to his folk / but Octa at the last
was dyscomfyted. It befell thus afterward / that these Brytons had dedignaco^n
of Aloth and would not be to him attendau^e. Wherefore the king was anoyed
wonder sore and let put him in a lytere in the host among his folk. And
they ladde him to Vereloyne that tho was a fair cite / there y^ saint Albon
was martred. And after was the cite destroyed with paynems through war. And
thither they had sent Octa and Ossa and there people And entered in to the
town / and let make sure y^ yates / and there they held them And the king
came and them besyeged / and made a strong assawee / but they that were within
manly them deffended / The king let ordeyne his ginnes and his engynes for
to break the walls / and the walls were so strong that no man might them
mysdo. Octa and his people had great despyte / that a king lyenge in a lytere
had them besyeged. And they took counseyll among them for to stand up in the
morrow erly and come out and give battle to the king / and so they did. And
in that battle were both Octa and Ossa slain / and all the other y^ escaped
a live fled in to Scotlnde / and made Colegrin their chyeftayne. And the
Saxons y^ were a live and escaped fro the battle / brought again a great
strength / and among them they said / that if king Vter were deed they spolde
well conquer the land / and thought to enpoysen the king / and ordained men
for to do this deed / and yaue them of yeftes great plente this thing to do.
And they ordained them thyderwarde there (...) y^ king was dwelling / and
clothed them in poor wede y^ better all for to speed their falls purpose. But
netheles all their falsenes and subtylte they might never come to nygh the
king. But so at y^ last they aspyed y^ the king drank no other lycour but
oonly water of a clear well that was nyghe beside / and the false traitors upon
a day pryuely went to y^ well and put therein poison / so y^ all y^ water was
enpoysened. And anon after as the king had drunk of that water / he began to
swelle / and soon after he deyed / and as many as drank of y^ water deyed
also. And anon as this was aspyed folk of the town let stop the well for
evermore When the king was deed his folk bare him to Stonhenge with great
solempnyte of bishop and barons that were there him to burye beside
Aurilambros his brother. And after turned again tho euerychone and sent after
his sone and they made him king of the land with much reverence after his
faders de^he / the.xvij. year of his regne.

How king Arthur y^ was the sone of Vter was crowned after his fads death and
how he drove Colegrin and the Sarons and Cheldr^k of Almayne out of this land.
AS Arthur was made king of the land / he was but young of aege of.xv. year /
but he was fair and bold and doughty of body. And to meke folk he was good
and curteys / and large of spending / and made him well beloved among all
them there y^ it was need / and when he began to regne be swore truly that the
Saxons never should have re^^ ne peace till that he had dryurn them out of the
land. And assembled a great host and fought with Colegrin) the which after
the time that Octa was deed the Saxons mayntened. And this Colegrin was
dyscomfyted and fled unto York and took the town / and there him held. And
the king besyeged hy^ there but he might no thing speed for the cite was so
strong. And they within the town kept y^ cite well and orpedly. And in the
mean time Colegrin let the town to Bladulf and fled himself to Cheldrik y^
was king of Almayne / for to have of him socour. And the king assembled a
great power and came and arrived in Scotlonde with.xv. hundred ships. And
when Arthur wist of these tidings y^ he had not power and strength enough to
fight against Cheldrik / he let be the syege and went to London / and sent
anon his letters to the king of little Brytayne yt was called Howell his
neuewe his systers sone / that he should come to him with all the power yt he
might And he assembled a great host and arrived at Southampton. And what king
Arthur if wist he was glad enough and went against them / and them received
with much honor. So that those two hosts met and assembled them / and took
their way even unto Nicholl that Cheldrik had besyeged / but it was not taken.
And they came upon cheldrik and his people or they wist where that they were /
and them egrely assaylled. The king Cheldrik and his men defended him manly by
their power. But king Arthur and his men slew so many Saxons / that never was
seen such slaughter / and Cheldrik and his men that were left alive fled
away. And king Arthur them pursewed and drove them out in to a wood that that
they might no ferder pass. Childrik and his men saw well that they were
brought in to much disease / and them yielded to king Arthur in this manner
wise. That he should take their horses and their armor / and all that they had
/ and they must oonly goo on foot in to their ships. And so they would go
home in to their own land / and never come again in to this land. And upon
assurance of this thing they (...) hy^ good hostages. And Arthur by counseyll
of his men granted this thing / and received the hostages / and thereupon the
other went to their ships. And when they were in the high see y^ wind
changed as the devil it would / and they forned their navy and came again in
to this land and arrived at Totnesse / and went out of the ships and took
the land / and dene robbed it / and much people slew / and took all the
armor that they might find. And so they went forth till they came unto
Bathe. But the men of the town shytte fast their yates / and would not suffer
them to come within the town. And they deffended them well and orpedly against
them.

How Arthur yaue bataylle unto the Saxons when they came again in to this
land / and had besyeged the town of Bathe and them overcame.
Anon as Arthur herd this tidings he let hang the hostages / and left
Howell of Brytayne his neuewe / for to keep the march toward Scotlonde with
half his people / and him self went to help and rescowe the town of Bathe.
When he came thither he yaue a strong battle to Cheldrik and slew almoost
all the people y^ he had. For no man might him withstonde ne endure under ye
stroke of his sword. And there both were slain Colegrin and Bladult his
brother / and Cheldrik fled thens and would have gone to his ships. But
when Arthur it wist / he took.x. thousand knights to Cador y^ was earl of
Cornewaylle for to let and stop his to mynge. And Arthur himself went
toward y^ march of Scotlonde. For mesengers told him that the Scotts had
besyeged Howell of Brytayne there that he lay syke / and therefore he hasted
him thytherwarde. And Cador pursewed after Cheldrik / and took him er he might
come to his ships and slew Cheldrik and his people. And when Cador had done
this vyage / he hasted him again toward Arthur as fast as he might / and found
him in Scotlonde there that he had rescowed Howell of Brytayne / but the
Scotts were far within Nounref / and there they held them a while. But
Arthur them pursewed. and they fled thens in to Limoigne / that were in that
country.lx. Isles / and great plente of birds / and great plente of Egles that
were wont to cry and fight togyders / and make great nose when folk came to
rob that land / and warn as much as they might / and so they did. For the
Scotts were to great rauenours / that they took all that they might find in
the land of Limoigne without any sparynge / and there with tharged again the
folk in to Scotlonde for to wend.

How king Arthur axed of Merlyn the adventures of.vi. of the last kings that
were to regne in England / and how the land should end.
Sir said Merlyn. In the year of the Incarnacyon of Ihesu Christ M.CC.xv. shall
come a lamb out of Wynchestre / shall have a white tongue and true lyppes / and
he shall have written in his heart holiness. This lamb shall make many gods
houses / and he shall have peace the most part of his life. And he shall make
one of y^ fairest places of the world / y^ in his time shall not fully be made
an end of. And in the end of his life a wulf of a strange land shall do him
much harm and sorrow through war. But at the end the lamb shall be master
through help of a reed fore / that shall come out of the Northwest / and him
shall overcome / and the wulf shall deye in water. And after that time the
lamb shall live no while / but he shall deye. His seed shall be in a strange
land. And the land shall be without a governor a little time.

ANd after this shall come a dragon meddled with mercy and also with woodnesse.
And y^ shall have a berde as a got / y^ shall give in England a shadow / and
shall keep the land fro cold and hete / and his own foot shall be set in
Wyke and y^ other in London. And he shall enbrace Inhabitau^ces. And he shall
open his mouth toward Walys. And y^ trembling of the hydour of his mouth /
his eeres shall stretche toward many habtacyons and countries. And his b^eth
shall be full sweet in strange land. And in his time shall the ryuers run
blood and with brain. And he shall make in places of his land walls y^ shall
do much harm unto his seed after his time. And then shall there come a
people out of the Northwest during his regne y^ shall be ladde thrughout a
wicked hare / that the dragon shall do crown king that afterward shall flee
over the sea without coming again for dread of the dragon. And in y^ time the
son shall be as reed as a blood / y^ men shall see thorugh out all the world
/ that shall betoken great pestylence and death of folk / thorugh dynt of
sword. And that people shall be faderles / till the time that the dragon deye
through an hate that shall meue against him war unto the end of his life / that
shall not fully be ended in his time. This dragon shall be hold in his time the
best body of the world. And he shall deye beside the marches of a strange
land / and y^ land shall dwell ^faderles without a good governor / and men
shall weep for his death / from the isle of Shepey to the haven of Mart^yll.
Wherefore Alas alas shall be there long of faderles folk / that shall over
live in his land destroyed.

ANd after this dragon shall come a got out of Kae y^ shall have horns and a
berde of silver / and there shall come out of his nosethryll a dompe that shall
betoken hungre and sorrow and great death of ye people. And much of his land
in the beginning of his regne shall be wasted. This got shall go over unto
France / and shall open ye flower of his life and death. In his time there shall
arise an egle in Cornewayle yt shall have feathers of gold / y^ of pride shall
be without pere of the land. And he shall despise lords of blood. And after he
shall flee shamefully by a beer at Gauersech / and after shall be made brydges
of men up on the costs of the sea / and stones shall fall from castestelles /
and many other towns shall be made plain. In his time shall seem y^ the beer
shall brenne / and a battle shall be done upon the arms of the sea in a field
ordained as a shield And at y^ battle shall deye many white heedes / wherefore
this battle shall be called the white battle. And y^ foresaid beer shall do
this got much harm / and it shall come out of the Southwest and of his
blood. Then shall y^ got lose much / and of his land / till that the time
y^ shenshyp shall him overcome. And then shall he close him in a lions skin /
And then shall be win that he had before lost and more thereto. For a
people shall come out of the North west y^ shall make the got so sore aferde
that he shall be in great perplexite. And he shall aduenge him on his enmyes /
through counsel of two owls that first shall be in peril for to be undone.
But y^ old owl shall wend a way a certain time / and after he shall come
again in to this long. These two owls shall do great harm to many one / and
so they shall counsel the got to arere war against the foresaid beer. And at
the last the got and the owls shall come at Burton upon Trent / and shall
go over / and for dread the beer shall flee and a swanne with him fro his
company to Burton ward y^ north and there they shall be with an hard shoure And
then shall the swanne be take and slain with sorrow / and the beer taken
heeded alther next his neest / that shall stand upon broken bridge / on whom
the lonne shall cast his beemes. And many shall him seek for virtue that from
him shall come. In the same shall deye for sorrow and care a people of his land
/ so that lands shall be upon him the more bolder afterward. And those two
owls shall do much sorrow to the foresaid flower of life / and her shall led
in to dystrestre / so that she shall pass over ye see in to France / for to
make peace between the got and the flouredelyse / and there she shall dwell
till a time that her sede shall come and seche her / and they shall be still
till a time / that they shall them clothe with grace. And they shall seche the
owls and shall put them to dyspytous death. And after shall this got be
broughtte to disease and great Anguysshe / and it sorrow he shall live all his
life.

AFter this got shall come out of Wyndesore a boore / that shall have an heed
of a white lions heart / and pyteous lokynge. His vysage shall be rest to syke
men. His breast shall be stau^ chynge of thyrste to tho that be thyrsty / His
word shall he gospel. His herynge shall be meke as a lamb. In the first
year of his regne he shall have great pain to Iustefye them y^ ben untrue. And
in his time shall his land be multeplyed with alyauntes. And this boore
thorugh fyersnesse of his heart that he shall have / shall make wulues to become
lambs. And he shall be called thorugh out of the world Boore of holiness
fyersnesse of noblynesse and of meekness. And he shall mesurably all that he

yates of Paris / and upon four lands. Spain shall tremble for dread.
Gascoyne shall sweet. In France he shall put his wynge. His great tail shall

AFter this boore shall come a lamb / that shall have feet of leed / and an
heed of brass / and an heart of loppe a swynes skin and an hard. And in his
time his land shall be in peace / the first year of his regne he shall do make

time a great part of his land through an hydeous wulfe / but he shall recover
it / and give a lordshyp to an Egle of his land and this egle shall well
govern it till the time that pride shall him overcome Alas the sorrow / for he
shall deye of his brothers sword. And after shall the land fall to the
foresaid lamb / that shall govern the land in peace all his lives time. And
after he shall deye / and the land be fulfilled of all manner of good.

AFter this lamb shall come a moldwarpe / cursyd of gods mo^th / and caytyf

shall fall upon him for sin. In the first year of his regne he shall have of
all good great plente in his land and toward him also / And in his land he
shall have great praysynge / till the time that he shall suffer his people live
in to much pride without chastysynge / wherefore god will be wroth. Then
shall arise up a dragon of the North / that shall be full fyerse / and shall
meue war against the forsayde moldwarpe / and shall give hy^ battle upon a
stone. This dragon shall gadre again in to his company a wulfe / that shall come
out of the West to meue war against the foresaid moldwarpe in his side / and so
shall the dragon and bind their tails together. Then shall come a lion out
of Irlonde / that shall fall in company with them. And then shall tremble
the land that shall be called England as an aspyn leyf / And in that time
shall castelles be felled down upon Tamyse. And it shall seem that Seuerne
shall be diye^for the bodies that shall fall deed there in / The four chyef
floodes in England shall run in blood. And grate dread shall be / and
anguysshe that shall arise After the moldwarpe shall flee and the dragon. The
lion and the wulfe shall them drive away / and the land shall be without
them. And the mold warpe shall have no manner power / sauf oonly a ship whereto
he may wend. And after that he shall go to land where the sea is withdraw.
And after that he shall give the third part of his land / fu^ to have the
fourth part in peace and in rest. And after he shall live in sorrow all his life
time. And in his time the hot bathes shall become cold. And after y^ shall the
moldwarpe deye auenturously and suddenly. Alas for sorrow / for he shall be
drowned in a flood of the sea His seed shall become faderles in strange land
for ever more. And then shall y^ land be departed in to three parts / that in
to say / to the wulf / to the dragon / and to the lion. And so shall it be for
ever mroe And then shall this land be called the land of Conquest. And so
shall the right heirs of England end.

How Arthur overcame Guillomer that was king of Irlonde. And how the Scotts
became his men.
Then what Guillomer that was king of Irlonde herd tidings y^ king Arthur
was entered at Glastenbury / he ordained a great power of Irysshmen and came to
the sea with his Irysshe people / and so came in to Scotlonde over the sea and
arrived fast there by y^ king Arthur was with his host / And anon as he wist
thereof / he went toward him and yaue him bataylle and overcame him anon
right. And Guillomer fled with his men again in to Irlonde. And what this
was done and dyscomfyted him Arthur turned him again there that he was / in to
the place there that he had left the Scotts and would have them all slain.
But the bysshopes / abbottes / and other folk of the country and ladies open
heeded came before king Arthur and cried him mercy and say de. Sire gentle
king and mighty / have mercy and pity upon us. And as yourself be of the right
law to hold and mayntene Crystendome. For full great dishonor it should be
to slay him y^ byleueth in almighty god as ye do. And for gods love have
mercy and pity on us and suffer us. For we have had much sorrow and pain. For
yo Saxons have many times passed through our land. But y^ is not enough to you
/ for oftenymes they have done us sorrow and disease. For our castelles they
have taken / and our beestes slain and eten / and much harm they have us
done. And if ye molde us now slay / it we re^none honor to a king to slay
them that cries him mercy. For enough ye have done to us and have us overcome.
And for the love of god y^ ye will suffer us for to live / and have mercy on
christian people that believe in Christ as ye do. When king Arthur herd this
sorrow / he had pity of them and yaue them life and lymme without any more
harm. And they fell down to his feet and thanked him / and became his lyege
men / and he took of them homage. And after that king Arthur turned again with
his host and came unto York / and made there his bydynge during that vyage.
And tho gave he all Logrys to Aloth y^ had spowsed his sister and other gifts
great plente. And tho was Gawyn his cosyn but of young aege. And to all his
other men that him had served in his war / he gave rich gifts / and he
thanked them much of all their good service.

How king Arthur spowsed Gu^nor that was Gu^nors cosyn Earl of Cornewayle /
and after he conquered of Guillomer all Irlonde.
ANd when Arthur had brought his land in peace and rest and in good state /
and all was well in every country. Tho took he and wedded a wife yt was called
Gu^nor and made her queen / a fair lady and a gentle y^ Cador the earl of
Cornewayle had nourysshed in his chamber that was his cosyn. But never they had
children together. And nevertheless king Arthur loved her wonder well and deyely.
And anon as Winter was passed / he let assemble a great host / and all his
Barons and said yt he would go in to Irlonde for to conquer the land. And he
carried not long y^ he ne passed over into Irlonde. And Guillomer the king
let assemble a great host and yaue bataylle to king Arthur but Guillomer was
his comfyted and yielded him to the king and became his man / and to him did
fewte / and h^mage / and of him held all y^ land fro that time forward. And
after passed king Arthur ferthermore and conquered Gutlonde and Islonde / and
took homage of the folk and of the land / and there dwelled.xij. year in peace
and reigned with Joy and myrthe. And there warred no man ne woman upon him. And
he became so curteys and large and honorable / that the Emperors court of
Rome / ne none other through out all the world was not accounted to king
Arthurs / that any man wist of / ne none so well praised. And therefore the best
kynghtes of all manner lands came unto him there for to dwell. And he them
received with good will and reverence. And all the knights were so good that
no man knew the werste. And therefore king Arthur made a round table that
when they should sytte on there meet / all should be ylyke high and euenly
served at the table that none of them should make auaunt that one of them were
higher thanne an other. And king Arthur had at that table Brytons and
Frenshmen. Normans and Flemynges. Burgoyns Mausers and Lotherins / and of all the lands a this half the mount Goue / and of his land of Brytayne / and of
the great Corn waylle / of Walys and of Irlonde / and of Scotlonde And shortly
to tell / of all the lands y^ would worship chyualry / such came to king
Arthurs court.

How king Arthur yede in to France and conquered y^ land of Froll yt was a
Romayne / and how he slew him.
Sith it befell that through counsel of his barons and lords / king Arthur
would go conquer all France that tho was called Galle through Romans that
tho held that land in their power and in their governance. And the Romans
had taken that land to a noble knyzt and a worthy of body that was called
Froll. And when he wist that Arthur came / he ordained an host of a great
power and fought with the king. And he and his folk were dyscomfyted and
fledes unto Paris and entered y^ cite / and closed the yates and there held
them. When Arthur wist that Froll was gone to Paris be pursued after and came
thither / and him besyeged. But the cite was so strong and well arrayed / and
tho yt were therein deffended them well and manly. King Arthur dwelled there
more than a month. and there was so much people in the cite that they
dyspended all their dytayle y^ they had within. And so great hungre be came
among them / yt they deyed wonderly thycke within the cite for hungre. And
came unto Froll and prayed him to be accorded with king Arthur for to have
peace / and they would yield them unto him and the cite also. Froll saw that
he might no longer hold the town against their will / and trusted greatly upon
his own strength and sent to king Arthur that he should come fight with hy^
body for body / and so should they depart France between them two. King
Arthur anon granted it. And would not y^ none of his people undertook the
battle for him. And upon the morn both came well arrayed without Par^s theret
that they should fight. And anon they smote togyders so fyersly and so well
they fought on both sides y^ no man demed the better of them / and so it
befell y^ Froll yaue Arthur such a stroke that he kneled to the ground would
be nolde he / And as Froll wounded king Arthur in the forhede y^ the blood
fell down by his ^yen and his face. Arthur anon sterte up hertely when he
felt hy^ hurt as a man that seemed almoost wood. And he took taburne his good
sword / and drew it up on high and yaaf Froll such a stroke that therewith
he claue his heed down to the sholders so that his helm might not be his
warraunt / and so he fell down deed in the place. And then tho of the cite
made great sorrow for Froll. And euerychone yielded them to king Arthur and the
town also and became his men / and did to him homage and feaute. And he
received them and took of them goodly hostages. And king Arthur after that
went forth with his host and conquered Augien and Angiers. Gascoyne. Pehito.
Nauerne and Bourgoyne. Berry. Lotherne Turin and Peithers / and all the other
lands of France he conquered all holy. When he had conquered and taken by
homages and feautees / he turned again to Paris and there he dwelled long time
/ and ordained peace long time over all the country / and thorugh all France /
And when peace was made over all / thorugh his noble kynghthode that he had /
and also for his own worthynes And no man were he never so great a lord
durst not meue war against him another to arise for to make the land of
France inquyete. And in peace he dwelled there.ix. year / and did many great
wondres / and repreued many proud men and evil tyrauntes them chastysed
after their demerytes.

How king Arthur auaunced all his men that had trauaylled in his service.
ANd afterward it befell thus at Eester there that he held a fest at Paris /
and rychely he began auaunce his knights for the service that they hades him
helped in his conquest. He yaue to his steward that was called Kay Augien and
Angiers. And he yaue to Bedwer his butler Normandye / that tho was called
Neustrie. And to Holdin his chambrelayne he yaue Flaundres and Mance And to
Dorell his cosyn he yaue Boleyne. And to Richard his neuewe he yaue Pountyf /
and to all other he yaue large lands and fees after they were of estate / And
when Arthur had thus his knights feoffed / at Aueryll next after suynge he
came again in to Brytayne his own land. And after at Wy^sontyde sewynge by
counseyll of his barons / he would he crowned king of Glomergon / and held a
solemn feast. And let somone barons earls and knights / that they should
come thither euerychone. And there was Scater king of Scotlonde. Cadwere king
of Southwalys. Guillomer king of Northwalys. Maded king of Irlonde. Malgamus
king of Gutlonde. Achilles king of Islonde. Aloth king of Denmark. Gone was
king of Norwaye / and Hell his cosyn king of Dorkeney. Cador king of little
Brytayne. Morwith Etle of Cornewaylle. Mauran earl of Gloucetre. Guerdon earl
of Wynchestre. Boell earl of Hartforde. Vrtegi earl of Oxforde. Cuisall earl of
Bathe. Jonas earl of Chestre. Enerall earl of Dorchestre. Kymare earl of
Salysbury. Waloth earl of Caunterbury. Iugerne earl of Chichestre. Arall earl
of Leycetre / and the earl of Werwyke / and many other moo rich lords.
Brytons there came mo / that is to say. Dippon Donaude. Gennes / and many
other that be not named here were at the feast. And many a fair feast king
Arthur hades hold before / but never none such / ne so solemn / and that
lasted.xv. days with much honor and myrthe.

Of the letter that was sent fro Rome for pride to king Arthur.
THe third day as king Arthur latte at his meet among his kings and
among them that sat at the feast / before them came in.xij. men of aege
rychely arrayed / and curtously they salewed the king / and said they came fro
Rome sent as messengers fro the Emperor. And took hy^ a letter that thus
much was to understand. Gretely us meruaylleth Arthur / that thou art ones so
hardy with thyn eyes in thy heed to make open war or contake against us of
Rome / that own all y^ world to deem / for you have never yet before this time
proved ne assayed thy strength of the Romans / and therefore you it shall in a
little time. For Julius Cezar conquered all the land of Brytayne / and took
thereof truage / and our folk have it long y^ had / and now thorugh thy pride
you withholdest it. Wherefore we of Rome command the that you it yield again /
and yet have you more folly done that you have slain Froll that was our baron of
France with wrong. And therefore all the comyns of Rome warns the and
command y^ upon life and lymme that you in haste be at Rome amends for to make
of thy misdeeds that you have done. And it so be that you come not we shall pass
the hylle of Joy with strength / and we shall the seek where ever you may be
found / and you shall not have a foot of land of thyn own / that we ne shall
destroy it / and afterward with thy body we shall do all our will. When this
letter was read and all men it herd they were anoyed all that were at that
solemn feast. And the Brytons would have slain the messengers / but the
king would not suffer them and said / that y^ messengers should have no harm
/ and may by reason none deserve. But commanded them to be worshypfully served
And after meet he took counsel of kings / earls and ^arons / what answer
he might give again to y^ messengers. And they cou^seylled him atons / that he
shol de assemble a great power of all the lands of which he had lordshyp /
and manly avenge him upon the Emperor of the despyte that he had send him
such a letter. And they swore by god and by all holy his name that they should
him pursewe and brenne as much as they might. And said that they would never
faylle king Arthur / and rather to be deed. And they let write a letter to
send to the Emperor by the same messengers in this manner of wise.

Of the bold answer that king Arthur sent to the Emperor of Rome and to
the Romans.
UNderstondeth among you of Rome that I am king Arthur of Brytayne / and
freely it hold and shall hold. And at Rome hastily I will be / not to give
you truage / but for to are truage. For Constantyne that was Eleyns sone that
was Emperor of Rome and of all the honor that thereto belongs. And Maximsan
king conquered all France and Almayne / and mount Joy passed / and conquered
all Lombardy And these two were mine auncetours and that they held and had. I
shall have thorugh gods will.

Of the reverence that king Arthur did to the Emperors messengers.
ANd when this letter was made and ensealed / king Arthur to these messengers
yaue great yeftes / and after that the messengers took their leave and went
thens / and came to the court of Rome again. And told the Emperor how
worthily they were received And also of such a ryall company that he had him
for to seem / and how he was more ryally served than the Emperor of Rome / or
any other king living in all the world. And when the Emperor had ouerseen
the letter / and had herd what was therein / and saw that Arthur would not
be ruled after him. He let assemble and ordeyne a great host for to destroy
king Arthur if that he might. And king Arthur as touching his power and
party / ordained his power of knights of the table round.

Of the kings and lords that came for to help king Arthur against the
Emperor.
THe kings of Scotlonde and of Irlonde / and of Gutlonde / of Denmark and of
Almayne / every of them had.x. thousand men. The duke of Normandye. Gascoyne.
Flau^dres. Peh^to. and of Boloyne / each had.iiij. thousand. Gerin of
Charthres had.x. thousand / Howell of Brytayne had.xij. thousand And himself
of his own land.xij. thousand. And of Arbalastres and of Archers and of
other folk on foot that no man cowde them nombre. And when all were ready to
go. King Arthur / his land and Gu^nor his wife / took to keep to one of his
neuewes / that was a wise kynght and an hardy / that was called Mordred / But
he was not all true / as ye shall here afterward. King Arthur took all his
reame to this Mordred / sauf oonly the crown. And after that king Arthur took
his host and went to South hampton / there that the ships were brought and
the folk assembled. And they did go unto the sea / and had wind and weder at
will. And as soon as ever they might they arrived at Hareflete. And as soon as
they might they went to land out of their ships and spradde all over the
country.

How king Arthur faught with a gyaunt in Spain that was called Dinabus / that
slew Eleyne that was king Howels cosyn of little Brytayne.
BYnge Arthur had not dwelled in the country but a little time / that men him
told that there was come a great gyau^t in to Spain / and had rauysshed fair
Eleyne that was cosyn unto Howell of little Brytayne. And had brought her
upon an hylle that is called the mount of saint Bernarde. And there was no man
in that country so bold ne so hardy that durst fight with him / ne come nigh
the place there that the gyau^t dwelled that was called Dinabus. And much
sorrow he did* in the country / When king Arthur herd this tidings / he
called to him Kay and Bed^were and commanded them to go pryuely and espy
where the gyaunt might be found And they came to the ry^age there that men
should go to the mount / that was al enclosed about with water and yet is / and
ever shall be. And they saw a brennynge fire upon the hylle. And there was
also an other hylle nigh that / and there was upon that an other fire brennynge.
Kay and Bedwere came to the next hylle / and found a wydowe open heeded
sitting besides a tomb sore weeping / and great sorrow made. And often she said
Eleyne eleyne. And Kay and Bedwere axed what she was / and wherefore she made so
much sorrow / and who lay in that tomb / O said she what sorrow and
mysauenture fair lords seek ye here. For if the Gyau^t may you here find he
will you slay anon. Be stylle good wife said they thereof dysmaye you not / but
tell us the south why that thou make so much sorrow and weeping. Syrs said
she For a damoysell that I nourysshed with my breest that was called Eleyne /
that was nece to Howell of Brytayne. And here lies the body in this tomb that
to me was taken to nourysshe. And so there came a devil a Gyaunt and rauysshed
her and me also / and ladde us both with him away. And he would have forlayne
that maid that was so young and tender of aege / but she might it not suffer
so great and so huge as the Gyaunt was. And for certain if he come now as he
is wont to do / he will you both now slay and therefore go ye hens. Then
bespake these two messengers and said to her / wherefore go ye not from hens.
Certes said she when that Eleyne was deed the Gyaunt made me to abide and haunt
his will / and I must needs it suffer. And god it wot I do it not which my will
/ for I had lever to be deed than with him to deal / so much pain and sorrow
I have when he me forlyeth. When Kay and Bedwere had herd all y^ this woman
them told / they turned again and came to king Arthur and told him all that
they had seen and herd. Arthur anon took them both with him and went
pryuely by night that none of his host wist and came on the morrow erly to the
Gyaunt and faught with him strongely / and at the last him slew. And Arthur
badde Bedwere smite of his heed / and bring it to the host to show it for a
wonder / for it was so great and huge. When they came again to the host / they
told wherefore they had been out / and showed to them the heed / and every man
was glad and Ioyefull of the worthy deed that king Arthur had done that was
their lord. And Howell was full sorrowful for his nece that was so lost. And
afterward when he had space / he let make a fair chapel of our lady over
Eleyn^ tomb.

How king Arthur yaue bataylle to the Emperor / in y^ which battle the
Emperor himself was slain.
ARthur and his people herd tidings yt the Emperor had assembled a great
power / as well of sarrasyns as of paynems and christian men. Whereof ye nombre
was.lxxx. thousand horse men with foot men. Arthur and his people ordened fast
forth in their way toward the Emperor and passed Normandy and France unto
Burgoyne / and would have gone unto the host. For men told him that the
Emperors host would come to Lucie. The Emperor and his host in the
beginning of August teweued from Rome / and came forth right the way to ward
y^ host. Tho came king Arthurs spies and said / if that Arthur would he
should find the Emperor there fast by / but they said / that the Emperor
had so great power with him of kings of the land of Paynems / and also
christian people that it were but folly to king Arthur to mete with them For the
spies ^olde / that the Emperor had five or six men against one of his. King
Arthur was bold and hardy / and for no thing him nysmayed and said. Goo we
boldly in gods name against the Romans / that with them led Sarrasyns and
Paynems / that no manner trust they have in god / but oonly vpontheyr strength.
Go we now and seek them sharply in the name of almighty god / and slay we the
Paynems and Christian men that been against us with them / for to destroy Christian
men And god shall us help them to overcome. For we have the right opinion and
therefore have we trust in god. And do we so that the enmyes that be to
crystendome and to god may be destroyed and overcome / and that men may record
the warthynesse of knyghthode. When king Arthur had thus said / they cried
all with an high voys. God that is fader almighty worshypped be thy name with out
end. Amen. And grant us grace well for to do / and to destroy our enmyes
that been against crystendome. In the name of the fader / the sone / and the holy
ghost. Amen. And god give hyen never grace ne worship in the world / ne mercy
of him to have / that this day shall faynte well for to smite and egrely. And
so they rode softly / and ordained his wings well and wisely. The Emperor
herd tell that king Arthur and his folk were ready appareylled for to fight
with him and how they were camynge. He (...) ordeyne his wings in the best
wise that he cowde. And more trusted upon his strength than in god almighty /
and that was seen afterward. For when the (...) hosts met / the Emperor
lost (...) of his folk against one of Arthur. And so many were slain / what on
that one party and on that other / that it was great pity to wit and to
behold. In this battle were slain through king Arthurs fine kings of the
Paynems and of other wonder much people / and king Arthurs men fought so well
/ that the Romans and paynems had no more strength to withstonde them /
than.xx. sheep against five wulues. And so it befelle that in this battle in
the shoure / that was wonder hard and long during in that one side and in
that other / the Emperor among them there was slain / but there was no man
that wyste for very sothe who him slew.

How king Arthur let entyere his knights yt he had lost there in battle /
and how he sent the Emperors body to Rome that there was slain in battle.
SO when y^ Romans wist that the Emperor was deed / they forsook the field
and y^ paynems also. And king Arthur after them chaced till it was night / and
so many of them slew yt it was wonder to tell. And tho turned king Arthur
again when it was night and thanked god of his victory. And on the morrow he
let look and search all the field for his knights that he there lost. That is
to say. Borell earl of Maunt. Bedwere / and Kay / and Lyegiers earl of
Boleyne. Vortiger earl of Baac. Aloth earl of Wynchestre. Cuisall earl of
Chestre / and after Holden earl of Flaundres These were the great lords that
king Arthur last in that battle / with other worthy knights them among. And
some he let entere in abbayes by the country / some he let to be borne in to
their own country. And the Emperors body he l^te take and put upon a beyr and
sent it to Rome. And said to the Romans / that for Brytayne and France
whichehe held / other truage would he none pay. And if they axed him any
other truages / right such truage he would them pay. The king let bear Kay
to Kenen his own castle / and there him entered. And Leygier was borne to
Boleyne there he was lord. And Holden was borne to Flaundres / there he was
entered / And all the other he let entere with much honor in abbayes and in
houses of relygyon in the country that they were slain. And Arthur himself
soiourned y^ same year in Bourgoyne with his host and thought the same year
following to pass the mount Joy / and have gone to Rome also to have taken
the cite and have put the Romans in subgeccyon / but the wicked tyrant
Mordred him letteas after ye shall here.

How the traitor Mordred / to whom king Arthur took his land to keep and his
castelles / held them against him.
AS Arthur had taken to Mordred his reame to keep / and gone against the
Emperor of Rome / and was passed the sea. Mordred anon took homages and
fea^tees of all them that were in this land / and would have had this land
to his own use / and took castelles about / and let them be arrayed. And after
this falsenesse he did an other great wrong / for against the law of
crystente he took his own emys wife as a traitor should / and ordained him a
great host against Arthurs coming / to hold the land against him with
strength for ever more / and to slay king Arthur if he might / and sent by
the sea and by land / and let assemble paynems and christian people. And he
sent to Saxons and to Danys for to help hy^. And also Mordred sent to
Cheldrik to send men to him out of Saxon that was a worthy duke / and promised
him if that he brought with him much people he would grant him Inherytau^ce
for ever / all the land fro Humbre to Scotlonde / and all the land that
Engist had of Vortigers yefte / when that he spowsed his daughter. And Cheldrik
came with a great strength and power of people / and Mordred had assembled
also on his half / that they had.xl. thousand of strong knights when that
they had need.

How Arthur enchaced Mordred the traitor and how he was slain / and also
king Arthur wounded to the death.
AS this tidings came to king Arthur there yt he was in Bourgoyne / he was
full sore anoyed / and took all France to Howell for to keep with half deal
of his men. And prayed him that he would it keep till he came again. For himself
would pass in to Brytayne / and avenge him upon mordred yt was his traitor.
And forth with Arthur went his way and came to Wytsande / and made his men to
go in to ship and would have arrived at Sandwyche / and brought with him a
great host of F^enshe^en also with his own land men / But or that he might
come to land with his people that were come out of his ships. Mordred was come
with all his power / and yaue a strong battle / so that king Arthur lost
many a man are that he might come to land. For there was Gawayne his neuewe
slain / and Anguysshell that held Scotlonde / and many other whereof king
Arthur was full sorry. But after they were come to land Mordred might not
against them endure. But anon was dyscomfyted and fled thens the same night
with his men / and upon the morn came to London. But tho of the cite would not
suffer him to come in. And from thens he fled to Wynchestre / and there he
him held with his people that came with hy^ King Arthur let take the body of
Gawayne his cosyn / and the body of Anguysshell / and let that one be borne in
to Scotlonde / and the other to Dover and buried. Anon after king Arthur took
his way for to destroy Mordred / and he fled thens in to Cornewayle. And
the queen Gunnor that was king Arthurs wife that tho soiourned at York / herd
that Mordred was fled thens and that he might not endure against king Arthur
/ she was sore aferde and had great doubt / and wyste not what was best of all
for to done. For she understood well that her lord king Arthur would never of
her / for to have mercy for the great shame that she had done unto him / And
took her way pryuely with four men without moo / and came to Karlyon / and
there she dwelled all there live / and never after was seen among the folk
her life during. King Arthur wist that Mordred was fled in to Cornewayle /
and let send after his men in to Scotland and Northumberlonde unto Humbre /
and let assemble folk without nombre / and came fro thens in to Cornewayle to
seek and pursewe after Mordred. And Mordred had assembled to him all the folk
of Cornewayle and had people without nombre / and wist that Arthur was coming
/ and had lever to deye and take his chance / than longer flee and abode / and
yaue an hard battle to king Arthur and to his people so that much people
was slain / what of one side and what of that other / that no man wist who had
y^ better party. But so it befell at the last that Mordred was slain and all
his folk / and the good chyualry that king Arthur had gadred and nourysshed
of diverse lands / and also the noble knights of the round table / that so
much were praised thorugh out all the world were there slain / and king
Arthur himself was wounded unto death. But he let hy^ to be borne to (...) ^un
to be heeled of his wounds. And yet the Brytons supposen that he lived in an
other land / and that he shall come yet and conquer all Brytayne. and But
certes this is the prophecye of Merlyn. He said that his death shall be doubtous
/ and said soth. For thereof yet men have doubt / and shall have for ever more
as men say. For men wot not whyther that he is on live or deed. Arthur was
borne at Auioun the.xxij. year of his regne / after the Incarnacyon of our
lord Ihesu Christ.v.C.xlvi. year.

How king Arthur delivered the trame unto Constantyne the sone of Cador his
neuewe.
AS king Arthur wyste that he might no longer regne / he let come before him
Constantyne that was Cadors sone earl of Cornewayle his cosyn and to hy^ betoke
all his reame / and to hy^ said / and badde hy^ thereof to be king till yt he
came again / for as much as he had none heir of his body begoten. And great
damage was it^ that so noble a king and so doughty as he was / had no child of
his body begoten. But all thing y^ god woll have done must be done / whose
name be blessed without end.

How king Constantyne was vexed of Mordred two sons.
THis Constantyne was a noble knight and a worthy of body. And the two sons
that Mordred had begoten had great envy of Constantyne that tho was crowned
king. And so it befell that they meued war against hy^. And assembled a great
host of them yt were before with Mordred / and had been driven away / and that
did much sorrow and an guysshe thrughout all that land. That one brother
ordained / and purposed him toward the ancient cite of London / for to take
the cite. And that other went to Wynchestre. But Constantyne came to London
and slew him that was there. And after he went to Wynchestre and slew him
that was there also. So that both his enmyes were deed. And when Constantyne
had reigned well and worthily four year / he deyed and lies at London.

Of the kings Adelbright and of Edell.
AFter king Constantynes death there were two kings in Brytayne / that one was
called Adelbright y^ was a danoys. And he held the country of Northfolke and
Southfolke. That other hight Edell and was a Bryton / and he held Nicholl.
Lindeser / and all the land unto Humbre. These two kings fast warred together
/ but after accorded they were and loved together / as they had been borne of oo
body. The king Edell had a sister that was called Ore^^enne. And he gaf her
through great frendshyp to king Adelbright to wife. And he begat upon her a
daughter yt was called Argentyll. And in the third year after came upon him a
strange syknesse that needs he must deye. And he sent to king Edell his
brother in law that he should come and speak with him / and he came to him with
a good will. Tho prayed he the king and coniured him also in the name of god /
that after when he were deed / he should take his daughter Argentyll and the
land / and that he kept her well / and nourysshe her in his chamber. And when
she were of aege / she should be married to y^ stro^gest and worthyest man that
he might find / and then he should yield up her land again Edell it granted
and by oath confermed his prayer. And when Adelbright was deed and enteryd /
Edell took the damoysell Argentyll / and nourysshed her in his chamber / and
she became as fair as any might be.

How king Edell married that damoysell to a knave of his kechyne.
THis king Edell that was uncle to Argentyll / bethought how y^ he might
fallely have the land fro his nece for ever more / and falsely against his oath
thought to dysceyue Y^ damoysell / and to marye her to a knave of his kechyn yt
was called Curan / and he became the worchyest and strongest man of body yt any
man wist in any land y^ tho lived / and to him he thought her shamfully have
married for to have had her land afterward / but he was clean disceyued. For
this Curan was Hauelockis sone yt was king of Kyrkelane in Denmark / and this
Curan conquered his wives land afterward and slew king Edell yt was his
wives uncle and had al her land / as in an other place it tells more openly
/ and he reigned but three year / for Saxons and Danes hy^ slew and that was
great harm to all Brytayne and Brytons bare him to Stonehenge and entyred him
honorably.

Of king Conan yt was Curans cosyn.
AFter this Curan reigned his cosyn Conan that was a wonder proud knight. And
reigned and could have no manner of love / but ever he was medlynge with his
people. And took his uncle with war / and slew his two childern. The Saxons
warred against hy^ oftentimes / but he them overcame / and so he was in peace all
his life time. And he reigned.xiiij. year / and after he deyed and lies at
London.

Of king Cortyf and of Gurmonde that came thorugh the paynems in to Brytayne.
AFter this Conan reigned his cosyn Cortyf yt was beha^ed of al his people and no
thing beloved. And this Cortyf lost all Brytayne through war And in his time
fell y^ great myscheyf in Brytayne y^ crystendom was destroyed / and all the
Brytons were driven out of y^ land and the land lost without any recover. But
afterward left the land to the Saxons as ye afterward shall here. For in
that time there was a paynem that was called Gurmonde / that was the kings
sone Daufrices of the parnems folk / that had the reame after his fader /
and was king / sauf he be^uaue and yaue it to his brother. And sa^d that he
nolde never be king but if that he might get and conquer a reame in a
strange country. For he was bold and strong of body. And of hy^ prophesied
Merlyn and sayd^ that he should be a wul^ of the sea. And he let assemble
(...) without nombre / and let appareylle ships / and went by many lands
and took homages and fea^tees of many. And so he went by the sea and conquered
ma^ny diverse lands. So that he came in to Irlonde / and conquered that land
that oftentimes warred upon Brytons and Brytons upon them / and often won and
often lost and yaue hostages to Brytons. And so they sent to Gurmonde there that
be was in Irlonde^ that he should come in to Brytayne and help them against the
Brytons / to help them to deliver that land of them / and they would him
hold gladly for their lord. For he was a paynem^ and they were paynems^ and
the Brytons were crystened. Well ought he them for to help so as they were all
of one law. When Gurmonde herd this prayer he hasted him as much as he might
and arrived in Scotlonde / and came in to Northumberlonde there that the Saxons
were dwelling / and they confermed the couenauntes between them that were made
by oaths and by hostages / f^r to bear him true fay / and hold him for lord /
and pay to him truage by the year / Tho began the Saxons and the Affricans to
destroy rob and brenne towns / and destroy all thing in asmoche as they
might / and spared neither man woman ne child / learned ne lewd / but all they
slew / and cast down towns castles and chirches / and so put they all the
land in great destruccyon. And as soon as they might flee / they fledes thens
as well poor as rich / bishops / abbottes / chanons / and all other great and
small / some in to little Brytayne / and some in to Cornewayle / al tho that
ships might have.

How the king Gurmonde drove king Cortyf to Chechestre / and slew the
Brytons / and through craft and engyne gate the same town.
COrtyf the king fled thens in to Chechestre yt tho was strong / and the^e
held hy^.xx. days / and this Gurmonde came and it besyeged. But the cite was
so strong yt he might not get it by no manner of wise with engyne that they
might do. Tho bethought they upon a subtylte for to brenne the town. They made
engynes with glewe of nets / and took pecys of thonder and of fire and bond it
to sparowes feet / and than let them flee / and they anon flewe and lodged
them in y^ town there yt their nestis were / and in stackes and euesynges of
houses / and y^ fire began to kyndle and burnt all the town / And when y^
Brytons saw that in every side they hyed them out and fought / but anon they
were slane and dyscomfyted / And while the battle dured the king pryuely
hid him and stale away in to Walys / and men wist never were he became / and
so was ye town of Chechestre taken and destroyed. And after Gurmonde went and
destroyed towns and cytes that never were after made again / as it is seen yet
in many places of this land.

How this land was called England for the name of Engist / and how many
kings were made after in this land.
SO when Gurmonde had destoyde all the land through out / he yaue the land to
y^ Saxons / and anon they took it with good will / for the Saxons long time had
desired it. For asmoche as they were of Engystes kynrede that first had all y^
land of Brytayne and let them be called Englysshmen / for by cause of
Engistes name / and y^ land they let call England in their langage / and the
folk ben called Englyshmen / for asmoche as in his time it was called Engistes
land when he had conquered it of Vortiger / that spoused his daughter. But fro
ye time that Brute came first in to England / this land was called Brytayne /
and y^ folk Brytons. But sith the time yt this Gurmonde conquered it eftsoon
/ and yaue it unto the Saxons / they anon right changed y^ name as before is
said. And when this was done. Gurmonde passed over in to France / and there
conquered many lands / and destroyed all christian people there that he came. And
the Saxons dwelled in this land and began fast to enhabyte it at her own will.
And they would have made new kings and lords / but they might never assent
to have oonly oo king for to be to them attendaunt / and therefore they made
many kings in diverse shyres / as it was in Engistes time. The first kingdom
was Kente / and that other Southsexe / and the third Westsex / the fourth
Eestsex / and the fyfth Northumberlonde / and the sixth Estangle that is to
say Northfolke and Southfolk and the seventh Mercheryche / and that is the
Erldome of Nicholl. Huntyngdon. Herforde. Gloucetre. Wynchestre. Werwyke and
Derby / and so departed all England in to.vij. parties. And after that it
befell that tho kings warred ofttymes together. And ever he yt was strongest
took him that was feblest / and so it was long time that they had no king
crowned among them / ne no christian man was tho among them / ne crystendome
another. But were paynems till y^ saint Gregory was pope of Rome / that had seen
childern of the nacyon of England in the cite of Rome / that were wonder fair
creatures / and had great will and desire them to behold. And axed of the
merchants whens they were / and of what nacyon. And men told him that they
were of England / and English they were called / but they and all the people
of England were paynems / and byleued not upon god. Alas said saint Gregory /
well mow they be called English / for they have the vysages of angels and
therefore well ought they to be crystened. And for this cause saint Gregory
sent there saint Austyn in to England and.xl. good men with him that were of
good life and holy men to preche and teache and to convert the English people
and them to torn to god / and that was in the.vi. year that saint Gregory had
be pope of Rome / that is to say / after thyncarnaco^n of our lord Ihesu
Christ.v.C.lxxxv. years as the Cronycle tells.

How saint Austyn baptized and converted king Adelbryght and the bysshoppes
that he made his fellows.
AS saint Austyn came first in to England / he arryuen in the Isle of Tenet /
and so passed forth and came unto Caunterbury and there soiourned. And king
Adelbryght of Kente yt was of the lygnage of Engist goodly received saint
Austyn and his fellows with much honor / and them found all that them neded.
And more over he yaue them a fair place / that now is called the abbay of
saint Austyn / in which place he lies himself shryned. This king Adelbryght
was a good man and with good will herd saint Austyn^ predycacyons / and yaue
him leave to preche through out all his land before said of Kent / to torn and
convert to him all the people that he might. It betelle so after thorugh
gods grace / that in little time the king himself was converted to god / and
all his people of his land were baptized. And in the mean while the people
turned them to god. Saint Austyn came to Rochestre / and there he preched the
word of god. And y^ paynems therefore him scorned / and cast upon him reygh
taylles / so that all his mantell was hanged full of these reygh tails / And
for more despyte / they cast upon him the guts of reyghes and other fysshe.
Wherefore the good man sa^^^ Austyn was sore anoyed and grieved. And prayed to
god that all tho children of that cite that should be borne afterward / that
is for to say / in the cite of Rochestre / might have taylles and so they
had. And when the king herd of this vengeance that was fall through saint
Austyns prayer. He let make an house in the honor of almighty god / wherein
wymmen should be delivered of their childern a^^ the brydges end / In the
which house yet wymmen of the cite ben delivered of child. When that saint
Gregorye had herd tell how the English people were turned to god and
converted / he sent unto saint Austyn his pallyon by a bishop / that was
called Paulin and made him P^^mate and Archebysshop of England / And sent
word that he should ordeyne and make bishops in the land. And anon Austyn
had the pallyon of the dygnyte of the Archebysshop. He made two bishops of his
fellows that came with him fro Rome / and one was called Mellite and he dwelled
at London / and that other was called Justin that held the dygnyte at
Rochestre. And this bishop Mellite tho went to preche in to Es^sex and
crystened the king of the country that was called Sicwith / that was king
Adelbryghtes cosyn his systers sone. This Justin went to preche in Southsex
and turned much of the people to god. And saint Austyn himself preched
thorugh out England.

How saint Austyn went in to Wales there the Brytons were / and how they would
not be obedyent to the Archebysshop of Caunterbury.
SO when all England was crystened and turned to god / saint Austyn went in to
that land there that the Brytons were for to keep them from Englysshmen / that
is to say in to Walys And there he fond monks and abbayes and.vij. bishops.
For the Brytons always destroyed the christian people y^ saint Austyn had
converted. And he said to the bishops yt he was a Legate of Rome and Prymate
of all England / and that they should by all reason to him be obedyent and
they said they nolde / but to the Archebysshop of Carlyon they would. They
would never for no manner thing be obedyent to the Englysshmen. For y^
Englysshmen they said ben our adversaries and our enmyes / and have driven us
out of our country / and we ben christian men and ever have be. And the
Englysshmen have ever be paynems / but now of late yt they ben converted. Saint
Austyn of them might have none answer other wise / but said pertly that they
would never them meke to him / ne to the pope of Rome. And saint Austyn turned
again tho to king Adelbryght that was king of Kente / and told him that his
folk would not be to no man obedyent / but to y^ Archebysshop op Carlyon. And
when the king herd this / he was sore anoyd and said that he would them
destroy / and sent to Elfryde king of Northumberlonde that was his friend /
that he should come to him with all the power that he might and yt he would
mete hy^ at Leycette / and fro thens they would go in to Walys / and there
destroy the Archebysshop of Carlyon / and all tho that had refused saint
Austyn.

How king Adelbryght and the king Elfryde slew Brecinall yt was a king of
Brytons yt held ye country of Leycetre
IT befelle so yt there was a king of Brytons yt held the country of
Leycetre and all the country about / his name was Brecinall. And this Bryton
herd tell yt tho two English kings would mete there at Leycetre for to go
in to Walys. He let ordeyne all the power yt he had for to go fight with these
two kings / but little it auayled hy^ / for his folk yt he had were slain
and hy^self fled / and lost his lands for ever more. And thele two kings
Adelbryght and Elfryde dwelled a while at Leycetre / and departed the land
among them / and took homages and feautees of the folk of the country. And
after they went toward Walys / and tho of Walys herd tell of the scomfyture
yt Brecinall had at Leycetre / and were wonder sore adrad of tho two kings.
and took and chose among them good men and holy of heremytes / monks and
pr^estes / and of other people great plente that went bare foot and wulwarde
for to have mercy of these two kings. But tho kings were so stern and so
wicked yt they would never speak to them but them slew euerychone. Alas for
sorrow / for they ne spared them no more than the wulf does y^ sheep / but
smote of their heedes euerychone / and so they were all martred yt tho them
came / that is to understand.v.C. and.xl. After they went fro thens to Bangor
for to slay al those yt they might there find of y^ Brytons. And when y^
Brytons herd that / they assembled and ordained all there power for to fight
with them. Tho was there a baron in Walys that was called Bledrik of Cornewale
that sometime was lord of Deuenshyre but the king Adelbright had driven him
out in to Walys / and after there he yaue them battle. And at that battle was
king Adelbright slain / and Elfryde sore wounded and forsook the field / and
the most party of his people slain. And Elfryde fled in to Northumberlonde
that was his own land. And after the people of Leycetre shyre made with
strength Cadewan that was Brecinals sone king of Leycetre / and he after
reigned nobly and with great honor.

How Cadewan king of Leycetre and Elfryde king of Northumberlonde were friends
/ and of the debate yt after was between Edwyn and Cadwalyn that were both
their sons.
ANd after that this battle was done yt Brytons assembled them and went thens
and came to Leycetre / and made there Cadewan yt was Brecinals sone king of
Leycetre and of all the country And he took homages and feauters of all the
folk of the country. And after that he assembled a great host / and said he
would go in to Northumberlonde / to destroy king Elfryde and slay him if he
might And when he was come thither / friends went so between them that they
accorded them in this manerr / that Elfryde should hold all the land fro
Northu^berlonde to Scotlonde^ and Cadewan should have all y^ land a this side
Humbre to y^ South / and after they were good trendes all their life / and loved
as they had been brethern. And this Elfryde had a sone called Edwyn yt held all
the land of Northumberlonde after his faders death as his fader had hold all
his life time. And Cadewan had an other sone called Cadwalin yt held his faders
land as ^e it held while he was a lyue^ and these loved as brethern. And the
love lasted betwixt them but oonly two year / and after began debate betwixt
them through a simple enuyo^^s cosyn of Cadwalins. called Bryens / so yt they
assembled a great host in both parties. And at the last it befell that
Cadwalin was dyscomfyted / and Edwyn him pursued and drove hy^ fro place to
place / so at the last he fled in to Irlond. And the other destroyed and
pylled his land / and cast down castles and burnt his manners / and departed
all Cadwalins land among his friends. And long time after came Cadwalin again
fro Irlonde with a strong power / and in plain battle slew Edwyn and all
his friends / and namely tho that withhelde his lands by Edwyns ye^te.

How king Os walde was slain thorugh king Cadwalin and Peanda and how Oswy
that was saint Oswaldes brother reigned after him and slew Peanda.
AS Edwyn was slain. Offris his sone undertook the war against Cadwalin his
came so yt this Offris deyed during y^ war. And after y^ death of this Offris
tho reigned a gentyl christian man y^ much loved god almighty yt had all the
land of Northumberlon by heritage / that was called Os walde / and he was
king of all y^ land. But for as much as he was friend to Edwyn / and held a
great part of y^ land of Cadwalin. This same Cadwalin warred upon him and
drove him toward Scotlonde. And when Cadwalin saw yt he would not abide.
Cadwalin would no longer him pursue / but took some of ^is folk to Peanda his
brother in law and prayed him to pursue after Oswalde / till y^ he werr taken
and slain / and Cadwalin turned home again. When Os walde ^erde these tidings
y^ Cadwalin turned home again / he would no longer flee but abode Peanda and
yaue him batayll^ and Peanda was dyscomfyted and fled / and came again to
Cadwalin and said / yt he would de never hold oo foot of land of him / but if
so were that he would avenge hy^ of Oswalde. Cadwalin let assemble a great
host for to fight with Oswald so that he and Peanda came to Northumberlonde
and yaue battle unto Oswalde And in the same battle was Oswalde slain and
his heed smyte^ of / and after he was entered at the abbay of Berdenay in
which place god had wrought for hy^ many a fair miracle / both there and
else where. And anon Oswy his brother seized all the land in to his hand
that was this Oswaldes. And the folk of Northumberlonde loved him wonderly
well / and held him for their lord. But he had men of his ky^ne worthy enough
that would have departed the land / and they warred together well. And for as
much as they were not strong enough / they came to Peanda and prayed him of
help and socour. And behyght hy^ of that land largely upon this covenant /
that he would them govern and help / and counseyll. Peanda herd their prayer
/ and so spoke with Cadwalin / that he should ordeyne a great host / and fast
ordeyne hy^ in to Northumberlonde for to fight with Oswy. And Oswy was a meke
man / and much loved peace and charity / and prayed Peanda of love and pens /
and profred him of gold and silver great plente. And this Peanda was so proud
that he nolde grant him peace for no manner thing / but for all thing he would
with hy^ fight. So at the last there was set a day of battle. And Oswy
ever trusted upon god / and Peanda trusted to much upon pride and upon his
host that he had And together they smote egrely / but Peanda was anon
dyscomfyted and slain And this was after the Incarnacyon of our lord Ihesu
Christ.v.C.lv. year. And this Oswy reigned.xxviij. year. And a king that was
called Oswyne / that was Peandaes cosyn warred upon him and together fought /
but Oswy had the victory of Oswyne. And Oswyne was dyscomfyted and slain / and
lies at Tynnemouth.

How king Cadwaldre that was Cadwalins sone reigned after his fader / and was
the last king of Brytons.
AFter the death of Cadwalin reigned his sone Cadwaldre well and nobly. And his
mother was the sister of Peanda. And when he had reigned.xij. year / he fell in
to a great syknenesse / and then^e was there a great dyscorde between the
lords of the land / that every of them warred upon other. And yet in y^ time
there fell so great derth and scarsyte of corn and other vitaylles in this
land / yt a man might go.iij. or.iiij. days fro town to town yt he should
not find to bye for gold ne silver bread. wine. ne none other vitayle
wherewith a man might live. But oonly the people lived by rotes of herbs / for
other living had they none / so much was it faylled all abowte / fysshes /
wild beestes / and all other thing so that yet to this mysauenture / there
fell so great mortalyce and pestylente among the people by the corrupcion of
y^ air that the living people suffysed not to burye the deed bodies. For they
deyed so suddenly / both great and small / lord and servant / in etynge going
and speaking / they fell down and deyed / so yt never was herd of more
sodeyne death among the people. For he yt went for to burye the deed body /
with the same deed body was buried. And so they that might flee / fled and
forsook their lands and houses / as well for the great hungre / derth and
scarsyte of corn and other vitayll / as for y^ great mortalyte and pestylence
in the land / and went in to other lands for to save their lives and left
the land all deserte and wast / so yt there was no man for to travail and
tylthe the land. So that the land was barayne of corn and all other fruytes
for de^a^^e of tyllyers / and this mysauenture dured.xi. year and more / that
no man might ere ne sow.

How Cadwaldre went out of this land in to little Brytayne.
CAdwaldre saw great hu^gre mortalyte and pestylence / and the land all poor
/ and faylynge corns and other vytaylles / and his folk perysshed / and saw
also y^ most party of his land all wasted and void of people. He
appareylled him and his folk that were left a live / and passed over in to
little Brytayne with a little navy unto king Alayne that he much loved / that
was his cosyn / and that his fader had much loved in his time. And as they
sailed in the sea / he made much lamentacyon / and so did all tho that were
with him and said (Dedistinos dn^e tan^ oues escarum. et in gentibus
dispersisti nos)

ANd then began Cadwaldre to complain him to his folk pytously and said.
Alas said he. to us wretches and caytyues is sorrow for our great sins / the
which we would not amend us while we had space / and now repentance is comen
upon us through mysauenture / which chaced us out of our rea me and propre
soil. And out of the which s^^tyme Romans. Scotts. Saxons / neither Danys /
might not exyle us. But what auaylleth it now to us that before time / often
times have gotten many other lands / sith it is not y^ will of god that we
abide and dwell in our own land. God that is very Judge that all things
knows before they ben do^e or made / he sees that we would not cesse of our
sins / and that our enmyes might not us ne our lygnage exyle fro / and out of
our reame. He would that we amend us of our folyes / and that we see our
propre defawtess. And therefore has showed to us wrath / and woll chastyse us
of our misdeeds. Sith that he does us without batayl / or strength of our
enmyes / by great companyes wretchedly to leave our reame and propre land.
Torn again ye Romans / torn again ye Scotts / torn again ye Saxons /
torn again ye Frau^soys. Now shows to you Brytayne all deserte / the which
your power might never make deserte / ne yet our power has not put us now in
exyle But oonly the power of the (...) almighty / whom we have often offended
by our folyes / the which we would not leave until he chastysed us by dyuyne
power. Among the words and lamentacyon that the king Cadwaldre made to his
folk / they arrived in little Brytayne / and came to king Aley ne before
said. And the king received him with great Joy / and made him to be served
wonder nobly. And there abode they long time after. The English people that
were left a live and were escaped the great hungre and mortalyte / lived in the
best wise y^ they might And much people sprange and came of them. And they
sent in to Saron^e where that they were borne to their frondes for men /
wymmen / and childern to restore the cytees with people and to wnes that were
all void of people / and for to labor / traueylle / and tylthe the earth When
the Saxons berde these trdynges / they came in to the land wonder thycke in
great companyes / and herberowed themself in the cou^^er all about where that
they would / for they found no man them for to let ne withstonde. And so
they wexed and multeplyed greatly. And used the manners and customs of the
cou^^re whereof they were come. And they used also the laws and the langages
and speech of their own land that they came fro. And also they changed all
the names of cytees / towns / castelles / and brughs / and yaue them names and
called them as they now ben called And they held the Countees. Baronages and
lordshyps in manner as the Brytons before time had compassed them / And among
other great companyes that came from Germayne in to this land / came y^ noble
queen that was called Sexburga with men and wy^men without nombre. And arrived
in the country of Northumberlonde / and took the land from Albion unto
Cornewaylle for her and for her folk. For there was none that might them let
/ for all was desolate and vayde of people / but it were a few poor Brytons
that were left on mountayns and woods until that time. And fro that time
forth lost the Brytons this reame for all their days. And the Euglysshe
people began to regne / and departed the land between them. And they made many
kings about by diverse parties of the land as here ben diuyded The first of
Westsexe / the second Mercheurtche / the third Estangle / the fourth kente /
the fyfth Southsex. All those reigned in this land after y^ Cadwaldre was
passed out of this land / and dwelled in little Brytayne with king Alayne his
cosyn and true friend. And when he had long dwelled there / and had know^^^ge
that the mortalyte and pestylence was ouerpassed and that the land was
repleaysshed again with people / he thought to tome again in to his land. And
prayed king Aleyne his cosyn of socour and help that he might be restored
again to his own propre reame and fyrfst dygnyte / And king Aleyne granted
him his asking. Then did he appareylle him to take his way and vyage in to
this land. And prayed god almighty denoutely that he would make to him
demonstracyon / if his prayer to this land were to him pleasant or none / for
against the will of god almighty he would no thing do. When he had thus
deuoutely made his prayer / a boys fro heaven to him said. And badde him leave
that Journey away in to England / and that he should go to the pope of Rome /
for it was not the will of almighty god that the Brytons should regne more in
Brytayne / ne never recover it unto the time of the prophecye that Merlyn said
before be fulfylletd. And that should never be unto the time were come / that
the relyques of his body shall be brought fro Rome and translated in to
Brytayne / And when the relykes of other saints that have been hid for the
persecucion of the paynem folk shall be found and and opely showed / then
shall they recover their land again / the which they have so long time lost
through their deserts. When Cadwaldre had herd this answer / he meruaylled
greatly and told it to king Aleyne. Then king Aleyne did send for the
clergy of his land / and made them to bring the stories and prophecyes that
Me^lyn and Sybyll had said in their prophecyes. And when he knew that the
prophecye that festom had prophesied of the Egle. and other prophecyes accorded
to the dy^yn answer that Cadwaldre had herd. He counseylled him / and right
faithfully desired him to leave his people and his navy / and submytte him to
the dyspolicyon of god / and do all that the angel had commanded him. Then
Cadwaldre called Ynor his sone / and Yuori his cosyn that was his systers sone
/ and said to them. Takes said he my folk and my navy that is here all ready /
and pass in to Walys and be ye lords of Brytons that no dishonor come to
them by interrupcyon of the Paynem folk for defaute of lords. And then he
himself left his reame of Brytayne and his folk for ever more / and took his
way unto the pope of Rome Sergius / the which worshypped him much / and so
he was confessyd / and took penance for his sins. And he had not long
dwelled there that he ne deyed / the.xij. Kalendis in May / the year of
grace.v.C.lxxix.

How king Offa was sovereign above all the kings of England / and how every
king warred upon other.
IT befell so that all the kings in that time that were in the land. as they
of Westsex. Marchenrych. Estangle / of Kente / and of Southsex / and of other
c^stes / each warred upon other. And he that was most mighty took the land of
him that was most feblest. But there was a king among them that was called
Offa / yt was saint Oswaldes brother. This Offa conquered all the kings of the
land / and reigned above them all. And so great was the war in every country
between kings / that no man might wit how the land went. But abbotes /
pryours / and men of Relygyon wrote the lives and deeds of kings / and how
long every of them reigned and in what country / and in what manner every
king deyed / and of bishops also. And thereof made great books and let call
them Chronicles. And the good king Alured had that book in his ward. And let
bring it unto Wynchestre / and let it be fast tacked to a pylar that men
should it not remeue / ne bear it thens / so that every man should it see and
thereupon look. For therein ben the lives of all the kings that ever were in
England.

How the king of Northumberlonde Osbryght forlaye the wife of Buerne Bocarde
through strength / and after this Buerne conquered the king with power and
strength.
ANd thus it befell in the same time / that there was a king in
Northumberlonde that was called Osbryght / and soiourned at York. And this
king went him upon a day in to a wood him for to dysporte. And as he came
again / he went pryuely in to a good man's house / that was called Buerne /
and the good man of that place was gone that time to the set. For oftentimes
there he was wont to spy thieves and robbers / that oftentimes were wont to
come in to the land / to rob / brenne / and slay. The lady that was Buernes
wife was a wonder fair woman. And the king came unto her when that her
husbonde was absente / And she trusted none harm unto the king / and welcomed
him with much honor / and worthily him served in all thing. When the king
had eten / he took the lady by the hand and ladde her in to a chamber and
said. He would speak with her a counseyll. And all the folk he made void fro
the chamber / save oonly the lady and he. But the lady wist not wherefore he it
did till that he had done all his will. And when he had done this deed / he
tormed again to York. And the lady he left there sort weeping for the deed
that the king to her had done. And when her lord was come home and saw her
weep and such sorrow and morning make / he axed of her what she had done /
and why she made such sorrow. S^re she said / subtylly and falsely the king
Osbryght has do me shame and vylanye against my will. And told him all the
truth how the king had forlayne her with sh^ngth / wherefore she said she had
lever to be deed than to live. Fair love be still said he / for against
strength feblenesse is little worth / and therefore of me shall thou never the
less be loved and namely for thou haste told me the truth. And if almighty
god grant to me my life I shall the avenge. This Buerne was a great man and a
mighty lord / and was well beloved and great friends had. And let send for
the grettest lords of the loud / and to them made his complaynt of the
despyte that the king to him had done and said / he would be avenged how so
ever it were. And all his friends cou^seylled him that he should goo unto York
there that the king was him to defye. And Buerne took his main and came to
the king. When the king him saw / he called him curtously Buerne by name.
And Buerne him answered and to hy^ said. Sit I you defye / and yield up
feautees homages and lands / and as much as I have holden of you / and fro
this time forward I will never of the no thing hold. And so he departed fro
the king without more speech or any abiding / and took leave of his friends
and went in to Denmark / and playned to the king Godern / and told him of
the despyte of yt the king Osbryght to him had done of his wife. and prayed him
of socour and help him for to avenge When king Godern of Denmark and the danys
had herd the complaynt of this Buerne / and the prayer that he badde / they
were right wonder glad in their hertes / for as much as they might find a
cause for to go in to England for to war upon Englesshemen / and for to
avenge Buerne of the despyte that the king Osbryght had done unto his wife.
And for as much as Buerne was sybbe unto the king of Denmark / anon they
let ordeyne a great host of men and let ordeyne them ships / and as much
as them neded for to have to that vyage. And when all the host was ready / the
king made his two brethern chyef capytayns / that were noble knights of body
and also bold. That one was called Hunga / and that other Hubba.

How the Danys took York / and slew the king Osbryght / and soon after
slew king Elle.
AS all was ready the two bredern took leave of the king Gode^n. and went
toward the sea for to pass over in to England as fast as they might speed.
Now is Buerne so well comforted and fast hyed hy^ with the Danys yt they ben
arrived in the North country / and comen through out Holdernes / and destroyed
all y^ country / and brenned towns / and robbed folk / and slew all that
they might take till that they came unto York. And when king Osbryght saw
them come / he took all his people that he had with him and came out of the
cite and faught with them / but no foyson he ne had against them / and much of
the people that there was were slain on both parties. And king Osbryght
himself there was slain / and the cite anon was take and the Danys went in.
And there was also an other king in Northumberlonde / that Buernes friends had
chose and held him for king / a man that was called Elle / for as much as
they would not to king Osbryght he attendau^t / for the despyte that he had
done unto Buerne their to syn. It befell thus that the king Elle was gone in to
the wood him for to dyfporte / and of venyson some he had taken. And as he sat
in the wood at meet / to a knight he said. We have well spedde and much
venyson taken. And with that word came in a man and to him said / if ye so much
of venyson have won / an hundred times somoche more there ayenste have ye
lost. For all this country the Danys have gotten / and taken the cite of York
/ and against you shall it hold / that never ye shall come therein / and for so
much they have slain king Osbryght / When king Elle herd these words / he
let assemble all the folk of the country / and ordained all the power that
he might have. And would have gotten the town of York with strength. But the
Danys came out anon and yaue him a strong battle. And slew the king Elle
and the most part of the people that he had brought with him. And the same
place there they were slain / shall ever more be called Elle crofte / and that
place is a little from York. And tho rested the Danys never till y^ they had
conquered all Northumberlonde. And in that country they made Wardeynes / and
went further in to the land / and took Notyngham. And there they abode all
the winter and did all the sorrow that they might. And after when Somer time
came they remeued from Notyngham and came in to Nicholl and Lyndesey / and to
Holonde. For no man might them withstand / so much power and strength they
had.

How saint Edmonde the king was martyred.
ANd so far had the Danys passed from country to country. and ever more
brennynge and robbynge and destroyenge all that they might till they came unto
Tethforde. And in that country they found a Christian king / that much loved
god and his works that was called Edmonde. And he was a king of Northfolke and
South folk. This saint Edmonde king or deyned as much folk as he might / and
fought with the Danys / but he and his folk were dyscomfyted / and the king
himself driven unto the castle of Framelynham. And the Danys him purse wed /
and came unto the same castle / And when king Edmonde saw that the castle
might not them withstand / he came against them / with whom the Danys first
did speak. And anon they axed of hy^ where king Edmonde was Now forsooth said
he when I was in the castle / there was the king / and when I went out of
the castle he went out also / and whether he shall escape or deep / at gods
will must it all be. When saint Edmonde had named god / by that word wyste
they well all yt it was himself. And anon Hubba and hungar took him and said /
that he should god forsake and all christian laws / as many other had done him
before. And saint Edmonde said that he would never but rather he would suffer
death for gods love and his laws to. Tho took they king Edmonge and bond
him unto a tree / and made their archers to shote at him with arowes / till that
his body stycked as full of arowes as an orchen is full of pre^ / kes. But for
all the pain that they hy^dyde he would never god forsake. And in the same
pain and torment he deyed / and betoke his soul unto almighty god / And when
they saw that he was deed / they smote of his heed. And of this manner as ye
have herd was saint Edmonde martred.

How Hubba and Hungar took the town of Redynge.
SO when Saint Edmonde was martyred. Hungar and Hubba yede thens with all the
Danys unto Redyng And as they went thytherwarde they burnt towns and cytees
/ and slew all christian people that would not forsake: god / and cast down
chirches and came to Redynge and took the town and there held them till that
the king Edelf of Westsex came thither with all his power for to take y^
towns. Tho came out the Danys for to give battle to Edelf / and at that
battle was slain an earl of the Danys that was called Sidiak. Upon the morrow
came king Eldred and his brother Alured with a strong power and a great
host. And the king Edelf came again that had foughten the day before to
that bataylle. And the Danyo tho came out for to fight with them / And the
bataylle was wonder strong / for many a man was there slain / and the Danys
that day had the vyctorye / And the king Eldred and his brother Alutrd yt day
were dyscomfyted. But the fourth day afterward / the Danys and y^ English
fought together an other time upon Elkedene / and there was slain a king of
Denmark yt was called Rafin / and four earls of great power. And yt day had
the Danys shame / for they we redryue^ unto Engilfelde. And the.xv. day after
the Danys and the English men fought an other time at Rafynge and there were
the Englysshmen dyscomfyted / and from thens a dane that was called Roynt went
to redynge with his host and destroyed all that he might take. And king Eldred
faught with him / but he was wounded sore wherefore he deyed / And he reigned
but.v. year / and lies at Womborn.

Circa annu^ dm^.iiij.C.xlix.
LEo the first was Emperor after Marcianus.xvij. year. In his time were the

ne hate should leave of to say his dyuyne service in the church / except the
mass. And he cursyd the emperor Anastasius / for he was an heretyke / and it is
written of him / that afterward he turned for dread to y^ opinion of the
Emperor. And he is called the second evil famed pope that is in (Catholico
pontificu^) And before him was Liberius famed in heresye.

And Symachus preualid the which loved the clergy and poor men and for
Paschalius the deaken Cardynall held against Symachus with the part of

the batthes after his death / as Gregory says in his book of Dyalogis. This
man ordained that (Gloria in excelsis) should be said every sunday and feestes
of martyrs.

Nota That England was long time Crystened before France.

the Romans out of almoost.ij.M. books and.iij.C. verses over long and
acco^dynge in to oo volumen of xij. books and called it Justinian. He made also
the Digestes and divided them in to three bok^s. and Bonifaus the second was
pope after Felix two year and little of him is written. Iohanes the second was
pope after Bonifarius and this man had a great stryf with Iustinianus
the emperor / wheder that Christ was of two natures or one. The pope said / he
had two natures. One of god / and an other of man. The Emperor said other
consent to us / or thou shall go in to perpetuell exyle. The pope answered. I
desire to come to Iustunanus the most christian Emperor / but as me seems I
have found Dyoclesyan the persecutour of christian man. But certainly I dread
not thy malice / ne I frir not thy threty ages Then the Emperor meked by
^nself and fell down to the gr^^lde / and asked mercy and absolucyon.

was Emperor after Justinius.vij. year. This man was a virtuous man. He yaue
Innumerable good to poor men. In so much many times that his wife chydde with
him and said that he cast away the goods of the Empire as stones. And he
answered again and said. I trust in god that our chestes shall never lack of
money / and we put tresour in to heaven. And upon a certain day when he went
by his palace at Constantynople / he saw in the marbyll pament a cross graven

Epitaphi.. Magna tuis monimenta pater benedicte reliquis: virtutu^ titulus and
decus (...) dolor. Pelagius was Emperor after Benedictus.v. year. In his time
Rome was besyeged by the Lombardes / and little he did in his days. Mauricius
was Emperor after Tyberius.xxi. year. This man was a very christian man and
subdued Persas and Armenias / and in the later end of his days / he dyscorded
with saint Gregory / and intended to have slain him. And then appeared a man
in Rome clothed in a relygyous habyte / holding a naked swe^de in his hand /
and cried about the Cy^^ in this wise. The Emperor shall (...) destroyed. The
which the Empero^^ herd / and he corrected himself of his trespaas / and
prayed to god to withdra^ we his sentence. To whom our (...) apperyd in his
sleep and said. Will y^ (...) I spare the now or in time to come. (...) he was
a lover of wretches / and (...) give me here my reward. Then (...) he
Emperor after many a day. (...) when he should have corrected his (...) tes
for the extorcyon that they did (...) asked him why that he would not pay
them their wages. And so they fell at va ryaunce / and those Foka for to be
Emperor and slew hy^ and three sons. This time saint Austyn came in to
England and ordained two Archebysshops / that is to say / of London / and of
York by the commandment of say^e ^regory. And ^emembre y^ many times is made
^encyon of diverse regyons and countries / that oftyme they have be turned to
the faith For always the faith abode not in them for diverse causes. So it is of
England. France. Persia. Iewery. And in this thing Rome was pryueleged / for
the faith of Peter never failed. focas was Emperor after Maurici his may ster
/ whom he and other slew. And by can se he began evil he ended naught. For in
his days the Romans faught stron gely against the Persees / and the Romans
were dyscomfyted and lost many a prouyn ce. And at the last he was overcome and
slain of Heraclius. For as he did unto other men / so he was done unto.

commanded to be said. He renewed and made all the offices of the church in a
fair and a more compendyous manner / the which abides yet unto this day /
and is called Gregoria nu^. And shortly for to conclude on this holy man /
man's tongue can not express lightly the louynges of this man / what in
wrytynges / and also in example of virtuous deeds. Saninianus was pope after
Gregory one year and.v. months. this man ordained y^ tyngynge of belles at
the hours of the day / but this man bachyted saint Gregory for his lyberalyte
y^ he had to poor men / and thought he see saint Gregory rebuked hy^ th^^es
for it. And the fourth time he lay in his bed / and thought saint Gregory
smote him on the heed / and he waked and dered anon. This was the third pope
among all the popes / the which is noted to deye dredefull death. Bonifacius
the third was pope after Saninianus.viij months. He ordained that none but
white clothes should be put upon the awter. Bonifacius the fourth was pope
four year and.viij. months / this man putchaced of y^ Emperor Focas y^
church of saint Peter of Rome should be y^ heed of all the church in the
world. For before Constantynople was the heed church. Also he gate license
that the church called Panton the which was dedycate to the honor of
Neptunus and other falls gods / where christian men many times were slain of
deuylles / might be dedycate to the worship of all saints in heaven. This man
ordained that monks might use the offyet of prechynge / crystenynge / and
confessing. Heraclius was Emperor after Focas.xiij. year. And in the third
year of his regne. Cosdias the king of Perse burnt Jerusalem and other
worshypfull places. Zachary the patryarke with other much people he took in
captyuyte The part of the holy cross the which Eleyne left there he took
with him in to his country. But the.xij. year of Heraclius. Cosdras was slain
of Heraclius and the cross was brought again / the people were delivered. And
when Heraclies would have entered the cite proudly / the yates of the cite by
power of god chytte therself / and y^ Emperor meked him to god above and y^
yates opened. And then was the feast of the exaltaco^n of ye cross made.
Deus dedit was pope after Bonifacius three year / this was an holy man For on a
certain day when he kyssed a lepre / anon y^ lepre was hole. This time a
Cyteyzin of London through the mocyon of Ethelbryght builded a church of saint
Peter in the West part of London / in a place yt was called Thorneye.

Circa annu^ dm^.vi.C.xliiij.
BOnifacius the fyfthe was pope after Deus dedit five year. The which ordained
that no man should be taken out of the chircheyerde. And little else of him is
written.

Nota Machomitum.
Machomite the duke of Sarrasyns and Turks was this time. And he was y^
dysceyuer of all the world / a false prophet / the messenger of the devil.
The forgooer of Antecryst / the fulfyller of hererye / and of all falls men the
meruayllest. Of whon the dominacion thus began / There was a certain famous
clerk at Rome / and could not speed in his matters that he desired to have
spedde in. Then he receded from Rome over y^ see / and procured many a man to
have gone with him. Among whom was this Machomyte a great man of wit. And
this clerk promised him to make him duke of the country if he would be gyded
after him. There he nourysshed a douue / and put all the corn y^ the douue ete
in Machomytes eere / and so this douue had never no met but in his eere. The
foresaid clerk on a day called the people and meued them to chese such a
prince as y^ holy ghost would show to them in likeness of douue. And anon
this clerk secretly let flee this douue / y^ which after his old custom
that he was wont to / fell anon to y^ sholder of Machomyte and put his bylle
in his eere. And the people saw this / anon he was chosen duke of that people
of Corosame / he said that he was the very prophet of god. Then he made a
book of his law that was called Alkaron. But he did it by Informaco^n of three
of his masters. To whom the devil mynystred the auctoryte and the conning.
The first master was a Jew a great Astronomyer and a Nygromancer. The second
was John^ de Anthiochia. The third was Sergius an heretyke. And these three
made an ungracious law and an unhappy. And what some ever was hard of believe
and noyous to do / they left that out of the law / and they put that thing
in the law / the which the worldly men were prone and ready to do. That is to
say. Glotony / lechery / rapyne / and such other. And also this Machomyte
ordained that a man should have as many wives as he might occupye and find /
and refuse them twyes or thryes / or four times / and take them again / And
many meruayllous and falls things he made in his law / the which were to
long to reherce here. But they be plain in his book of Alkaron. And ever he
wrote in his book / that our lord spoke to Machomyte his prophet / saying on
this wise / or on this. Thus by his false means he dysceyued the people. And
when his masters and he had made this that was so delectable. He wrote it in a
bo^^ with letters of gold. And also he nourysshed a mighty camel secretly in
a pryue place / and aloonly with the ho^des of Machomyte was always fed / And
there pryuely he tied this book of the law that he had made about the camels
neck / and put this camel forth on a time in to the field before day. And this
camel Ioyed in his lybertee / for he was never lose before. And he would suffer
no man to come and touch him. And so there was a great fame of such a camel
/ and all the people ran to see hy^ Among whom was this Machomyte. But when
the camel saw him y^ had fed him always. Anon he ran unto him. And he
had taught this camel before time to fall down on his knees and lycke his
hondes. And so he did before all that people. The people then cried and said
/ that there was a very ensample that he was the true prophet of god. Then
they prayed Machomyte to open that holy book with his holy hondes / the which
was sent from heaven evermore to be kept. In the which book is showed how the
people shall worship god. And Machomyte said / this book was written with angels
hand / So by these falls means / he turned to his law all the land of Perse
/ and all the Erst Imperyall against Heraclium the Emperor. And he occupied
unto the end of Alexandre and Egypt. Libia. Arabia and Siria. Then after he
enfected all Affrycam. And but the grace of god withstode him / he had enfected
all Spain and France. And many other things he did / which were to much
to write in this book.

COnstantyne the third / the sone of Heraclij was Emperor.xxvij. year. This
Constantyne was a great tyrant and a cursyd man / and an heretyke Falls /
subtle / and odyous to christian men Ne he gaaf no place to pope Mertyne / And
he raised a great host against the Lombardes. And there he lost the field /
and fled unto Rome. And honorably was received of the pope Vit^llianus / and
other of the cite. And he rewarded not them like after their merytes as a
prince should have done. But used forth tyranny and heresye. Wherefore at the
last he was slain of his own knights in a bath / the which would no longer
suffer his tyranny. And so he wretchedly lived / and deyed unhappily.
Martinus the first was pope after Theodor.vi. year. This Martinus was a very
holy man / and strongely strove for the faith of god. And when he sange mass
on a certain day at the awter / there pursewed him to slay him a man that was
called Spatarius of Olymphe. And when he would have smyten him / he was blind
suddenly. This same man called a Synodi in the cite of Rome / and dampened
Syrum. Alexandru^ Sergium. Pyrum / and Paulum heretykes. Wherefore Constantyne
the Emperor expled him / and he deyed a saint. Eugenius a Romayne was pope
after Martyne almoost three year / and was an holy man / but of him little acts
is written. Vitellianus was pope after him. (...) year. This man made the song
that the Romans use / and accorded it also with the organys. And he also had
the grace of the Emperor / the which was wroth with his predecessors.
Nevertheless afterward he stood not in his conco^de. Ne hitherto I could not
find / that ever the church of Rome had fully after the death of Constantyne
y^ mighty / the lordshyp of the cite and of other the which he yaue to the
church.

Anno dm^.vi.C.xliiij.
ADeodatus a Romayne was pope after Vitellianus four year / and in his days
was translated the body of saint Benedictus / with the body of Saint Scolastica
his sister fro the hylle of Cassin unto the monasterys of Floriecens nyghe
Aurelian. Consta^ tyne the fourth was Emperor after his fader Constantyne the
cursyd man This Constantyne was a good man and hated heretykes over all thing.
The church he repeyred / and grace he reconsyled again to the church of Rome
/ and he with the pope gadred together the.vi. general Synodus / in the which
was granted to priests of Greece / for to use their leyffull wives / and to
the priests of the Eest for cause of great hete / but not to those of the West
party by no means For they amytted chastyte in the time of saint Gregory. And
every man may auertyse and pondre how much the goodness of a prince is worth /
to the quyete state of the church / and to the promocyon of the faith / and
also the contrary / how much the malice of a prince hurts that thing. These
two Constantyns the fader and the sone showed openly. For in the faders days
the church never had rest / and in the sons time it was quyete. Yet
nevertheless our lord suffered the Sa^rasyns and the Bulgars to enter in this
Emporours land / that he them might not withstand / but that he made his peace
with them / and paid to them yearly a truage / so myghtely preuaylled that
cursyd sect of Machomyte / and after he deyed blessydly. Nota.

That there were.vi. general Synodus / and most pryncypall of the which the
auctoryte is equal to the gospel for the truth of the gospel is declared by
them against the.vi. pryncypall heresies the which strongely trowbled the
church for the subtyltee of those heretykes to dysceyue simple men. This time
deyed saint Cedde of Lytchefelde / y^ third year of his bysshopryche. Demus a
Romayne was pope after Adeodatus three year. Of this man little is written.
Bonifacius was pope after him / and little of him is written / but that he lived
like a priest. Agatho was popope after him / and he was a very holy man. For on
a day when he kyssed a lepre / the lepre anon was made hole /

Iste et de consensu principis iussit celebrari sextu^ sinodu^ apud
ostantinopoli CC.lxxx. ep^orum. in qua asseret duas naturas et duas voluntates
esse in xp^o.

Leo the second was pope after Agatho three year / this Leo was an holy man and
suffycyentely taugh in latin and greek / this man ordained that the pax should
be yeuen after Agnus dei / and deyed a blessed man. Benedict^s the second was
pope after Leo almoost three year This man about all thing was virtuous / and
his name accorded with his deeds. And in his time was a great pestylence.
Iustinianus the second was Emperor this time / and he was a very good man / a
prudent and a large / and he encreaced the Empire of Rome myghtly / but but he
charged the office of the church over much. Many laws he made / and after
was not good / he intended to have let y^ decrees of the.vi. Synodus /
wherefore the.x. year of his Empire he was taken of Leo the prince of Patricio
and Tyberio / and they cut of his nose and his tongue and exyled him to
Crysona^. There was then turbacyon in y^ church for strive and heretykes. And
know all men when varyaunce falls betwixt great lords / then errors ben
multeplyed / for there is no man corrected them / therefore that is oftentyme
preued in the church. Then after fell a varyaunce betwixt Leo and Tyberio.
And Tybereo preuaylled / and he exyled Leo / and cut of his nose the third
year of his regne / and reigned for him. Iustinianus fled to the Sarrasyns and
the Bulgars / the which restored him again to his Empire / and slew Leo and
Tyberio / the which favored heretykes. Then this same Iustinianus reformed
himself to the church of god / and had great repentance But he venged him to
cruelly on his adversaries / so that he would have slay (...) their Innocent
childern. Therefore he was slain with his sone / of Phylyp whom he exyled.

Anno dm^.vi.C.lxxxiiij.
IOha^nes the fyfth was pope after Benedictus ^o year / he was a good man / but
he decessid anon. Zeno was pope after him. And he was a very holy man / for he
would not meddle with seculer matters. And in beauty he was an angel / quyete in
virtues / and meke in soul / and very demure in langage of his relygyons life /
this man was chosen at the last with one accord of the church and lay men.
But there was a great distynccyon / for the Clergy intended to have chose Perys
the Archebysshop. And the host of alye men would have had Theodorum a priest.
But at the last the holy ghost turned the will of all this people in to this
holy man. Sergins was pope.ix. year. This man was virtuous and comendable in
his life. And in his eleccyon a great dyscorde was / for one party of the
clergy chose Theodoru^ / and an other party Paschalem. But as our lord would
at the last they turned all to this man. This man translated the body of saint
Leo. He also found a great part of y^ holy cross by miracle. And he
crystened Cadwaldre the last king of Brytayne. He commanded (Anus dei) to be
said or song thryes at mass. And decessyd blessydly. Nota.

Saint Beda the worshypfull priest was this time a great man of fame in
England / the which was take the.vij. year of his ^ege to Benedict the abbot
Gyrwyen^ monastery to be taught. And then after to Colfrido the abbot after
the death of Benedict. And at the.xix. year of his aege he was made Deaken of
the bishop of York. And at.xxx. year he was made priest / in the which year
he began to ^yte. So he continued all the time of his life in that monastry / in
geuynge his labors to writing and scripture to be expowned. He made.lxxviij.
books / the which he nombreth in the end of his English book. This man was
ever in labor other in prayer or in singing daily in the church / or to
learn or teache or write. For which thing men may Judge by reason that he was
never at Rome / all though some say he went to Rome that he might see that his
books accorded with the doctrine of the holy church. But it was certain that
he was blind / and went to preche / and had a servant that was not good /
and made him to preche to a mighty multitude of stones and said / that they
were men. And when all his sermon was done / the stones answered and said.
Amen. But that he went to Rome thryes / and found written three arres / three
effes / and e^powned them / it was never found in no book of auctoryte. There
was after the talking of the people such a writing on the yates of Rome (RRR.
FFF) And such an exposition (Regna Rome Ruent. Ferro Flama Fame) But it is
certain that Beda was desired to come to Rome by the wytynge of Serg^us the
pope to Colfrido his abbot. And this Beda translated y^ gospel of saint Johan
in to English tongue / and dyssessyd blessydly. The fame says that now he
lies at Deuelyn with saint Cuthberte / and there is buried with him the
knowledge of y^ deeds of England almoost to the conquest. Leo the second was
Emperor / and little of him is written. Liberius was Emperor after him vij.
year / he rose against Leo and entered his kingdom / and kept him in prison as
long as he reigned. In his time Iustinianus the second which in old time was
exyled to Crysonam openly said / he would recover his Empire again. Wherefore
the people of that country / for the love of Liberius / were about to slay
that Iustinianus. Wherefore he fled to the prince of Thurcorum and wedded his
sister. And thorugh help of his brother and the Bulgars he recovered his
Empire and slew Liberius and Leo the usurper of his reame. And as many times
almoost as he wyped any drope from his nose / the which they kytte of / so
many times he made one of his enmyes to be slain. Leo the third was pope
after Sergius two year. This man was made pope by the power of the Romans and
was not put in the nombre of popes / for he evil entered / but he did none
evil. Johannes the.vi. was pope after him a Greek. And he was a martyr / but
of whom and wherefore the cause is not found in hystoryes. It is said / that it
was of the dukes of Lombardy / for they were enmyes to the church myghtely.
Ioha^nes the.vij. a Romayne was pope after him three year / but no thing of him
is written. Iustinianus was Emperor again with his sone Tyberius.vi. years. And
this was he the which was reued the Empire before by Leo / And when this man
was restored again he took him to the right faith / and worshypped the pope
Constantyne. And certainly he destroyed Creson y^ place where he was exyled
unto / and all that dwelled in it / except y^ childern he slew them And he
came again an other time to have slain the Innocents. And the men of that
country made them a capytayne / a certain man that was called Philyp an
outlawe / the which anon went to him in battle / and slew him for his
outrageous cruelnesse against those children. Sysinnius was pope twenty days /
and then was great strife / and he decessyd / but little of him is written.
Constantyne was pope after him.vij year. This man was a very meke man and so
blessed / that of all men he was beloved. He went over the sea to Iustinianus
the Emperor / and was received with great honor / and deyed a blessed man.
Philyp the second was Emperor one year / the which fled in to Scicilia for
the host of the Romans / And he was an heretyke / and commanded all pyctures
of saints for to be destroyed. Wherefore the Romans cast away his coin / ne
would not receive no money that his name or image were written upon. Anastasius
the second after he had slain Philyp was Emperor three year. This man was a
christian man / and he lived well. But by cause he put out Philyps eyes / and
slew him afterward. And therefore Theodosius faugh against him and overcame him
/ and then he was made a priest / and lived so quyetly.

Anno dm^.vij.C.xiiij.
GRegorius the second was pope after Constantyne.xvij. year / this Gregorius
was a chaste man and a noble man in scripture. And about this time the popes
began to deal more temporally with the Emperors than they were wont for
their falsnesse and their heresye. and also for to remeue thempyre fro oo people
to an other as y^ time required / this man cursyd Leo the Emperor by cause he
burnt the images of saints. This same Leo commanded Gregorius the pope that
he should brenne chirches and destroy them. And he set no thing of his
saying / but commanded the cou^trary manly. And so it is openly showed /
that the destruccyon of the Empire of Rome / was the cause of heresye. For
certaynely faithful people with the prelates with one will / drew to the pope
/ and constrained the Emperors for to leave their tyranny and their heresye /
And this time in the eest part of the world strongly faylled the very faith /
for y^ cursyd law of y^ falls Mach^myte Theodosius was Emperor and reigned but
one year. And he was a very christian man / and even as he did so was he done
unto. For Leo deposyd him and made him a priest. Leo the third with Constantyne
his sone was Emperor xxv. year / this Leo when he was mighty he deposyd
Theodosius and reigned for him / and was desceyued by a certain Apostata / the
which had him that he should take and brenne all the images of saints.
Wherefore he was punysshed both in battle and in pestylence / and with other
Infortunes. And by cause he was accursyd of Gregorius / and bode therein three
days / therefore the pope with the common people took fro him the best part of
his Empire / co^maundynge that no man should obey him ne socour him / by
cause he lived like an heretyke. Holy men said against him. And many by him were
martred and exyled. And at the last in his myshyleue he deyed wretchedly. And
in this man's days / but that Karolus Marcellus help the Christian faith / and
faught manly against the Sarrasyns / and drove them backewarde in to Spain the
which they had subdued else they had entered in to France. And Karolus slew
three hundred thousand Sarrasyns and moo. And of his people were slain but.xv.
thousand. Nota This man for the contynuall battle took to lay men the
tresoure of the church. Wherefore saint Eucharius the bishop of Aurelian / as
he was in his prayers / saw that same Karolus in soul and body payned in
hell. And the angel that showed the bishop this man said. That that was the
Judgment of all those that took away the goods of the church / or of poor
men. And to fortifye that that the bishop said and to prove it / the abbot of
saint Denis went to the sepulcre there that Karolus was buried / and opened
the cheste that he lay in. And there they see a great dragon go out / but he
had no body. Gregorius the third a Romayne was pope after Gregorius the
second. The which conformed the worshyppes of the images of saints / with
the counseyll almoost of a thousand bishops. And he cursyd horrybly all the
despysers of these images. As the Emperor and other that were of that
condycyon. Constantynus the fyfth was Emperor after his fader Leo.xxv. year He
was a cursyd man and a pure heretyke / so that he did sacrefyce to the
deuylles. He pursewed the church. And no thing that is good of him is written.
And so by the su^^raunce of god the church was trowbled long time. About this
time were many meruaylles / and there were meruayllous earth quakys. And
certain cytees that were set on mountayns / they were reme^ed and borne
away with the bylles in to the feldes.vi. miles thens as they stood and the
cytees were not broken ne bur^^ In the land of Mesopotanian the earth was
broken by the space of two m^le And also there was a mule that spa^e in a
man's voys. Ashes fell fro heaven And in the sea of Poncico there was use for
great froste that was.xxx. cub^^es of thycknesse. And sterres fell fro heaven
so myghtely that men trowed that the end of the world had be comen. All these
betokened meruayllous things for to come.

Anno dm^.vij.C.xliiij.
ZAcharias was pope after Gregorius.x. year. This Zacharus was a noble man and
arrayed with all virtue / With all men be was loved for his meekness. And he
deposyd the king of France Hydery / and put in his place Puppinus / for he
was more profitable. Here may ye see what power the church had that time / the
which translated that famous kingdom fro the very heirs / to the kingdom of
Pippinus / for a leyffull cause (Vt habet.xv.q.v. alius) Stephanus the second
a Romayne was pope after Zacharias.v. year. This man in all thing was
profitable unto the church / as well in word as in doctrine. And he governed
the spirytualtee and the temporaltee nobly. He was the lover and the defender
of poor men. This man anointed Pippinus the king of France / and sent him
against the Lombardes / that he should compel them to restore the church of
such goods as they had with hold from them long time vnryghtwysly the
which he did. He also translated the Empire of the Greeks to the Frensshmen.
Paulus a Romayne was pope after him.x. year. This was a very holy man / for he
did great alms to faderlesse childern and prisoners / wydowes / and other
poor men / that he might be a follower of saint Poule. Constantyne a Romayne
the second was pope after Poul two year. This Constantyne was a lay man and
suddenly was made a priest / as a tyrant / and took on him the dygnytee of the
pope. And with a great sclaundre to the church was pope a little time. But the
faithful men put him out / and put out his eyes. And this was the fyfth In
famed pope / among so many herd tofore. So the holy ghost that holy apostles
sete kept in all honor and holiness Intynyte martyrs were made this time by
Constantyne the Emperor / for he was such an heretyke. And men trow that
there was never Emperor / ne no pagon that slew so many martyrs. And in his
time the church was trowbled full sore / and very precyously bought the
worshyppynge of the images of the holy saints / for the great shedynge of
blood of martyrs. And certainly that cursyd Emperor was not unpunished. For
when that he deyed / he cried with an horrible voys and said. I am taken to a
fire / that is unable for to be destroyed. And so he yielded up the ghost to
everlasting pain. The Empire of Rome was dyuyded about this time For
Stephanus the pope translated Ytaly and other unto Karolus a young man. And
Constantyne held the land of Greece with other lands over the sea with a
great labor and many rebellynge. This time Karolus magnus was a noble young
man. And he began for to regne upon France / and was the sone of Pippinus /
and his mother was called Berta. Stephanus the third was pope after Paulus three
year. And he amended all the errors of Constantyne. And he degraded all those
the which Constantyne ordained in a general Synodus.

Anno dm^.vij.C.lxxxiiij.
ADitanus a Romayne was pope after Stephanus.xxiiij. year. This man was
myghtely worshypped of the people / no man greter before him in honor / riches
and building. This man set two solemn Synodis. The first of three hundred
and fyfty faders The second in Rome with an hundred and fyfty faders / being
present Charles the king of France / to whom it was granted the lyberte of
eleccyon of the popes / and to ordeyne the appostles sete. Leo the fourth
reigned Emperor with the Greeks five year. This Leo was a cursyd man / but not
so much as his fadet was. And he was a coueytous man / and he took away a
certain crown of a church and put it up on his heed. And anon he was
corrupted with an axes and sore dyseased. And he had a cursed wife / the which
reigned after him with her sone. Constantyne was Emperor after Leo / and he was
a meke man / and put away his mother fro the kingdom / that she might take heed
unto her wy^mens work. But she with a feigned rancour put out his eyest
afterward / and his children also / and reigned again three year. And at the
last she was about for to have be wedded. And when the Greeks perceived that
she would be wedded to great Karolus / they took her and shytte her up in a
monastery / and took Nychoferu^ to be their Emperor. The.v. universal study
the which in old time was translated from Athenes unto Rome / about this
time was translated to Paris / by Karolus king of France. Nychoferus was
Emperor after Constantyne. He was a very nygon / and was exalted to his Empire
by the Greeks. But he profyted not / for in his time all the ^est Imperyall was
brought to naught. For the Romans put them under Karolus magnus. Jerusalem
about this time was recovered by Karolus / with all the holy land. And the
sect of the Sarrasyns was destroyed strongely. For the destruccyon of wretches
came then. Michaell was Emperor two year / And he was a very christian man /
and he was well beloved / and also he was conning in all scyences. And tho
that Nychoferus had hurt and dystressyd of their goods by his
coueytousnesse / this Michaell restored them and made them rich again. Nota.

Karolus magnus the first saint was Emperor after Michaell. And he was crowned
Emperor by Leo the pope / from the which time the Empire was translated from
the Greeks to France and Germayne. And for the translacyon of that Empire /
the Greeks always were defectyne unto the Romans And the Greeks strove ever
more with them. But it was more with venomous words than with strength / and
more with craft than with battle. For they had so great envy at the
Romans / that they would not obey the church of Rome. For certainly when
that the popes would write unto them / for to obey the church of Rome / they
wrote again and said. Ye have taken from our kynrede teh Empire / and therefore
we woll not obey / and we us take from you / And for this noble Emperor
Karolus it is to be understand / this man when he was a young man / he was
anointed king of France by Stephanus the pope. In the year of our lord Ihesu
Christ.vij. hundred.liiij. when his fader Peppinus lived. Under whom / and
with whom he reigned.xv. year unto the death of his fader. Then after his
fader under the year of our lord god.vij. hundred.lxviij. this Karolus with
his brother Karolomannus reigned two year. And then his brother deseased in the
second year. And this Karolus there held all the hoole kingdom.xiiij. year /
to the year of our lord.vij. hundred.lxxxiiij. In the which year he went to
Rome / that he might be crowned Emperor of the pope Adrianus. And he reigned
Emperor xvi. year / to the year of our lord.viij.C. when pope Leo confermed
him again the Emperor. And after that he was Emperor.xiiij. year. And he
dysseasyd in the year of his aege.lxxij. The which was the year of our
lord.viij.C. and xiiij. If ye will see more of Karolus / go to the book of
Turpinus and Libraminus his master / for they wrote his noble acts. Leo the
fourth was pope after Adrianus.xx. year / this man when he went on a certain
day with the Letany to saint Peter's church on Saint Marks day / he was
taken with cursyd people / and both his eyes put out / and his tongue cut of.
But our lord merueylously restored hy^ again his sight and his speech / so that
he spoke without tongue / and saw by miracle. Afterward he went with Karolus
in to France. And he came with him unto Rome / and renged the pope on his
c^mye. And then he crowned Karolus. And he late before crowned / comfermed him
again. Ludouicus the meke the first begoten sone of Karolus was Emperor
after his fader.xxvi. year / in whose time was put away that clerks should
use no gyrdels with precious stones / nestrau^ge arayment. This Ludouicus of
his first wife gate two childern / and both had an evil end. In all thing
that went against him he was pacyent / and in the last end he ever overcame.
For against god he abode devout. And his childern followed him in condycyons /
and he dyssessyd a blessed man. Stephanus the fourth was pope after Leo three
year This Stephanus redeemed many captyue men / and crowned Ludouicus the
Emperor. And then he dyssessyd and was byryed at Rome. Paschall was pope
after Stephanus. This Paschall gave a great dylygence to relyques of Saints.
And he took up Innumerable bodies of saints / and buried them worshypfully as
in the vysyon of saint Cecile he was commanded. Eugenius the fourth was pope
after Paschall / and he was a very holy man. And all those things that were
for christ he took head to. This man was crowned a martyr / and by the lay men
of Rome he was buried in saint Peter's chircheyerde.

Circa annu^ dm^.viij.C.xliiij.
TAlentinus was pope after Eugenius.xl. days / and little of him is wrytell.
Gregorius the fourth was pope after hy^.xij. year / this Gregorius saw many
heavy times / for the plages among the common people. And at this man's
petycyon. Ludouicus the Emperor / and Marchio the prince of Lombardy exyled
all the Sarrasyns fro Ytaly. And at the last he dyssessed after Innumerable
good deeds and works that he had done at saint Peter's. Lotherius the first
sone of Ludouicus was Emperor.xv. year in Ytaly and Rome and the parties of
Germayne next to the hills of Alpy. This Lotherius rose against his brother
Ludouicus and Karolus / for the kingdom of Duchelonde / the which some time
Pippinus their brother held. And they fought at a place called Fontanecu^ /
where Lotherius was dyscomfyted. And there was such slaughter made on both the
sides / that they had no men for to resyst their adversaries. This understood a
falls christian man / and sent unto Soudan of the Sarrasyns yt he should come
anon. And he took Rome / and saint Peter's church was made a stable for their
horses. But Ludouicus with the Frensshmen and Lombardes all that Infenyte
nombre destroyed / and that with great shedynge of christian blood. Sergius the
second was pope after Gregorius two year. This man was called first (os porci)
in English / hog gesmouth. Wherefore that man and all the popes names are
changed when they are chosen. And that for three causes / The first for Christ
changed the names of those men the which he made popes. The second / for as
much as they are changed in the name / should they be changed in perfeccyon
of life / The third leest he which is chosen to an exceeding degree should be
hurt in name. Leo was pope after Sergius viij. year. This Leo was an holy man
/ and also he was in prudence as sharp as a serpente / and in his deeds as
meke as a douue. And he was brouhht forth virtuously in a monastery. And when
that he was made pope / he labored to repeyre his chirches again / the which
false sarrasyns one after an other had destroyed. This man was a mighty writer
and a great precher / and myghtely labored in watch and prayer / and so deyed
/ and was buried and lies at saint Peter's. Benedictus a Romayne was pope after
Leo two year. This Benedictus had the name of the thing. For in all thing he
was blessed. This man ordained that clerks should go ordynatly and honestly.
Ludouicus the sone of Lotherius was Emperor this time / and anointed of
Sergius the pope / and a while reigned with his fader / and after reigned.xxi. year
alone. This man had a sone that hight Karolus / in to whom the devil entered
and vexed him before his fader. And then^e he conspyred his faders death. And in
his time many a meruaylle fell. Nota Johannes Anglicus of the nacyon of
Magnutin about this time was pope / and she was a woman arrayed in man's
garments. But she profyted so in holy scripture / that there was found none
like her. Then she was chosen pope / but afterward she was with child. And
when she should have gone openly in processyon / she traveled and decessyd.
And this is the sixth pope / the which to this time had the name of holiness /
and were vycyous. And this person as other popes were was punysshed of god /
ne she was not nombred in the book of popes. Nicholaus a Romayne was pope after
this woman.ix. year. This Nicholaus was of great holiness / that there was no
man comparable to him after Gregory the pope. And when he was made pope.
Ludouicus the Emperor was present. And after he decessyd a very good man and
was buried in saint Peter's chircheyerde. Adrianus a Romayne was pope after
Nicholaus. This Adrianus cursyd Lotherius brother to the emperor the king of
Lotharynge for his aduoutry. But when he came to Rome to excuse him of his
aduoutry / he said yt he was cursyd wrongfully. And he brought with him all the
noble men of his regyon / and all were deed within one year / and the king
deyed in the way when he came to the cite of Placenciam.

Anno dm^.viij.C.lxxiij.
Of king Alured / and how the Danys in his time prayed him of mercy that they
might go out of the land.


AFter the death of this Eldred reg ned his brother Alured that Dolfines was
called. Tho went the Danys and assembled them / and went forth to seek Alured
that tho was king new made of Southsex / and there they found him at Wylton
with a little people / And nevertheless he faught with them / but at the last
he fled thens from the field / and went in to Westser and ordained so much
people of his own reame / and also of other till y^ he had a strong host so
that the Danys had no power against him to withstand. And he came to London
with his host / and there were the Danys soiourned. And there he would have
foughten with them. But the Danys durst not with him fight / but prayed him of
peace / and y^ they might go again in to their own country / and never to come
in to England again / that is to say any harm for to do. And upon this
covenant they should give him to pledge good hostages / and such as the
Englyssh men would axe.

How Hubba and Hungar were slain at Chyppenham / and how the Danys brought
their king to our king.
ANd the same day that the Danys departed from London / so fast they rode
both night and day / and never took rest of going till yt they came unto
Excestre / and took tho the town / and there held them. When king Alured
herd these tidings / anon he let take the hostages / and went from thens
unto Excestre with all the power that he had / And when the Danys herd tell of
his coming / they went from thens unto Westsex / and came unto Chyppenham /
and there they did much harm in the country / they robbed folk / and
brought them in prison. The king Alured them pursewed / and came upon them
right soon and fyersely them assailed. And there were slain both Hubba and
Hungar his brother / and Buerne Bocarde. And in this battle were much folk
slain in that one part and in that other. But the gree of that field bode
with the Danys / for as much as the king came with few folk. The king
hasted him as much as he might for to go again. And when the Danys found
Hubbacs body lyeng deed they buried it / and laid upon it a great logge / and
let call it Hubeslowe / and so it is called unto this day. And that place
is in Deuenshyre. The Barons of Somerset. Wyltshyre and Dor set herd tell how
that their king was dyscomfyted / and ordained all the power that they might
have / and came to the king there he was / and thanked god that they him yet
found alive / for they had wend that the Danys had him slain. Tho took
they a counseyll the king and his barons / that would go and seek the Danys
with them for to fight. And so they rode all that night them for to seek / and
came on the morrow about Pryme to Abyndon there y^ the Danys were. The king
Alured and his barons tho assembled and there assaylled the Danys egrely / and
there yaue them a strong battle. And the Danys put them a long time that no
man wist whether part more people were slain. But thus it befell as god would
that the king Alured had the vyctory with much honor For the Danys were so
driven that they ne wist whyther for to torn. And.xv. days the king them
pursewed at his will / that gladly and feign they were for to speak of peace and
accord / and took him good hostage / and said they would never more upon him
war ne no debate arere. And more over they behyght unto the king Alured /
that they would go and bring their own king unto hy^ and that their king
and they all should be baptized. And upon this condycyon king Alured grant
them life and lymme And said unto them / that they should gone their king for
to seek / and at a certain day to come again that to them was set. And so
they went forth fast and came again at a day that to them was assygned. And
all the Danys brought their king with them. The king Alured anon let them
be baptized / and their names changed. And so the king of Denmark was called
Athelstone And.xxx. of his fellows names were changed also / and the other
were baptized to the right believe. And all this was done at Westmestre. And
after that king Alured held with him king Athelstone and all his Danys.xij.
days at soiourne with much solempnyte / and yaue them great yeftes. And after
that they were baptized and so departed. Tho was king Alured all at ease /
when he had his enmyes ouercomen / and that they were turned to the right
believe of god almighty.

How the Danys y^ came in to France with Gurmonde came again in to England /
and of the death of king Alured.
ANd thus it befelle afterward / that the Danys of Northumberlonde that were
paynems came with a great strength and an huge host of France / that is to
understand / with them y^ went in to France with Gurmodde of Affryke / when
he had conquered England and yaue it unto the Saxons. And tho y^ came fro
France arrived in Kent and sent in to Northumberlonde that they should come to
them / and when those two hosts were come and assembled / anon they yede to
destroy all the christian people of England from place to place / and did
much sorrow. It befelle thus as almighty god would an hard chance in to
England. For the good king Alured yt was wont to abate the Danys deyed in the
mean time. This king Alured reigned.xxx. year / and a good king had be and
well could chastyse his enmyes. And also he was a good clerk / and let make
many books / and a book he made in English of adventures of kings / and of
bataylles that had been done in the land / and many other books of Gestes / he
let them write that were of great wisdom and of good learning / thorugh
which books many a man may him amend / that woll them led and upon them look
/ upon whose soul almighty god have mercy. And this king Alured lies at
Wynchestre.

Johannes the.viij. was pope after Adrian.viij. year. This Ioha^nes anointed
Karolus the Emperor. And he suffered great wrong of y^ Romans for he favored
not the said Emperor And therefore he put the said pope in keeping. Also he
degraded the bishop of Portuense / the which was the occayson of all his
sorrow. Karolus the second was Emperor after Ludouicus. This Karolus had a
brother the which was called Ludouicus / and he was the king of Germayne / and
he ordained battle against his brother / but Karolus or they taught was
poysened. And he made many a monasterye. Martinus was pope after Ioha^nes one
year. This Martinus little profyted / for he lived but little time. Adrianus
the third was pope after him 00 year. And of him is no thing written.
Stephanus the fyfth was pope after him.vi. year. And no thing of him is written
/ but that he translated the body of saint Martyn. Karolus the third was
Emperor after the second.xij. year. This Karolus had in possessyon peassyble
all France and all Germayne / and was crowned Emperor of Johannes the pope.
And after this glorious vyctory / he turned all Normandye to the faith of god
almighty / And he might no more tesyste the Frenshemen but four year he reigned
on them He was unprofitable to them / and therefore they put him away. Amulphus
was Emperor after Karolus.xiij. year. This Arnulphus utterly constreyned y^
Normans / y^ which destroyed the Frenshemen.xl. year. Then he was syke and
had no comfort of no lecke / for he was in a meruayllous sykenesse / so that
he was consumed with life / and was deed / Formosus was pope after Stephanus.v.
year / this man first was bishop of Portuensis. And pope John was depryued
for his Inobedyence / and was degrated to the lay f^^. But by Martyn the pope
he was restored. And against his oath / he came not aloonly to Rome / but to
offer hy^ the dygnyte of the pope / for y^ which there was great alteraco^n.
Bonifacius the.vi. was pope.v. days. Stephanus the.vi. one year and three
months. Johannes thie months and.xij. days / Iona also thie months and
twelve days. Theodorus the second twenty days. Johannes the enleuenth was
two year and.xv. days. Benedictus the fourth three year and two months. Leo
y^ fourth was.xl. days. Xpristo forus the first.vij. months. All these viij.
popes were but little time / and therefore we can not tell of them none notable
things / but if we should write sclau^dre of them that might be found / for
the vnharde strife and contencyon in that holy appostles sete. For one strove
against an other / and repreued the deeds of an other. And for to tell how they
strove / it were no great honor to show / for that holy appostles sete.
Ludonicus the third was Emperor after Arnulphus.vi. year. This man had not
the popes blessing / for the unstableness of them the which reigned in Ytaly.
And he was constreyned to expulse Berynge. And this man was the last Emperor
of all the kynred of Karolus king of France This time the Empire was remeued
and translated and dyuyded. For the Frenshemen halpe not the church / the
which their faders had edifyed and fortefyed / but destroyed / ne halpe not ye
Romans against Lombardes / the which vexed the Romans right sore. Therefore by
the comyns assente they were excluded fro the Empire / and the Ytalyens began
to be Emperor in Ytaly / and the Almayns in Almanye / until Ottanen the which
reigned in both the places. The Frensshmen were constreyned to abide in their
own country / and no more to be Emperor for their myscheuous living.
Beryngarius the first. Conradus and Beryngarius the second / and Hugo were
Emperors after Ludouicus But they are not nombred among the Emperors. For
some were but in Almayne / and some were in Ytalye.

Of king Edward that was king Aluredes sone.

the king saw y^ he might no better do / then he took peace with them and
granted them his trewes And nevertheless the trewes dured not long / that
the Danysne began strongly for to war upon the Englysshmen and did them

And this Edgar was Saint Edwardes fader. And when Edgars wife was deed that was
saint Edwardes mother and enteryd / he herd speak of the fayrnesse of Estrylde
/ that was Oxgarus daughter a baron of Deuenshyre that was so fair a woman /
that al men did speak of her. He called one of his knights that he much
loved and trusted upon and told him. God said he to the noble baron Orgarus of
Deuenshyre / and see if that his daughter be so fair as men speak of / and if
it be soth I will have her unto my wife. This knight that was called Edelwolde
went forth his way as the king him had said / and came there that y^ lady
was. And when he saw her so fair / he thought to have her himself to wife. And
thereof spoke to Orgarus her fader. And her fader was an old man and had no moo
childern but oonly her / and saw that Edelwolde was a fair young knight and
worthy and rich and was well beloved with the king / and thought his daughter
should well be married and besette upon him / and granted him his daughter if
the good lord the king would consent thereto. And then this Edelwolde came
again unto the king and told him / that she was fay re enough upon to see /
but she was won der lothly. Tho answered the king and said that he took but
little charge. Sir said Edelwolde / she is her faders heir / and I am not
rich of lands / and if ye would consent and grant that I might her have /
then should I be rich enough. In gods name said the king. I consent
thereto. Edelwolde tho thanked the king right much / and went again in to
Deuenshyre and spowsed the damoysell / and in that country he dwelled And thus
it befell upon a time / that he told his counseyll and all this thing unto
his wife / how and in what manner he had begyled his lord y^ king that would
have had her to wife. And anon as she it wist / she loved him never more
afterward as she did before. This lady conceived by him a sone. And when time
was that the child should be borne. Edelwolde came to the king and prayed him
to have a sone of his at the font stone. The king him granted / And let
call him Edgar after his own name. And when this was done he thought that all
was syker enough for the king / that he would not take his wife / for as much
as his lord was a Ioly man and an amerous.

How that king Edgar wedded Estrylde after the death of Edelwolde.
THus it befell that all men in king Edgars court then spoke and said /
that Edelwolde was rychely auaunced / thorugh the foresaid marriage of his wife.
And yet they said / he was auaunced an hundred fold more. For he had spowsed
the most fairest creature that ever was seen. And the king her de speak so
much of her beauty / that he thought he would have him dysceyued / and
begyled. And thought pryuely in his heart / that he would go in to Deuenshy re
/ as it were for to hunte for the heart and for the hynde and other wild
beestes / and then he should see there the lady or he departed thens. And
this lady was dwelling at a manner place besydest the forest / there that the
king would hunte / And at that manner he was herborowed all night. And when
time came that the king should suppe / and the son shone / the king asked
after his gossyppe and after his godsone. And Edelwolde made her to come before
the king. And ne uerthelesse if it other wise might have be she should not
have come in his sight by his will. The lady welcomed the king and swetely him
kyssed. And he took (...) by the hand / and tho next by him her sat / and
so souped they together. And there was a custom and an usage in this land that
time. That so when one drank to an other / the drynket should say Wassayll.
And that other should answer / and say Drink hayll. And this did the king
and the lady / and also kyste many times. And after supper when time was for to
god to bed / the king went to bed / thyn king hertely on the fayrnesse
of that lady / and then was overcome for her love / that him thought that he
should deye / but if he had his will on her / Upon the morrow the king
aroos / and in the forest went him for to dysporte with hearts and hyndes and
all other wild beestes. And of the hearts great plente he sent to that lady.
And thryes he went for to solace and to speak with that lady the whiles he
dwelled there in that country. And after that the king remeued thens / and
thought him how he might best deliver Edelwolde fro his wife as he had him first
desceyued. And the king anon after viij. days ordained a parlyame^t at Sa /
lysbury of all his baronage counseyll so have. And for to ordeyne how the
country of Northumberlonde should best be kept that the Danys came not there
/ the land for to destroy. And this Edelwolde came unto the kings parlyament
And the king sent him unto York / for to be keeper of that country. And thus
it befell / that men that knew him not slew him by the way. And anon as the
king herd tell that he was deed / he let send after the lady Estrylde that
she should come unto the cite of London / and there be wedded to the king with
great solempnyte and worship. And held a solemn feast. And he ware a crown
that was of gold / and the queen an other. And saint Dunstane on the morrow
came unto the king in to the chamber / and found the king in bed and the
queen togyders. And saint Dunstane axed the king who she was And the king
answered and said / that she was y^ queen Estrylde. And the Archebysshop saint
Dunstane said / that be did great wrong / and against gods will to take a
woman to wife whose child ye had take at font stone. And y^ que ne for that
word never loved saint Du^stane after. And the good man warned of that folly to
be left / but it auaylled but little / for y^ love between them was so much.
The king begat upon her a sone that was called Eldred. When this child
was.vi. year old / the king his fader deyed. And about that time he had
reigned.xvij. year / and lies at Glastenbury.

Emperor after his fader. And he was a noble man to the chir che as his fader
was. And many a battle he had against the false men of believe. And at the last
he almoost lost all his host in Kalabur. Yet forsothe with all his mind
besought saint Peter to help. And meruayllously saint Peter delivered him. And
his wife was the daughter of the Emperor of Constantynopolitan of the Romans
blood And this man was crowned of Benedictus the pope.

Of saint Edward the martyr how Estrylde his stepmoder let kylle him / for to
make Eldred her own sone king.
ANd after this Edgar reigned Edward his sone / that he begat upon his first
wife / that well and nobly governed the land. For he was full of all manner of
goodness / and led a full holy life. And above all thing he loved god and holy
church. And the queen Estrylde that was his stepmoder let slay him / by cause
to make her own sone Eldred king. And thus on a day he was slain / as ye
shall here afterward It befell thus upon a day that the king Edward went
in to a wood for to play / in the south country beside a town that is called
Warham. In which forest was great plente of hearts and hyndes. And when he had been a while there him for to play / he thought upon his brother Eldred that was
with his mother the queen / for her place was nygh the forest / and thought for
to go thither and vysyte and see his brother. And took with him but a little
meyne / and went him toward his stepmoders house / that in that time soiourned
in the castle of Corfe. And as he rode in the thyckenesse of a wood to aspye
his game / it befell that he went amysse and lost his meyne that with him
came. And at the last he came out of the wood. And as he looked him about / he
saw there fast besides a manner that his stepmoder dwell led in / and
thyderwarde he went alone And anon it was told the queen / how that the
king was comen alone without any company. And therefore she made Joy enough /
and thought how that she might do / that he were slain as pryuely as she might
/ and called to her one of her knights. To whom she had told much of her
counsel between them. And both they came to the king and turteysly him
received. And the king told that he was come to vysyte and also for to speak
with Eldred his brother The queen many times him thanked. and him prayed for to
alyght / and herborugh with her all that night. The king said / that he might
not. But again he would go unto his folk / if he might them find. And when
the queen saw that he would not abide / she prayed him that he would ones
drink / and he granted her. And anon as the drink was come / the queen
drank unto the king. And the king took the cup and set it to his mouth.
And in the mean while that he drank the false knight that was with the queen
with a knyfe smote the king unto the heart. and there he fell down deed unto
the earth of his palfroy. The queen for this deed gave the knight gold and
silver great plente and of other riches enough And the knight anon as this was
done went him over the sea. And so escaped he out of this land. When this
king Edward was thus martred. It was in the year of the Incarnacyon of our
lord Ihesu Christ.ix.C.lxxx. and he had reigned.xij. year and an half / and
lies at Glastenbury.

Of the king Eldred / and how the king Swyne of Denmark held England. and
how Eldred that was saint Edwardes brother was not beloved in his Realm / and
therefore he fled in to Normandye.
SO after this Edward reigned Eldred his brother. And saint Dunstane crowned
him. And this sayn te Dunstane deyed soon after that he had foryeuen the queen
her trespaas / because that she was cause of king Edwardes death. And saint
Dunstane had her assoylled / and penance had her enjoined. And she lived after
a chaste life and a clean. This king Eldred wedded an English woman / and on
her begat Edmonde Irensyde / and an other sone that was called Edwyne. And
after dey ed the queen their mother. And in that time came Swyne in to England
that was king of Denmark / for to challenge and to conquer all that his
auncetrees had before that time. And so he conquered and had it all at his
axynge. For the good earl Luthberte of Lyndeleye and all the people of
Northumberlonde / and almoost all the grette of England held with Swyne that
was king of Denmark / for so much as they loved not king Eldred / for by
cause that his good brother Edward was slain for love of him. And therefore no
man set but little by him. Wherefore king Swyne had all his will / and took
all the land And Eldred the king fled tho in to Normandye. And so spoke to
the duke Richard / that the duke yaue him his sister Emme to wife. Upon the
which be gate two sons / that one was called Alured / and that other Edward.
And when Swyne had conquered all the land / he reigned nobly and lived.xv. year
and then he deyed and lies at York.

How king Eldred came again from Normandy / and how Knoght the Dane reigned /
and of the war betwixt him and Edmonde Irensyde.
THus after the death of Swyne that was a Dane. Knoght his sone dwelled in
England / and would have been king. And tho came again Eldred out of
Normandye with much nombre of people / and with a strong meyne that Knoght
durst not abide / but fled thens in to Denmark. The king Eldred had again
his reame / and held so great worship / that he began for to destroy all tho
that halpe Swyne that was a Dane against him. And afterward came again this
Knoght from Denmark with a great power / so that king Eldred durst not with
him fight / but fled from thens unto London / and there held him. Tho came
Knoght and him besyeged so long / till that king Eldred deyed in the cite of
London / and lies at saint Poules. And he reigned.ix. year.

BOnus was pope after Benedictus one year. This man abode but a little time.
Bonifacius was pope after him five months. Benedictus was pope after him.x.
year / This man crowned Otto the second / and made many Romans to be taken
And he gadred a counseyll against the king of France / where Gylberte the
Nygromancer was deposyd. Ioha^nes the.xiiij. was pope after him.viij. months.
And he was put in the castle Angel / and was famyned to death / Ioha^nes
the.xv. was pope after him four months. Ioha^nes the.xvi. was pope after him
almoost.xi. year / This man was taught in arms / and made many books / and
else little of him is written. Gregorius the.v. was pope after this man almoost
three year. And this Gregorius was made pope at the Instaunce of the Emperor
Otto the third / for he was his cosyn / And when he had be a little while pope
/ and the Emperor receded from the cite of Rome. Placentinus was put in by
Crecensius a Counsull for money / And then^ was stryf a few days. But the
Emperor came soon after / and took Crecensius the Consul / and stroke of his
heed / and put out the eyes of this man Placencius pope / the which put
out his cosyn of the dygnyte of the pope And maimed him on other members / his
knights ne his dukes halpe him no thing. For he did that thing that he
should not have done. And he suffered that that he deserved. Nota.

This Gregorius with the Emperor Otto ordained the chesers of the Empire the
which from thens forth has abode unto this day. For the Frensshmenne none
other might not break that ordinance. And those chesers of the Empire by the
pope and Otto were not made for any blame of the Saxons / but to eschew the
euylles to come. And their names ben written for learned men in latin in these
verses. (Maguntinensis T^euerensis Coloniensis. Quilibet imperij fit
cancellarius horum. Et Palatinus datifer Dux Portitorensis. Marchio prepositus
camere. Pincerna Bohemus Hij statuunt du^m cuntis per secula summu^. Palatinus

veru^ vt quida^ dicunt. Through this occasyon the Egle has lost many a feder.
And in the end he shall be made naked. Otto the third was Emperor.xviij.
year. This man was a worthy man all the days of his Empire. And after the
wisdom of his fader / he was a very faithful man to the church. And in many
batayls he prosperyd by cause he was devout unto almighty god and his saints.
And yaue mighty worshyppynge to the relykes of saints. And oftentimes he
vyspted holy places. This man was crowned by Gregorius his cosyn. And at the
last he decessyd at Rome.

Anno dm^.M.iiij.
SIluester the second was pope after Gregorius four year. And he was made
pope by the help of the devil / to whom he did homage / for he should give
him all thing that he desired. And he was called Hylbert. And his enmye gate
him the grace of the king of France / and he made him the bishop of Remensis
/ but anon he was deposyd. And after he gate the grace of the Emperor / and
was made the bishop of Rauennie / and after the pope / But he had an end
anon / and so have all that put their hope in falls deuylles. Yet men trust in
his salvation / for certain demonstracyon of his sepulcre / and for the great
penance that he did in his last end. For he made his hand and his legs
to be cut of / and dysmembred in all his body / and to be cast out at the
door to fowls / and then his body to be drawn with wysde beest^ and there
to be buried where some ever they rested as an hand. And they stood still at
saint Johan lateranensis and there he was buried. And that was sign of his
salvation. Johannes the xviij. was pope five months. Johannes the.xix. was
pope after him five year. And these two did little things. Henricus the first
was Emperor in Almayne.xx. year / this Henricus was duke of Barry / and all
according he was chosen / for his blessed fame and good name the which he
had. And it is read / that many of these dukes of Barry were holy men not
all oonly in absteynge of flesshely desires / but also in virtuous living. And
this man had a sister that was an holy as he / the whom he yaue to wife unto
the king of Hungry. And she brouht all Hungry unto the right believe and the
christian faith. And his wives name was (sancta Konnogundis) with whom he lived
a virgyn all his lives days. And also he did many a bataylle / as well in
Ytaly / as in Almayne against the rebellyous / and prosperyd ryghtwysly. At the
last with a blessed end he decessyd. And in the life of saint Laurence he and
his wife be put for ensample^ / Benedictus was pope after Iohanes.xi. year.
This man had great strife in his days / for he was put out / and a another put
in. And this Benedictus after that he was deed / was seen of an holy man
bishop in a wretchyd figure / and he had great pain. And this figure said. He
trusted no thing in the mercy of god. And no thing profyted him that was
done for hym^for it was gotten with extorcyon and unjustly. Then this bishop
left his bysshopryche for dread of this sight and went in to a monasterye and
lived virtuously all his days. Ioha^nes the.x. was pope after him.xi. year /
and little profyted.

Of King Knoght that was a Dane
ANd after the death of Eldred Knoght that was a Dane began to regne. But
Edmonde Irensyde that was king Eldredes sone by his first wife / ordained a
great power of men / and began for to war on king Knoght / And so he did
many times and often / And the war was so strong and hard / that wonder it
was to wit. And the queen Emme that dwelled tho at Westmestre / had great
dread of her two sons of the war Alured and Edward / lest they should be
defoyled and mysdone thorugh this war. Wherefore she sent them over the sea
in to Normandy to the duke Richard their uncle. And there they dwelled in
saufte and peace long time. This Edmonde Irensyde and Knoght the Dane warred
strongely togyde^. But at the last they were accorded in this manner / that
they should depart the reame betwixt them both / and so they did / and after
they became good friends. And so well loved together as they had been brethern
gotten of one fader and of one mother borne.

How king Edmonde Irensyde traytoursly was slain thorugh a traitor / that was
called Edrith of Stratton.
ANd after tho reigned king Irensyde and Knoght the Dane. But thus it befell
afterward / that in the same year that they were accorded and so much loved
together. Wherefore a falls traytoure had enuytee to the love that was betwix them
and frendshyp / whoos name was Edrith of Stratton / that was a great lord /
that was Edmondes Irensydes man / and of him held all the land that he had.
And nevertheless he thought his lord to betraye and make Knoght king of the
land / to the entente rychely to be auaunced / and with him be well beloved /
Wherefore he prayed his lord Edmond Irensyde upon a day with him for to et^.
And the king him curteysly granted and to him came at his prayer. And at the
meet the king ryally was served with diverse meets and drynkes. And when the
night came that he should goo unto bed. The king took his own meyne and
went unto the chamber there that he should take his nyghtes rest. And as he
looked him about / he saw a fair image and well made / and in semblaunt as it
were an Archer with a boowe / and in the boowe a fine arowe. King Edmonde
went tho nere for to behold it better what it might be. And anon y^ arowe
smote him through the body and there slew the king. For that engyne was made
for to slay his own lord traytoursly And so when king Edmonde was thus deed
and slain / he had reigned but.x. year. And his people for him made much
sorrow. And his body they bare unto Glastenbury and there they him entyred. And
this false traitor Edrith anon went unto the queen / that was king Edmondes
wife / that wist not of her lords death. Anon he took from her two sons that
were fair and young / that her lord had upon her gotten / that one was called
Edward / and that other Edwyne. and ladde them with him to London / and took
them unto king Knoght / that he should do wish them what his will were. And
told him how subtylly he had slain king Edmonde / for by cause and love of
him / so that king knoght all England in his power holy might have. O thou
falls traitor / have thou my true brother that was so true thus slain for me
/ the man I most loved in the world. Now by my heed I shall for thy travel
the well reward as thou have deserved / and anon let him be take and bound
hand and foot in manner of a traitor / and let cast him there in to Tamyse /
and in this manner the false traitor ended his life. The king took the two
childern and put them unto the abbot of Westmestre to ward and to keep till yt
he wist what was best with them to do.

How king knoght sent king Edmondes sons both in to Denmark to be slain /
and how they were saved.
SO it befell soon after that king knoght had all ye land in his hand / and
spowsed the queen Emme thorugh consent of his baronage. For she was a fair
woman / the which was Eldredes wife and the dukes sister of Normandy / and they
lived together with much love as reason would. The king axed upon a day
counseyll of the queen what was best to do with the sons yt were Edmonde
Irensydes. Sir said she. they ben the right heirs of the land / and if they
live they will do much sorrow with war / and therefore let send them in to a
strange land a far to some man that may them defoyle and destroy. The king
anon let call a dane yt was called Walgar / and commanded hy^ yt he should
led tho two childern in Denmark / and so to do and ordeyne for them / y^ he
should never here more of them. Sir said this Walgar / gladly your
commandment shall be done and anon tho two childern he took and lad them in
to Denmark. And for as much as he saw that the childern were wond fair and
also meke / he had of them great pity and ruche / and would them not slay / but
lad them to the king of Hungry for to nourysshe / for this Walgar was well
beknowen with the king and well beloved. Anon the king axed whens the childn
were / and Walgar told him and said / that they were the right heirs of
England and therefore men would destroy them / And therefore sir unto you they
be come mercy and help for to seek. And forsothe if they may live / your men
they shall become / and of you they shall hold all their land. The king of
Hungry received them with much honor / and let them worthily be kept. And
thus it befell afterward yt Edwyne the younger brother deyed / and Edward the
elder brother lived / a fair man and a strong and a large of body and gentle
/ and curters of condycyons / so that all men him loved And this Edward in the
Chronicles is called among the Englysshmen Edward the outlawe. And when as he
was made knight / the kings daughter of Hungry him much loved for his goodness
and his fayrnes / that she him called her derlynge. The king that was her fader
perceived well the love that was betwixt them two / and had no heir but only
that daughter / and the king vowchesauf his daughter to no man so well / as he
did to him that she loved so well and he her / and yaue her unto him with a
good will / and Edward her spowsed with much honor. The king of Hungry
sent after all his baronage / and made a solemn feast and a rich wedding.
And made all men to understand / that this Edward should be king of that
land after the decesse of him. And of that tidings they were all full glad.
This Edward begat upon his lady a sone that was called Edgar Helynge / and
afterward a daughter that was called Margarete yt afterward was queen of
Scotlonde. And by the king of Scotlond that was called Mancolin she had a
daughter that was called Maud yt was queen afterward of England / through king
Henry that was the first sone of ye conqueror that her wedded. And he begat
on her a daughter yt was called Maude that afterward was Empress of Almayn.
And of this Maude came ye king of England that unto this day is called Henry
y^ Empress sone. And yet had this Edward an other daughter by his wife that
was called Crystyan and she was a Nonne.

How king Knoght that was a proud man conquered No^^andy / and how he became
afterward meke and mylde.
NOw have ye herd of Edmonde Irensydes sons yt king Knoght wend they had been
slain as he had commanded Walgar before. And this king Knoght had in his
hand all the reame of England and Denmark. And after that they went unto
Norwaye that londo for to conquer. But the king of the land that was called
Elaf came with his people / and wend his land to have well kept and defended /
and so there he faught with him / till at the last he was slain in that
battle. And tho this Knoght took all the land in to his hand. And when he
had conquered Norwaye / and taken feaute and homages there / he came again in to
England / and held himself so great a lord / that him thought in all the
world his pere no man was. And he came so proud and hauteyne that it was
great wonder. And so it befell upon a day as he had herd mass at Westmestre
/ and would have gone in to his palace / the wawes of the Tamyse so swyftely
against him came that almoost they touched his feet. Tho said the king with a
proud heart. I command the water to torn again / or else I shall make the /
The wawes for his commandment would not spare / but flowed ever in heyght
more and more. The king was so proud of heart that he would not flee the water
and beat it with a rod that he had in his hand / and commanded the water
that it should go no ferder. But for all his commandment the water would not
cesse / but ever wexed more and more on high / so that the king was all wete
and stood deep in the water. And when he saw that he had abyden there to long
/ and the water would no thing do his commandment / tho soon he withdrewe
him / and tho stood he upon a stone and held his hondes on high and said
these words herynge all the people. This god that makes the sea thus arise /
is king of all kings / and of all myghtes most. And I am a caytyf and a man
deedly / and he may never deye / and all thing does his commandment / and to
him is obedyent / To that god I pray / that he be my warraunt. For I knowledge
me a caytyf feeble / and of no power. And therefore I will go unto Rome without
any long lettynge / and my wickedness for to punysshe and me to amend. For
of god I claim my land for to hold / and of none other. And anon made ready
his heir / and himself went to Rome without any lettynge. And by the way
did many alms deeds / and when he came to Rome also. And when he had be
there / for his sins do penance / he came again in to England / and became a
good man and an holy. And lived and left all manner of pride and stoutenes /
and lived an holy life after / and made two abbayes of saint Benet / one in
England and an other in Normandye / for as much as he loved saint Benet more
specially than other saints. And much he loved also saint Edmonde y^ king.
And often he yaue great yeftes to the house / wherefore it was made rich. And
when he had reigned.xx. year he deyed / and lies at Wynchestre.

Anno dm^.M.xviij.
BEnedictus the.ix. was pope after Johannes / and he was a great le^hour / and
therefore he was dampened / and he aperyd to a certain man vnd a meruaylous
figure and an horrible. His heed and his take was lylae an ass / that other
part of his body like a beer. And he said to this man to whom he aperyd. Be
not aferde / for I was a man as ye now be / but I apeyre now / for I lived
unhappily in old time like a be when I was pope. In this man's time there
was great dyuysyon and sclaunder to the church / for he was put out and in two
times. And here Tholome^^ notes / that the pride of bishops had ever an evil
end. And it was ever the occasyon of much unrest and battle. Conradus the
first was Emperor after Henricus.xx. year. This man made many laws / and
commanded peace to be kept most straytly of any man. But the earl of ^udolf
was accused / and he fled from his land / and desired more to live like a
churl than like a gentylman / and yet meruayllously his sone was made Emperor
by the commandment of god against the will of Conradus. And at the last they
were accorded. And he took Corodis daughter to his wife.

Of king Harold that lever had go on foot than ride on horse.
THis Knoght of whom we have spoken of before / had two sons by his wife Emme
/ and yt one was called Hardiknoght / and that other Harold. And he was so
light of foot y^ men called hy^ most comynly Harold Hare foot. And this Harold
had no thing the condicyons and the manners of king Knoght that was his fader.
For he set but little price of chyualrye / ne no curteysy / another worship /
but oonly by his own will / And he became so wicked that he exyled his mother
Emme. And she went out of the land in to Flau^dres / and there dwelled with the
earl / wherefore after there was never good love betwixt him and his brother For
his brother hated hy^ deedly / and when he had reigned two year and a little more
/ he deyed and lies at Westmestre.

Of king Hardiknoght that was Haroldes brother.
AFter this Harold Harefoot reigned his brother Hardiknoght^ a noble knight and
a worthy man and much loved chyualry / and all manner of goodness And when this
Hardiknoght had redned a little while / he let vncouere his brother Harold and
smote of his heed that was his brother at Westmestre^ and let cast the heed in
to a gonge / and the body in to Tamyse. And after came fysshers and took the
body with their nets by night / and bare him to saint Clementes ch^^che and
there him buried. And in this manner avenged him Hardiknoght of his brother for
in none other manner he might be avenged. This king Hardiknoght was so large a
yeuer of meet and drink / that his tables were set every day three times
full with ryall meets and drynkes for his own meyne / and for all that came
unto his court / to be rychely served of ryall meetts. And this king
Hardiknoght sent after Emme his mother / and made her to come again in to
England / for she was driven out of England while that Harold Harefoot reigned
/ through counseyll of the earl Godewin / that tho was the grettest lord of
England next the king / and most might do through out all England what he
would his commandment / for as much as he had spowsed the daughter of the
good king Knoght / that was a Dane^ which daughter he had by his first wife
/ And when this queen was driven out of England / and come to the Earl of
Flau^dres / that was called Baldewyne her cosyn / he found her there all
thing that her neded / unto the time yt she went again in to England / that
the king Hardiknoght had sent for her that was her some and made her come again
with much honor. This king Hardiknoght when he had reigned five year he deyed
and lies at Westmestre.

Of the vylany that the Danys did to the Englysshmen. Wherefore fro that time
after was no Dane made king of this land.
ANd after the death of this king Hardsknoght / for as much as he had no
thing of his body begoten / The earls and barons assembled / and made a
counsel / that never more after no man yt was a Dane / though he were never so
great a man among them / he should never be king of England for the despyte
yt the Danes had done to Englysshmen. For evermore before and if it were so
that the Englysshmen and y^ Danys happened for to mete upon a bridge / the
Englysshmen should not be so hardy to me^e ne styre a foot / but stand still
till ye Dane were passed forth. And more over if yt Englysshmen had not bowed
down their heedes to do reverence unto the Danys / they should have been beten
and defoylled. And such manner despytes and vylany did the Danys to our
Englysshemen. Wherefore they were driven out of y^ land after time y^ king
Hardiknoght was deed / for they had no lord yt them might mayntene. And in
this manner avoided the Danys England / yt never they came again. The earls and
barons by their common assente and by their cou^seles sent unto Normandy for to
seek those two brethern. Alured and Edward that were dwelling with the duke
Richard that was their came / in entente for to crown Alured the elder
brother / and him make king of England. And of this thing to make an end /
the earls and ^arons made their oath. But y^ earl Godewin of Westsex falsely
and traytoursely thought to slay these two brethern anon as they should come
in to England / in intent / to make his sone Harold king the which sone he
had begote upon his wife / the which was king Knoghtes daughter that was a
Dane. And so this Godewin pryuely hy^ went unto South hampton for to mete there
the two brethern when yt they should come unto land. And thus it befell the
messengers that went in to Normandy / found not but oonly Alured yt was the
elder brother For Edward his brother was gone in to Hungary for to speak with
his cosyn Edward the outlawe / yt was Edmondes sone with the Irensyde. The
messengers told and said Alured / how that the earls and barons of England
sent after him / and that he boldly should come in to England and receive
the reame. For king Hardiknoght was deed / and all the Danes driven out of the
land.

How Godewin the false traitor took Alured upon Gyldesdowne when that he came
from Normandy to be king of England / and how he caused him to be martyred in
the isle of Ely.
AS Alured herd these tidings he thanked god. And in to ship went with all
the have that he might and passed the sea / and arrived at Southhampton there
Godewin the false traitor was. And when this traitor saw that he was come /
he welcomed him and received him with much Joy and said / that he would led
him to London there that all the barons of England him abode to make him
king. And so they went on their way toward London / And when they came on
Gyldesdowne tho said the traitor Godwin unto Alured. Take keep about you both
on the lift side and right side / and of all ye shall be king / and of such
an hundred more / Now forsothe said Alured. I behyght you and if I be king. I
shall ordeyne and make such laws / wherefore god and man shall be well
pleased. Now had the traitor commanded all his men that were with him. that
when they were come upon Gildesdowne / that they should slay all yt were in
Aluredes company / that came with him fro Normandy / and after that take Alured
and led him in to the isle of Ely / and after put out both his eyes of his
heed / and afterward bring him to death / and so they did. For they slew all
ye company that there were / the nombre of.xij. gentylmen that were come with him
fro Normandy / and after took they Alured and in the isle of Ely they put out
his eyes and rent his womb and took the chyef of his bowels / and put a stake
in the ground / and an end of the bowels thereto fastened / and with nedyls
eylesse of yren they pryched the good child / and so made him to go about the
stake till that all his bowels were drawn out of his body / and so deyed
Alured there thorugh treason of the earl Godewin. When the lords of England
had herd and wist how Alured that should have be their king was put to death
through the false traitor Godewin they were wonder wroth. And swore between god
and them / that he should deye a more wors death / than did Edrith of Stratton
/ that had betrayed his lord Edmonde Irensyde / and they would have put hy^ to
death / but ye theyf traitor fled thens in to Denmark / and there held hy^
four year and more / and lost all his land in England.

SIluester the third was pope after Benedictus. This Siluester was chose / and
Benedictus was ^^pulsyd. And afterward was he expulsyd / and Benedictus was
put up again. And after he was put out / and Gregorius was made pope. And he was
but a simple lettred man / and therefore he chose an other man for to be
consecrate with him. And when many men were dyspleased with this gydynge of two
popes / the third was brought in / the which should occupye the place of
both tho two. And so they strove among themself. But Henry the Emperor came
then to Rome and deposyd them all / and made Clement the second pope / whom
he made anon to crown him. And he said to the Romans / they should never
ch^se pope without his assent. And so five being popes / the sixte was put in.
But many men say / this Gregorus was an holy man. Dama^ius the second was
after Clement.xx. days. This man was an usurper of the popeheed / and so he
deyed suddenly. And anon the Romans asked to have a pope / and that the
Almaynes should have none. For they were so hard herted / that they might not
enclyne to the entente of the Emperor / the which said. There should be no
pope chosen but if he would be of counseyll of the eleccyon. But for all that
they putt in this holy man Leo and after he bad of that conscience / and
refused. And anon he was chosen by the common assent this Leo put Christ in the
form of a Las^ in his own bed / and in the morrow he found no thing
there.

Of saint Edward the Confessor that was Aluredes brother how he was king of
England.
ANd when this was done / all the barons of England sent an other time in to
Normandy / for that Edward should come in to England (...) much honor. And
this Edward in his childehode loved almighty god and him dradde. And in
honest and clennesse had ladde his life / and hated sin as death And when he
was crowned and anointed with a ryall power / he forgate not his good manners
and condycyons that he first used. And forgate not al good customs for no
manner honor / ne for riches / ne no manner hyghnes. But ever more and more
yaue him to goodness / and loved god and holy church passing all other
manner thing. And poor men also he loved / and them held as they had been his
own brethern. And to them often he yaue great alms with full good will.

Of the first specyal love that god showed to saint Edward living.
IT befell on a day / as he went from the church of Westmynstre. and had
herd mass of saint Johan the Euangelyst / for as much as he loved saint John
Euangelyst more specially after god and our lady than he did any other saint.
And so there came to him a pilgrim / and prayed him for the love of god and
our lady and saint John the Euangelyst some good him for to give. And ye king
pryuely took his ring of his finger / that no man perceived it and yaue it to
the pilgrim / and he it received and went thens. This king Edward^ made all
the good laws of England / that yet ben most used and holden. And was so
mercyable and so full of pity / that no man might be more.

How the earl Godewin came again in to England and had again all his land / and
afterward saint Edward wedded his daughter.
AS the Earl Godewin that was dwelling in Denmark had much herd of the
goodness of king Edward / and that he was so full of mercy and of pity. He
thought that he would go again in to England / for to seek and to have grace
of the good king Edward that so merciful was / that he might have again his
land in peace. And arrayed him as much as he might and put hy^ toward the sea
and came in to England to London there that the king was that time and all the
lords of England / and held a parlyament. Godewin sent to him that were his
friends / and were the most grettest lords of the land / and pray to them to
beseech the kings grace for him / and that he would his peace and his land
grant him. The lords led him before the king to seek his grace. And anon
as the king him saw / he apeled him of treason / and of the death of Alured his
brother / and these words unto him said. Traitor Godewin said the king I the
appele / that thou have betrayed and slain my brother Alured. Certes sir said
Godewin. saving your grace and your peace and your lordshyp. I him never
betrayed / ne yet him slew. And therefore I put me in reward of ye court. Now
fair lords said the king. Ye that been my lyeges / earls and barons of the
land that here be assembled / full well ye herd mine appele / and the answer
also of Godewin / and therefore I woll that ye awarde and does right. The earls
and barons tho gadred them all together for to do this awarde by themself / and
so they spoke dyuersely among them. For some said / there was never alyau^ce
by homage seriment service / ne by lordshypp between Godewin and Alured / for
which thing they might him draw. And a^^ the last they devised and demed /
that he should put him in the kings mercy all together. Tho spoke the earl
Leuerik of Couentree a good man to god and to all the world / and told his
reason in this manner and said. The earl Godewin is the best frended man of
England after the king / and well it might not be again said / that without
counsel of Godewin Alured was never putt to death / Wherefore I awarde as
towchynge my part / that himself and his sone and every of us.xij. earls that been his friends go before the king / charged with as much gold and silver as
we may bear betwixt our hondes / prayenge the king to forgive his evil will
to the earl Godewin / and receive his homage / and his land yield again. And
they accorded unto that a ward / and came in this manner as is above said /
every of them with gold and silver as much as they might bear between her
hondes before the king / and there said the form and the manner of their
acorde and of their awarde. The king would not them agaynsaye / but as much
as they ordained / he granted and confermed. And so was the earl Godewin
accorded with the king / and so he had again all his land. And afterward he
bare him so well and so wisely / that the king loved him worder much / and
with him he was full preuy. And within a little time they loved so much / that
there the king spowsed Godewins daughter / and made her queen. And
nevertheless though the king had a wife / yet he lived ever in chastyte and
clennesse of body without any flesshly deed doing with his wife. And the queen
also in her half ladde an holy life two year / and deyed. And afterward the
king lived all his life without any wife. The king yaue the erledom of
Oxenforde to Harolde that was Godewins sone / and made him earl. And so well
they were beloved / both the fader and he / and so pryue with the king / both
the fader and the sone / that they might do by right what thing that they
would / For against right would he no thing do for no manner man / so good and
true he was of conscience. And therefore our lord Ihesu Christ great specyll
love unto him showed.

How king Edward saw Swyne king of Denmark drowned in the sea in the time
of the Sacrament as he stood and herd mass.
IT befelle upon Wytsondaye as king Edward herd his mass in the great
church of Westmestre right at the leuacyon of Ihesu Crystys body / and as all
men were gadred in to the church / and came nygh the awter for to see the
sacrynge / the king his hondes lift up on high / and a great laughter took
up. Wherefore all that about him stood gretely ganne wonder. And after mass /
they axed why the kings laughter was Fair lord said king Edward. I saw
Swyne the younger that was king of Denmark come in to the sea with all his
power for to have come in to England upon us for to war. And I saw him and
all his folk drowned in the sea. and all this I saw in the leuacyon of
Crystis body between the priests bond / and I had therefore so great Joy that
I might not my laughter withholde / And the earl Leueryk beside him stood at
the leuacyon / and openly saw the form of bread torn in the lyknesse of a
young child / and took up his right hand and blessed the king and after the
earl and the earl anon tomed him toward the king for to make him see that
holy sight. And tho said the king. Sy^^ Earl said he I see well that ye see
thanked be god yt I have honored my god my savior visybly Ihesu Christ in four
me of man. Whoos name be blessed in all worlds. AMEN

How the ring that said Edward bod given to a poor pilgrim for the love of
god and said Johan Euangelyst came again to king Edward.
THis noble man said Edward reigned.xiij. year. And thus it befell upon a time
are he deyed / that two men of England were gone in to holy land / and had
done their pilgrimage / and were going again in to their own country where
they came fro. And as they went in the way / they met a pilgrim that
curteysly them saluwed / and axed of them in what land and in what country
they were borne. And they said in England. Tho axed he who was king of
England. And they answered and said. the good king Edward. Fair friends
said tho the pilgrim / when that ye come in to your country again. I pray you
that ye will go unto king Edward / and oftentimes great him in mine name / and
oftentimes him thank of his great curteysye / that he to me has done and
namely for the ring that he yaue me when he had herd mass at Westmestre for
saint Iohans love Euangelyst And took the ring / and took it to the pilgrims
and said. I pray you go and bear this ring / and take it unto king Edward /
and tell him that I send if him / and a full rich yefte I will him give. For
upon the.xij. day he shall come unto me / and ever more dwell in bliss
without any end. Sir said the pilgrims / what man be ye / and in what
country is your dwelling. Fair friends said he. I am John the Euangelyst /
and I am dwelling with almighty god / and your king Edward is my friend / and
I love him in special for by cause that he has evermore lived in clennesse
and is a clean maid / and I pray you my message fulfill as I have you said.
When yt saint John y^ Euangelyst had them thus charged / suddenly he voyded out
of their syghtes both The pilgrims tho thanked almighty god and went forth
their way. And when they had gone two or three mile / they began to wax very
and set them adowne for to rest them / and so they fell on sleep / And when
they had slepte well / one of them awoke and lift up his heed and looked about
/ and said to his fellow. Arise up and walk we in our way. What said that one
fellow unto that other / where be we now. Certes said that other / it seems me
that this is not the same country there we laid us down in for to rest and
sleep. For we were from Jerusalem but three mile. They took up their hondes and
blessed them / and went forth in their way / And as they went in their way /
they saw sheperdes going with their sheep y^ spoke none other langage but
english Good friends said one of the pilgrims / what country is this / and
who is lord thereof. And one of the sheperdes answered and said / this country
is the country of Kente in England / of the which the good king Edward is
lord of. The pilgrims thanked tho almighty god and saint John Euangelyst /
and went forth in their way and came to Caunterbury / and fro thens unto
London / and there they found the king. And told him all from the beginning
unto the ending asmoche as saint John had them charged / and of all things
how they had sped by the way. And took the ring to king Edward / and he
took it / and thanked almighty god and saint John Euangelyst And tho made him
ready every day fro day to day to depart out of this life / when god would
for him send.

How saint Edward deyed the Twelfth day.
ANd after it befell thus on Christ mass even / as the holy man Edward was at
gods service matyns for to here of that high solemn feast. he became full
syke / and in the morrow endured with much pain the mass for to here. And
after mass he let him be ladde in to his chamber / there for to rest him.
But in his halle among his barons and his knights might he not come them for
to comfort and solace / as he was wont for to do at that worthy feast.
Wherefore all their mirth and comfort among all that were in the halle was
tonned in to care and sorrow / because they dradde for to lose the good lord
the king. And upon saint John day Euangelyst that came next / the king
received his ryghtes of holy church / as it befalls to every christian man /
and abode the mercy and yt will of god. And the two pilgrims he let before
him come and yaue them rich yeftes and betoke them to god. Also the abbot of
Westmestre he let before him come and took him that ring in the honor of god
and saint Mary / and of saint Johan the Euangelyst. And the abbot took it and
put it among other relykes / so that it is at Westmestre / and ever shall be /
and so lay the king syke till the twelfth eve. And tho deyed the good king
Edward at Westmestre / and there he lies. For whoos love god has showed many
a fair miracle. And this was in the year of the Incarnacyon of our lord Ihesu
Christ.M.lxv. And after he was translated and put in to y^ shryne by the noble
martyr saint Thomas of Caunterbury.

UIctor the second was pope after Leo / and of him little is written. Henry y^
second was Emperor after the first Henry.xvij. year / this man was cosyn to
Conradus / and he was borne in a wood / and twyes taken for to be slain when
he was a child / but god defended him evermore. When he was made Emperor /
many a monastery he made in the same place in the wood where he was borne. This
man was a victoryous man / and he entered in to Ytaly / and there he took
Padulphus the prince of Campany. Strepha^^s the.ix. was pope after Victor.ix.
months. Benedictus after him / and he took the dygnyte of the pope Stephanus
by strength and kept it.ix. months / and then decessyd. Henry the third
was Emperor after Henry the second / this Henry was an (...) man / and many
times troubled that holy man Gregorius the.vij. And first he axed forye^enesse
and was assoyled. But he per^euered not long / but brought in an other pope
against him / and said he was an heretyke. And Gregorius cursyd him. And the
chesers of the Emperor they chose the duke of Saxon for to be Emperor / whom
this Henry in battle overcame. And then he came to Rome with his pope and
pursewed pope Gregorius and the Cardynalles also. And then anon Robert the
king of Naples drove him thens / and delivered the pope and his Cardynalles.
Nevertheless yet he was a man of great alms. And.xij. times he faught in
battle / and a^^ the last he deyed wretchedly / for he was put there by his
own sone. For so as he did to other men / so was he done unto Nicholaus the
second was pope after Benedictus two year / this Nicholaus called a counsel
against the Archedeken of Turonoseus / the which was an her^tyke / and he
taught against the faith. For he erred in the sacrament / and after he was
converted and was an holy man / but he could never co^uerte his dyscyples.
Nota. Alexander y^ second was pope after him.xij. year / this Alexand was an
holy man. and he ordained y^ under pain of cursynge that no man should here a
priests mass whom men knew had a lemman (Vt pz.xxxij. p^ter hoc) He had
strive with one Codulo / but he expulsyd hy^ as an usurper / and put him out as a
symonyer.

How Harolde that was Godewins sone was made king / and how he escaped from the
duke of Normandy.
AS saint Edward was gone out of this world / and was passed to god and
worthily enteryd as to such a great l^^de ought / the barons of the land

of the reame. But Hands sone through the earl Godewin / and the strength of his
fader Godewin / and torugh other great lords of the reame / that were of his
kynne and unto hy^ sybbe seized all England in to his bond / and anon let
crown him king after the enterement of Saint Edward. This sy^olde that was
Godewines sone the second year before that saint Edward was deed / would have
gone in to Flaundres but he was driven through tempest in to the country of
Pountyse / and there he was taken and brought to duke Wylliam And this Harolde
wend that tho this duke Wyllyam would have be avenged (...) him for by cause
that y^ earl Godewin that was Haroldes fader / had let ^lee Alured that was
saint Edwardes (...) and pryncypally for by cause that (...) was queen Emines
sone / that was Richardes mother duke of Norman die that was a^^nll to the duke
William And nevertheless when the duke William had Harolde in prison and under
his power / forasmoche as this Harold was a noble wise knight and a worthy of
body / and that his fader and he was accorded with good king Edward / and
therefore would not mysdo him. But all manner things that betwixt them was
spoken and ordained. Harolde by his good will swore v^on a book / and upon holy
saints that he should spouse and wedde duke Willyams daughter after the death
of saint Edward / and that he should besely do his d^uour for to keep and save
the reame of England unto the profit and auantage of duke Wyllyam. And when
Harolde had thus made his oath unto y^ duke Wyllyam he let him goo / and ya^^
him many a ^^yche yettes. And he tho went (...) him be amenged what (...)
befell. And anon (...) assemble a great (...) and come in to England to
avenge him upon Harolde / and to conquert the land if that he might. And in
the same year that Harolde was crowned. Harolde Herekynge king of Denmark
arrived in Scotland and thought to have be king of England / and he came in
England and (...) / and destroyed all that he might / till that he came to
York / and there he slew many men of arms a thousand and a h^^dred
priests. When this tydydges came to y^ king / he assembled a great power /
and went for to fight with Haralde of Denmark / and with his own hondes he him
slew / and the Danes were dyscomfyted / and tho that were left alive with
much sorrow fled to theye ships. And thus king Harolde of England slew
king Haralde of Denmark.

things / if that he would have his daughter to wife as he made and swore his

Wellyam destroyed holy church and their possessyous. in what part he might

Archebysshop of Caunterbury Ancelmus. For by cause that he reprenyd him of his
wickedness / that he destroyed Holy church. And for that cause the king bare
to him great wrath. And so he exyled him out of this land / and the
Archbysshop went to the court of Rome / and there dwelled with the pope / And
this king made the new forest / and cast down and destroyed.xxvi. towns /

/ did many a miracle this time. And he ordained the friar Minores. And the.vi.
year of pope Innocencius the third / the order of the friar Prechers began
under Domynyk / but it might not be confermed till the first year of Honorius.

Of king John / that in the first year of his regne lost all Normandye.
AS king Richard was deed / by cause that he hades none heir / another sone /
ne daughter / then his brother Johan was made king / and crowned at
Westmester of Hubert that tho was Archebysshop of Counterbury. And when he
began for so regne / he became so meruayllous a man / and (...) over in to
Normandye / and warred upon the the king of France. And so long they (...)
together / till at the last king John lost all Normandy and Angoy / where fast
he was sore anoyed / and it was no meruaylle. Tho let he assemble before him
at London Archebysshops / bishops / abbots and pryours / earls and barons and
held there a great parlyament / and axed there of the Clergy / the tenthe of
every church of England / for to conquer and get again Normandy and Angoy
that he had lost. They would not graile that thing / wherefore he was wonder
wroth. And in that same time deyed Hubert. The pryour and the covent of
Canterbury those against the kyng^ will to be Archebysshop Stephen of Langton a
good clerk / that dwelled at the court of Rome / and sent to the pope their
eleccyon / and the pope confermed it and sacred him at Viterbi. When the king
wist these tidings / he was wonder wroth / and drove the pryour and the
couente fro Canterbury / and exyled out of England / and commanded that no
letter that come fro Rome / ne commandment / should be received ne pletyd in
England. When these tidings came to the pope / he sent king John his letter
/ and prayed him With good will and good heart / that he would receive Stephen y^
Archebysshopp of canterbury to his church / and suffer the pryoour and his
monks to come again to their own dwellyngs. But the king would no^ grant it
for no thing.

How king John would no thing do for the popes commandment. Wherefore all
England was enterdyted and suspended.
ANd at the last the pope sent by his (...) / and enjoined to the bishops of
England / that if the king would not receive the pryour of Cou^terbury and
his monks / they should do general enterdytynge through out all England. And
full power to four bishops to pronounce the enterdytynge / if he if warned.
The first was bishop Wyllyam of London and that other bishop Eustace of
(...) was bishop Walter of Wynche^^^ / and the fourth was bishop (...) forde.
And these (...) the king knelynge (...) sore weeping that he (...)
commandment. And (...) popes Bulls of the (...) for no prayer (...) he
would not consent (...) the bishops (...) the king. And in the (...)
Annunciacion of (...) the general (...) all England so that (...) were thytte
with (...) and with walls. And when (...) dytynge was prono^^^d (...) began
for to were al out of (...) anon took in to his bond all the (...) syons of
the four bishops (...) clergy thrughout all England (...) he took / and
ordained men for (...) it that the clerks might not have (...) living.
Wherefore the bishops (...) all them that put or should meddle (...) holy
church goods / against the (...) them that ought them. And (...) the king
would not of his maly^^ (...) for no manner thing. These four bishops before
said went over the (...) and came to the bishop of Caunterbury and told him
all th^^thyng^. And they Archebysshop to them said that they should go again to
Caunterbury and he should come thither to them or else be would send unto
them certain parlours in his stead that should do as much as of he himself
were there. And when the bishops herd this they (...) again in to England /
and came unto Caunterbury. The tidings ^ame to the king / that the bishops
were come again to Caunterbury^ and himself might not come thither that time /
he sent thither bishops ertes and abb^ts / for to treat with them / that the
king should receive ch^rchebysshop Stephen / and the pryour and all the monks
of Canterbury / that he should never after y^ time no thing take of holy
church against y^ will of them that owes the goods. And y^ the king should
make full amends to them / of whom he had any goods taken. And y^ holy
church should have all frau^chyse / as ferforth as they had in saint Edwardes
time the holy Confessor.

How Stephen of Langton came again in to England through the popes commandment
/ and how he went again.
SO when the form of accordement thus was ordained. It was in a pair of
endentures / and they put their seals to y^ one part / and they that came in
the kings name put their seals to that other part of the endentures And
four bishops about said took y^ one part of the endentures to them. And that
other part of the endentures / they bare with them to show to the king /
When the king saw the form and understood he held hy^ full well apayed of
all manner things as they had ordained / saving as touching / restytucyon of
the goods for to make again. To that thing he would not accord / and so he
sent again to the four bishops / that they should do out and put away that
(...) point of restytucyon. But they answered / that they would not do one
word out. Tho sent the king to the Archebysshop by the four bishops that
he should come to Caunterbury for to speak with him there / and sent unto him
(...) under pledges. That is to sayet / his (...) at his own will And thus in
this manner tharchebysshop Stephen came to Cou^terbury. When y^ Archebysshop was
come / the king came to Ch^haz. For he would no nyghe Canterbury at that time.
But he sent by his Tresorer bishop of Wyncestre y^ he should do out of the
endentures y^ clause of / restytucyon / for to make of the goods / And
tharchebysshop made his oath y^ he would not never do out ^o word thereof / ne
yet it change of that the bishops had spoken and ordained. And tho the
chebysshop yede again to R^me without any more doing. King John was tho
wrother than ever he was before / and let make a common cry thorugh out all
England / that all tho y^ had holy church rentes / and went over the sea /
that they should come again in to England at a certain day / or else they
should lose their rentes for ever more. And that he commanded to every Shyref
through out all England / that they should inquire if any bishop / abbot or
pryour / or any other Prelate of holy church / fro that day afterward /
receive any commandment y^ comes fro the pope. That they should take the
body / and bring it before him / and that they should take in to the kings
hondes all their lands of holy church / that were give to any man / by y^
Archebysshop or by the pryour of Caunterbury / from the time of the eleccyon of
the Archebysshop. And commanded that all the woods that were the
Archebysshops should be cast done unto the ground / and all sold.

How king John destroyed the (...) of Cisteaux.
ANd in the same year / the I^ysshe men began to war upon king John / and
the king ^^deyned him for to go in to Irlonde / and let ^^tre an huge tax
thrughout all England / that is for to say.xxx. thousand mark. And thus he
sent through out all England unto the monks of y^ order of ^^steaux that they
should help him of.vi. thousand mark of silver. And they answered and said /
that they durst no thing do without their cheyf abbot of Cisteaux. Wherefore
king Johan when he came again from Irlonde / did them so much sorrow and care
/ that they wist not wheder to abide / for he took so much ^au^son of every
house / and the sum amou^ted to.ix. thousand and.iij. hundred mark / so that
they were clean lost and destroyed / and voyded their houses and their lands
thrughout all England. And y^ abbot of Wauersaye dradde so much his menace /
that he forsook all the abbaye and went thens / and pryuely ordained him over
the sea to the house of Cisteaux. When the tidings came to the pope / that the
king hat done so much malice / then he was toward the king full wroth. And
sent two Legates unto the king / that one was called Pandulf / and that
other. Duraunt / that they should warn the king in the popes name / that he
should cesse of his persecucyon that he did unto holy church / and amend the
wrong and the trespass / that he had done to the Archebysshop of Canterbury
/ and to the pryour and unto the monks of Caunterbury / and to all the clergy
of England. And that he should restore all the goods again that he had taken of
them against their will and else they should curse him by name / And to do this
thing / and to conferme the pope took them his letters in bulls patentes.
These two Legates came in to England / and came to the king to Northampton /
there that he held his parlyament / and full curteysly they him salewed and
said. Sir we come fro the pope of Rome / the peace of the holy church and the
land to amend. And we admonest you first in the popes half / that ye make
full restytuc^n of the goods that ye have rauysshed and taken of holy church
and of the land. And that re recerue Stephen Archebysshop of Caunterbury in to
his dygnytee / and the pryour of Canterbury / and his monks. And that ye
yield again unto the Archebysshop all his lands and rentes / without any
withholdynge. And sit yet more over that (...) shall make restytucyon / unto
all holy church / whereof they shall hold (...) well a^a^ed. Tho answer^d the
king as touch^nge the (...) of Caunterbury (...) said I will do gladly (...)
ye will ordeyn^. But as (...) Archebysshop. I shall (...) as it lies. That the
(...) leave his Archebysshop (...) pope then for him (...) then upon (...)
some other bysshop^^^^^ to (...) England. And upon (...) will him accept
(...) theles as Archebysshop in (...) he abide / he shall never have (...)
saufconduyte but that be (...) Tho said Pandulf unto the (...) Sire holy
chu^che was wont (...) dyscharge an Archebysshoppe (...) cause reasonable. But
eue^ it has (...) to chastyse princes that to god (...) church were
^nobedyene^. (...) how now said the king menace (...) Nay said Pandult but ye
now (...) have told as it stands in your (...) And to ^ou we will tell what
is the (...) will. And thus it stands that ^e has you holy enterdy^ed and
(...) for the wrongs that ye have done to holy church and to the clergy. And
for as much as ye dwell and beth in will to abide in malice and in (...) and
will not come out thereof ne to amend ye shall understand that this time
afterward the senteence is upon you (...) and holds stead and strength and
upon all tho that with you hat co^^ned before this tyme^whether there ben earls
(...) / ^s knights / or any other what so ever y^ they be / we them assaylle /
saufly unto this day. And fro this time afterward of what condycyon someuer
that they ben we them accurse / that with you comyne any word / and do we
sentence upon them openly and specially. And we assoyle clean / earls / barons
/ knights / and all other men of their homages / seruyces and feaute^s / that
they should unto you do / And this tydynge to comferme / we give plain power /
to the bishop of Wyn chestre / and to the bishop of Norwyche. And the same
power we yeu^ in to Scotlonde to the bishops of Rochestre and of Salysbury.
And in Walys we give the same power to the bishop of saint David and of Landaf
and of saint Ass. And more over we sent through out all Crystendom / that all
the bishops beyond the sea / that they do accurse all tho that help you / or
any counsel yeueth you in any manner need that ye have to do in any part of
the world. And we assoylle them also all / by auctoryte of the pope / and
command them also with you for to fight / as with him that is enmye to all
holy church. Tho answered the king. What may ye do more to me / Tho answered
Pandulf. We say to you in the word of god / that ye ne no heir that ye have
never after this day may be crowned. Tho said the king. By him that is
almighty god / and I had wist this are that ye came in to my land / that ye
had brought me such tidings. I should have made you ride al one year. Tho
answered Pandulf / Full well wend we at our first coming / that ye would have
be obedyent to god and holy church / and have fulfilled the popes
commandment / and now we have showed unto you / and pronounced the popes will
/ as we were charged therewith And as now ye have said / that if ye had wist the
cause of our coming / that ye would have do us to ride all an hole year. And
as well ye might have said / that ye would have taken (...) hoole year of
(...). But for to suffer what death ye (...) ordeyne / we shall not spare for to
tell you holy all the popes message and his will / that we were charged with.

How Pandulf delivered a clerk that had falsyd and cou^^^^^^tyd the kings
money before the king himself.
ANd anon the commanded the king the Syrefs and Bayly^s of Northampton / that
were in the kings presence / that they should king forth all the prisoners /
that they might be done to death before Pandulf / for by caus^ the king wened
that they would have gaynsayd their deeds / for cause of the death all thing
that they had spoken before. When the prisoners were come before the king / the
king commanded some to be hanged / and some to be drawn and some to draw
out their eyes out of their heed. And among all other / there was a clerk
that had fullyd the kings money. And the king commanded that he should le
hanged and drawed. And when Pandulf herd this commandment of the king / he
sterte hy^ up right quyckly / and anon axed a book and a candelb / and would
have cursyd the king / and all them that would set upon the clerk any
hand. And Pandulf himself went for to seek a cross. And the king followed him
/ and delivered him the clerk by the hotde that he should do with him what he
would. And thus was the clerk delivered and went them. And Pandulf and
Duraunt his fellow went fro the king / and came again to the pope of Rome.
And told him that king Johan would not amended be. But ever abode so
accursyd. And nevertheless the pope granted that year (...) out all England /
that (...) might (...) chirches / and (...) body / and give it to syke men
which were lykly to pass out of this world. And also y^ men might christian
childern over all y^ land. And when the pope wyste and saw that the king
would not be under the rule of holy church for no manner thing. The pope
then sent to the king of France in remyssyon of his sins / that he
should take with him all the power that he might / and go in to England for to
destroy the king John. When these tidings came to king John / then was he
sore anoyed / and sore dradde lest he should lose his reame / and himself be
done to the death. Then sent he to the pope messengers and said. He would be
Justified / and come to amendment in all things / and would make satysfaccyon
to all manner of men after the popes ordinance. Then sent the pope again in
to England Pandulf and other messengers / and came to Caunterbury to the king
and there abode. And the.viij. day of May / the king made an oath for to
stand to the popes ordinance / before Pandulf y^ Legate in all manner of
things in which he was accursyd. And that he should make full restytucyon to
all men of holy church and of relygyon / and of the goods that he had taken
of them against their will. And all the great lords of England swore upon the
book and by their holydom / that if the king would not hold his oath / they
said that they would by strength make him hold it. Then put the king him to
the court of Rome / and theme gaaf he up the reame of England and of Irlonde
for him and for his heirs for ever mo^e that should come after him / (...)
that king John and his ^eytes should take the two reames of the popes hondes /
And should every year pay ferme unto the court of Rome a thousand mark of
silver. And tho took the king the crown of his heed and set it upon his
(...). And these words said he in herynge of all the great lords of England.
Here I resygne up the crown and the realm of England in to the pope
Innocencius hondes the third / and put me holy in his mercy and in his
ordinance Tho received Pandulf the crown of king John / and kept it five
days as fore ceasing / taking of two realms / of England and of Irelonde.
And co^fermed all manner thing / by his realtre / that follows after.

How the clerks that were (...) came again / and how king John was assoylled.
SO when this chartre was made and ensealed / the king received again his
crown of Pandulfus hand. And sent anon unto the Archebysshop Stephen / and
to all his after clerks and lewd men / that he had exiled out of this land /
that they should come again in to England / and have again their lands and
also their rentes. And that he would make reflytucyon of the goods that he had
taken of theyrs against their will. The king himself tho and Pandulf / and
earls and (...) went unto Wynchestre against the Archebysshop Stephen. And when
he was come. the king went against him and fell adowne to his feet / and thus
to him said. Fair sire ye be welcome. And I cry you mercy by cause that I
have trespassed against you. The Archebysshop took him up tho in his arms / and
kyssyd him curteysly oftentimes / and after led him to the door of saint
Swythunes church by the hand / and assoylled him of the sentence / and him
^^^^syled to god and to holy church. And that was on Saint Margaretes day.
And the Archebysshop anon went (...) (...) she asked. The Legate went then
again to the pope after Cryst^^^e. And the king sense over see to Iulyan that
was king Rychardes wife / for to have a relace of that she axed of him. And so
it befell / that Iulyan deyed anon after Eester. And in so much the king
was quyte of that thing that she ared But then at the feast of saint John
that came next after / thorugh the popes commandment / the enterdytynge was
first releasyd thrughout all England / the seventh day of Iulij. And vii.
(...) was the land enterdyted. And on y^ morning men ronge and said mass
thorugh out all London and so after thorugh out all England. And the next
year after there began a great debate between king Johan and the lords of
England / for by cause that be would not grau^e the laws and hold the ^^che
saint Edward had ordained and had been used and holden unto that to me that he
had them broken. For be ^^de hold no law / but did all thing that him
lyked / and dyshertysed many men without consent of lords and ^^^tys of y^
land. And would (...) the good earl Rodulf of Ch^^h^ for by ^^^se that he
undertook hy^ of his wickedness / and for cause that he did so much shame
and vylany to god and to holy ch^rche. And also for he held and haunted his
own brothers wife / and lay also by many other (...) great lord^^ daughters.
For be spared no woman that him lyked for to have. Wherefore all the lords of
the land were wroche and (...) the cite of London. To c^sse this debate the
Archebtysshop and lo^des of the land assembled before the feast of saint John
Baptyst in a medowe belyde the town of Stanys that is called (...) (...) for
the king himself soon after did against the points of the same chartre that
he had made. Wherefore the most part of the lords of the lands assembled and
began to war upon him again / and ^^nned his towers / and robbed his folk /
and did all the sorrow that they might / and made them as strong as they
might with all the power they had / and thought to drive him out of England /
and make Lowys the kings sone of France king of England. And king John^
sent tho over see / and ordained so much people of Normans / and of Pycardes
/ and of Flemynges / so that the land might not sustain them / but with
much sorrow. And among all this people / there was a man of Normandye that
was called Fawkis of Brent / and this Norman and his company spared another
chuches ne houses of relygyon / but they burnt and robbed it / and bare away
all that they might take so that the land was all destroyed / what of any
side and of other. The barons and lords of England ordained among them the
best spehers and wysest men / and sent them over the sea to king Phylypp of
France and prayed him / that he would send Lowys his sone in to England to
be king of England / and to receive the crown.

How Lowys the kings some of France came in to England with a strong power
of people / to be king of England
A None as king Philyp of France herd these tidings / he made ^etayne
alyaunce between them by their comune eleccyon / that Lowys king Philyps sone
of France should go^ with them in to England / and dry^se (...) king John
of the land. And all that were in presence of Lowys / made unto him homage /
and became his men (...) (...) was set before him upon the table / And the
monk said / that the loof was worth but an half penny. O said the king tho.
Here is great chepe of bread. Now said he cho / and I may live any while such
a loof shall be worth.xx. shelynges or half a year be gone. And so when he said
this word / much he thought / and often he syghed / and took and ete of the
bread / and said by god / the word that I have spoken / it shall be soth. The
monk that stood before the king was for this word full sorry in his heart /
and thought / rather be would himself suffer death / and thought if he might
ordeyne therefore some manner remedy. And anon the monk went unto his abbot
and was shryuen of him / and told the abbot all that the king had said. And
prayed his abbot for to assoyle him / for he would give the king such a drink
that all England should be glady there of and Joyful. Tho yede the monk in
to a gardeyne / and found a great tode therein / and took her up and put her
in a cup / and prycked the tode thorugh which a broche many times till that
the venym came out of every side in the cup And tho took the cup and filled
it with good ale / and brought it before the king knelynge saying. Sir said
he Wash sayll / for never the days of all your life drunk ye of so good a
cup. Begin monk said the king. And the monk drank a great draught / and
took the king the cup / and the king drank also a great draught / and
set down the cup. The monk anon right went in to (...) and there deyed
anon / on (...) soul god have mercy Amen. And fine monks sing for his soul
specially / and shall while that the abbay^ stands. The king rose up anon
full evil at ease and commanded to remeue the table / and axed after the
monk. And men told him that he was deed for his womb was broken in sondre.
When the king herd this / he commanded for to trusse / but it was for naught
/ for his belly began to swelle for the drink that he had drunk / and within
two da^^^ he deyed on the morrow after saint Luli^ day / and had many fair
chidern of his body begoten / that is to say. Henry his sone that was king
after John (...) fader / and Richard that was Earl of Comewalle / and Ysabell
that Empress of Rome / and Elenore that was queen of Scotlonde. And this king
Johan when he had reigned. (...) and five months and five da^es be (...) in
the castle of newerbe. And his body was buried at Wynchestre.

Anno dm^.M.CC.
ERedericus the second was Emperor.xxx. year. This man was crowned of
Honorius y^ pope against (...) for by cause that be should frghte with him / the
which be did and ^^pullyd him. And first be nourysshed the ch^^che / and
afterward he dylpoyled it as a stepmoder. Wherefore Honorius (...) him / and
all tho that were contrary to his opinion the pope assoylled. And the same
sentence Girgorius the.ii. renewed And this same man put Henry his own sone
into prison / and there murdered him. Wherefore when this Emperor an other
season was syke by an other sone of his own he was mindred in the time of
Innocenicus the fourth. Honorius the third was pope after Innocencius. x. year
/ and confermed the order of friar Prechers and Mynors. And made certain
Decretalles.

Of king Henry the third that was crowned at Gloucetre.
ANd after this king John reigned his sone Henry / and was crowned at Gloucetre
when he was.ix. year old / on saint Symondes day and Jude of Swalo the Legate
of Rome through counsel of all the great lords that held with king Johan
his fader / that is to say / the earl Radulf of Chestre. Willyam earl Marshall
earl of Penbroke. Willyam the Brener earl of Feriers. Serle the manly baron.
And all other great lords of England held with Lowys the kings sone of
France. And anon after when king Henry was crowned. Swalo the Legate held
his counsel at Brystowe at saint Martyns feast. And there were.xi. bishops
of England and of Walys / and of other prelates of holy church a great nombre
/ and earls and barons / and many knights of England. And all tho that were
at that counsel / swore feawte unto Henry the king that was king John's
sone. And anon after the Legate enterdyted Walys / for cause that they held
with the barons of England. Also all tho that help / or yaue any counsel to
meue war against the new king Henry he accursyd them. And at the beginning
/ he put in the sentence the kings sone of France Lowys. And nevertheless the
same Lowys would not spare for all that. But went and took the castle of
Barcamstede / and also the castle of Hertforde. And from that day afterward
/ the barons did there somo che harm thrughout all England. and pryncypalle
the Frensshe men that were with king Lowys. Wherefore the great lords / and
all the common people of England / let them dress / for to drive Lowys and
his company out of England / but some of the barons and Frensshe men were gone
to the cite of Nicholl / and took the town and held it to king Lowys profit.
But chyther came king Henryes men with a great power / that is to say the
earl Radulf of Chestre / and Wyllyam earl Marshall / and Wyllyam the Brener
earl of Feriers / and many other lords with them / and yaue battle unto Lowys
men. And there was slain the earl of Perchees / and Lowys men were foul
dyscomfyted. And there was taken Serle earl of Wynchestre / and Humfroy de
Boune earl of Hertforde / and Robert the sone of Walter / and many other that
began war against the king / there they were taken and led unto king Henry
/ that was king Iohans sone. And when ye tidings came to Lowys of the
dyscomfyture / y^ was the kings sone of France. He remeued fro thens and
went unto London / and let shytte the yates fast of the cite. And anon after
the king sent to the Burgeys of London / that they should yield them unto him
/ and the cite also. And he would them grant all their fraunchyses that ever
they were wont to have before. And would conferme them by his great new
chartre under his broad seal. And in the same time a great lord that wat
called Eustace the monk came out of France with a great company of Lords /
and would have come in to England / for to have helped Lowys the kings sone
of France. But Hubert of Brugh / and the five ports with.viij. ships tho
met with them in the high see / and assaylled them egrely / and overcame
them with strength / and smote of Eustace the monks heed. And took also.x.
great lords of France and put them in to prison. And slew almoost all the
men that came with them / and anon drowned the ships in the sea.

How Lowys turned again in to France / and of the confermacyon of king Iohans
chartre.
SO when Lowys herd these tydynages / he dradde sore to be deed and lost. And
let ordeyne / and speak between y^ king and Lowys by the Legate Swalo. And
thorugh the Archebysshopp of Canterbury / and through other great lords that
all the prisoners on that one half and that other should be delyuerd and go
quyte. And Lowys himself should have for his costs a thousand pound of
silver. and should go out of England / and come never more therein again. And
in this manner was the accord made between king Henry and Lowys. And tho was
Lowys assoylled of y^ popes Legate / that was called Swalo of the sentence that
he was in / and the Barons of England also. And after this king Henry and
Swalo the Legate and Lowys went to Merton and there was y^ peace confermed / and
between them ordained And after Lowys went from thens unto London and took
his leave / and was brought with much honor unto the sea with the
Archebysshopp of Caunterbury / and with other bishops / and also with earls
and barons / and so went in to France. And afterward the king and the
Archebysshop / and also earls and barons assembled them / and came to the cite
of London at Myghelmas that next came tho sewynge and held there a great
parlyament at London / And there were tho renewed all the frau^chyse that
king John had granted / at Romney mede / and king Henry tho confermed by
his chartre / the which yet ben holden through out all England. And in that
time the king took of every plough land.ij. shelynges / And Hubert of Brugh
was made tho cheyf Justice of England. And this was in the fourth year of king
Henryes regne. And in the same year was Saint Thomas of Canterbury translated
the.l. year after his martyrdom. And after it was ordained by all the lords of
England / that all Alyens should go out of England / and come no more therein.
And king Henry took tho all the castelles in to his hand / that king Johan
his fader had give and take to Alyens for to keep that held with him. But the
proud Fawkis of Brytayne rychely let array his castle of Bedforde / which he
had of king John's yefte / and held that castle against king Henryes will
with might and strength. And the king came thither with a strong power / and
be syeged the castle. And the Archebysshop master Stephen of Langton / with a
fair company of knights came to the king him for to help. And from the
Ascensyon of our lord unto y^ Assumpcyon of our lady lasted the syege. And tho
was the castle won and take. And the king let hang all tho that went in
to the castle with their good will. for to hold the castle. That is for to
say.lxxx. men. And tho afterward Fawkis himself was found and had in a
church at Couentree and there he forswore all England with much shame / and
went again in to his own country. And whiles that king Henry reigned.
Edmonde of Abyndon that was tresorer of Salysbury was consecrated Archchysshopp
of Caunterburye. And this king Henry sent over the sea unto the Earl of
prouynce / y^ he should send hy^ his daughter in to England / that was called
Ellenore and be would spowse her. And sho she came in to England after
Crystmas. And on the morrow after saint Hylaryes day the Archebysshop Edmonde
spowsed them together at Westmestre with great solempnyte. And there was a swear
sight between them. That is to say. Edward that was next king after his
fader / flower of curteysy and of largeness / and Margarete y^ was after queen
of Scotlonde / and Beau^^^e that was after countess of Brytayne / and
Kachetyne that deyed maid in relygyon.

Of the quinzeme of goods that wete granted for the new chartre / and of the
purueaunce of Oxforde.
ANd thus it befell that the lords of England would have some addicyons moo
in the chartre of frau^chyse that they had of the king / and spoke thus
between them. And the king granted them all their axynge. And made to them two
chartres / that one is called the great chartre of frau^chyses / and that other
is called y^ chartre of forest. And for the grant of these two chartres /
prelates / earls and barons / and all the comyns of England / yaue to the
king a thousand mark of silver When king Henry had be kynne.xliij. year /
the same year he and his lords earls and barons of the reame went to Oxforde
/ and ordained a law in amendment of the reame. And first swore the king
hymlself / and afterward all the lords of the land / that they would hold
that statute for evermore / and who that them brake should be deed. But the
second year after that that ordinance the king through counseyll of Edward
his sone / and of Richard his brother / that was earl of Cornewaylle / and
also of other repented him of that oath that he had made for to hold that law
and ordinance. And sent to the court of Rome to be assoylled of that oath.
And in the year next coming after / was the great darth of come in England.
For a qurter of whete was worth.xxiiij. shelynges. And the poor people ete
netles and other wedes for hungre. And deyed many a thousand for defawte of
mete. And in the.xlviij. year of king Henryes regne began war and debate
between him and his lords / for by cause that he had broken the couenauntes
that were made bytwone them at Oxforde. And the same year was y^ town of
Northampton taken / and folk slain that were within / for by cause that they
had ordained wild fire for to brenne the cite of London. And in the month of
May that came next after / upon saint Pancras day / was the battle of Jews
/ that is to say / the Wenesdaye before Saint Dunstans day. And there was
taken king Henry him self / and sir Edward his sone / and Rychar de his
brother earl of Corn wayll / and many other lords. And in the same year next
sewynge sir Edward the kings sone brake out of the ward of sir Symonde of
Mou^tforth / earl of Leycetre / at Heart / forde / and went unto the barons of
the March / and they received him with much honor. And the same time Gilbert
of Clarau^ce earl of Glocetre that was in the ward also of y^ foresaid Symonde
thorugh the commandment of king Henry / that went fro him with a great
heart / for cause that he said / that the foresaid Gilbert was a fool /
wherefore he ordained him afterward so / and held him with king Henry. And on
the Saterdaye next after the mids of August / sire Edward the kings sone
dyscomfyted sir Symonde de Mountforth at Kelyngworth / but the great lords
that were there with him were taken / that is to say. Baldewyne Wake. and
Willyam de Mou^chensye / and many other great lords. And the Tewysdaye next
after was y^ battle done at Eusha^ And there was slain sir Symonde de
Mou^tforth. Hugh the Spenser / and Mount forth that was Rauf Bassettes fader of
Draiton / and other many great lords / And when this bataylle was done / all
the gentylmen that had been with the earl Symonde were dysheryted / and ordained
together and did much harm to all the land. For they destroyed their enmyes
in all that they might.

Of the syege of Kenylworth / and how the gentylmen were dysheryted thorugh
counseyll of the lords of the reame of England / and how they came again and
had their lands.
ANd the next year coming in May / the fourth day before the frest of saint
Dunstane / was the battle and scomfyture at Chestrefelde / of them that were
dysheryted / and there was many of them slain. And Robert Earl of Feriers
there was taken / and also Baldewyne Wake / and John oclahay / with much sorrow
escaped thens. And on saint Iohans cue the Baptyst tho sewynge / began y^ syege
of the castle Kenilworth / and the syege lasted to saint Thomas eve y^
apostle. in which day sir Hugh Hastynge had the castle for to keep / that
yielded up the castle unto the king in this manner / that himself and the other
that were within the castle / should have their lives and ly^me / and as much
thing as they had therein / both horse and harneys / and four days of respyte /
for to deliver clenly ye castle / of themself / and of all other manner thing
/ as they had within the castle / and so they went fro the castle. And sir
Symonde Mou^tforth the younger / and the countess his mother were gone over the sea in to France / and there held them as people that were exyled out of
England for ever. And soon after it was ordained by the Legate Octobone / and
by other great lords / the wysest of England / that all tho that had be
against the king and were dysheryted / should have again theyt lands by grievous
rau^sons / after that it was ordained. And thus they were accorded with the
king / and peace cried th^^ughout all England / and thus the war was ended.
And when it was done / the Legate took his leave of the king and of the queen /
and of the g^rate lords of England / and went tho to Rome the.lv. year of
king Henryes regne / and Edward king John's sone of Brytayne Johan Vessi.
Thomas of Clare. Rogere at Cly^^orde. Oaths of (...) Robert le Bru^. Johan of
Verdon / and many other lords of England / and of be yonde the sea took they
way toward y^ holy land. And y^ king Henry deyed in the same time at
Westmestre / what he had reigned.lv. year and.xix. wekes / on saint Edmonds day
the Archebysshop of Caslterbury. And he was enteryd on saint Edmondes day the
king in the year of the Incarnacyon of our lord Jesus Christ.M.CC.lxxij.

Prophecye of Merlyn of the king Henry the first erpowned / that was king
Iohans sone.
ANd of this Henry prophesied Merlyn and said that a lamb^ should come out of
Wynchestre in y^ (...) re of the Incarnacyon of our lord Ihesu Christ.M.CC.
and.xvi. with true lyppes and holiness written in his herte^ And he said so the
/ for y^ good Henry the king was borne in Wynchestre in the year abouesayd /
and he spoke good words and sweet / and was an holy man and of good
conseyence. And Merlyn said / that this Henry should make the fairest place of
the world / that in his time should not be fully ended / and he said soth. For
he made the new work of y^ abbaye of saint Peter's church at Westmestre /
that is fayrer of sight than any other place y^ any man knows thorugh out all
^ystendom. But king Henry deyed are that work were fully at an end and that
was great harm. And yet said Merlyn / that this lamb should have peace the
most part of his regne. And he said full soth / for he was never noyed
thorugh war / neither dyseased in no manner wise / till a little before his
death / and Merlyn said in his prophecye more / and in the regne and end of
the fursayd la^^ be / a wulf of a strange land shall do^ him much har^^^
tho^^gh his (...) And that he should at y^ last be mayste^ thorugh help of a
reed fox / that should come forth of the Northwest and should hy^ overcome.
And that he should drive hy^ out of the water / and y^ prophecye full well was
known. For within a little time or the king deyed Symonde of Mou^tforde earl
of Leycetre / that was borne in France / began against him strong war /
through which doing / many a good bacheler destroyed was and deyed / and dyshe
ryted. And when king Henry had the byctory at Eusham / and Symond the earl was
slain thorugh help and might of Gilbert of Clare earl of Glocetre / yt was in
keeping and ward of the foresaid Symonde / through ordinance of king Henry /
that went again unto the king with much power. Wherefore the foresaid Symonde
was destroyed / and that was great harm to the comyns of England / that so
good a man was slain for the troth / and deyed in charity / and for the common
profit of the same folk / and therefore almighty god for him has syns showed
many a fair miracle to diverse men and wy^men of the spkenesse and disease that
they have had for the love of him And Merlyn also said in his prophecye / that
after that time / the lamb should live no while / and then his seed should
be in strange land without any pasture / and he said soth / for king Henry
lived no while after y^ Symonde Mount forde was slain / that king Henry ne
deyed anon after him. And in the mean time sir Edward his sone / that was
the best king of the world of honor / was tho in the holy land / and gate
there Acres. And in that country he begat there upon dame Elenore his wife
Johan of Acres his daughter / that afterward was countess of Glocetre / and
made such a vyage in the holy land / that all the world spoke of his
knyghthode / and every man dradde him / hye and low thorugh out all
crystendome / as the s^orye of him tells / as after ward ye shall here more
openly. And from the time that king Henry deyed / till that sir Edward was
crowned king / all the great lords of England were as faderles childern
without any socoure / that them might mayntene and govern / and defend
against their deedly enmyes.

ORegorius the.ix. was pope after Honorius / this man canonysed many saints /
and defended myghtely the church against Frederyk / therefore he took many
prelates and two Cardynalles / the which went to counsel against him This
pope was segyd in the cite of Rome by the Emperor / and he saw the Romans
were corrupt by the money of the Emperor. Then he took in his hand the
heedes of the appostles Peter and Poule / and went with processyon fro the
church of saint Johan Latranence / to saint Peter's church. And so he gate the
hertes of the Romans / and the Emperor went fair away fro y^ cite. This pope

last decessyd Richard / and Alphonsus came amye before Gregorius the.ix. by
the sign of peace / and utterly renounced all his title of the Empire / and he
had any / for he was a very wytty man / and a noble astronomer / and his tables

fourth was pope after Vrbanus.iij. year and.ix. months / this Clemens was an
holy man / and said through the spyryte of prophecy / that the enmyes of the

made a solemn counseyll / in the which the counsel of the Greeks and the
Tartars were and there the Greeks promised to be refout med by the unity of the
church. And the Tartars were but a little before baptized / and promised the
same. And there were gadred.vi. C. bishops and.M. prelates / and therefore a
certain man said Gregorius gadred togrder all kind of people And there was
decreed that all persans and vycaryes should be called priest. and no prelates
/ and that no man should assygne his tithes to what church he would as they
did before. But they should be paid to his mother church. And he dampened the

For in every place that sir Edward roode in London / the streets were covered

How Ydeyne that was Lewelyns daughter of Walys / prince Aymer / that was the
earls brother of Mounforde were taken in the sea.
THe first year after ward y^ king Edward was crowned Lewelyn prince of
wales sent into France to the earl Mountforde / y^ thorough counsel of his
friends / the earl should wedde his daughter. And y^ earl tho auysed hy^ upon
this thing / and sent unto Lewelny and said. that he would send after his
daughter. and so he sent Aymer his brother after the damoysell. and Lewelyn
arrayed ships for his daughter and for Sir Aymer. and for her fair company
that should goo with her. And this Lewelyn did great wrong. for it was
couenau^ted that he should give his daughter to no manner man / without
counsel and consent of king Edward. And so it befell that a Burgeys of
Brystow came in y^ see with wine laden: and met them / and took them with
might and power. And anon the burgeys sent them to the ky^ ge. And when
Lewelyn herd this tydy^ ges he was very wroth / and also sorrow full. and began
to war upon king Edward / and did much harm unto Englysshmen / and beat
down the kings castles / and began for to dystroye king Edwardes land: And
when tidings came unto the king of this thing / he went into walys and
somoche he dydd thoroughe gods grace and his great power / that he drofe
Lewelyn unto great myscheyf / that he fled all manner of strenth and came and
yielded him unto king Edward. and yaue him.l. mark of silver to have peace.
And took the damoysel and all his heritage. and made an oblygacio^ to king
Edward to come to his parlemente two times of the year. And in y^ second year
after that king Edward was crowned / he held a general parliament at
westmestre / and there he made the statutes for defaute of law by the comune
assente of all his baronage / And at Ester next sewenge / the king sent by
his letter unto Lewelyn prince of wales that he should come too his parlemente
for his land / and for his holding in wales / as the strenthe of his letter
oblygatory wytnessyd. Tho Lewelyn had scorn and dyspyte of the kings
commandment / And for pure wrath again began werre upon king Edward. and
dystroyed his lands. And tho when king Edward herd of these tidings. he
wexed wonder wroth unto Lewelyn and in have assembled his people / and went
him toward wales / And warred so upon Lewelyn the prince / tylle that he
brought him in much sorrow and disease. And Lewelyn saw that his defense
might him notte auaylle / and came again and yielded him to the kings grace
(...) him mercy. and long time kneled before the kings foot. The king (...)
him pity / and commanded him for^^ arise. And for his mekenes foryaue (...)
his wrath / and to him said that if he trespassed to him a another time that he
would dystroye him for evermore. Dauyd that was Lewelyns brother that same time
dwelled with king Edward and was a fell man and a subtle and enuyous / and
also far casting and much treason thought. and evermore made good
semblaunt and seemed so true y^ no man might perceive his falines.

How Lewelyn through eggynge of his brother Dauyd werryd again upon kyge.

IT was not long after that time that king Edward yaf to Dauyd Lewelyus

money / that was full ill kytte / wherefore the people playned sore. so that the
king enquered of the tres passours. And iii. hundred were atteynted of such
manner falsnes / wherefore some were hanged and some draw and after hangyd. And
afterward the king ordained / that the sterlynge halfpeny and ferthynge
should go through out all his land / And commanded that no man fro that day
afterward yaue ne feoffedhous of relegyon with land / tenement without
special leave of y^ king. and he y^ did should be punysshed at the kings
will / and the yefte shall be for naught And it was not long after that
Lewelyn prince of wales through the tyceme^t of Dauyd his brother / and both
their consent they thought to dysheryte king Edward / in asmoche as they might
/ so that thorough them both the kings peace was broken. And when king
Edward herd of this / anon he sent his. barons into Northumberlonde and the
Surreys also / that they should go and take their vyage upon the traitors
Lewelyn and Dauyd. and wonder herd it was for to warte tho / For it is winter

And when the kings men it perceived and also the strenthe of walys / they let

might made assawte unto y^ castle of Swa^ don and gate the castle / And when
da uyd the prince brother herd of this tidings: he ordained him to flight and
Lewelyn the prince saw that his brother was fled / then he was sore abasshedde
for he had no power to his warte for to mayntene. And so Lewelyn began for to
flee / and wend well for to have scapedde. But in a morrow sir Roger mortymer
met with him oonly with.x. knights. and set him round about. And to him
went / and smote of his heed / and presentyd y^ same heed unto king Edward.
And in this manner Lewelyn the pry^ce of walys was taken / and his head smyten
of / and also all his heirs dysheryted for evermore through ryghtfull dome of
all the lords of the reame.

How dauyd y^ was Lewelyns brother prince of walys was put to death.
DAuyd that was y^ princes brother of walys / thrughe pride wend too have he

Edward let cry his peace through out all wales and seized all the land into

And tho enquered be of his traitors that coniected falsnesse against him And
each of them all received therdome after that they had deserved. But in the
mean time that the good king Edward was beyond the sea / too do / them for
to make amends that ayenste him had trespassyd there was a false the if / a
traytoure that was called Rysapp Merydok / began for to make werre ayenste
king Edward. and y^ was for cause of sir Pain Tiptot. wrongfully grieved and
dyseased the foresaid Rysap merydok. And when king Edward herd all this
matere and it well understood a none he sent by his letter pryue seal to the
foresaid Rebellyon Rysap Merydok y^ he should begin in no manner wise for to
make and reyse werre but y^ he should be in peace for his love / and when he
came again into England he would under take the quarrel and amend all that was
mysdon. This foresaid Rysap Mer^dok despised the kings commandment and spared
not to do all the sorrow that he might to the kings men of England But anon
after he was take and ladde to York / and there he was drawn and hangyd for
his felonye.

Of dressynge y^ king Edward made of his Iusti^es and of his clerks y^ they
had done for there falsnes and how he drove the Jews out of England for there
usury and myshyle^e.
AS king Edward had dwelled three year in Gascoyne a desire came to him for
to goo into England again. And when he was come aye^ he found so many
playntes made to hy^ of his Justices and of his clerks that had done so many
wrongs and falsnesse that wonder it was to here. and for which falsnesse sir
Thomas waylond the kings Justice / forswore England at the toure of London /
for falsnesse that men put upon him / wherefore he was atteynt / and proved
falls. And anon after when y^ king had done his will of the Justices tho let
he enquere and espy how the Jews dysceyned and begyled his people / thorough
the sin of falsnesse and of usury. And let ordeyne a preuy parliament among
his lords. And they or / deyned among them / y^ all the Jews. should void
out of England for their mysbyleue / and also for their falls vsurye that they
did unto christian men. And for to speed. and make an end of this thing / all
the comynalte of England yaue unto the king the.xv. penny of all their goods
meuable / and so were the Jews driven out of England. And tho went y^ Jews
into France. and there they dwelled / through leave of king Phylyp y^ tho. was
king of France.

How king Edward was seized in all the land of Scotlonde / through consent
and grant of all y^ lords of scotlo^de
IT was not long after that alex andre / king of Scotlond was deed / and
Dauyd the earl of Huntyngdon that was the kings brother of Scotlo^de axyd and
claymed y^ kingdom of Scotlonde after that his brother was deed / for cause
that he was ryghtfulle heir / But many great lords said nay. wherefore great
debate arose between them and there fre^des / for asmoche as they would not
consent to his coronacyon / and the mean time the foresaid Dauyd deyed / And
so it befell that y^ said Dauyd had three daughters / that worthyly were married
/ The first daughter was married to Bailol / the second to Brus / and the
third to Hastynges. The foresaid Baylol and Brus challenged y^ land of
Scotlonde / and great debate and stryf arose between he^. by cause each of the^
would have be king. And when the lords of Scotlonde saw y^ debate between
the^ / came to king Edward of England. and seized hy^in all y^ land of
Scotlonde as chyef lord And when the king was seized of the foresaid lords /
the foresaid Baylol Brus and Hastynges came to the kings court / and axyd of
the king which of the^ should be king of Scotlonde And king Edward that
was full gentle and true / let enquere by y^ Chronicles of scotlonde / and of
the grettest lords of Scotlonde / which of them was of the eldest blood. And
it was found that Baylol / was the eldest. and y^ the king of Scotlonde
should hold of the king of England / and do him feaute and homa / ge. And
after this was done Bailol went into Scotlonde / and there was crowned king
of Scotlonde. And the same time was upon the sea great war bytwe ne the
Englysshmen and the Normans But upon a time. the Normans arrived all at Dover.
and there they martred an holy man that was called Thomas of Dover / And
afterward were the Normans slain. y^ there escaped not one of them. And so
afterward king Edward should lose the duchye of Gascoyne through king philyp
of France thrughe his false casting of the Dousepers of the land / wherefore
sir Edmonde y^ was king Edwardis brother yaue up his homage unto the king of
France. And in that time the clerks of England granted to king Edward
half deal of holy church goods / in helping too recover his land again
in / Gascoyne. And the king sent thethere a noble company of his bachelors.
And himself would have gone to Po^tesmon the / but he was let through one Maddok
of walys that had seized the castle of Swandon into his hand / and for that
cause the king tomed to walys at Crist mass And because that the noble lords
of England that were sent into Gascoyne had no comforth of there lord y^
king they were take of sir Charlys of France / that is to say / sir John^ of
brytayne / sir Roberte Tiptot / sir Rau^e Tanny / sir Hughe Bardolfe / and sir
Adam of Cretynge / And yet at the Ascensyon was Maddok take in Walys / and a
another that was called Morgan. and they were sent to the tour of London and
there they were byheded.

How sir John^ Baylol king of scotlonde with said his homage.
ANd when sir John^ Baylol ky^ ge of Scotlond understood that king Edward was
werred in Gascoyne / to whom ye reame of Scotlonde was delyuerd / Falsely tho
against his oath with said his homage through procuring of his folk and sent unto
ye court of Rome through a falls suggestyon to be assoylled of ye oath yt he
swore unto ye king of England and so he was by letter enbulled. Tho chose
they of Scotlonde dousepers / for to beny^me Edward of his right. And in yt
time came two Cardynalles from ye court of Rome. fro the (...) Celestine / to
trete of acorde between the king of France and the king of England. And as
tho cardynalles spoke of acorde. Thomas turbeluyll was taken at Lyo^s and made
homage to y^ ward of Paris and putt his sons in hostage / and thought to go
into England to aspye ye country / and tell them when he came to England that
he had broken the kings prison of France by night and said yt he would do
that all Englysshmen and walsshmen should abowte the king of France. And this
thing for to bring to the end he swore / and upon this covenant deeds were
made between them / and yt he should have by year a thousand pounds worth of
land. to bring this thing too an end. This false traitor took his leave /
and went thens and came intoo England unto the king and said. yt he was
broke out of prison and yt he had put him in such peril for his love wherefore
the king cowde him much thank and full glad was of his coming. And the false traytoure fro that day / aspyed all the doing of the king and also his
counselle / for the king loved him full well and was with him full preuy But a
clerk of England / yt was in the kings house of France: herd of this
treason / and of the falsnesse / and wrote to another clerk yt tho was
dwelling with Edward king of England. all how thomas Turbeluyll had done his false coniectynge / and all the counsel of England was write for to have send
unto the king of France. And through ye foresaid letter yt the clerk had sent
fro France it was found upon him. wherefore he was led to London and hangyd and
draw there for his treason. And his two sons that he had put in France for
hostage. were then beheeded.

Of the Conquest of Berwyke.
SO when the two Cardynalles were gone again into France for to trete of the
peace of Cambroy the king sent thither of his Earls and barons. That is to say
sir Edmonde his brother earl of Lancastre and of Lecetre sir Henry Lacy earl of
Nicholl / and wyllya^ Vessy Baron / and of other baronettes. abowte.xiii. of

his vyage to Scotlonde / for to were upon John^ Baylol king of Scotlonde. And
sir Robert Roos of Berewyk fled fro the Englyshmen. And went to the Scotts.
And king Edward went him toward Barwyk / and besegyd the town. And thoo

Edward ships / and said in dyspyte and repreyf of him (wenyth king Edward
with his long shankys too have get Berewyk all our vnthankes gas pykes him /
and when he has done gas dykes him) when king Edward herd this scorn /
anon through his myghtynesse / be passed over the dyches and assaylled the
town / and came to the ya^es and gate and conquered the town / and thrughe
his gratyous power slew xxv. thousand and.vij. hundred scotts. and ky^ ge
Edward lost no man of renoune sauffyr Rychard of Cornewayle. and him killed a
Flemynge out of the red halle with a quarrel as the forsayde Richard did of
his helm. and commanded them for to yield them / and put them in the ky^ges
grace. and the Scotts would notte wherefore that halle was brent and cast
down. and all tho that were therein were brent and king Edward lost no moo
men at that vyage of simple estate but.xxvii. englysshmen. And the wardeyn of
the castle yaue up the keys of the castle without any assawte. And there was
taken sir wyllyam Douglas and Symond Frysell and the earl patryk yeldyd them to
the peace. But Ingham of Humlresmylle and Robert the Brus yt were with. king
Edward forsook king Edward and held with the Scotts. And afterward they
were taken and put into pryso^ And thoo let king Edward close in Berewyk
with walls and with dyches / and after Robert Rous went to Tyndale / and set
wuyerbrydge a fire and Exham / and Lamerstok and slew and robbyd ye folk of y^
country. And after yt he went fro thens to Dunbatre. And the first wenesdaye of
March the king sent the earl of Garenne. sir. Hugh Percy and sire Hughe
Spenser with a fair company for too besege the castle. But one that was
called sir Richard Sywarde a traytoure and a falls man / ymagyned for to begyle
the Englysshemen / And sent too the Englysshmen them for to desceyue / and
said / That he would yield to them the castle. if they would grant
them.viii days of respyte / that he might send and tell too Sir Johan Baylol
that was king of Scotlonde / how his men fared that were within the castle /
And send him word but / if he would remene the sege of the English men /
that they would yield the castle unto the english men. The messenger thoo
came to sir John^ Baylol that thoo was king of Scotlonde where that he was
with his hooste / and the messengre told him all the caas / And sire John^
took his host and came on the morrow erly toward the castle. and sir
Richard sywarde saw him come that was master of the counsel and keeper of
the castle and said unto the Englysshmen Osayd he. now Ise a fair company
and well appareylled I woll go ayenste them / and with them too mete / and
them assaylle And sir Hugh Spenser saw the falsnesse of him and the treason.
and said to him O traitor take and prove your falsnesse shall not auaylle
you. And hughe Spencer commanded anon to bind him. and all in have went
against there enmyes / and slew of y^ Scotts.xxii. thou sand. For the Scotts
had y^ time no man with them of honor sauf Patryk Graham that manly fought /
and long and at the last he was slain. And thoo said the Englysshmen in
repreyf of the Scotts (These scaterande Scotts hold I for scotts of
wrenches unware. Erly in a morning in an evil tymynge / went ye fro Dunbare.
As tho y^ ware within the castle saw y^ scomfyture they yielded up the castle
unto y^ Englysshemen. and bound their bodies gods and castles to king
Edward. And so there were take in that castle three earls vii. barons.
and.xxxviii. knights and.xi. clerks / and.vii. Pycardys and all were
presentyd to king Edward. And he sent them to y^ tower of London to be kept.

How king Edward of his great grace delyuerede again the Scotts out of
prison that were cheyftayns of that land / and they drew them to the
Frensshemen through couseyll of wyllyam waleys.
AS king Edward had made tho an end of the werre. and taken the cheyfteyns
of Scotlonde. thoo came sir John^ Baylol and yielded him unto ky^ ge Edward /
and put him in his grace and he was led to London / and when king Edward
was come thither / they were brought before him / And the king axyd how they
would make amends / of y^ trespaas and loss y^ they had done to him / and
they put heym in his mercy. Lordynges said y^ king I will not of your lands
ne your goods / but I will y^ ye make to me an oath upon goddys body to be
true te me / and never after this time against me bear armies. And all they
consentyd to the kings will. and swore upon goddys body. That is to say sir
John^ of Common. y^ earl of y^ Strathorn / y^ Earl of Carryk / and also four
bishops undertook for all y^ clergy / and so y^ king delyuerd them / and

afterward y^ they nearyse aye^ king Edward / for cause y^ they wyste well y^
king Edward folk was take / in Gsacoyne / as before is said But sir John^
Baylol king of Scotlonde wist well y^ his land should have sorrow and shame /
for their falsnesse. And in haste went him over see to his own lands and
there he held him and came never aye^ wherefore the Scotts chose unto their
king wyllyam waleys / a rybaude and an harlot comen up of naught / and much
harm did to the Englysshmen and king Edward thought how he might have
delyueraunce of his people y^ were take in Gascoyne. And in have went hy^ over
these in Flaundres for to werre upon the king of France. And the earl of
Flaundres received him with much honor and grau^tyd him all his londys at
his own will. And when y^ king of France herd tell y^ the king of England
was aryued in Flaundres and came with a great power him for to dystroye. he
prayed him of trewto for two year / so that the English merchants and also
French might saufly go and come in both sides. The king Edward geaunted it.
so that he must have his men out of prison y^ were in Gascoyne and the king
of France anon granted and so they were delyuerd. And in y^ same time y^
Scotts sent by the bishop of saint andrews in to France to y^ king and to
sir Charles his brother. y^ sir Charles should come with his power and they of
Scotlonde would come with their power / and so they should go into England /
y^ land to dystroye from Scotlonde unto they came to Kent. And y^ Scotts
trustyd much upon y^ Frensshmen but of y^ thing they had no manner grant
and netheles the Scotts began to rob and kylle in Northu^berlonde / and dydd
much harm.

How wyllyam waleys let reyse the land of Scotlonde as cheyf lord. And sir
Hughe of Cressynham / and of the bataylle of Fonkyrke.
AS tidings was come to king Edward y^ wylliam waleys had ordained such a
strong power. and also that all Scotlonde to him was attendaunt and ready for
to ^lee Englyssh^e and to dystoye the land / he was sore anoyed / and sent
anon by letter to therle of Garienne / to sir Henry Perry and to wyllyam
Latomer and too syer Hughe of Cressynham his cresorer y^ they should take power
/ and go into Northumber / land. and so forth into Scotlonde. for too keep y^
countries and when wyllyam waleys herd of their comy^ge. be began to flee and
the Englysshmen him followed and drout him till he came to S^ryu^lyn and there
he held him in the castle. And y^ walsshmen every day them escryed and
menacyd / and did all the dyspyer that they might so that the Englysshemen
upon a time in a morning went out fro the castle / the mou^tenaunce of.x.
miles / and passed over a bridge / and wyllyam waleys came with a strong power
/ and drove them abak / for the Englysshmen had against him no power tho but
fled. and they that might take the bridge escaped. but sir Hugh the kings
tresorer there was slain / and many other also / wherefore was made much
sorrow. Tho had king Edward sped all his matters in Flaundres / and was come
again into England / and in have took his way into Scotlonde / and came
thederat y^ Ascencyon tide. and all y^ he found he set a fire and brent /
But the poor people of Scotlonde came too him wonder thyck and prayed him for
goddys love / y^ he would on them have Mercy and pity wherefore tho the king
commanded y^ no man should do them harm y^ were yolden to him / ne to no man
of ordrene to no house of relygyon / ne no manner church. But let espy all y^
he might where y^ he might find any of his enmyes tho came a spy unto y^ king
and told where y^ the Scotts were assembled too abide bataylle. And on saint
Mary Mawdeleyns day / the king came to Fonkyrk and yaue bataylle to the
Scotts and at that battle were slain.xxx. thousand Scotts / and of
Englysshemen.xviii. and no mo. Of y^ which was a worthy knight slayn^e y^ was

fled from y^ battle y^ same Frery brian him pursewed fires ly / and as his
horse ran it stert in a mire of a marys up to the belly. and wyllyam waleys
turned tho again and there slew the foresaid brian. and that was much harm.
And that while king Edward went thorough Scotlonde / For to enquere if he
might find any of his enmyes. And in that land he dwelled / as long as him
lyked / And there was no enmye that durst him abide. And soon after king
Edward went too Southampton for he would not abide / in Scotlonde in winter
season / for esement of his people. And when he came to London / he let amend

How the castle of Estreuelyn was be seged and won.
BYnge Edward came to the castle of Estreuelyn with a huge power and besegyd

Of Merlyns prophecyes that were declared of king Edward. yt was king Henryes
sone.
OF this king Edward prophesied Merlyn / and called him a dragon the second
of y^.vi. kings y^ should regne in England and said / that he should be
meddled with mercy / and also with strenth and sternesse. that should keep
England from cold and hete. And that he should opene his mouth toward walys
and that he should set his foot in wyk and that he should close with walwes
/ that should do much harm to his sede. And he said sothe. for the good king
Edward was meddled with mercy and with fyersnesse / with mercy ayenste his
enmyes of walys / and after of Scotlo^de with fyernesse / when he put them to
death for there falsnesse / and traytoursly as they had deserved. And well keped
he england from cold and heet / sith he kept it from all manner of enmyes that
ran upon him to do him any wrong. And well he opened his mouth toward walys
/ and made it quake thrughe hydour of his mouth / when he conqueryd it thrughe
dynt of swerd. For the prince Lewelyn and Dauyd his brother. Ris and Morgan.
were put to death through their falsnesse and their folly / And he set his foot
into wyk / and conquered Berwyk at the which conquest were slain.xxv.
thousand and.vii hundred / out take such as were brent in the red halle.
And the walls yt he let make shall be noyous / unto his sede. as men shall
here after in y^ life of sir Edward of Carnaruan his sone And yet said merlyn yt
he should make ryuers ren in blood and with brain. and y^ semyd well in his
werres there as he had y^ maystry. And yet Merlyn said y^ there should come a
people out of y^ northwest during y^ regne of y^ foresaid dragon y^ should be
lad by an ill greyhou^de / yt should the dragon crown king. yt afterward should
fle over y^ se for dread of ye dragon without coming again. and y^ was proved
by sir John^ Baylol yt king Edward made to be king of Scotlo^de. y^ falsely
arose against him. and after he fled to his own lands of France / and never
he came again in to Scotlonde for dread of king Edward: And yet said Merlyn: y^
people that should led the said greyhou^de should be faderles unto a certain
time soth he said. For ye people of Scotlonde greatly were dysesyd after sir
John^ bayllol was fled. And Merlyn said the sone should become in his time as
red as any blood in tokenynge of great morta lyte of people. And that was
know well when ye Scotts were slain. And sith said Merlyn / y^ same dragon
should nourysshe a Fox. yt should meue great were ayenste him / yt should not in
his time be ended / and that seemed well by Robert the Brus. that king Edward
nourysshed in his chamber that sythen stale away and meued great werre against
him which werre was not ended in his time And yet said Merlyn yt the dragon
should dep in ye march of an other land / and that his land should be long
without a goo^^ keeper. And y^ men should weep for his de the from the isle of
Shephey unto y^ isle of Mercyll / wherefore alas shall be their songeamonge the
common people fader / les in the land wastyd. And that prophecye was know over
all full well. For y^ good king Edward deyed at Burgh up sandys / that is
upon the March of Scotlonde where the Englysshmen were dyscomforted and
sorowed in Northu^berlonde / For cause that king Edwardes sone set by the
Scotts no force. for the riot of Peers of Ganaston / wherefore alas was the
song thrughe out all England for defawte of their good wardeyne / from y^
isle of Shephey unto the isle of Marcill the people mad mo / the sorrow for good
king Edwardes / death. For they wend that good king Edward should have gone
into the holy land / For y^ was holy his purpoos / Upon whoos soul god for
his high and Ingynyte grace have mercy.

thederward to rescowe the castle. and his power encresyd fro day to day. when
the earl of Lancastre and the Earl of Herforde and the barons of there company
herd of this thing they assembled all their power and went the^ too Burto^
upon trent and kept the bridge yt the king should not pass over. but it
befell so on the tenthe day of March in the year of grace.M.CCC.xxi. the king
and the Spen^er^. sir Aymer Valaunce earl of Penbroke / and John^ earl of Arun
/ dell and their power / went over the water and dyscomfyted therle Thomas and
his company. And they fled to the castle of Tetbury / and from thens they went
to Pountfret. and in that vyage deyed sire Roger Daumore in thabbay of Tetbury.
And in y^ same time the earl thomas had a traitor with him that was called
Robert Holonde a knight. yt the earl had brought up of naught / and had
nourysshed him in his butrye. and had give hy^ athousand mark of land by
year. And somoche the earl louyd him that he might do in the earls court all
that him lyked both among them high and low / and so craftly the theyf bare
him against his lord / yt he trustyd more upon him than any man on live. and
the earl had ordained by his letters for to go into the erledome of Lancastre /
to make men arise to help him in that vyage / That is to say.v. hundred men
of arm is. But the false traitor came not there: no manner men for to warn ne
for to make arise to help his lord. And when that the false traitor herd

sco^fyture. And took of thezhors and harneys / and all that they had and slew
of them all that they might take / and came and yeldyd him to the king. when
the good earl Thomas wist that he was so bytrayed. he was so abashed / and
said to himself / O almighty god how might robert Holonde fy^de in his heart me

through my kyndnesse have him auauncyd and made him high where that he was low.
And he makyth me go from high unto low / but yett shall he deye an evil

Of the scomfyture of Brurbrygge.
THe good earl Thomas of Lancastre. Hu^froy de Bohoune earl of Herford / and
the barons yt with them were took counsel between the^ at y^ friar prechers
in Pou^tfret. tho thought Thomas upon y^ traitor Robert Holonde. and said in
repreyf / Alas Robert Holond has me betrayed / aye is y^ red of some evil
shred. And by y^ common assent they should all go to y^ castle of Dunstanbrughe
/ y^ which perteyned to therldo^^ of Lancastre / and yt they should abide there
till yt the king had foryeue them his male talent. But when y^ good earl Thomas
this herd / he answered in this manner and said. Lords said he / if we go
toward y^ North / y^ Northen men woll say yt we go toward ye Scotts / and
so we shall be holden traitors / for cause of dystau^ce that is between king
Edward and Robert the Brus that made him king of Scotlonde. And therefore I
say as touching myself / that I will not go no ferder into the North / than
to my^ own castle at Pou^tfret / And when / sir Roger Clyfford herd this he
arose up anon in wrath. and drew his sword on high / and swore by god
almighty and by his holy names / but if yt he would go with them / he should
him slay there. the noble and gentle earl Thomas of Lancaster was sore aferde
and said. Fair syres I will goo with you whether some euere. ye me bydde. Tho
went they together in to the north / and with them they had vii.C. me^ of
armies / and came to Burbrig And when sir Andrew of Herkela that was in the
north country / through ordinance of y^ king. for to keep y^ country of
Scotlonde / herd tell. how that Thomas of Lancastre was sco^fyted and his
company at Burton upon trent / be ordened him a strong power / and sy^ symonde
ward also / that was tho the shyref of York / and met the barons at
burbrugge. and anon they brake the bridge that was made of tree. And when sir
Thomas of Lancastre. herd y^ sir Andrewe of Herkela had brought with him such
a power he was sore adrad. and sent for sir Andrewe of Herkela / and with hy^
spoke. and said to him in this manner sir Andrewe said he. ye may well
understood yt our lord yt king. is ladde and mysgouerned by much falls
counsel. through sir Hugh Spenser y^ fader and sir Hugh his sone: sir John^
earl of Aru^dell / and through master Roberte Baldok a falls pyllyd clerk. yt
now is in y^ kings come dwelling / wherefore I pray you yt ye will come with
us with all your power that ye have ordained and help to dystroye the venym of
England. and the traitors that been therein / and we will give unto you all the
best part of five Erldoms yt we have and hold. and we will make unto you an
oath. that we will never do thing with out your counsel / and so ye shall be
eft as well with us as ever was Robert Holonde Tho answered sir Andrew of Herkela
and said sir Thomas yt would not I do ne consent thereto for no manner thing with
out the will and commandment of our lord y^ king / for the^ should I be
holden a tratour for ever more. And when yt y^ noble earl Thomas of Lancaster
saw y^ he would not consent to hy^ for no manner thy^g sir Andrew he said will
ye not co^sente to dystroye the venymme of the reame as we be consent at one
word Sir Andrewe I tell the that are this year begoon / that ye shall be take
and hold for a traitor. and more than any of you hold us now / and in worse
death ye shall deye than ever did any knight of England. And understand
well / that ye did never thing / That sorer ye shall you repent. And now go
and do what you good lykyth / and I will put me into the mercy of god. And so
went y^ falls traitor tyrau^t as a falls forsworn man For through the noble Earl
Thomas of Lancastre / he received y^ armies of chyualrye / and thrughe him he
was made a knight. Tho might men see archers draw them in y^ one side and in
that other and knights also. and fought tho together wonder sore. And also
among al other Humfroy de Boughon earl of Herforde a worthy knight of renoune
through out all cristendome / stood and fought with his enmyes upon y^ bridge.
and as ye noble lord stood and fought upon the bridge a theyf rybaude sculkyd
under y^ bridge / and fyersly with a spear. smote the noble knight into y^
^u^dement / so yt his bowellys came out about his fete there. Alas for sorrow
and pity. For there was slain the flower of solace and of comforth / and also
of curteysye / And sir Roger Clyfforde a noble and a worthy knight stood ever
and fought / and well and worthyly him defended as a noble baron. But at the
last he was sore woundyd in his heed / And sir wyllyam of Sullayande. and sir
Roger of Benefelde were slain at that battle. when sir Andrewe of Herkela saw
yt sir Thomas men of Lancastre / lassed and slakyd. anon he and his company
came unto the gentle knight sir Thomas and laid unto him in an high voice
Yield the traitor yield the. The gentle earl Thomas of Lancastre answered
then and said. Nay lords traitors we ben none. and to you we will never us
yield while that our lives last But lever we had to be slain in our truth /
than yield us unto you. And sire Andrewe again gardyd upon sir Thomas and his
company / yellynge and crienge like a wode wulf. yield you traitors taken
yield you / and said with an high voys Beware syres that none of you be so
hardy upon life and lymme tomysdo Thomas body of Lancastre / And with that
word the good earl thomas yede into the castle / and said knelynge upon his
knees and turned his vysage toward the cross and said almighty god to the I
yield / and holy I put me unto thy mercy. and with that the vylaines and
rybaudes lept abowte him on every side as tyrau^tes and wood torme^tours / and
dyspoyled him of his armoure and clothed him in a robe of ray / yt was of his
squyres lyueray / and forth ladde him unto York by water. Tho might men see
much sorrow and care For the gentle knights fled on every side and the
rybaudes and the vyllayns egerlye. th^^ dyscryed / and cried on high yield you
traitors yield you. and when they were yelden they were robbyd and bounden as
theuys. Alas ye shame and dyspyte that the gentle order of knyghthode had
there at that battle. And the lord was tho without law / For holy church
had tho no more ereuerence than it had be a burdell house / And in that battle
was the fader against the sone^ and ye uncle against the neuewe. For somoche
unkindness / was never seen before in England / as was that time among
folks of one nacyon. For one kynred had no more pity of that other. than an
hungry wulf has of a sheep / And it was no wonder. For the great lords of
England were not all of one nacyon / but were medlyd with othere nacyons /
That is for to say some / Brytons / some Saxons / some Danys / some Pehypes /
some Frensshemen some / Normans / some: Spanyerdes / some / Romans / some /
Henaude / soom Flemynges and othere diverse nacyons the which nacyons accordyd
notte too the kind bloodeof England. And if so great lords had be ^only
weddyd to English people. Then should peace have been and rest among them
without any envy. And at yt battle was roger Clyfforde take. sir John^
Monbrey sir wyllyam Tuc^ it. sir wyllyam fitz wyllyam / and many other worthy
knights there were take at that battle and sir Hugh Dandell next day after
was taken and put into prison / and should have be done to death if he had not
spousyd ye kings nece / yt was earl Gylbertes systre of Gloucestre / and anon
after was sir Berthylmewe of Badelesmore taken at Stow park / a maneyr of y^
bishop of Lyncoln / yt was his neuewe / and many other barons and baronettes.
wherefore was made noche sorrow.

How Thomas of Lancastre was he did at Pountfret / and.v. barons hangyd / and
drawn there.
ANd now I shall tell you of the noble earl Thomas of Lancastre. when he was
take and brought to york / many of y^ cite were full glad and upon him cried
with an high voys O sire traytoure / ye be welcome. blessed be god for now ye
shall have y^ reward / y^ long ye have deserved. And cast upon him many snow
balls / and many other repreues they did him. But the gentle earl al suffered
/ and said another o word nor other And at the same time ye king herd of this
scomfyture / and was full glad and Joyous / and in great haste came to
Pou^tfret. and sir Hughe Spenser. and sir Hughe his sone / and sir John^ earl
of Arundell and sir Edmonde of wodestoke the ky^ges brother earl of Kent. and
sir Aymer of Valaunce earl of Penbroke and master Robert Baldoke. a falls
pyllyd clerk / yt was pryue / and dwelled in the kings court / and all came
theder with the king And the king entryd into the castle / and sir andrew of
Herkela a falls tyraunte through the kings commandment took with him the
gentle earl. Thomas too Pountfret and there he was prysoned in his own castle
that he had new made that stood against the abbaye of king edward. And sir
Hugh Spenser y^ fader and the sone cast and thought how and in what manner
the good earl Thomas of Lancastre should be deed / without Iu gement of his
perys. wherefore it was ordained through the kings Iusticys that the king
should put upon him points of treason. And so it befell that he was led to
bar before the kings Justices bareheed as a theyf / in a fair halle in his
own castle yt he hadd made therein many a fair feste. both to rich and too
poor: And these were his Justices sir Hughe Spenser the fader. and Aymer of
Valaunce earl of Penbroke sir Edmonde of wodstok earl of Kent / sir John^ of
Brytayne earl of Rychemonde and sir ^obert Malemethrop Justice and sir Robert
him acouspyd in this manner. Tho^mas court excludes you of all manner answer.
Thomas our lord the king / puttyth upon you. yt ye have in his land ryden
with baner dysplayed against his peace. as a traitor. And with y^ word the
gentle earl Thomas with an high voice said / Nay lords forsooth and by ^aynt
Thomas / I was never traytoure / The Justice said again tho. Thomas our lord
the king puttythe upon you that ye have robbyd his folk and murdered his
people as a theyf. Thomas also the king puttythe upon you that he dyscomfyted
you and your people with his folk / in his own reame^ wherefore. ye went and
fled to the wood as annutlaw. and Thomas as a traytoure ye shall be hangyd
by reason. but the king has foryeuen you y^ Iugemente^ for love of queen
Isabell. And Thomas reason would yt ye should be hangyd / but y^ king has
foryeue you y^ Judgment for by cause and love of your lygnage. But for asmoche.
Thomas as ye were taken fleenge / and as an outlawe. the king: woll that your
heed shall be smyten of / Anon have him out of pre^s and bring him to his
Judgment. when thelgen till knight Thomas had herd all these words / with an
high voice he cried sore weeping and said alas saint Thomas fair fader. alas
shall I be deed thus Grant me now blessydfull god answer. But all auayled
him no thing For y^ cursyd Gascoyns put him hither and thither / and on him
cried with an high / voys. O king Arthur most terryble and dredefull / well
known and showed now is thine open traitor. And an evil death shall thou
right anon deye* Haste thou not right well deserved it. And then these
cruel folk set upon ye good knight Thomas for very scorn an old chaplet
that was all to rent / yt was not worth an half penny: And after that they
set him upon a white palfroy full unseemly / and also all bara / with an old
brydell / And with an horrible noise they drove him out of the castle toward
his death / and they cast upon him many balls of snow in dyspyte. and as the
traitors lad him out of the castle tho said he these pyteous words. and his
hondes held up on high toward heaven Now the king of heaven give us merci for
the erthly king has us forsaken and a friar precher went with him out of y^
castle till he came to the place that he ended his life. unto whom he shroue
him all his life. And the gentle earl held y^ friar wonder fast by the
clothes and said to him Fair fader abide with us till yt I be deed. for my
flesh quakyth for dread of death. And the sothe for to say / The gentle
earl set him upon his knees / and turned him toward the eest: but a rybaude yt
was called Hygone of mostoon set hand upon the gentle Earl and said in
dyspyte of him Sir traitor torn the toward the Scotts / thy foul death to
receive / and turned toward the North. The noble earl Thomas answered tho with
a mylde voys / and said now fair lords I shall do your will. and with that
word the friar went from him sore weeping. And anon a rybaude went to him /
and smote of his heed / the.xi. Kalendas of Auerell. in ye year of
grace.M.CCC.xxi. Alas that ever such a gentle blood should be don to death
withouten cause and reason. And traytoursly ye king was cou^seylled / when he
through the false counseylle of the Spensers suffered sir Thomas his uncles sone
to be put to such a death / and so be beheeded against all manner of reason /
And great pity it was also / that such a noble king should be dysceyued and
mysgouerned through counseyll of the false Spensers / the which tho he mayntened
thrughe loselry against his honor and alsoo his proffyte. For afterward there
fell great vengaunce in England. for because of the foresaid Thomas death. Whane
the gentle earl of his life was passyd. y^ pryour and the monkys of Pounfret
gate the body of sir Thomas of the king and buried it before the high awter on

How king Edward went into scotlonde with an hundred thousand men of armies /
and might not speed.
SO^ when king Edward of England had brought the flower of cheualry unto
their death. thrughe sounsell and consent of sir Hugh Spenser the fader / and
sir Hugh y^ sone / he became as wood ^ as any lion. and what so ever y^
Spensers would have it was done. so well y^ king louyd them / y^ they might
do with him all thing yt them lyked / wherefore the king gaaf unto sir Hugh
Spenser ye fader y^ erldom of wy^chestre and unto sir Andrewe of Herkela
theerldom of Cardoill^ in preiudyce and in harming of his crown. And king
Edward tho through counsel of y^ Spe^sers dysheryted all them yt had be against
him in any quarrel with Thomas of Lancaster. And many other were dysheryted also
/ because that the Spensers coueyted for to have their lo^des. And so they had
all that they would desire with wrong / and ayenste all reason. Tho made the
king Robert Baldok a false pylled clerk Chaunceler of England. through counsel
of the foresaid Spensers. And he was a false rybaude / And a coueytouse And so
they counseylled the king much / that the king let take to his own ward
all the goods of the lords that were put wronfully to the death into his own
hand. And as well they took ye gods that were within holy church / as y^
gods yt were without / and let them be put into his tresoury in London / and
let / them call his forfeytes: And by there counsel y^ king wroughte / for
ever more he dys heryted them y^ the gods ought and through there counsel let
^^er a t^legge of all the goods of England / wherefore he was the rychest
king y^ ever was in England. after wyllyam Bastard yt cuonquered England.
And yet thrughe counsel of them him semyd that he had notte enough. But made
yet every town of England for to find a man of armies upon their own costs
/ for to go and werre upon y^ Scotts yt were his enmyes / wherefore the king
went into Scotlonde with an h^u^dred thousand men of armies at wytsontyde in
the year of our lord Ihesu Criste.M.CCC.xxii. But the Scotts went / and hyd
them in mou^teyns and in wodes and tarried the Englysshmen fro day to day / that
y^ king might for no manner thing fy^de them in plain field / wherefore ma^^
Englysshmen that had little vytaylles deyed there for hungre wonder fast and
suddenly in going and coming and namely tho that had been against Thomas of
Lancastre and robbyd his men upon (...) lands. when king Edward saw that
vytaylles failed him / he was wonder sore dyscomfited. because also yt his men
deyed. and for he might not ^pede of his enmyes. So at the last he came again
into England / and anon after came James Douglas and also Thomas Rudulph with
an huge hooste into England in to Northumberlonde / and with them the
Englysshmen that were driven out of England / and came and robbyd y^ country
/ and slew the people / and also bree^ the town yt was called Northallerton
and many other towns to York. And wha^ the king herd this tidings be let
so moan all manner men that might traueyller. And so y^ Englysshmen met y^
Scotts at the abbay of Beyg^elande the.xv. day after Myghelmas. in the same
year above said / and the English men were there dyscomfyted. And at that
scomfyture (...) take Sir Johan of Brytayne Earl of Rychmonde that held the
country and the erldom of Lancastre and after he paid an huge ransom and was
let god. And after that he went into France and came never after again.

How sir Andrew of Herkelay was take and put to deth^yt was earl of Cardoil
THen at y^ time was sir Andrew of Herkela / yt new was made earl of Cardoil /
for cause yt he had taken y^ good Earl Thomas of Lancastre. He had ordained
through y^ kings commandment of England. for to bring hy^ all the power
that he might. for to help against y^ Scotts at y^ abbaye of Beyghlande. And
when the false traitor had gadred all the people that he might and should have
come to the king unto the abbaye of Beyghelande / the false traitor ladde them
by a another country thrughe Copelonde. and thrughe therldome of Lancastre / and
went through ^he country and robbyd and slew the folk all yt he might And
ferthermore the false traitor had take a great so^^^e of gold and sylue^ of
sir Iamys Douglas for to be ayenste y^ king of England. and to be helping
and holding with the Scotts / through whose treason the king of England was
scomfyted at Beyghlande or y^ he came f^yder. wherefore the king was toward him
wonder wroth. and let pryuely enquere by y^ country abowte how yt it was And
some men enquered and aspyed / so at the last y^ trough was found and sought
And he atteynte and take as a falls traitor / as y^ good earl Thomas of
lancastre him told or yt he was put unto death at his taking at Burbrugge. and
to him said. Or y^ year were done he should be take and hold a traitor. And
so it was as the holy man said. wherefore y^ king sent pryuely too sir Anthoyn
of Lucy / a knight of the country of Cardoil yt he should take sir Andrewe of
Herkela and put him unto the death. And to bry^ge this thing unto the end.
the king sent his Commyssyon so yt this same Andrewe was take at Cordoil and
ladde unto the bar in y^ manner of an earl worthyly arrayed / and with a
sword gyrde about him / and hosyd and sporyd. Tho spoke sir Authoyn in this
manner sir Andrew said he the king puttyth upon the for asmoche as thou have be
orpyd in thy de dys / he did to the much honor / and made the earl of
Cardoil^ and thou as a traitor to thy lord. laddest the people of his country
that should have help him at the bataylle of Beyghelande / and thou laddest
them away by the country of copelonde / and through the erldom of Lancastre
wherefore our lord the king was discomfy^d there of the Scotts through thy
treason and falsnesse and if y^ had come by times he had had the battle
and treason thou did for the gre^ so^me of gold and silver that thou
received of Iamys Douglas a Scot the kings enmye And out lord the king will
/ that y^ order of knyghthode. by y^ which than received all thine honor and

other knights of lower degree mow after be ware / which lord has the
auaunted hugely in diverse countres of England and that all may take ensample
by there lord afterward. truly for to serve. Tho commanded he anon a knave /
to hew of his spores on his helys / and after he let break the sword over his
heed. y^ which the king yaue him for too keep and defend his land therewith
when he / made him Earl of Cardoyll. And after he let him be unclothed of
his furred taberd and of his hode / and of his furryd cotes / and of his
gyrdyll / And wha^ ne this was done / sir Anthony said the^ ne unto him.
Andrewe said he Now art thou no knight but a knave / and for thy treason y^
king will that thou shall be hangyd and drawn and thy heed (...) of / and thy

Of the miracles yt god wroughte for saint Thomas of Lancastre / wherefore the
king let closein ye church doors of the pryory of Pountfret / yt no man
should come therein for to offer.
ANd sone after that the good earl Thomas of Lancastre was martryd there was a
priest y^ long time had be blind / dremed in his sleep / yt he should go to
the hill there the good earl Thomas of Lancastre was done unto death / and he
should have his sight again and so he dremed three nyghtes sewynge. and the
priest let led him to the same hill and when he came to that place that he
was martryd on / full deuowtly he made there his prayers / And prayed god and
saint Thomas / that he might have his syghte again / And as he was in his
prayers he laid his right hand upon the same place that the good man was
martryd on / and a drope of dry blood and small sonde cleuyd on his hand /
and therewith stryked his eyes. And anon thrughe the might of god and saint
Thomas of Lancastre / he had his syghte. again. And thankyd tho almyghtye god
and saint Thomas And when this miracle was known among men / the people
came thither on every side / and knelyd and made their prayers at his tomb
that is in the pryory of Pou^tfret and prayed that holy martyr of socour and of
help / and god herd there prayer Also there was a young child drowned in a
well in the town of Pountfret and was deed three days and three nyghtes. And
men came and laid the deed child upon said Thomas tomb y^ holy martyr / and
the child arose from death to life. as many a man it saw.

And also much people were out of there mind / and god sent them their mind
again. thorough virtue of y^ holy man And god has give there also to cry^^pyls
their going / and to crokyd thyr hondes and there fete / and to blind also
they^ sight. and to manyseke folk there health of diverse maladyes for the love
of this good martyr.

Also there was a rich man in Cou^^dom in Gascoyne and such a malady he had /
that all his right side rotyd and fell away from him that men might see his
liver and his herte^ and so he stanke / that uneath they might come n^gh^ him.
wherefore his friends were for him wonder sorry. But at the last as god would.
they prayed to saint Thomas of ^a castre / that he would pray almighty god for
that prisoner / and be^yght for to go to Pountfret for to do their pilgrimage /
he thought that the Martyr saint Thomas came to him / and anointed all his
syke body / and therewith the good man awoke and was all hoole and his flesh
was restored again that before was rotyd and fallen away. For which miracle the
good man and his friends louyd god and saint Thomas evermore after. And this
good man came into England. And took with him four felowe^^ and came to
Pou^tfret to y^ holy martyr. and did their pilgrimage. and the good man that
was syke came thither all nakyd / sauf his preuye clothes. And when they had
done. they turned home again in to their own country. and told of the miracle
wheresoever y^ they came.

And also two men have been heelyd there of the mormale through help of y^ holy
martyr / though yt evil be hold in curable. And when the Spensers herd y^
god did such Miracles for this holy man / they nolde believe it in no manner
wise / but said openly / yt it was great he resye / such virtue of him to
believe. and when sir Hugh Spenser y^ sone saw all this doing / anon he sent
his messager from Pou^tfret there yt he dwelled to ky^ Edward yt tho was at
Graven at scypton / for cause yt the king should undo y^ pilgrimage / And as
the rybaude y^ messager went toward the king for to do his message / he came
by the hylle there y^ good martyr was done to death. and in the same place he
made his ordure / and when he had done. he rode toward ye king and a strong
flyxe came upon him or that he came to York / and tho he shed all his bowelles
at his fu^dment. And when sir Hugh Spenser herd this tidings / so^dele he was
adradde / and thought for too undo this pilgrimage if he^ might by any manner
a way / and anon he went to the king / and said yt they should be in great
sklau^dre through out all crystendome / for y^ death of Thomas of Lancastre if yt
he suffered y^ people to do there pilgrimage at Pou^tfret and so he cou^seled y^
king yt he commanded to shyt y^ church doors of Pou^tfret / in y^ which
church y^ holy martyr was enterid. and thus they did ayenste all frau^chyses
of holy church so y^ four year after might no pilgrim come to y^ holy body.
and because y^ monks suffered men to come and honor yt holy body of saint
Thomas ye martyr. through counsel of sir Hugh Spenser y^ sone / and thrughe
counsel of master Robert Baldok y^ falls pylled clerk. yt was y^ kings
chau^celer. yt king consented yt they should be set to their wages / and let
make ward yn^ over there own good long time / and thorough commandment of
the foresaid sir Hughe Spenser.xiiii. Gascoynes well armyd kept the hylle there
that the good man saint Thomas was don unto his death so that no pilgrim might
come by that way / Full well went he to have take cristis might and his power

Of the prophecye of Merlyndedare ^ uf king Edward the sone of king /
Edward the first.
OF this king Edward prophecy ed Merlyn^ and said / y^ there should come a
got out of Carre. y^ should have horns of silver / and a berde as where as
snow. And a drope should come out of his nosethrylles / that should betoken mo
the harm Hungre / and death of people and great loss of his land / And (...)
gynnynge of his regne should be hau^^^d much lechery. And he said sothe. alas
y^ time For king Edward y^ was (...) Edwardes sone was boine at Ca^naryuaun
in walys / forsothe he had homes of silver. and a berde as wh^^e as ^n / we
When he was made prince of walys to much he yaue him to tyot. and too toly And
sothe said Merlyn in his prophery yt there should come out of his ^ose a deope.
For in his time was great hunger among the poo^e people / and strongr death
among the rich / y^ deyed in strannge land with much sorrow / and in werre
in Scotlonde. And after he lost Scotlond and Gascoyne / and while that himself
was king there was much lechery (...) tyd. And also Merlyn told and said
that this gore should seek the flower of lyt and of death and he said sothe. For
he spousyd Isabell the kings sister of France And in his time Merlyn said
that there should be made brydge^ of folk upon dyches of the sea / and that
was well seen at Bannockes home in Scotlonde when be wa^^ dys co^fyted thereof
y^ scortes / And Merlyn told also / that stones should fall from castles. and
many toune^ should be made plain. And he said sothe / For when king Edward
was dyscomfyted in Slotlonde and came thoe south ward / the Scotts besegyd
tho castles / and did them much barme and burnt towns into the herd earth.
And after ward Merlin told that an Egle should come out of Cornewayle / that
should have feders of gold / y^ of pride should have no pere and he should
dispyse lords of blood and after he should dey through a beer at Gauersich and
that prophecy was full well know and funde soth for by the egle understand sir
Pers of Ganaston that tho was earl of Cornewayle that was a wonder proud man
that despised the baronage of England. but afterward he was heeded at
Gauersych through the earl of Lancastre and through therle of war wyh. y^ And
Merlyn told / that in his time it should seem that the beer should bre^ ne and
that bataylle should be upon an arm of the s^e in a field / arrayed like a
sheld. where should deye many white he des. And he said sothe. For by the
bryunynge of the beer it betokenyd great dread thrughe hyttynge of swerdes at
y^ bataple of Miton / for there came the Scotts in manner of a slelde / in
manner of a wynge and slew men of relegyon pr^st^s and seculers / wherefore the
Scotts called that battle in dyspyte of the Englysshmen / the white battle.
And after Merlyn said the foresaid beer should do the got much harm. and y^
should be upon the southweste. and also upon his blood / And said also / that
the got should lose much deal of his land. till the time that shame should
him overcome / and the^ he should clothe him in a lions skin and should win
again that he had lost and more thrughe people that should come out of the
Northwest / that should make him to be a ferde. and him avenge upon his enmyes
through counsel of two ^^les / that first should be in paryll too be undone. And
that tho two o^^kes shield go (...) see (...) stranngs londe^ and there they
should dwell unto a certain time. and then they should come unto england again
/ And tho two owls should do much harm unto many one. and that they should
counsel the got to (...) ^erre aycust the foresaid beer. And the got and che
owls / should come to as arm of the set at Burton upon tre^^t / y^ should
goouer / and that for dread the beer should flee with a swanne in his company
to Bury toward the North. through an unkind outpulter / and that the swanne
then shall be slain with sorrow / and the beer should be slain full nyghe
his own nest. that should stand upon pou^tftet / upon whom the son shall
shede his beemes: And many folk him shall seek for virtue. And he said sothe.
For y^ good Earl Thomas of Lancastre was borne in the Northwest. and cosyn to
the king. and his uncles sone. And by law he made the king lose much land /
y^ which he had pu^ chacyd wylfully. till at y^ last the king took thereof
shame / and himself slew with ^^uelte. And after he ga te again that he had
lost / and much more through folk that he let assemble out of the north west
/ that made him too be adradde. And auengyd him on his barons / through counsel
ofsyt Hugh spenser the fader / and of sit Hughe the sone that before were
outlawed for they^ wye kydnesse. But afterward they came a yen into England /
sir Hugh Spenser the fader cameout of France / and somoche counseled the hynge
/ that he should werre upon Thomas of Lancastre. So that the king and the
Spensers and the earl of Arundell and their power met with Thomas of Lancastre
a^ Burton upon trente / and him there dyscomfyted and lyr Vmtroy earl of
Herforde was in his company. And after fled the foresaid Thomas and Humf^oy
with theye ^^pany to (...) metynge with (...) Andrew of Herkela / that is
called y^ unkind outpulter / and also sire Symonde ward earl of York came
and met with Thomas of Lancastre with an huge power / and them dyscomfyted /
and in y^ scomfyture the earl of Herforde was slain upon the bridge cowardly
with a spear i^ the fu^dement. and the earl Thomas was take and lad unto
Pou^tfiet. and tho was he did beside his own castle. But afterward many him
sought for miracles y^ god did for him. And in y^ time merlyn said. for sorrow
and harm should deye a people of his land / wherefore many lo^des should be
upon him y^ more bolder / and he said sothe for because of his barons y^ were
done to death for saint thomas quarrel of Lancastre. people of many lo^des
became y^ bolder for to meue werre upon y^ king / for their blood was turned
to many nacyons. And afterward Merlyn told and said y^ y^ forsaydowles should
do much harm unto y^ flour of life and death / and they should bring her to
much / dysese. so y^ she should go over see in to France for to make peace to
y^ flower delyce. and there should abide till a time her sede should come and
fetch her / and tho they should abide both till y^ time / y^ they should
clothe them with grace / and tho two owls she should seek. and put the^ to
pyteuous death. and y^ prophecy was full well know. and was full sothe / for sir
hughe Spenser y^ fader. and sir Hughe the sone / did much sorrow and
persecuco^n unto y^ queen Isabell through their procurement to her lord y^
king / so they ordained among them. y^ she was put unto her wagys. That is
to say.xx: shelynges in ye day. wherefore y^ king of France her brother was
sore anoyed. and sent in england by his letters unto king Edward to come unto
his parliament to Paris in France. But king Edward was sore adrad to come
there / for he wend to have be arestyd till that he had made amends for y^
trespase y^ sir Hugh Spenser the fader and the sone had done and for the harm
that they had done unto queen Isabell his sister / wherefore thrughe his
ordinance and consent of the. Spensers. the queen Isabell went over see into
France for to make accord be twene king Edward and the king of France her
brother* And there dwelled she in France / till Edward her eldest sone came
her for too seek / and so they dwelled there both till that alyau^^ce was made
between them and the ge^tyll earl of Henaude / that if they with there virtue
might dystroye and overcome the venym and the falsnesse of the^ Spensers / that
spr Edward should spowsedame Phylip the worshypfull lad^^ the earls daughter of
Henauds / wherefore the queen Isabell and Edward her sone / and sir Edward of
wodstok the ^^ges brother of England / and sire Io han of Henaude / and sire
Rog^^e: Motymer of wygmore / and sire Thomas Rocelyn / and sire John^ of
C^omwelle and sir wyllyam Trussell / and man^^ other of the alyaunce of the

quarrel and were dyshertted of their lands orderned them a great power / and
arrived at H^rewich in Sonthfolke / And sone aft^^ they pursewed y^ Spensers
till y^ then were taken and put to piteous death as before is said. and there
company also / for y^ grrate falsnes y^ they did to king Edward. and to his
people. And Merly said also more y^ the got should be put in great dystresse and
in great anguyssh and in great sorrow he should led his life / And he said
sothe / For after the time that king Edward was take he was put into ward
till y^ the Spensers were put to death and also because that he would not come
unto his parlemente at. London as he had ordained and assygned himself unto
his baronage / and also would not gouer^^ / ^^ rule his people^ne his trame as a
king should do. wherefore some of the barons of England came and yield up
there homages unto him / for them and all the other of y^ reame. in the day of
y^ conuersyon of saint Poule / in y^ year of his regne.xx. And they put him out
of his ryaltee for evermore / And ever lived afterward in much sorrow and
anguysshe.

LOdowicus was emperor after Henry four year. this Lodewye was duke of Banare

and much labor and many perils he had after And he trowbled greatly the
unity of holy church. And the^ was chosyn against him Frederyk the duke of
Ostryche. and he overcame the duke and abode arebelyon to his end. and in
great peril to his soul / And at the last Rarolus was chosen against him / y^
which preuaylled / and suddenly Lodewic fell down of his horse and dyscessyd.

John^ Mandeuyll a douctour of physyh and a knight borne was in England abowte

Anno dn^t.M.CCC.xxii.
Of king Edward the chyrde after the Conqueste.
ANd after this king Edward Carnariuan reigned sir Edward of wyndsore his
sone / y^ which was crowned king / and anointed at westmestre / through
counsel and consent of all y^ great lords of y^ reame. y^ Sunday in
Candelmasse eve. in y^ year of grace.M.CCC.xxvi. y^ was of aege at that time
but xv. year And for cause y^ his fader was in ward in y^ castle of
Kenilworth and also was put down of his ryaltee / the reame of England was
without king from y^ feast of saint Katheryn from y^ year above said to the
feast of Candelmasse. And tho were all manner ple^^ of the kings bynche
astente. And tho was commanded to all y^ Shy^efs of England thrughe writ /
to warn the parties to defendau^tys / through somnynge again And also
ferthermore / that al prisoners that were in the kings gayolles / that were
attachid thrughe Shyrefs / should be let goo quyte. The king Edward after
his coronaco^n / at the prayer / and besechynge of his lyege of the reame.
grauntyd them a chartre of steadfast peace to all them that would it axe / And
sir Johan of Henaude. and his company took his leave of the king and of the
lords of the reame. and tor^yd home to their own country again: And each of
them had full rich yeftes. every man as he was of value and estate. And tho
was England in rest and peace / and great love between y^ king and his lords.
And comyuly Euglysshmen said among them that the devil was deed / ^ut the
innumerable / iresoure of the king his fader / and the tresour of the Spensers
/ both of the ^ader and of the sone / and of the earl of Arundell / and of
master Robert Baldok y^ was y^ kings chau^celer was departed after y^ queen
Isabelles ordinance and sir Rogere Mortymers of wygmore / so that the king
had no thing there of. but at her will and her delyuerau^ce / (...) of their
lands / as after ward ye shall here.

How king Edward went unto sta^thop for to mete the Scotts.
ANd yet in the same time was y^ king in y^ castle of kenylworth under the
keeping of sir Henri / yt was earl Thomas of Lancasters brother. that tho was
earl of Lcycetre. And the king grau^tyd him y^ erldome of Lancastre / yt ye
king his fader had seasyd into his ho^ de and put out Thomas of Lancastres
brother. and so was he earl of Lancastre and of Lcycetre / and also Stywarde of
England as his brother was in his time. But sir Edward yt was king Edwardes
fader made sorrow without end / because he might not speak with his wife. ne
with his sone / wherefore he was in much mischeyf / For though it was so y^ he
was led de and ruled by falls counsel / yet he was king Edwards sone called
Edward with y^ long shankys / and came out of ye worthyest blood of the
world. and they to whom he was wont to give great yeftys and large. were
most preuy with y^ king his own sone / And they wre his enmyes both by
night and by day / and procured to make debate and contake between him and his
sone / and Isabell his wife But the friar prechers were to him good friends ever
more / and cast both by night and by day. how they might bring him out of
prison. And among their company yt the freres had prpurly brought / there was
a friar that was called / Dunhened and he had ordained and gadryd a great
company of folk to keep at y^ nebe / but ye friar was taken and put in the
castle of pountfret / and there be deyed in prison / and sir henry earl of
Lancastre / y^ had y^ kings fader in keeping / through commandment of the
king. delyuerd Edward the kings fader by endenture to sir Thomas of
Berkelay. And so sir John^ Matreuas and they lad him from the castle of
kenylworth to y^ castle of Ber kelay / and kept him there saufly. And at Ester
next after his coronaco^n: y^ kynordeyned a great huge host / for to fight
against y^ Scotts / And sir John^ y^ earls brother of Henaude came from beyond
the sea / for to help king Edward and brought with him.vij.C. men of armies and
arrived at Dover and they had leave for to go forth till they came to York.
they y^ king them abode / and y^ scotts came the der to y^ king / for to make
peace and accord / but y^ accordement lasted not between the^ but a little time
And at yt time the Englysshmen were clothed all (...) cotes and hodes painted
with letters and with flowers full semely with long berdes and therefore y^
scotts made a byll, y^ was fastnyd upon y^ church doors of laynt Pen^to ward
stangate, and thus said y^ sarp^^ re in dyspyte of Englysshemen Long berdes
hertles / payntyd hodes wrotles g^^ye cotes graceles makyth England thriftelees)

SO in y^ Triny^^ day nerte after began y^ contak in y^ cite of Yoke between
y^ Englysshmen and y^ Henandes: and in y^ debate were slain of y^ erldo^ of
Nicholl and murdered.lxxx. men. and after they were buried in saint cleme^tis
church in Fosgate. and for cause y^ y^ Henaudes came to help y^ king. there
peace was cried upon pain of life and ly^me. and in y^ other half it was found
by an enquest of y^ e^te y^ the Englysshmen began y^ debate.

How the Englysshmen stoppyd the Scotts in the park of Stanope and how they
turned again into Scotlonde.
THis time the Scotts had assembled all their power and came into England /
and slew and robbyd all that they might take / and also burnt and dystroyed
all the north country thrughe out / till y^ they came unto the the park of
Stanhope in weridale / and there y^ Scotts held them in a busshment / but
wha^ the king had herd through spies where y^ scotts were / anon right with
his host besegyd them within y^ foresaid park so y^ the scotts wist not where
to go out but oonly unto there harms. And they abode in the park: xv. days /
and vytaylles faylled them in every side. so y^ they were greatly peyred of
bodies / and sith that Brute came fyste into Brytayne unto this time / there
was never seen so fair an host / what of Englysshmen / and of alyu^tes and of
men of foot / y^ which ordained them for to fight with y^ Scotts / thrughe
eggynge of sir Henry of Lancastre and of sir John^ Henaude / y^ would have gone
over y^ water of with for to have fou ght with y^ scotts. But sir Roger
Mortuner consentyd not thereto / for he hadd p^yuely taken mede of y^ scotts
them to help / y^ they might go away into their own cou^tre^^. And this same
Mortymer cou^seylled somoch Thomas of brotherton y^ earl Marshall that was
king Edwardes uncle. y^ y^ foresaid Thomas should not assemble at that time
unto y^ Scotts. And he assentyd. but he wyste not the doing between y^
Scotts and the foresaid Mort^mer / And because that he was Marshall of England
/ as to hyzperteyned ever y^ vau^twarde. he sent hastily to y^ earl of
Lancastre / and to sir John^ of Henaude / y^ they should not fight with the
Scotts / in preiudyce and harmyng of him and his fee / and if they did y^ they
should stand to their own paryll. And the foresaid earl Marschall was all
arrayed with his battle / at y^ reredoos of the earl of Lancastre / for to have
fought with him and with his folk if he had go to fight with the scotts / and
in this manner he was dysceyued and wist no thing of y^ treason And thus was
y^ king pryncypally disceyued. And when it was night Mortymer / y^ had the
watch for to hepe of the host / y^ night dystrobled y^ watch y^ no thing
might be done. And in y^ mean while y^ Scotts stele by night toward their
own country as fast as they might And so was the king falsely betrayed y^ wenyd
y^ all the traitors of his land had been brought to an end as it was said
before. Now here you lords how traytoursly king Edward was dysceiued. and
how meruayllously and boldly the Scotts did of werre / For Iamys douglas with
two hundred men of armies rode through out all y^ host of king Edward / y^ same
night y^ Scotts escaped toward their own country as is above said / till y^
they came to y^ kyngis pauilyon / and slew there many men in their beds /
and cried Naward naward / and a another time a Douglas a Douglas / wherefore y^
king y^ was in his pauylyo^ and much other folk / were wonder sore afraid /
But blyssyd be almighty god y^ king was not taken / and in great peril was
tho the reame of England. and that night the moon shone full clear / and
bright. And for all the kings men the Scotts scapyd harmeles. And on the
morrow when the king wyste that the Scotts were escapyd into their own
country he was wonder sorry / and fulle hertely wept with his young eyes / and
yet wist he notte who had him done that treason. But that falls treason was
full well I known a good while after as the storye makyth mencyon / Tho king
Edward came again unto York full sorrowful / And his host departed / and every
man went into his own country with full heavy chere and morning semblaunt /
And the Henaundes took their leave and went into their own country And the
king for their trauaylle / hugely rewarded the^ / And for because of y^ vyage
/ y^ king had dyspended much of his tresoure and wastyd. And in that time
were seen two moons in y^ fyrmament / y^ one was clear / and that other was
(...) / as men might see through y^ world. And a great debate was y^ same time
against pope John^ y^.xxii. after say^e petyr. and y^ emperor of Almayn tho
made him emperor against y^ popys will y^ tho held his see at Auinion.
wherefore the ^mperoure made his cry at Rome and ordained another pope / y^
hight Nicholas / y^ was a friar Minor / and that was a yenste y^ right of holy
church. wherefore he was cursyd. and the power of y^ othere pope soon laid.
And for cause that such merueylles were seen / men said that the world was
nygh at an end.

Of the death of king Edward of Carnariuan.
ANd now go we again / to sir Edward of Carnariuan that was king Edwards fader
/ sometime king of England. and put down of his dygnyte. Alas for his
trybulaco^n and sorrow that him befell through falls counsel. y^ he louid and
trustyd upon tomoche. y^ afterward were dystroyed through there falsnesse as god
would. And this Edward of Carnariuan / was in y^ castle of Berkelay under y^
ward and keeping of sir Moryce of ^erkelay / and also of sir John^ Matreues
and to them he made his complaynte of his sorrow and of his disese. And often
times axyd of his wardeyns. what he had trespassed against dame Isabell his wife
and sir Edward his sone. that was made new king / that they would not visit
him. And tho answerde one of his ^^rdeyns and said. My worthy lord dyspleyse
you not that I shall tell you the cause is. for it is do^n them to understood
/ that if my lady your wife came any thing nyghe you. that ye would her stra^
gle and slay / and also that ye would do^ to my lord your sone in the same
wise Tho answerde he with simple there Alas alas am not I in prison / and all
(...) your own will / now god it wot I thought it never / and now I would
that I were deed / ^o would god that I were. for then were all my sorrow
passyd / It was not long after. that the king thrughe counsel of Roger
Mortimer / grauntyd y^ ward and keeping of sir Edward his fader unto sir
Thomas To^oursy and to y^ foresaid sir John^ Matreuers thrughe y^ kings letter
/ and put out holy the foresaid sir Moryce of y^ ward of y^ (...) ge. And they
took and ladde the king unto the castle of ^o^f. y^ which castle the king
hatyd as any death / And they kept him there till it came unto saint / Mathewes
day in Septembre in the year of grace.M.CCC:xx^u. that the for said sir Roger
Mortymer sent the manner of y^ death / how and in what wise he should be done
to death / And anon as y^ foresaid Thomas and John^ had see the ^et ter / and
co^mau^demente / they made king Edward Carnari^an good cher^: and good solace
/ as they might at that sou^tpere / and nothing y^ king wist of y^ traytory.
And when time was for to go too bed the king went to his bed and lay and
slept fast. And as the king lay and slept the traitors falls forsworn against
there homage and f^uate / came pryuely into the kings chamber / and their
company with them / and laid an huge table upon his womb / and with men
p^e^ssyd and held fast down the four corners of the table on his body /
wherewith the good man awoke / and was wonder sore adradde to be deed and there
slain / and turned his body up tho so down. Tho took the false traitors / and
tyrau^tes an horn. and put it into his fundement as deep as they might / and
took a spyt of cop^e brennynge / and put it through the horn into his body
and of^ times therewith thy^led his bowels and so they slew there lord / that
no thing was perceived / And after he was enteryd at Glouce^^e.

How king Edward spowsyd Phylyp y^ earls daughter of Henaude at york
ANd after Cristmasse tho next sewynge / sit John^ of Henaude brought with
him Philyp his brothers daughter / y^ was earl of Henaude his nece into
England / and the king spowsyd her at York. with much honor. And sir
John^ of Bothum bishop of Ely / and sir wyllyam of Melton Archebysshopp of
York / sange y^ mass y^ Sunday on the even of y^ Conuersyon of saint Poule /
In the year of grace.M.CCC.xxvii. But because y^ the king was but young and
tender of aege when he was crowned full many wrongs were done while y^ his
fader lived / by cause y^ he trowed / y^ cou^seyllers y^ were falls a abowte him
/ y^ cou^seylled him to do otherwise than reason would / wherefore great harm
was done to y^ reame and to the king / and all men dyrected i^ the kings deed
/ and it was not so / almighty god it wot / wherefore it was ordained at the
kings crownynge* y^ the king for his tender aege / should be governed by.xii.
of the grettest lords of England / without whom nothing should be done.
That is to say thar^h^bysshop of Canterbury / tharche bishop of York / y^
bishop of wynches tree / and the bishop of Herforde / the earl of Lancastre /
ther^e Marschall / and the Earl of Kent / y^ were the kings vndes and the earl
of Garen^e / sir Thomas wake. sir Henry Percy. sir Olyuer yngham and John^ Rous
barons / all these were sworn truly for to counseyll the king. and they should
answer every year in parliament / of that that should be done in y^ time of
their gouernall / but that ordinance was sone undone / and that was much
harm to all England / For the king and all the lords y^ should govern him
were governed and (...) y^ queen his mother dame Isabell. and (...) sye Roger
Mortimer: and as they would all thyn ge was done / both among high and low
And they took unto them castles towns londees / and tent^ in great harm.
and loss to y^ crown. and of the kings estate out of all mesure.

How the peace was made between the Englysshmen and the Scotts and alsoo of
Iustifyenge of Troylles^aston.
King Edward at wytsontyde in the second year of his regne thrughe the
counseyll of his mother / and sir Roger Mortimer / ordained a parliament at
Northampton. And at y^ parliament the king through his counsel / and none other
of y^ land / with in aege grau^tyd to be accordyd with the scotts in this manner.
y^ al y^ feautees and homages. y^ the scotts should do to y^ crown of
England / foryaue them for ever more / by his chartre ensealed. And
ferdermore an endenture was made of y^ Scotts unto king Edward / y^ was
king Henryes sone / which endenture they call it ragman. in y^ which were
contained all y^ homages and feaute^s / First of y^ king of Scotlonde and of
y^ prelates / earls barons of y^ reame of Scotloyde / with their seals set
thero^ and other chartres and reme^brauncys y^ king Edward and his barons had
of their right in y^ foresaid reame of scotlonde / it was foryeue again holy
church / And also with y^ black cross of Scotlonde the which y^ good king
Edward conquered in Scotlonde and brought it out of the abbaye of Scone / y^
is a full precious relyque / And also ferthermore / he releacy^ and fully
forgave all the lands y^ y^ noble barons had before y^ time in y^ reame of
scotlonde / by old conquest. And ferther more y^ this peace for to be holden
and continuelly last y^ Scotts were bound unto the king in.xxx. thousand
pound of silver to be pay^^ within th^e year / that is every year.x. thousand
pound by even porcy^^^. And ferther^^^^ above all this / they spoke between
the parties above said. that David Dri^^^autier that was king Robert B^us sone
/ the false tyrant / and falls forsworn against his oath that arose against his
lyege lord / the noble and good king Edward. and falsely made him king of
Scotlonde / that was of aege.v. year. And so this cursyd counseyll Dauyd
spoused at B^rewyk dame John^ of the Toure / that was king Edwardes sister /
as the gestes tellith upon Mary Mawdeleyns day. in y^ year of
grace.M.CCC.xxviii. too great harm and ^mpayrynge of all y^ kings blood /
whereof y^ gentle lady came. alas the time / For wonder much that fair
damoysell dysperagyd / sith y^ she was married against all the comyns will and
assent of England. And from the time that Brute had conquered Albion / and
named the land after his own name. Brytayne: that now is called England after
the name of Engist. And so the reame of Scotlond was hold of y^ reame of
England / and of the crown by feaute and homage. For Brute conquered that
hand / and yaue it to Albana^ / y^ was his second sone / And he called that
land Albayn / after his own name / so y^ his hey^es y^ came after him. should
hold of Brute and of his heirs / y^ is to say of the kings of Brytayn / by
feaute and homage: And from y^ time unto this time of king Edward / y^ reame
of Scotlonde was hold of the reame of England by ^eaute and seruyse / as
about is said in the Chronicles of England and of Scotlond and be^ ythe
witness more prenarely. And accursyd be y^ time that this parliament was holden
at Northampton. For there by falls counsel. y^ king was there falsely
dysheryted and yet he was within aege. And yet when that king Edward (...)
put out of his ryaltee of England yet men put not him out of the f^autes and
seruyse of Sco^londe. ne of the ^ra^nchyses dysher^ted him for ever more And
nevertheless the great lords of England were against to conferme the ^eas and
the (...) above said / sauf only queen Isabell / that tho was the kings mother
Edward / and the bysshopp of Ely / and the lord Mortimer. But rea son and law
would not that a fynalle peace should be made between the with out the common
assent of England.

Of the debate that was between qu^ne Isabell and sir Henry earl of Lancas tree
and of Leycetre / and of the riding of Bedforde.
Then as the foresaid Dauyd had spowsyd dame Iohan^e of y^ tour in the town of
Berwy^ as before is said / The Scotts in dyspyte of the Englysshemen called
dame Iohanne y^ ^^a^tesse make peace / for the cowardly peace y^ tho was
ordained. But the kings person bare all y^ w^te and blame with wrong of the
making of the accord / And all was done thrughe the queen and Rogere
Mortymer. And it was not long after that the queen Isabell ne took intoo her
hondes all y^ lordshyp of Pou^^^rer almost all the lands that were of any
value that apperteyned to the crown of England / So the king had not to
dyspende / but of his uses and of his esscheker / For the queen Isabell and the
Mortymer had great main of the (...) y^ followed the kings court ever mo^^
and went and took the kings pry^^s for her penny worthes ^tte good ^hepe /
Wherfo re the coun^^^e that they came in were / fulle sore adradde / and
almooste dystroyed of them. Tho began y^ comy^^l te of England for to have
(...) to (...) bell the queen. y^ somoche louyd her before whann she came again
for to pursue the false traitors / y^ Spensers fro France. And in y^ same time
the false traitor Robert of Holonde / y^ bytrayed his lord sir Thomas of
Lancaster. was tho delyuerde out of prison / and was wonder preuy with ye queen
Isabell / and also with Roger Mortymer. but y^ auaylled him but little. For he
was taken at Myghel mass y^ tho came next after / as he rode toward queen
Isabell to London / and sir Thomas whither smote of his heed besides the town
of saint Albons. And this sir Thomas dwelled with sir Henry earl of Lancastre /
and he put him aside for dread of the queen / For the queen loved him
wondermoche. And prayed unto y^ king for him y^ the same Thomas might be exyled
out of England. And y^ noble earl sir Henry of Lancastre had often times herd
the common claymoure of the Englysshmen / of y^ disease yt we re done in
England / and also for diverse wrongs y^ were done to the common people. of y^
which the king bare y^ blame with wrong / for he was but full young and
tender of aege. And thought as a good man for to do away / and slake the
s^lau^der of the kings person / if y^ he might in any manner a wise / so as
y^ king was thereof nothing gylty / wherefore he was in peril of life and
ly^me: And so he assembled all his retenewe and went and spoke with them of the
kings honor / and alsoo for to amend his astate. And sir Thomas Brotherton
earl of Marchall / and sir Edmonde wodstok / that were the ky^gys uncles / and
alsoo men of Londone made their oath him for to mayntene in that same quarrel.
And their cause was this / that the king should hold his house and his meyne
/ as a king ought for to do / and have all his ryaltce. And that the queen
Isabell should deliver onte of her hondes in too the kings hand all manner
of lordshyps rentys / towns and castles that apperteyneth unto the crown of
England as othere queen's have done here before / and meddle with none other
thing. And alsoo that sire Rogere Mortimer should abide and dwell upon his
own lands / For the which lands he had help too dysheryt^ motche people
/ ^n so much that the common people were dystroyed and gretlye domaged /
thoroughe such wrongfulle taking. And alsoo too enquere how and by whom that
the king was bytrayed and falsely dysceyued at Stanhope / and through whose
counseyll that the Scotts went away by night from the king / And also how
and through whoos counseylle the ordinance that were made at the kings
coronacyon / was put down. That is to say / that y^ king for amendment
and helping of his reame / and in honor of him should be governed and ruled
by.xii. of the grettest and wysest lords of the reame / and without them.
should nothing be grauntyd ne done / as before is said / which couenau^tes
were malycyously put down fro the king / where many harms. shamis and
repreues have fall to the king and his reame / and that is too understand
for asmoche as Edward king of England / sometime / was ordained by asse^t in
plain parliament / for to be under ward and governance of Henry earl of
Lancastre his cosyn / for saluaco^n of his bodi he was take out of y^ castle of
Kenilworth / there yt he was in ward. and through color of queen Isabell / and
of y^ Mortimer with out consent of any parliament they took and ladd him there
that never after none of his kynred / might with him speak ne see. and after
traytoursly took and mordred him / for whose death arose a sklau^dre through all
criste^dom / when it was done. And also y^ tresore y^ sir Edward of Kerna^
iuan left in many places in England and in walys and wastyd and borne away
/ without y^ will of kynged ward his sone / in dystruccyon of him and of all
his folk. Also through who se conseyll / that the king yaue up the kingdom of
Scotlonde / for the which reame / y^ kyngys au^cetours had full sore traueyled
/ and so did many a noble man for their right / and was delyuerd unto dauyd y^
was Robert Brus sone all y^ right / y^ no right had to y^ reame. as all y^
world it wist. And also by whom the chartres and remebaunces yt they had of
y^ right of Scotlonde were take out of y^ tresory / and taken to y^ Scotts y^
kyngys enmyes / to dysherytynge of him and of his successors / and to great
harm of his lyeges / and great repreef to all Englysshmen for ever more. Also
wherefore dame Johan of ye toure ye kings sister Edward / was dysperagid and
married unto Dauyd y^ was Robert Brus sone. y^ was a traitor and enmye unto
England. and through whoos counsel she was take in to our enmyes hondes out
of England. And in this mean while. y^ good e^le Henry of Lancastre and his
company took counsel how those points abouesayd / might be amended to ye
worshipp of ye king and to his profit and to y^ profit of his lyegs / And y^
queen Isabel thrughe coniectynge and also of y^ Mortimers let ordeyne a
parliament at Salisburye And at y^ same parliament / y^ Mortimer was made earl of
March ayenste all the barons will of England in prejudice of the king and of
his crown. And sir John^ of Eltham the kings brother / was girde with a
sword of Cornewaylle. And tho was called earl of Cornewayle. and ever more
queen Isabell procurydso much against her sone the king / y^ she had the ward
of the foresaid sir Edward and of his lands. And at that parliament the earl
of Lancastre would not come / But ordained all his power against queen Isabelle
and the Mortimer / And men of London ordained them with tyue houndred men of
armies / wharme queen Isabell wyste of the doing / ^he^ swore by god and by his
names / full angerly / that in an evil time he thought upon tho points / Tho
sent y^ queen Isabell and y^ Mortimer after their retene we and after the
kyngys retene we / so y^ they had ordained among the^ an huge host And they
cou^seylled y^ king so that upon a night / they rode.xxiii. miles too Bedford
/ there y^ earl of Lancastre was with his company / and thought to have him
dystroyed / and that night she rode beside the king her sone as a kryghte for
dread of death. And it was done the king to understand that the earl Henry of
Lancastre and his company would have dystroyed the king and his counseyll for
ever more / wherefore the king was somdele toward him heavy and anoyed. when
therle Marschall and therle of Kente the kyngys brother herd of this tidings
/ they rode so in message between them / that the king grauntyd him his peace
to therle Henry of Lancastre / for a certain raunso^me of a.xi thousand pound
/ But that was never paid afterward. And these were the lords y^ held with
sir Henry of Lancastre. sire Beaumo^t / sir Fouk fytzwar^n. sir thomas Rocelyn
/ sir wyllyam T^ussel (...) Thomas whyther / and abowce an hundred knights moo
that were too him consented / and all those were ^ryled thrughe counseyll of
queen Isabell and of Mortymer. For the Mortimer waited to have their lands /
if that he might thru / ghe any manner coniectynge / For he was to coueytous and
had to much his will and that was great pity.

How king Edward went over the sea for too do his homage unto the king of
France / for y^ duchye of Guy hen.
IT was notte long after that the king of France / thrughe counseyll of his
douzepers / sent to king Edward of England that he should come to Paris and
do his homage / as reason it would / for y^ duchye of Guyon / and so through
counsel of y^ lords of England king Edward went over see. And at y^
Ascencyon tide / he came unto Paris / y^ third year of his regne / for to do
his homage unto y^ king of France. and y^ king received his homage / and
made of him much Joy and worship / But when king Edward had done his homage
hastyly he was sent for into England thrughe y^ queen Isabell his mother and
anon hastyly he came again into England / upon wytsonday without any taking
leave of y^ king of France. wherefore he was wonder wothe.

How sir Roger Mortymer bare him proudely and so high.
ANd now shall ye here of sir Roger Mortymer of wygmore that desired and
coueted to be at an high astate / so that the king grau^tyd him to be called
earl of March / through out al his lordshyp. And he became so proud and
hauteyn / y^ he would lose and forsake the name y^ his elds had ever before /
and for y^ cause he let him call earl of march. And none of ye comyns of
England durst call him by othere name / for he was called so by y^ kyngys
cry. that men should call him earl of March. and Mortymer bare him so
hauteyne and so proud that wonder it was for to wit. and alsoo dysguysed him
with wonder rich clothes out of all manner of reason / both of shapynge and
of werynge. whereof the Englysshmen had great wonder / how and in what manner
he might contriue or find such manner pride. And they said among them
comynly / y^ his pride should not long endure. And the same time sir Geffray
Mortymer the young / That was Mortymers sone. let call him king of folly /
and so it befell afterward in deed / for he was so fulle of pride and of
wretchydnesse / that he held a round table in walys / to all me^ that theder
came / and counterfeted the doing and the manner of king Arthurs table / but
openly he failed / for the noble king Arthur was the most noble lord of
renomme / that was in all y^ world in his time and yet came never none such
after / For all y^ noble knights in all criste^dom of dedys of armies assayed /
dwelled with king Arthur / and held him for there lord and sovereign / And
that was well seen / for he oconquerde in a battle a Romayn that was called
Froll. and gate of him the reame of France / and slew him with his own
hounds / and also he faught with a gyaunte that was called Dynabus / and slew
him that had rauysshyd fair Elayne yt was king Howels nece / king of lytyl
Brytain and after he slew in bataylle ye emperor of Rome / yt was called
Lucie / y^ had assembled against Arthur / for to fight with him so much people
of Romans and Pehites and sarrasyns / y^ no man cowde nombre them / and he
dyscomfyted them al as the story tellyth. And in that same time common voice
spronge in England through coniectynge and ordinance of the friar prechers /
y^ sir Edward of Carnariuan / yt was king Edwardes fader of whom the geste
tellyth / said y^ he was alive in y^ castle of Corf / whereof all the comyns of
England almost werein sorrow and dread / whether y^ it were so or not For
they wist not how traytoursly mortymer had him done murthred.

How Edmonde of wodstok that was earl of kente and y^ kings brother Edward
of Carnaryuan / was heedyd at wynchestre.
ANd upon a time it befell so / that sir Edmonde of w^^^tok Earl of Kente /
spoke unto pope John^ the.xxii. at Auimon / and said y^ almighty god had often
times done for Thomas love of Lancastre many great miracles to many men and
wy^men / that were thrughe diverse maladyes undone. as unto y^ world / and
thrughe his prayere they were brought unto there health. and so sir Edmo^de
prayed y^ pope hertely y^ he would grant him grace / y^ foresaid Thomas might
be trau^slatyd. But ye pope said nai that he should not be traunslatyd / unto
y^ time that he were better certifyed of ye clergy of England and seen by
there obedyence what thing god had done for the love of saint Thomas of
Lancastre after the suggestion y^ the foresaid earl of Kent had unto him made.
And when this Edmond saw y^ he might not speed of his purpos: as towchynge ye
traunsla co^n. he prayed him of counsel. as touchy^ge sir Edward of
Carnariuan his brother / and said. y^ not long agon he was king of England /
what thing might best be done as touching his delyuerau^ce / sithe yt a
comune fame was thrughe England yt he is alive. hole and sauf when y^ pope herd
him tell y^ sir Edward was alive. he commanded y^ earl upon his blissynge. yt
he should help with all y^ power y^ he might / that he were delyuerde out of
prison / and save his body in all manner y^ he might. And to bring this thing
to a^ end he assoyled him and his company a pena and culpa^ and all that halpe
to his delyueraunce. Tho took Edmond of wodstok his leave of the pope / and came
again into England / and when sir Edmond was come / some of the friar prechers
came and said that sir Edward his brother yette was alive in y^ castle of Corf
/ under the keeping of sir Thomas Gurnay / tho sped him y^ foresaid Edmond as
fast as he might / till he came to the castle of Corf / and acquay^ted him
and spoke so fair to John^ Daueryll / y^ was conestable of the same castle /
and yaue him rich yefes for to have acqueyntau^ce of him and to know of his
counsel. And thus it befell that the foresaid Edmonde prayed specially to tell
him pryuely of his lord his brother sir Edward / if y^ he lived or were deed
/ and if he were alive he prayed hy^ ones to have a sight of hy^. And this sir
John^ Daueryll was a high herted man and full of courage / and answerde
shortly to sir Enmond and said / y^ sir Edward (...) brother was in health. and
under his (...) ge. and durst not show him unto no man sith it was defended
him in y^ king ^^^fe Edward / y^ was Edwardes sone of Carna^^an / and also by
the co^ nau^^^ ^^^te of queen Isabell y^ kings mother (...) of sir roger
Mortymer y^ he should show his body to no man of y^ world saufonly to them
vponlyf and ly^me / and (...) tynge of his heirs for ever more. But the false
traitor falsely lied. for he was not in his ward but was take thens^ lad to y^
castle of Berkley by (...) Thoma^ of Gurney / by the co^m^^nde^^te of Mortymer
/ till he was deed as (...) is said / But sir Edmonde of wodsto^ wist no thing
y^ sir Edward his brother was deed / whereupon he took a letter unto king
Edward his brother as to his worthy lorde^ and received y^ letter of him and
behyght him right faithful to do his message without fayll. And with that sir
Edmonde took leave of y^ (...) Ihon^ / and yede into his own country and
lordshyp in Kent that he had there. Anon as this same John^ wist. that sir
Edmonde was gone into Kent his own lo^ deshyp / anon he went in all the ^aste
y^ he might / fro the Castle of Corf and came unto sire Rogere Mortymer and
took him the letter that sire Edmonde of wodstok earl of Kent had taken him
closed and e^sealed with his own seal And when sire Roger Mortymer hadd
received the letter / ^e vncloysed it / and saw y^ was ^^reyned the^^^ / and
began it to read. whereof the beg^^nynge was thy^ Worshyppes and reverence with
brother alyegaunce and subiec^yon / sir knyz^ worshypfull and dear brother / if
it you please I pray you hertely that ye be in good comforth / for I shall so
ordeyn for you / that ye shall come out of prison and be delyuerd of that
dysese that ye been in / And vnderstondyth of your great lord ship / that I
have to mine assenting almoost all the great lords of England / with all
their appareyll / that is to say with armoure / with tresour without no^bre /
for to mayntene your quarrel so fer forth / that ye shall be king again as ye
were before / and that they have sworn to me upon a book / and as well
prelates as earls and barons. when sire Roger Mortymer saw and understood /
the might and the strenth of the letter anon his heart for wrath began to
boll and evil heart bare toward sir Edmo^de of wodstok / that was earl of Kent
/ and with all the have that he might / he went unto dame Isabell y^ queen /
that was the kings mother / and showed her sire Edmonds letter / his will and
his purpose / and how that he had coniected and ordained to put down king
Edward of wyndsore her sone / of his ryalte and of his kingdom / Now certes
sir Roger said she / has sir Edmond done so now by my faders soul said she /
I will be thereof avenged / if that god grant melyfe / and that in a short
time. And with that queen Isabell went unto king Edward her sone there he was
at the parliament at wynchestre / too have amend the wrongys and the trespasses
that were done among the people of his reame And thoo she took and showed him
the letter that sir Edmond of wodstok had made / and ensealed with his own
seal and had him upon her blessing. that he should be auengyd upon sir
Edmonde as upon his dedely enmye. Tho was the queen sore wroth toward sir
Edmonde earl of Kent. and sessyd never to pray until her sone / till that he
had sent in all the have after him. And upon that y^ king sent by his letters
after sir Edmo^de of wodstok / that he should come and speak with him at
wynchestre all manner thing left. And when sir Edmond saw that the king sent
after him with his letters ensealed / he hasted him in all that he might till
that he came to wynchestre. But when the queen wist that sir Edmonde was come
to wynchestre tho anon she prayed / and so fast wend unto king Edward her
sone / that the good earl was arested anon / and ladde unto the bar before
Robert of Hamo^de / that was Coroner of y^ kings house hold. And he associed
unto him sir Roger Mortimer. And tho spoke y^ forsaid Roger and said / sire
Edmonde earl of Kente / ye shall understand that it is done us to wit / and
pryncypally unto our lyege lord the king Edward of England almighty god him
save and keep / yt ye be his deedly enmye / and a tray toure / and also a
comune enmye too the reame / and that ye have been about many a day. for to
make pryue delyuerau^ce of sir Edward sometime king of England your brother /
the which sometime was put down of his ryalte by the common assent of the lords
of England / in peasynge of our lord the kings estate / and also of his
reame. Tho ansuerd the good man and said / Forsooth sir understand well that I
was never traytour^ to my king / ne to the reame / and that I do me on god /
and on all y^ world / and therefore by my kings leave. I shall it preue and
defend as a man ought* for to do. Tho said Mortymer. sir Edmonde. it is so
ferforth know / that it may not be well gaynsayd / and that in prys^^e of all
y^ here been. it shall be well proved. Now had this false Moltimer the same
letter that sir Edmond had take to sir John^ Daueryll in the castle of Cors
for to take to king Edward his brother y^ sir Edmonde wist not of ne supposed
no thing that sir John^ Daueryll had be so falls to deliver his letter in such
wise unto Mortimer. and thought no mane^^ of thing of y^ letter. Then Mortimer
said to sir Edmonde / and showed a letter sealed. and axid him if y^ he knew
y^ let^ and the seal. This sir Edmond lokyd thereon / and auysed him long time
on the prynte of y^ seal / for he might not see y^ letter within. and wist
well y^ it was his seal / and thought y^ it had be so^me letter that had bore
no great charge / and thought no thing of y^ other letter. And said openly in
herynge of them all / ye forsothe this is my seal. and I will it not forsake.
Lo said the Mortymer / syres ye here all what he has said / and y^ he know
legyth him y^ this is his letter and his seal. And now ye shall here what is
contained therein / And then this Mortimer opened the letter y^ he had fold
tofore together. and read it openly word by word inherynge of them all / and
when the letter was read / he said / Loo syres / ye have herd all y^ herin is
written / and yt he has knowlegyd y^ this is his letter and his seal. and he
may not go therfro / And thenn they cried and yaue dome / y^ he should be
hangyd and drawn / and his heed smyten of i^ a manner of a traitor and he and
his heirs dysheryted forever more / and so he was ladde forth and put into
prison. and when this was done / and the queen wist that he was dampened by way
of law / both of life and of ly^me / and his heirs dysheritedted for
evermore. through open knowlegynge in plain court / where them thought yt it
were good / that the foresaid sir Edmond were hast^ly slain / without wyttynge
of y^ king / or else the king ^olde lightly foryeue him his death / and then
it should form them to much sorrow / so as he was emp^chis / And anon the
queen through counseyll of y^ Mortimer / and without any other counseyll sent in
have to the Baylyf of wynche^re that they should smite of sir Edmonds heed ^rle
of Kent without any manner abiding or respyte upon pain of life and lymme^ And
that he he should have no / ne other execusyon / by cause of tatyeng
notwithstondynge the Judgment. Tho took the baylyfs sir Edmond out of p^ison /
and sad him beside the castle of wynchestre / and there they made a
gonfermer smite of his heed / for none other durst it do / and so he deyed
there / alas the while. That is to say the tenthe day of Octobre / the third
year of king Edwards regne. And when y^ king wist thereof / he was wonder sorry /
and let entyere him at the friar Mynors at wynchestre.

Of the death of sir Roger Mort^mer earl of March.
ANd so it befell at that time that sir Roger Mortimer earl of the March / was
so proud and so haute^^ that he held no lord of the reame his pere. And tho
became he so coueytous y^ he followed dame Isabell ye queen's court that was
king Edwardes mode^ and beset his penny worth with the officers of the queen's
householde / ^n the same manner that the kings officers did. And so he made
his taking / as touching of vytayle and also of caryages and all he did for
because of expencys and too gadre tresoure / And so he did without nombre in
all that he might. T^^oo had he made him wonder preuy with the queen ^sabell
/ And so much lord ship and ^etenewe had / y^ all the great lords of
England of hy^ were adrad wherefore the king and his counseylle / toward him
were agreued / and ordained among them to undo him thoroughe pure reason and
law for cause y^ king Edward y^ was the kings fader tray tourly through him
was murdered in the castle of Corf / as before is said moore plainly in some
part of this book / of his death. And some that were of the kings counseyll
louyd Mortymer / and told him in preuyte / how y^ the king and his counseylle
/ were abowte from day to day / him for to dystroye and undo wherefore
mortymer was sore anoyed and angry as the devil against them of the kings
counseyll / and said he would of the^ be avenged / how so ever he took on. It
was not long afterward / y^ king Edward and dame Phylyp his wife / and dame
Isabell y^ kings mother. and sire Rogere Mortimer / ne went unto Notyngham
there for to sotourne / And so it befell / y^ queen Isabell thrughe counsel
of Mortymer took to her y^ keys of y^ yates of the castle of Notyngham. so y^
no man might come another in ne out / but thrughe commandment of Mortimer /
ne the kynge^ne none of his counsel. And yt time it fell / yt the Mortimer as
a devil for wrath bolled / and also for wrath that he had against y^ kings
men Edward / and pryncypally against them yt had him accusyd to y^ king / of
y^ death of sir Edward his fader. And pryuely a counseyll was take between
queen Isabell and the Mortymer / and the bishop of Lyncoln and sir Symonde of
Bedford / and sir High of. Trompyngton / and other preuy of their counseyll /
for to undo them al y^ the Mortimer had accusyd unto y^ king of his faders
death / of treason and off felonye. wherefore all tho that were of the kings
counseyll / when they wist of the Mortimers casting: pryuely came to king
Edward and said / that Mortymer would them dystroye / because that they had
him accusyd of king Edwardes death. his fader / And prayed hy^ that he
woldmayntene them in their right / And these were the lords that pursued this
quarrel / Sir wyllyam of Mountagu / sir wyllyam de Bohum / sir wullyam his
brother / sir Rauf Stafforde. sire Robert of Herforde / sir wyllyam of Clynton /
sir John^ Neuell of Hornbyand many other of their consent And all these swore
upon a book to mayntene y^ quarelle / in as much as they might. And if befell
so after. y^ sir wyllyam Mou^tagu / ne none of ye kings fre^des must not be
herberowed in y^ castle for y^ Mortimer / but went and took their herberowe
in dyuerfe place of y^ town of Notyngham. And tho were they sore aferde /
leest y^ Mortimer should them dystroye. And in have they came unto king
Edward sir wyllyam of Mou^tagu / and other yt were in y^ castle. And pryuely
hy^tolde / yt he ne none of his company. should not take y^ Mortymer. without
counseyll and help of wyllyam of Elande. constable of y^ same castle. Now
truly said ye king I love you well. and therefore I counsel you y^ ye go to
the foresaid conestable / and command him in my name / that he be your friend
and your help / for to take the Mortimer / all thing yleft / upon peril of
life and lymme Tho said Mountagu Syremy lord grant mercy. Tho went forth y^
for said Mountagu / and came to the Constable of the castle / and told him y^
kings will. And he answerde and said. the ky^ges will should be done in as
much as he might. and that he would notte spare for no manner of death / And
that he swore and made his oath Tho said sir wyllyam of Mountagu to the
Constable / in herynge of them all. that were helping to the same quarrel. Now
certes dear friend / us behouyth to work and doby your aduys for to take the
Mortymer / sith that ye be keeper of the castle. and has the keys in your
ward. Sire said the Conestable / will ye understand / that the castle yates
ben lockyd with y^ keys that dame Isabell sent hither. and by night she has
the keys thereof: and lays them under y^ luesell of the bed unto y^ morrow.
and so ye may not come into the castle by the yates / by no manner of wise /
But I know an aleye that stretchyth out of the ward under the ^^ the into the
foresaid castle / that gothe into the west. which aleye dame Isabell the queen
/ ne none of her men ne y^ mortimer / ne none of his company knowith it not And
so I shall led you through y^ aley / and so ye shall come into y^ castle with
out aspyenge of any man y^ are your enmyes. And y^ same night sir wyllyaz
Mountagu / and all the lords of his quarrel / and the same Conestable also
went them to horse / and made semblaunt as it were for to go out of Mortimers
sight But anon as Mortimer herd this tidings / he wend y^ they would have go
ue over see for fere of him. And anon right he and his company took a
counseyll among them for to let their passage / and sent letters anon to
the porters so y^ none of the great lords should go home to their own
countries / but if they were arested and take. And among other things wyllyam
Eland Conestable of the foresaid castle. pryuely ladde sir will lyam of Mou^tagu
and his company by y^ foresaid way under the trthe / tylle they came into the
castle and went up into the toure there y^ Mortimer was in. But sir Hugh of
Trompynton them ascryed hydously: and said a traitors it is all for naught.
y^ ye ben common into this castle ye shall deye yet an evil death euerichone.
And anon one of them that was in Mountagues company up with a mare / and
smote the same Hughe upon the heed / that the brain braste out and fell on the
ground / and so was he deed of an evil death. Tho took they Mortymer as he
armyd him at the toures door / when he herd the noise of them for dread. And
when the queen Isabel sa^e that the Mortimer was taken she made much sorrow
in heart / and these words unto them she said / Now fair (...) / I pray
you that ye do no harm (...) his body a worthy knight our (...) f^^de and
our (...) cosyn Tho went they thens / and came and brought Mortimer and
presentyd him unto king Edward / and he commanded to bring him in
sauewarde. But anon as they y^ were consenting unto mortimers doing / herd
tell y^ he was taken they went and hid them / and pryuely by night went out
of y^ town ethe one his way / with heavy heart and morninge chere and lived
upon their lands as well as they might / And y^ same year that Mo^^mer was
take. he had ir. score (...)tes without squyers and sergaun^es of armies / and
footmen / And then was Motimer ladde to London / and sir Edmonde of Bedforde
was ladde with him and was taken to the conestable of y^ four to keep / But
after ward was y^ Mortymers life examined at westmestre before the king / and
before all the great lords of England / for peril that might fall to the
reame / And to enquere also which were consenting to sir Edwardes death the
kings fader. / and also through who me the Scotts escaped fro Stanhope in
Scotlonde / without leave of king Edward. And also how y^ chartre of ^^^man was
delivered unto the Scotts therein the homages and feauters of the lords of
Scotlonde were contained y^ the Scotts should do ever more too the Engysshe
king for the reame of Scotlond / wherefore he was Iugyd to be drawn and hangyd
for his treason And this myscheyf came unto him on saint Andrews even. In the
year of the Incarcyon of our lord Ihesu crist.M.CCC.xxx.

How king Edward gate again unto him gracyously the homages and frautres of
Scotlonde whereof he was put out thrughe false counseylle of y^ queen Ysabell
his mother / and sire Roger Mortymer. that was newely made earl of March.
NOw have ye herd how Iohane Bayllol in the time of peace was chosen to be
king of Scotlonde for cause that he came of the eldest daughter of the Earl
Dauyd of Huntyngton / that was king Alysanders brother of Scotlonde / that
deyed without heir of his body begoten / And how this John^ made his feauete
and homage to king Edward / Henryes sone y^ third. for his lands of
Scotlonde / And how he afterward withsayd his homage / thrughe counsel of
the Scotts / in the year of our lord M.CC.lxxiiii. and sent unto y^ pope
thrughe. a falls suggestyon y^ he made his oath unto y^ foresaid king Edward over
his astate and his will / of y^ which oath y^ pope him assoyled through his
bullys to hy^ysent. And anon as king Edward wist thereof / he ordeyne anon
his barons and came unto Berewyk / and conquered the town / at the which
conquest there wereslayne.xxv. thosand. and.vii. hundred. and Bayllol that was
king of Scotlond came and yeldyd him to good king Edward / and the king
delyuerd him out of the tour of London. and all y^ great lords with him y^ tho
were taken at Barwyk and yaue them saufconduyte / to go into Scotlonde. And
the Scotts sithe through their falsnesse / werred upon the good king Edward.
And when sire John^ Bayllol king of Scotland saw all this / he went over see
unto Dimp^er and lived there upon his lands as well as he might. till that the
Scotts would amend them of their mysdedys and trespaas / and ladde with him
sir Edward his sone. wherefore the Scotts in dyspyte of him called him sir
John^ Turnlabard / for because that he would notte offend ne trespaas ayenste
the good king Edward of England. And so he forsook his reame of Scotlonde /
and set thereof but little price. And this sir Iohanne dwelled long time in
France / till y^ he deyed there and sir Edward his fo^^ received his (...)
rytage / and (...) mage to y^ king of France / for his lands of Dunpie^ /
And so it befell afterward / y^ Edward y^ was John^ Bayllols sone / had^ of
him a squyre of England y^ was borne in York shyre / that was called John^ of
Barnaby / and this edward Bayllol louyd him much / and was nyghe hy^ / and
full preuy. And so this John^ of Barnaby was in debate with a French man in ye
town of Du^pier / and so he slew him and went his way in all the haste y^ he
might into the castle. for too have socoure and help of his lord / And a
none came the officers of the town. to take John^ of Barnaby as a felon. and
sir Edward his lord help him / and rescowed him / and by night made him go
out of the castle / and so he went his way and came into England without
any harm. And when y^ king of France saw y^ sir Edward had rescowed his
felon. he became wonder wroth ayenstetyr Edward. and anon let him arestyd
and took into his hondes all his lands / Tho dwelled sir Edward in prison /
unto y^ time y^ sir Henry of Beaumont came into France / y^ which Henry
sometime waserle of Anguysshe in Scotlon de and was put out thereof when
thacordement was between England and scotlonde through y^ queen Isabell and sir
Roger Mortimer and their company for y^ marriage y^ she made between Dauyd /
that was Roberte Brussone and dame Johan of Tour king Edwards sister of
England / and well understood this / that at y^ end he should come to his
right / butyf it were sir Edward Bayllol / that was right htyre of the reame
of Scotlonde And the king of France Lowyslsuyd much this sir Henry / And he
was with hy^ full preuy / and thought for to make a deliver a^mie of sire
Edward Bayllof / if he might in any manner of wise / Tho prayed he the king
that he would of his grace grant him sy^^ Edward Bayllols body / unto the
next parliament. y^ he might live with his own rentes in y^ mean time / and y^
he might stand to be Iugyd with his perys at the parliament / And y^ king
grau^tyd him his prayer / and made y^ foresaid Edward to be delivered out of
prison / in y^ manner above said. and anon as he was out of prison sir Henry
took him forth with him and ladde him into England / and made him dwell
pryuely at the maneer of Sandhall upon Ouse in york shyre. with the lady Vescy.
And so he ordained hun there an huge retenew of Englysshmen and also of
alyauntes / for too conquer again his heritage / and so he yaue much silver
unto y^ souldyours and alyauntes for to help him / And they behyght for to
help him in y^ they might / but they faylled him at his most need. And at y^
time Dauyd earl of Moryf herd tell how that sir Edward Bayllol was privily
come in to England. And came to him / and made with him great Joy of his
coming and said unto him and behyght him / that all y^ great lords of
England / should be to him entendau^te / and should him hold for king as
right heir of Scotlonde / and did to him feaute. Tho came sir Henry of
Beaumo^te to king Edward of England. and prayed him in y^ way of charytee /
that he would grant of his grace unto syred ward Bayllol y^ he might saufly
goo by land from Sandhall / vnto^ Scotlo^de / to conquer his right and
herytannce in scotlonde. The king answerde and said / if that I suffer
Bayllol. go thrughe my land into Scotlonde. then the people would say / y^ I
should be assenty^ge unto y^ company. Now sir I pray you y^ ye would give him
leave to take with him souldyours of Englysshmen that they might saufly led him
through your land to Scotlonde / And sir upon this covenant y^ if it so befall
/ as god it forbydde that he be dyscomfyted in battle through the Scotts /
that I and also all the lords that hold with Bayllol / ben for ever more out
of our rentes y^ we have in England. And there the king upon this covenant
/ grauntyd their bone / as towchynge him / and tho that were of the same
quarrel / the which claymed for to have lands and rentes in the reame of
England / And these were y^ names of those lords that pursued this foresaid
matere and quarrel. That is to say / Sire Edward Bayllol / the which
chalengyd the reame of Scotlonde* sir Henry Beaumont earl of Ang^^^she / sir
Dauyd of Stroboly earl of atheles / sir Geffray of Mombraye walter Common / and
many other that were put out of their heritage in scotlonde when the peace was
made between England and Scotlonde, as before is said And ye shall understand
that these sordes took with them five hundred men of arms. and two thousand
artbers and of footmen. and tho went into ship at Raue^spore / and sailed
by the sea till that they came unto Scotlond. and came to lord at
Kynkehorne.xii. mile fro saint Iobannes town / And anon sent out the^shyppes
again / for that they should not be hurt / ne empeyred / neither that no man
should go in to the ships again though that they had need / but abide
alperylles / and not flee but stand / and rather suffer death than flee for
too mayntene their true quarrel. when y^ earl of Fysse. a fyers man and a
stern / herd y^ Bayllol was come / for to take y^ land of scotlo^de / he
came in have to Kynkeborne / with xii. thousand Scotts / for to dyshoye him /
that he should not come to land / But sir Edward Bayllol and his company
there him dyscomfyted at the which dyscomfyture sir Alysander Scton was there
slain / and many other. The earl of Fyffe / was tho sore and full ruyl ashamyd
/ that so little a company bad him dyscomfyted / and shamefully putt him and
all his company that were alive for too flee. Tho came sir Edward Bailloll /
and took the country all about him. till he came unto the abbay of
Du^fermlin. and there he found vitaylles for him and for his folk / and
among all other thing he fond in a chamber about five hundred of great
staves of five oak with long pryckes of yren. and of stele And he took them
and delyuerd them to y^ most strongest men of his company. And anon after he
yede fro thens. and lodged him in a field.ii. miles from saint Johannes town.
And when the burgeys of the town herd how the earl of Fyffe was dyscomfyted
thrughe Baylloll. brake the brydges that they had made over the water of Erne.
so that Bailloll might not go over / wherefore he lodged him there all that
night / but lytyllhede he took of rest. and said unto his people / Now dear
lords ye know full well. y^ we ben now lodged between our enmyes / and they
may us hampre / there is no bote but death. wherefore if we abide still all this
night. I wene it shall torn us to much harm. For the power of Scotlonde may
every wexe and encre^e and we may not so do. And we ben but little people as
against them. Wherefore I pray you for the love of almighty god make we us bold
and hardy / and that we may myghtely take the Scotts this night / and boldly
werre upon them. and let us pursue theyme this night. And if they be
traueylled thorughe us. and see our hardynesse. other Scotts y^ se them so
traueylled and weary: the sorer woll they be adradde with us too fight and
fyersly then shall we fight with them. and on them pursue. so that thrughe
the grace of god / all the world shall speak of the doughtynes of our chyualry.
And syres understands well that all the company that came with sire Robert
Bailloll / granted well unto y^ counsel / and were thereof right glad. and
anon pursued upon the Scotts. that they became wonder weary. And Baillol and
his company sore followed them / and did them much harm and sorrow / through
the r^assente. so that they might not for feblynesse them help / and for lytyl
people. But tho said the Scotts among them / what is now befall that so
little a people as Bailloll has in wyng does us so much traueyll and sorrow
/ Now certes it semyth us that he werketh by grace / for he is wonder gracyous
in his quarrel and we certes shall be deed or that we may come to him. us for
too yield. sith that his fader set of us no price. And among al other things
Bailloll and his people passed the water of Erne so that Robert Swynerton the
sone was fyers and angrye / and went forth and they saw people of arms full
well arrayed. and forth they went unto them and with them faught. and slew and
took as many as would abide: And netheles at that assawte they wend it had be
the great host of Scotlonde. And when it came to the morrow. they gadred them
together / and restyd them a while / And while y^ Englysshmen rested the / y^
noble baron. Thomas Vescy / and y^ noble baron / Stafforde / pryckyd their horse
up and down by ye hills / for to keep y^ estrees of y^ country / And as they
piyckyd up and down. they saw a great host of good array ordained in rheyr
wings / with helmes and sheldes shynynge / coming upon the^ And then came tho
two barons again unto Bayllols folk / and said. Now for y^ love of god almighty
be of good co^forth for ye shall have battle anon right / And tho spoke sire
Fouk the sone of Garenne. a baron of great renown and of dedys of armies /
Syres understood what I will say / I have seen many diverse wings / as well
among sarrasins and Jews / as among the Scotts / and yet saw I never she
fourth part of the wynge fight. and therefore yt ye will abide our enmyes / we
ben enough for the^. But if we be not of good heart and of good rourage we ben
but lost. And therefore for the love of god. take to us good heart / and let us
be bold / and think we never of our wives ne of our children / but only to
conquer our enmyes in battle. and thrughe y^ help of our lord we shall the^
over come. And with y^ came y^ host of ye scotts toward them full serely /
and ayenste sir Edward Bayllol in three batayles well arrayed in armoure / And
wonder fyersly they came toward the Bayllos company / But when sir Donald Earl
of Marcell that was with the Scotts / saw all this / he said unto Robert Brus
the sone of Robert the Brus these words / Sire Roberte said he / fulle sore me
forthynkyth at my heart / that these people that Bayllol has brought with
him should deye with dynt of Scotts swerdes / sith that they ben christian men
as we ben / And therefore me thynkyth y^ it were great charity / for to send
unto them / for to yield them / unto our mercy / and raunsomme them unto
grievous raunsomme / for as much as they have taken our lands and done yll'
Now certes said sir Robert y^ Brus / I have well perceived / that thou art an
enmye and a traitor unto Scotlonde / sithe y^ thon will consent to save our
dedelt enmyes / y^ have done us much sorrow and shame / and now it semyth well
y^ ye be of there assent. Now certes Robert said sir donald / falsely ye lie. I
am not of their company ne of their consent / and y^ hastyli ye shall se / for
I will fyzte with them rather than any of this company / and certes sire Robert
said he I shall in maugre of thy head assayll them or y^. And with y^ they
pryckyd their stedys fyersly upon Gaskemore: and their wynge them followed on a
renge. And tho came they and met with Bayllol and his company at an
hanging bough of the moore in a strait passage and so fast they hastyd the^
unto the Englysshmen that thousands fell onto the ground echone over upon
other into an hepe both horse and man Bayllol and his men myghtylye stood
ayenste them / and fast slew the Scotts too the ground / and many they
sore wounded / so long / tylle that they stood upon them / and foyned them
with their swerdes and speres thrughe their bodies / and full sore they were
trauaylled upon them / tylle that they became wonder weary / nnd wyste notte
what for to do / And the Scotts that were left alive / fled away / for to
save theymselfe in the best manner that they might And thoo pursued them sir
Edward Bayllol and his men / and slew of theym^yll it was night. And froo
thens they went too saint Johannes town / and took it: and held the^ there /
and v^^aylled the^self at there own will / for the^ found ye^ ough where with to
make merry. Tho made Bayllol his men y^ were wounded go to ship / to sayll into
england to he^e there wou^des. and in y^ time there was a fle^m^^ge in y^ see.
a strong theyf. and a ^obber y^ was called crab. and this fle^my^ge was driven
out of Flau^dres for his wickidnesse and therefore he came into scotlo^de. to
hold with y^ scotts / and did as much harm to the English men as he might
doo^ And this Crabbe met Bayllols men in y^ see y^ were wounded before in
batayl y^ were sent again into England. for to bele their wou^des. and this
crabbe yaaf to them a great assawee. and would have slain them euerycho^e.
But the Englys^shmen defended them well and manli and discomfyted Crabbe and
his companys and tho began he fle into Scotlonde. And as he came toward saint
Ioha^nes town / he found a great company of Scotts / y^ were come again
together after the dysc^^yture at Gaskemore. y^ which by seyged Bayllol and his
men in y^ sa^^^ town of saint John^. And anon told the Scotts how that he
was discomfyted of the Englysshmen / y^ were wou^dyd at Gaskemore / that went
toward England / for to heel their wounds / And said to the Scotts / y^
they should have another power ne might ne grace against Edward Bayllol / by
cause that he scomfyted / and empeyred all y^ chyualri of Scotlonde with a
handful of men as to compte ayenste y^ Scotts y^ were slain. wherefore he
cou^seylled to remeue the sege from saint Johannes town / and keep them in y^
best manner that they might. The Scotts understood that Crab said sothe /
forsook the sege and went thens by night. when this thing was know through
Scotlonde how that the lords and knights were dyscomfyted at Gaskemore of
Scotlonde through sire Edward Bayllol / ye shall understand y^ the lords and
ladies / and y^ gentyls of scotlonde came wonder fast to saint Ioha^nes town
/ and yeldyd them unto Bayllol. and to him did homage and feautee for their
lands and yield them to his peace and he them received freely / And fro the^s
he went to the abbaye of Scone. and there he was crowned king of Scotlonde /
and after he let cry his peace thrughe out / all the land. And at that same
time it befell that king Edward held his parlemente among his lyeges at
the new castle upon Tyne / for to amend the trespaces and the wrongs / that
had been done in his land. And sir Edwar / de Bayllol king of Scotlonde came
to him thither / and did to him homage and feautee / for the reame of
Scotlonde. And in this manner king Edward of England gadred again his homages
and feautees of Scotlonde / whereof he was put out / through counseyll and
assent of dame Isabell his mother / and of sir Roge Mortimer earl of March /
Tho took Bayllol king of Scotlond his leave of king Edward of England / and
went thens into his own land of Scotlonde and set but little by such as
had counseylled him / and helped him in his quarrel / wherefore they went from
him / and went and lived by their own lands and rentes in scotlonde. And sote
befell afterward not long / y^ the king of Scotlonde neremeued and came to
the toure of Anande and there took his dwelling / and thither came to him a
company of knights. strong men and worthy / and yielded them unto the king.
And bare them so fair in deed and in cou^tenau^ce / so that he trustyd much
upon them And anon as the traitors saw that he trustyd much upon them /
they ordained among them fyfty in a company / and would have slain their
lord the king / But thragh the grace of almighty god / he brake through a wall
an hole in his chamber / and as god would scapyd their treachery / and all his
men were slain / and he escaped with much dread unto the town of Cardoyll /
And there he held him sore anoyed. And this befell upon our ladies even the
concepcyo^ Tho sent king Edward Bayllol to king Edward of England / how
falsely and traytoursly he was in little time / put to shame and sorrow through
his lyege men / upon whom he trustyd wonder much. and prayed him for the love
of god y^ he would mayntene hy^ and help hy^ against his enmies. The king of
Englo^ had of him great pity / and behyght to help him and socour him. And
sent hy^ word / y^ he should hold him in peace still in y^ foresaid cite of
Cardoyll / till y^ he had gadred his powere. Thoo ordained king Edward of
England a counseyll at London / and let gadre his men in diverse shyres of
England. and when he was all ready / he went toward y^ tow of Berwyk upon
Twede / and theder came to him king Edward Bayllol of Scotlonde with his
powee / and beseged y^ town / And made without the town a fair town of

of the town / that they might have peace of the Englysshmen and thereof they
prayed the king of his grace and mercy / And prayed him of trewes for viii.

they prouffred too the king.xii. hostages out of the town of Berwyk. when y^

pryuery over the water of Twede to y^ bought of y^ abbaye. and sire wyllyam

which at that battle shot arowes so fast and so sore: that y^ Scotts might
not help themself. And the^ (...) the Scotts thousands unto he ground. And

pylfre of the Scotts that were slain / every man that he might take: without
any chalengynge of any man. And so after this gracyous vyctory. the king tornyd
him again unto the same syege of Berewyk / And when they be syeged saw and
herd how king Edward had spedde / they yielded to him the town with the
castle / on y^ morrow after saint Margaretes day. And then the king did

beyond the sea. But such as might spend an hundred pound of re^te by year.
But this ordinance and statute was but of little effect / for it was no thing
holden. In the xiii. year of his regne king Edward went over see in to Braban
with queen Philyp his wife there berynge a child at And werpe there he dwelled
more than a year for to treat with the duke of Braban and other alyed unto him
of the chalengynge of the kingdom of France. to king Edward of England by
right and by heritage after the death of Karoll the great king of France
brother Germayne of queen Isal^^ king Edwardes mother / the which was holden
and occupied unrightful by Phylyp of Valoys the emes sone of king Karoll / y^
which duke and all his in the foresaid things and all otherlongynge there to
with all his men and goods king Edward to^de ready unto him and made and
behyght him suerte by good faith and trust / and after y^ the king hasted him
again into England and left there the queen still be hynde him in Braban. Than
in y^.xiiii year of his regne when all y^ lords of his reame and other that
oughten to be at his parliament were called and assembled together in y^ same
parliament holden at London after y^ feast of saint Hylarye / The kings needs
were put forth and promothed as touching y^ kingdom of France. For which
needs to be spedde y^ king axed y^ fyfte part of all the meuable goods of
England and y^ mulles and y^.ix. sheep of every corn / And all y^ lords of
every town where such things should be taxyd and gadryd should answer too the
king thereof / and had it and held it at his own lust and will. wherefore if I
should knowleche the very truth / the ynner love of y^ people was turned in
too hate / and the common prayers into cursynge / for cause that the comune
people were so strongely grieved. Also the foresaid Phylyp Valoys of France had
gadred unto him a great host and destroyed in his parties and kingdom / many
of the kings friends of England with towns and castles many other of their
lordshyppes and many harms shamys and dystytes did unto the queen / wherefore
king Edward wha^ he herd this tidings strongly meued therewith and an angered.
and sent diverse letters over see to the queen and to other y^ were his
friends. gladynge them certefienge them that he would be there himself in all
the have y^ he might. And anon after Ester when he had sped of all things y^
him neded to have / he went over set again. Of whose coming y^ queen and all
his friends were wonder gladd and made much Joy And all that were his enmyes
and held against him made as much sorrow. In the same time the king through
counseyll of his trewelyeges and counseyll of his lords that there were
present with him write the king of Fraunces name / and took and meddled the
kings arms of France quartred with tharmes of England / and commanded
forth with his coyen of gold under discrypcyon and writynge of y^ name of
England and of France to be made best that might be / and y^ is too say
y^ floreyne y^ was called y^ nobell price of.vi. shelly^ge vii. pens sterlynge
/ and y^ half nobell y^ valuc.iii. shellynge and iiii. pens / and y^
farth^^ges the value of.xx. pens.

How king Edward come unto the scluys and dyscomfyted all the powere of
France in the haven.
ANd in the next year after^that is to say the.xv. year of his regne he
commanded and let write in his chartres wryttes and other letters the date of
the regne of France the first. And w^yle that he was thus doing and
trauayllynge in France thrughe his counseyll he wrote to all the prelates
dukes earls and barons and the noble lords of the country / and also too
diverse of the comune people diverse lettres and mau^dementes berynge date at
Gandaut the.viii. day of February. And anon after within a little time he
came again into England with the queen and her children. And in the same year on
mydsomer even he began to saylle toward France again and manly and fyersly he
fell upon Philyp of Valoys the which long time lay and had gadryd to hy^ a
full long and boystous meny of diverse nacyons in y^ haven. of Scluys / and
there they foughten together y^ king of France and he with their hosts fro
myddaye to three of y^ clock in the morn / in the which battle were slain
xxx. thousand men of the kings company of France / and many ships and
cogges were taken. And so through gods help he had there y^ uyctorye. and
bear thens a glorious chyualrye And in the same year abowte saint James tide
without the yates of saint Omers robert of Arthoys with men of England and
Flaundres faught against the duke of Burgon and the Frensshmen / at which
battle were slain and take of y^ Frensshmen. xv barons and.lxxx. knyghts /
and ships and barges were take unto y^ nombre of.CC. and.xxx. The ^ame year
y^ king making and abiding upon the sege of tornay y^ earl of Henaude with
English archers made assaute unto y^ town of saint Amande where they slew.
^knightes and many other and also destroyed the town. And in y^.xvi year of
his regne following in y^ winter time the king dwelled stylle upon the foresaid
seyge and sent oftyme into England unto his tree sorer and other purueyours for
gold and money y^ should be sent unto him there in his need / but his
proctours and messyngers cursedly and full clously served hy^ at his need and
deceived him / on whoos defaute and latches the king took trewes between him
and the king of France / And then king Edward full of shame and sorrow in
his heart withdrew hy^ fro the sege and come into Brytayne and there was so
great strive of vatayll y^ he lost many of his people. And wha^ he had done
there that he come for he dressyd hy^ over see into England ward. And as he
saylled toward England in the high see the most myshappes storms and
tempests thondre and lyghtnynge fell to him in the sea / the which was said
that it was done and araysyd thrughe evil spyrytees made by sorcery and
nygromancye of the^ of France / wherefore the kings heart was full of sorrow /
and anguisshe welly^ge and syghynge and said unto our lady in this wise.
Oblessyd lady saint Mary what is y^ cause y^ ever more going into France all
things and wethers fallen to me Joyful and liking and as I would have them /
but always tornynge into England ward all thyges fallen unprofitable and very
harmfull neuersheles he scapyd all perils of the sea as god would / and came
to the tour of London by night. And the same year the king held his Crystmas
at Meneres and sent word to the Scotts by his messyngers y^ he was ready and
would do fight with them: but the Scotts would not abide y^ but fled over
the Scotts se and hyd them as well as they might And in y^: xvii. year of his
regne about the feast of the Co^uersyon of saint poul king Edward when he
had been in Scotlonde and saw y^ the Scotts were fled tho he come again
into England And a little before lent was the turnement at Dunstable / to the
which turnement come all the young bachelary and chyualry of England with
many other earls and lords. At the which turnement king Edward himself
was the re present. And the next year following in the.xviii. year of his regne
at his parliament holden at westmynster the auyzeme of Paske king Edward y^
third made Edward his first sone prince of walys. And in the.xix. year of
his regne anon after in Ianyuer before le^te the same king Edward let make
full noblle Iustes and great feestes in the place of his birth at wyndesore y^
there was never none such seen therafore. At which feast and ryaltee were two
kings and two queen's y^ prince of walys / the duke of Cornewayle.x. Earls.ix.
Countesses barons and many burgeys the which might not lightly be nombred /
and of diverse lands beyond the sea were^ many strangers. And at the same
time when y^ Iustes were done. king Edward made a great souper in y^ which he
ordened and began his round, table and ordened and stedfasted the day of the
round table to be holden there at wyndesore in y^ Wytsone weke ever more
yearly. And in this time Englysshmen so much haunted and cleuyd to the woodnes
and folly of she strangers / y^ from time of coming of Henaudees.xviii. year
passed they ordained and changed them every year diverse shappes and
dysguysynge of clothing of long large and wide clothes destitute and dyserte
from all old honest and good usage. And an other time short clothes and
strayt wastyd dagged and kyt and on every side slatered and botomed with sleues
and tapytis of surcotes and hodes over long and ouermoche hanging / y^ if I
the sothe shall say they were more like too tormentours and deuyls in their
clothyng and shoynge and other array than to men and the wymen more nycely yet
passed y^ me^ in array and curyouslyer / for they were so strayt clothed y^
they let hang foretayles sewed byneth within there clothes for to feel and
hyde their arses / the which dysguysynges and pride parauenture / afterward
brought forth and caused many mysshappes and myscheyf in y^ reame of England.
The.xx. year of king Edward he went over into Brytayne and Galcoyne. in whose
company went the earl of warwyk / y^ earl of Suffolk. the earl of Huntyngton
and the earl of Arundell / and many other lords and comune people in a great

such a vyctory after their great labor taken to them all thing needful to
their sustynau^ce / and saving of their lives / and for dread of their enmyes

How king Edward besyeged Calays and how it was won and yolden unto him.
IN the.xxii. year of king Edwardes regne he went over the sea in the winter
time and lay all the winter at the syege of Calays / the which year while the
syege lasted and endured Philyp the king of France cast and purpoysed
traytourously and with fraud to put a wa ye the syege and came y^.xxvii. day
of Iuyl ^ y^ same year with a great host and a strong power and neyghed to
y^ sege of Calays. The which Phylip y^ last day of Iulii. sent to y^ king
Edward word y^ he would give him plain battle the third day after y^
about euensonge time if he durst come fro the syege and abide. And when king
Edward herd y^ without any long taryenge or long auysement accept gladly
y^ day and hour of battle y^ Philyp had assygned. And when y^ king of
France herd y^ / the next night after he set his tentys a fire and remeued
and went his way thens cowardely. Then they y^ were in y^ town and in the
castle besyeged saw all this that they had none other help ne socour of y^
king of France ne of his men. And also y^ their vytayls within the^ were
spended and wastyd and for fault of vytayls and of tefresshynge they eten
horses hou^des cattes and myse for to keep their troth as long as they
might. And when they saw and was found among them at the last that they had
no thing among them for to ete ne live by ne no socoure ne rescowe of the
Frensshmen / of y^ other side they wist well y^ they must needs deye for
defaute or else yield y^ town / and anon they went and took down y^ baners
and the arms of France on every side y^ were hangen out and went on the
walls of y^ foresaid town on diverse places as naked as ever they were borne
sauf only their shertes and their preuy clothes / and held their swerdes naked
and the point do^^warde in their hondes / and putten ropes and halters about
there necks and yielded up the keys of y^ town and of the castle to king
Edward of England with great fere and dread of their lives and gods and
dread of heart / And when king Edward saw all this as a mercyable king and
lord received them to grace / and a few of y^ grettest prisoners of estate
and of governance of y^ town he sent intoo England there for to abide their
rau^son and the kings grace. And all the commynalte of the town the king let
goo wheder they would in peace and without any harm / and let them bear with
them all their things that they might bear and carye away / keeping the town
and the castle to himself. Then through meditacyon of Cardynales that were
sent from the pope / trewes was ^^ke there between France and England
for.ix. months than next following And about Myghelmas king Edward come again
into England with a glorious vyctory. And in the.xxiii. year of his regne. in
the E^st parties of y^ ^worlde there arose and began a pestylence ^ death of
Sarasyns and Paynyms that so great a death was never herd of a fore / and
that wasted away the people so that uneath the tenthe person was left alive.
And the same year abowte the southe countrees and also in the west countrees
there fell so much rain and so great waters y^ from Crystmas to mid somer
there was uneaths nos day ^enyght but y^ it rayned somewhat through which
waters y^ pestylence was so enfted and so habu^dante in all countre^ and namely
acout y^ court of Rome. and other places and see costs y^ uneath there were
left living folk for to bury them y^ were deed honestly. But made great
dyches and pytt^ y^ were wonder broad and deep and therein buried the^ / and
made a re^ge of deed bodies and cast a little earth to feel the^ above / and
than cast in a another renge of bid bodies / and an other renge above them /
and thus were they buried and none otherwys^ / but if it were so that they were
men of great estate so that they were buried as honestly as they might. And
after all this in the.xxiiii. yereof king Edwardes regne it was done hy^ to
wete and understand of a treason that was begone at Calays and ordained for to
sell y^ town for a great sum of Florens unto king Phylip of France
thrughe y^ flasnesse and ordinance of a knight that was called sir Geffrey of
Cherney was wonder preuy with king Phylyp of France. And when king Edward
herd this he took with him y^ noblest and ge^tyllest lords and many other
worthy me^ of arms y^ were there present with him for the solempnyte of y^ high
fest. And well and wisely in all y^ have y^ he might / and as pryuely as he
might he went over se toward Calays. And y^ same year y^ good king Edward
held his Ceystmas at Hauerynge. and y^ morn after new years day y^ king
was in y^ castle of Calais with his men of arms that none of the alyens wist
thereof. And that falls conspiratour and traytoure Geffrey of Cherney sith that
he might not openly have his purpose of the castle pryuely and stely^ gely he
come in and held y^ towen with a great have. And when he with his men were comen in
/ he paid y^ foresaid so^me of floreyns as covenant was to a Geneweye in the
town that was keeper of y^ castle and consenting to the same Geffreye in all
his falsnesse and trechorye and bou^ den the Englyssh mynstrels and seruau^^es
that were in the castle y^ they might not help themself ne let the^ of
their purpos. And than wenynge y^ they had been sure enough / then they spaken
all their wyckydnesse and falsnesse openly on high that all men might here. And
now shall ye here how they were deceived / for they came in by a pr^uy posterne
over a little bridge of tree / and when they were comen in subtyly and pryuely
y^ bridge was drawn up and kept that none of the^ that came in might go out
neno mo might come to the^ / and anon our Englysshmen went out at preuy holes
and wyndowes and (...) y^ walls of the town and of the castle and went and
taught manly with y^ Frensshmen y^ were with out and had che better of the^ / y^
which when they were occupied by the^self on their side / the king y^ was with
in y^ town having scarsely but.xxx. men of arms drew out his sword and with
a loud voys he cried on high. O saint Edward. A saint G^orge. And when y^
people herd y^ / they come rennynge to him and gaaf there to their enmyes so
great assawte y^ there were mo than two hundred men of arms and many mo other
slain and many fled away. And so by y^ grace of god alimighty the vyctory
fell unto the Englysshemen. Then the king took with him this Geffray y^ was
fynder of this trechory / and also many other Frenssh prisoners / and then
within a while after he come again into England. and in this same year and in
the year before and alsoo in the year next following was so great a pestylence
of men from the ^^st in to the weste and namely thorughe botches / that thoo
that sykened / as on this day deyed on the third day after / to the which
men that so deyed in this pestylence had but little respyte of lyggynge. The
pope Clemente of his goodness and grace gaaf they us fulle remyssyon and
forgyuenesse of all their sins that they were shiyuen of / and this
pestylence lasted in London fro Myghelmas unto August. next following almoost
an hole year. And these days was death without sorrow / weddy^ges without
frendshyp / wylfull penance / and derth without scharsyte. and fley^ge without
refute or socour. for many fled from place to place because of y^ pestylence
/ but they were enfected and might not escape the death / after that the
prophet Isay says who that flees fro theface of dread he shall fall into
the dyche And he that wyndethe him out of the dyche he shall be hold and tied
(...) a (...) this pestylence was (...) uneaths the tenth (...) people was
left on live. And (...) a wonder thing (...) after y^ pestyle^ (...) in their
heed less (...) had before.

How king Edward had a great battle with Spanyardes in these fast by
^ynchelsee.
ANd in the.xxx. year of his regne about saint Iohn^s day in harvest in y^ see
fast by wynchelse king Edward had a great bataylle with men of Spain where
y^ their ships and nauye lay chain together / y^ other they must fight or
be drenched. and so when all our worthy men of arms and of y^ se costs fast
by wynchelse and romeny were gadred together / and our nauye and ships al ready
to y^ war / y^ Englysshmen met manly and strongly with their enmyes coming
fyersly against them. And wha^ the Spayn^ vessels and nauye were closed all
about / there men might see strong battle on both sides and long during in
y^ which battle was but few y^ faught but they were pytously hurt. And
after y^ battle there were.xxiii ships taken and so y^ Englysshmen had y^
better. And in y^ next year following of his regne. y^ is to say y^.xxvi. year
y^ king through his counsel let ordeyne and make his new money y^ is to say
y^ pe^y y^ grote value of iiii. pens and the half grote of.ii. pens. but it was
of less weight than y^ old (...) be.v. shellynge in y^ pound / And in
y^.xxvii. year of his regne was the great derth of vytayls y^ which was called
y^ (...). And the.xxviii. year of his (...) in y^ parliament holden at (...)
after (...). sir Henry earl of Lancastre was made duke of Lancastre and in this
year (...) so great a drought y^ from the (...) to y^ Monethe of Iuyll there
fell no rayn o^^ there the / wherefore all fruytes seeds and herbs / for the
most part were lost in defaut wherefore come so great disease of men and
beestes and derthe of vytayls in England y^ this land y^ ever before had been
ple^teuous had need y^ time to fe^e vytayls and refresshynge at other out (...)
and cou^tres. And the.xxix. year of king Edward it was accorded granted and
sworn between y^ king of France and king Edward of England y^ he should
have a yen all his lond^ and lordshyppes y^ longed to y^ duchye of Guyhen of
old time y^ which had been with drawn and wrongfully occupied by diverse kings
of France before hand to have and to hold to king Edward and to his heirs
and successors for ever more. freely peasybly and in good quyete upon this
covenant y^ the king of England should leave of and releasen all his right and
claim that he had claymed of y^ kingdom of France and of y^ (...) he took
thereof / upon which (...) couenau^tes it was sent to y^ (...) Rome on both
sides of y^ kings (...) foresaid covenant should be (...) god ordained better
for the kings ^^^shyp of England. for what through fra^de and dysceyte of the
Frensshmen? what thrughe lettynge of the pope and of the court of Rome the
foresaid couenauntes were dysquate and left of. And in the same year the king
revoked by his w^ se and dyscrete counseylle / the staple of wulles out of
Flaundres into England with all the lybertees fraunches and fre customs that
longed thereto and ^deyned it in England in diverse places / y^ is for to say
at westmystre / Caunterbury. Chychestre. Brystowe. Lyncoln. and Hulle with all
the foresaid things that longen thereto. And y^ ^hys thing that should thus be
done the king swo^^ hy^self thereto / and prince Edward his sone with other
many great wyenesses y^ ther^ were present. And the.xxx. year of his regne
anon after wytsontyde in the parleamente ordained at westmenstre it was told
and certefyed to y^ king y^ Phylyg y^ held y^ kingdom of France was deed.
and y^ Ioh^^ his sone was crowned king. and y^ this John^ had given Karoll his
sone y^ duchye of Guyhen. of y^ which thing king Edward when he wist thereof
/ he had great Indygnaco^n unto him and was wonder wroth and strong ly meued.
And therefore before all y^ worthy lords y^ there were assembled at that
parliament / called Edward his sone unto him / to whom y^ duchye of Guyhen by
right heritage should long to / and gat it him there / bidding and strenthyng
him / y^ he should ordeyne him for to defend him and avenge hy^ upon his
enemies and save and mayntene his right. And afterward king Edward himself
/ and his eldest sone Edward went to diverse places and saints in England on
pilgrimage for too have y^ more help and grace of god and of his saints.
And.ii. kal of Iuyll: when all thing was ready to that vyage and battle and
all his retenue and power assembled and his nauye also ready he took with him y^
earl of warwyk y^ earl of Suffolk y^ earl of Salesbury and the earl of Oxford
and a thousand men of arms and as many archers / and in the Natyuyte of our
lady / took their ships at plu^mouthe and began to sayll. And when he come
and was arrived in Guyon / he was there worshypfully aken and received of y^
most noblest men and lords of that country. And anon afer king Edward
took with him his two sons. that is to say. sir Lyonell earl of Vlton and sir

And wha^ king John^ France herd tell of the kings coming of England / he
went away with his men and caryage cowardly and shamfully fleing and wasting
all vytayls y^ Englysshmen should not have thereof. And when king Edward /
herd tell y^ he fled he pursued him with all his host till Henede / and than
he beholdynge y^ scarsyte and wantynge of vytayls and also y^ cowardyse of y^
king of France he turned again wasting all the country. And while all these
things were a doing / y^ Scotts pryuely and bynyghte. took y^ town of
Berwyksleyng them y^ withstode them and no manels. but blessed be god y^
castle was saved and kept by Englysshmen that were therein when the king
perceived all this / he turned again into England as wroche as he might be /
wherefore in the parleament at westmynster was grauntyd to the king of every

were not sworn before swore that same oath that was written upon gods body and
on the mass book in this wise / we. N. and N: sweren upon gods body and on
the holy gospels steadfastly for to hold and keep toward us the peace and the
accord made between the two kynkes and never for to do the contrary / and when
they had thus sworn they took their scrowes that their oaths were
comprehended into the notaryes. And this same year in the Ascencyons even
about myddaye / was seen the clypses of the son / And there followed such a
drought / that for defaute of rain there was great brennynge of corn fruit
and hey / And in the same monethe the.vi. kal of June there fell a sanguyne
rain al most like blood at Burgon. and a sanguine cross from morn unto
pryme apcrid and was seen at Boloyn in the heir y^ which many men saw / and
after it meued and fell in the mids of the sea. And in the same time in
France and England and many other lands as they that were in plain
countrees and deserte / baren witness suddenly there apperyd two castles / of
the which went out two hoostes of armed men. And that one hooste was closed
in white and that other in black. and when battle between them was begone /

and over come y^ white and after y^ they went again in to their castles: and
than the castles and all y^ host vanysshed away. And in this same year was a
great and an huge pestylence of people and namely of men / whose wives as women
out of governance took husbondes as well strangers as other lewd and simple
people. y^ which forgetynge there honor and worship coupled and married them

deyed Henry duke of Lancastre And also in this same year Edward prince of
walys wedded the countess of Kente that was sire Thomas wife of Holonde the
which was departed sometime and deuorced fro the earl of Salysbury for cause of
the same knight And about this time began and rose a great company of diverse
nasyons gadred togider of whom their leders and governors were English
people / and they were called a people without any head the which did much
harm in the party of France. And not alonge after there arose another
company of diverse nacyons y^ was called y^ white company / the which in y^
parties and countrees of Lombardy did much sorrow. This same year sire John^
of Gaunt the sone of king Edward the third was made duke of Lancaster by
reason and cause of his wife y^ was the daughter and the heir of Henry sometime

mother tongue. And in the same year come in to England three kings y^ is to say
the king of France y^ king of Cypres and y^ king of scotlonde / because to
bysy^^ and for to speak with the king of England. And after y^ they had be

this same year there fell so great a rain in hey time that it wasted and
destroyed both corn and hey. And there was such a debate and fighting of
sparowes by diverse places in these days that me^ found ^nnumerabled deed in
the feldes as they went. And there fell also such a pestylence yt never was
seen such in no man's days yt than lived / for men y^ went to bed hole and
in good point so deynly they deyed. Also y^ time a seek nes y^ men call y^

Edward of England / the which Richard king Ry charde of Amory can heueden
at y^ tount stone after whom he was called Richard. And this same Richard
when his fader was deed and king Edward also / he was crowned king of Englon
de the.xi. year of his aege thrughe right line and heritage and also by the
comune assent and desire of the comynalte of the reame. About this time at
king Edwardes commandment of England when all the castles and towns were
yolden too him y^ long were holden in France by a great company assembled to
gyder sire Bartram Claykyn a nobled knight and a good warryour went and
purposed him to put out Pers king of Spain out of his kingdom with help of

led and use a sinful life / y^ which Pers smyten with dread of this tydynge
fled into Gascoyne to pry^ce Edward for to have socoure of him. And when he was
fled out of Spain Henry his brother y^ was a bastard by assent of y^ most
party of Spain and through help of yt ferefull company y^ I spoke of first was
crowned king of spain: and y^ no^bre of yt same co^pani was rekened and set

there come a great company and a nauye of y^ Danes gadred them together in the
North see purposyng the^ to come into England to reave and too rob and also
to sle with whom they cou^tred and met in the se. maryners and other good

they were sole^ply wedded and about y^ Natyuyte of our lady y^ same duke of
Melai ne deyed. And in y^ same year y^ Frensshe men brake y^ peace and y^ trewes
rydyng on y^ kings ground and lordshyp of England in y^ shyre and country of
Pou^tyfe / and toke^ and held castle and towns / and bear y^ Englyssh men on
hand falsely and subtle y^ they were cause of breky^ge of trewes. and in this
same year deyed y^ duches of Lancastre and is buried worshypfully in saint
Poules church. The.xliiii. year of king Edwardes regne was y^ grettest
pestyle^ce of men and of great bestes and by y^ great falling of waters yt
fell at yt time / there fell great hyndrynge and destroyenge of corn in so
much yt ye next year after a busshell of whete was sold for.xl. pens. And in
this same year about y^ last end of Maykyng Edward held tho his parliament at
westmyster / in which parliament was treated and spoken of y^ oath and trewes
that was borken between him and the king of France and how he might best be
avenged upon his wrong. In this same year in y^ Assu^pcyon of our lady deyed
queen Philyp of England a full noble and good lady / and at westmyster full
worshypfully is buried and entered. And about mydsomer y^ duke of Lancastre and
the earl of Herforde with a great company of knights went into France where
as they gate them but little worship and name / for there was a great hooste
of y^ Frensshmen upon Calkhull bridge / and an other host of Englysshmen fast
by y^ same bridge y^ long time had lived there. And maniworthy and great men
of England ordei ned and yaf counsel for to fight and yaf battle to y^
Frensshmen but y^ foresaid lords would not consent thereto for no manner thing.
And anon after it hap ned y^ the earl of warwyk come thyderwarde for to
war / and when y^ Frensshe men herd of his coming or y^ he came fully to
land they left their senses and pauylyons with all their vytayls and sled and
went away pryuely. And when y^ earl was comen to land with his men he went in
all have toward Normandye and deshored y^ isle of Caur with strenth of sword and
thrughe fire. But alas in his reformynge to England ward home again at Calays
he was taken with sykenes of pestylence and deyed not leuynge behind hy^ after
his days so noble a knight of arms. In which time reigned and warted y^ noble
knight sir John^ ^^^wkewod y^ was an Englysshman borne / having (...) at his
governance y^ white company (...) foresaid. y^ which o time against (...)
^^^che and an other time against lord (...) and ordained great batayls and there
in (...) me country he did many merueylleu^ things. And about y^ (...) of
saint Poule y^ king when he had ended and done y^ entering and crequyes with
^^^te costs and ryaltees about y^ scpule^^e and buryenge of quence Phylip his
wife (...) held a parliament at westmyster (...) ^^^che parlem^t was ared of y^
clergre (...) years dyme that is for to say a greedy me to be paid three year
during And the clargye put it of and would not (...) it unto Ester next
coming and (...) they granted well that in three (...) certain terms y^ dyme
should be (...) and also of the lay fee was a three year (...) granted to the
king.

How sir Robert Knolles with other certain lords of y^ teame went over sent to
France and of their governance.
ANd in the.xlv. year of king Edward in y^ begyunynge king Edward with
unwise counsel and indiscreet borrowed a great so^me of gold of y^ prelaces
merchants and other tyche men of his reame saying y^ it should be spended in
defending of holy church and of his reame. Netheles it profyted nothy^ge /
wherefore about mydsomer after he made a great host of y^ worthyest men of his
reame. Among whom weresome lords yt is for to say y^ lord Fytzwater and y^
lord grau^son and other worthy knights of which knyghes y^ kygne ordained sir
Robert Knolles a proved knyzt and a well assayd in deeds of arms for to be
governor / and y^ through his cou^seyl and governance all thing should be
governed and dressed. And when they come into France as long as they dwelled
and held them hole together y^ Frensshmen durst not fall upon the^. And at the
last about the begy^ nynge of winter for envy and couetyse y^ was among them
/ and also dyscorde they sondred and parted the^ into diverse co^panyes
unwisely and folely. But sir Robert Knolles and his men went and keped them
sauf within a castle in Brytayne. And when y^ Frensshmen saw yt over men and
felaushyp were divided into diverse co^panyes and places not holding ne
strengthynge them togyders as they out for to do they fell fyersly on our men
/ and for y^ most party took the^ or slew them. and tho y^ they might take
led with them prisoners. And in the same year pope Vibane come fro Rome to
Auynyon for this cause y^ he should accord and make peace between y^ king of
France and the king of England for evermore. But alas or he began his
treates he deyed with sickness y^.xxi. day of Decembre / and was buried as for
y^ time in the cathedral chir che of Auynyon fast by y^ high awter. and the
next year after when he had lain so his bones were taken out of the earth and
buried new in the abbaye of saint vyctorye fast by Marcyle / of y^ which
abbaye he was sometime abbot himself. And in both places y^ he was buried in /
there be many great miracles done and wrought through the grace of almighty god
to many a man's help and to the worship of god almighty. And after whom
followed next and was made pope Gregorye Cardynalle Deken that before was called
Pyers Roger. In this same ye re the cite of Lymoge rebelled and faught ayenste
the prince as other cytes did in Guyhen for great taxes costages and raunsons
that they were put and set to by prince Edward / which charges were
importable and to chargeable / wherefore they turned fro him and fellen to y^
king of France. And when prince Edward saw this he was sore chafed and
agreued / and in his tornynge homewarde again into England with sore
scarmusshes and fighting and great assautes fought with them and took the
foresaid cite and destroyed it almoost to the ground and slew all that he
found in the cite. And than for to say the soth for diverse sekenes and
maladyes that he had and also for defaute of money that he might not withstand
ne tarry on his enmyes he hyed him again into England with his wife and menye
leuynge be hynde in Gascoyne the duke of Lancastre and sir Edmonde earl of
Cambrydge with other worthy and noble men of arms. In the.xlvi. year of king
Edward at the ordinance and sendynge of king Edward / the king of Nauerne
come to him to Claryngdon to treat with him of certain things touching his
war in Normandye where king / Edward had left certain syeges in his stead
till he come again. But king Edward might not speed of that that he asked him.
And so the king of Nauerne with great worship y^ great gifts took his leave
and went home again. And about begy^nynge of March wha^ y^ parliament at
westmyster was begone y^ king asked of y^ clergy a subsydye of.l.M pound y^
which by a good auysement and by a general co^uocaco^n of y^ clergy it was
granted and ordained y^ it should be paid and raised of y^ lay fee. And in
this parliament at y^ request and asking of the lords in hatred of men of holy
church. the Chaunceler and the tresourer yt were bishops and the clerk of
the pryue sale. were remeued and put out of office and in their stead were
seculer men put in. And while this parliament lasted there come solemn
embassatours fro y^ pope to trete with the king of peace and said yt the pope
desired to fulfill his predecessors will but for all their coming they sped
not.

Of the besyegynge of Rochell and how the earl of Penbroke and his company was
taken in that haven with Spanyerdes and all his ships burnt.
THe.ix. day of June king Edward in y^.xlvii. year of his regne held his
parliament at wynchestre and it lested but.vii. days / to y^ which parliament
were sompned by write of men of holy church.iiii. bysshoppes and.iiii.
abbottes without any moo. This parlemente was holde^ for merchants of London
of Norwyche and of other diverse places in diverse things and points of
treason y^ they were defamed of / y^ is to say y^ they were rebel and would
arise against y^ king this same year y^ duke of Lancastre and the earl of
Lambrydge his brother come out of Gascoyne into England and took and wed ded
to their wives Peter's daughters so^ time king of Spain Of which two
daughters y^ duke had y^ elder y^ the earl the younger. And yt same time there
were sent two Cardynals fro y^ pope / yt is to say an English Cardynall and
a Cardynall of Paris to treat of peace between these two reames / y^ which wha^
they had been both long each in his prouynce and countries fast by treatyng of
y^ foresaid peace / at the last they took with them y^ lettes of procuracye y^
went again to Rome without any effect of their purpose. In this year was there a
shronge battle in y^ se between Englysshmen and Flemynges and the Englysshmen
had the vyctory and took.xxv. shypps with salt and sleynge and drenchynge all y^
men y^ were therein vnwetynge them they were of y^ country. And much harm
should have fallen thereof had not peace and accord sone be made between the^.
And in this same year the Frensshmen besyeged the town of Rochell wherefore y^
earl of Pe^broke was sent into G^scoyn with a great company of men of arms for
to dys troy y^ syege / which passed y^ se and came sauf to y^ haven of
Rochell y^ when they were there at y^ haven mouth or y^ they might enter /
suddenly come upon them a strong nauye of Spanyerdes (...) which overcome y^
Englysshmen in much blemysshynge hurtynge and sleynge of many people for as
much as the (...) men were than notredy for to (...) were ware of them. And
as the (...) yerdes came upon them all the Englysshmen other they were taken o^
(...) and.x. of them were sore wounded t^^ the death and all their ships
(...) and there they took the earl with a great tresour of the reame of
England and many other noble men also on (...) somer eueu y^ which is saint
Edeld^^ day and led them with them into Spne. And of this myscheyf was no
great wonder for this earl was a fulle ylle l^uer as an open lechoure. And
also in a certain parliament he stood and was a yenst the ryghtes and
frau^chyle of holy church. And also he counseylled the king and counseylle
that be should are mo of men of holy church thanne other persons of the lay
men. And for the king and other men of his counteyll accepted and took rather
ylle opy^^ons and causes ayenste men of holy church than he did for too
defend and mayneene the right of holy church it was after seen many times for
lack of fortun^ and grace they had not ne bare always so great vyctory ne
power ayenste their enemies as they did before. This same year y^ king with a
great hooste entered these to remeue the syege of Rochelle / but the wind was
ever contrary unto him and suffered him not a long time to go fer fro y^ land
/ wherefore he abode a certain time upon y^ see costs abiding after a good
wind for them and yet come it not So at y^ last he come thens with his me^ to
land ward again and anon as he was a land y^ wind began for to torn and was
in an other cost than he was before.

How y^ duke of Lancastre with a great host went into Flau^dres and passed by
Paris through Burgon and through all france till he come unto Burdeux.
SOane after in the.xlviii. year of the regne of king Edward the duke of
Lancastre with a great power went into Flau^dres and passed by Paris through
Burgon and through all France til he come unto Burdeux without any manner
withstanding of y^ Frensshmen / and he did them but little harm sauf he took
and ra^^oned many places and towns and many men and let them go after
freely. The same year y^ king set certain ambassatours to y^ pope prayenge him
y^ he should leave of and meddle not in his court of the keeping and reseruacyons
of benefyces in England. and that tho y^ were those^ to bysshoppes sees and
dygnetees freely and with full might Joy and have and be confermed to y^ same of
their metropolytans and Archbysshops as they were wont to be of old time. Of
these points and of other touchy^ge the king and his reame / when they had
their answer of y^ pope / the pope enjoined them y^ they should certefy him a
yen by their letter of the kings will and of his reame or they determined
ought of the foresaid artycles. In this same year deyed John^ the Archebysshop
of york / John^ bishop of Ely / wyllyam bishop of worcestre. In whose stedes
followed and were made bishops by auctoryte of y^ pope. master Alexander
Neuyll to y^ Archbysshopryche of york / Thomas of Aru^dell to the bysshopryche
of Ely. and sir Henry wakfelde to the bysshopriche of worcestre. In the which
time it was ordained in the parliament y^ all Cathedral chirches should Joy and
have their elecco^ns hole and yt the king fro y^ time afterward should not
writ against them y^ were chosen / but rather help them by his letters to
their confirmaco^n / and this statute did much profit And in this parliament
was granted to the king a dyme of the clergy and a.xv. of lay fee. In
the.xlix. of y^ regue of king Edward deyed master wyllyam wytlesey
Archebysshop of Canterbury / and the monks of the same church asked and
desired a Cardynall of England to be Archbysshop. and therefore y^ king was
agreued and meant and purposed to have exyled y^ monks of y^ same. And they
spended much good or they might have the kings grace again and his love but
yet would y^ king not consent ne grant to their eleccyon of the Cardynalle
ne of the pope alsoo ne his Cardynales. And at the beginning of Auguste it
was treated and spoken at Bruges of certain points / and artycles hanging
between the pope and the king of England / and this treates lasted almooste
tho year. And at the last it was accorded between them that the pope fro that
time forth should not use ne dele with the reseruaco^ns of benefyces in England
/ and that the king should not grau^e ne let no benefytes by his writ that
is called (Quare impedit) But as touching the eleccyon above said / there was
no thing touched ne done. And that was wyted and put upon certain clerks
the which rather supposed and hoped to be auau^ced and promoted to
bysshopryches which they desired and coueyted by the court of Rome rather than
by any other eleccyons / This same year about Candelmasse there met togyde
at Bruges many noble and worthy men of both sides and reames to trete of
peace between tho two kings. And this tretes lasted two year with great tostes
and large expenses of both parties. And at the last they went and departed
thens without any accord or effect The next year after y^.l. year of king
edward y^.iiii. Non^ of May being yet void and vacau^t yt Archbysshopryche of
Canterbury master Symonde sudbery bishop of London was made Archbysshop and
master wyllyam courteney y^ was bishop of Herford was tha^ made bishop of
London / and y^ bishop of Bangor was made bishop of Herforde. And this same
time in a certain treates and speky^ge of peace trewes was taken between the^
of France and England fro mydsomer to mydsomer come again an hole year / and
about y^ begy^nynge of Apryll y^ duke of Brytayne with many earls barons and
worthy lords and men of England went over see into Brytayne where he has had
all his lust desire and puropse ne had the foresaid trewes bt so sone taken the
which let the^. This same time y^ isle of Constantyne where y^ the castle of
saint Saueour is in. y^ long time was foughten at and besyeged of y^
Frensshme^ than yield to y^ Frensshmen with all the apportenau^ces into great
harm and hyndry^ge of y^ reame of England. And this same year there were so
great and so passing hetes and therewith all a great pestylence in England
and in other diverse parties of y^ world y^ it destroyed and slew vyolently
and strongly both men and wymen without no^bre. This same year deyed sir
Edward y^ lord spencer a worthy knight and abolde and in y^ mynster of
Teukesbury worshipfully is buried. And lasting this pestilence y^ pope at y^
instau^ce and prayer of an English Cardynale granted to all people y^ deyed
in England y^ weresory and repentau^te for their sins and also shryuen full
remyssyon by two bulls under led.vi. months than next to last. In this
same year the earl of Penbroke was taken and cas^^oned by Bartram Claykyn
between Patys and Calays as he come toward England upon saint Atheldredes
day y^ which saint as it was said y^ earl oftentimes had offended and within
a little while after he deyed / And in Nouembre next after there met at
Bruges the duke of Lancastre and the duke of Angoy with many other lords and
prelates of both reames for to treat of peace.

Of the death of prince Edward and of the lord Latymer and dame ^^^^peres
through whom and her maynte / ners the reame many a day was (...) governed.
'NOt long after the.li. year of ^^^ge Edward regne he (...) ne and hold at
westmyster y^ greetest ^^^ment y^ was seen many (...) y^ which parliament he
asked of ^^^^naite of y^ reame as he had done (...) fendynge of him and of his
reame (...) comunes answered y^ they were so often (...) by day grieved and
charged with so many talages and subsydyes y^ they might no^^ger suffer no
such bu^chons charges and that they knew and wist well enough y^ the king had
enough for saving of him and of his reame of the reame were well and truly
governed but that it had be so long evil governed by ylle of fycers that the
reame might another he plenteuous of chaffre and marchau^dyse ne also with
richesse. And in these things they profred themself if the king would
certainly to preue it and stand by. and if it were founden and preued
afterward that the king had need they would gladlye every man after his power
and state him help and leave. And after this were publysshed and showed in the
parleament many playntes and defautes of diverse officers of the reame and
namely of the lord Latymer y^ kings chambrelayne both to the king and eke
to the reame. And also at the last there was spoken and treated of dame Alyce
pers for the great wrongs and evil governance y^ was done by her counsel
in the reame. the which dame Alyce pers y^ the king had holden long time to
his lemman wherefore it was the less wonder though through y^ trealtee of the
woman's excyty^ge and her sterynge he consented to her lewdenesse and evil
cu^oseyll y^ which dame Alyce and also y^ lord Latymer and other such that
meued the king to evil governance ayenste his profit and the reme also /
all the comynalte asked and desired that they should be remeued and put away
and in their stedes wise men and worthy that were true and well assayd and
proved and of good governance. should be put in their stedes. So among all
other there was one among the comunes that was a wise knight and a true / and
an eloquent man whoos name was Pers delamare. And this same Pe^s was chosen to
be speker for the comunes in the parliament. And for this same Pers told and
publysshed the truth and rehearsed the wrongs against the foresaid dame Alyce
and other certain persons of the kings counseyll as he was bydden by y^
comyns. And also trusting much to be supported and mayntened in this matter by
help and favor of y^ pry^ce anon as y^ pry^ce was deed at y^ instau^ce and
request of y^ foresaid dame alyce / this pers de amare was Iugyd to perpetual
pryso^ in y^ castle of Noty^gha^ And in y^.vi. kal. of Iule lasting y^ same
parliament deyed pry^ce Edward king Edwardes first sone / y^ is to say in
trynyte sunday in worship of which feste he was wont every year where y^
ever he were in the world to hold and made y^ most solempnyte y^ he might.
whose name and fortune of knyghthode but if it had he of an other Ectour all men
both christian and hethen while y^ he lived and was in good point wondered much
and dradd him wonder sore / whose body is worshipfully buried in Crychirche at
Canterbury. And in this same year y^ men and y^ earls tenau^tes of warwyk
arose malycyously against y^ abbot and covent of Euesha^ and their tenau^tes /
and destroyed thabbaye. and the town and wounded and beat their men and slay
many of them / and went too their manners and places and did much harm / and
brake down there parkes and closes and slew their wild bestes and chaced them
brekynge their fysshe pondes and hedes and let the water of their pondes
stews and ryuers run out and took y^ fysshe and bare it with them. and did
them all the sorrow that they might. in so ferforth that forsooth they had
destroyed perpetual yt abbay with all their members and apportenanu^ces but if
the king the sooner had not helped it and taken head thereto. and the^fore y^
king sent his letters to y^ earl of warwyk chargynge him and co^mau^dy^ge him
y^ he should stynt redress and amend tho evil doers and brekers of his peace.
and so by means of lords and other friends y^ peace was made between the^. and
for this hurlynge as it is said y^ king would not be governed at yt time by his
lords that there were in y^ parliament. but he took and made his sone y^ duke
of Lancastre his governor of y^ reame / y^ which stood so still as gouernoure
till y^ time yt he deied The same year after Candelmasse or y^ parleament was
done / y^ king asked a subsydye of the clargy and of the lay fee and it was
granted him / that is to say yt he should have of every person of y^ lay fee
both man and woman that passed fourtene year of aege four pens out taken pore
beggars that were known openly for need poor beggars. And that he should have
of every man of the holy church that was benefyced or promoted twelve pens /
and all other that were not promomed.iiii. pens out taken the.iiii. ordres of
y^ frete beggars. This same year after Myghelmasse Richard prince Edwardes son
was made pry^ce of wales to whom y^ king gaaf y^ duchye of corneway le with y^
erldom of chestre. And about this time y^ Cardynale of England y^.iiii day
before Mary Mawdalenes day after dinner suddenly was smite with the palsye and
lost his speech / and on mary Mawdalenes day deyed.

Of the death of king Edward and how sir John^ Monsterwarth knight. was
drawn and hanged for his falsnesse.
'Byght anon after in the.lii. year of king Edward in the begynny^ge of
Octobre pope Gregorye y^.ix. brought and remeued his court with him from
Auynyon to Rome. And y^.xii day of Apryll. John^ Monsterwarthe. knight at
London was drawn and hangyd and than quartred and sent to four chief towns of
England and his heed smyten of and set upon London bridge / for this same
John^ was full untrue to y^ king and to the reame and coueytous and unstable /
for he took oftymes great so^mes of money of y^ king and his counsel formen
of arms wages that he should have paid the^ and took it to his own use / and
he dradd that at the last he should be shent and accused for the same cause and
fled pryue ly to the king of France and was sworn to him and become his
man and behyght him a great nauye out of Spayn into confucyon and destroynge
of England / But y^ ryghtfull god to whom no preuyte is unknown suffered hy^
first to be shente and spylt or that he so traytoursly and falsely betrayed his
lyege lord y^ king of England and his people in his reame / in y^ which
ground this same Johan was born. and wickydly through battle destroyed or he
brought about his cursed purpose. In the feast of saint George thoe next king
Edward gaaf to Richard of Burdeux his heyr y^ was pry^ce Edwardes sone at
wyndsore thordre of knyghthode and made him knight the which king Edward when
he had reigned.li. year. the.xi. kal of June he deyed at Shene and is buried
worshypfully at westmyster on whose soul god have mercy. This king Edward
was forsothe of a passing godenes and full gracyous among all y^ worthy men
of y^ world for he passed and shone by virtue of grace given to him from god
about all his predecessors y^ were noble men and (...) he was a well herted
man and an hard^^ for he drad never no myshappes ne harms ne evil fortune y^
might talle a noble warryour and a fortunate forboth on land and se and in all
batayls and assebl^s with a passing glory and Joy he had y^ (...) he was meke
and benygne homely (...) soft to all men as well to strangers as (...) his
own subgettes and to other were under his governance. He was deud oute^^^ly
both to god and holy church for he worshypped help and mayntened holy (...)
and their mynystres with all manner (...) / he was treatable and well auyled
^^^porall and worldly needs wise in cou^se^ll and dyscrete and meke to speak
with (...) deeds and manners gentle and well ^^^^ght / having pity of them that
were in disease / plenteuous in geuynge (...) benefaytes and almoses besy and
curyous in burldynge / and lightly he bare and suffered w^enges and harms and
when be was gruo^ to any occupacyon he left all other thing for the time and
tended thereto / semely of body and a meyne stature hauyn ge always to high
and to low a good chere. And there spro^ge and shone so much grace of hy^ y^
what man had behold his face or had dremed of hy^ he hoped y^ day y^ all thing
should hap to him Joyful and liking. And he governed his ky^gedome gloryously
unto his aege / he was large in geuyng and wise in spences / he was fulfilled
with all honest of good manners and virtues / under whom to live it was as
for to regne. wherefore his fader and his loos spronge so far that it came
into hethenes and Barbary showing and telling his worthynes and man hode in
all lands / and that no land under heaven had brought forth so noble a king
so gentle and so blessed or might reyse such an other when he was deed.
Nevertheless lechery and meuynge of his flesh hauntyd him in his aege /
wherefore the rather as it is to suppose for unmeasurable fulfyllynge of his
lust his life shorted the sooner. And here of take good head like as his dedys
bears witness for as in his beginning all things were Joyful and liking
to him / and to all people. And in his myddell aege he passed all people in
high Joy worship and blessydnes. Right so when he drew into age drawing
donwarde through le chery and other sins little and little all tho Joyful and
blessed things and prosperyte decreased and mysshapped and unfortunate things
and unprofitable harms with many euyls began for to spring and the more harm
is it continued long time after.

CLemens yt.vi. was pope after Benedict.x. year / this man in name and deed was
virtuous / and many things that Benedict was rygous in / he made easy / and
certain that he depryued he restored and y^ rygousenes of the faith of Benedict
was laudable / But much more laudable was y^ meekness of Clement. This man
was a noble prechour and many sermons he gadred / and let no man pass from
him but he gaaf hy^ good counsel / and dessessyd a blessed man Karolus
the.iiii. was Emperor after / Lodewyk.xxxi. year. This man was king of Beme a
wise man and a mighty. And this man was chosen Emperor by the commandment of
Cleme^s Lodewyk being a live in his contemacy / and because he asked mekely
the popes blessyng and to be crowned of him as other good kings did.
therefore he was protected of god and preueyled over all his enmyes. And many
favorable laws he made to spyrytuall men / y^ which yet are called Karolma /
at the last he decessed a rich man in virtue and goods. Innocentius the.vi.
was pope after clement.x. year / and he was a great lover of relygyous men and
he founded a monestery in France of the order of Cartusyens. and was a great
canonyst. Vrbanus the.v. was pope after Innocent. this man was abbot of
Myssolens of the order of saint Benet a doctor and is taken for a saint. he
made the cross to be preched against the Turks / and he made a passage to the
Turks / And to hy^ saint Brygyt was sent from Crist for the confyrmacyon of
their rule and than^e he was poysened and decessyd Gregory the.ix. was pope
after him.viii. year. This Gregory did little. And after hy^ followed the
trybulacyon the which our lord showed to saint Brygyt for y^ sin of the
clargye. Venselaus sone too Kacolus aforsayd was Emperor.xiiii year. And he
was a child and was chosen when his fader was on live / but he took no keep of
thempyre / and when he was warned many times for to take heed unto it and would
not. he was deposed / For he gaaf all his delight and lust to lechery / and his
end was without honor for he went gretely from the manners and the virtues
of his noble fader. And he was crowned with themperyall dyademe. and the
wisdom of his fader passed into Sygysmonde his brother as after it shall
appyrel. Vrbanus was pope after Gregorye.vi. year / this Vrba ne was chosen in
the cite of Rome by y^ strenth of the Romans but the Cardynals did that for
dread and not wylly^gly / wherefore they fled unto the Cite of F^ndo^^. And
they said that he was not pope / and chose in his place sire Robert of Gebennys
the same year the which was called Clement y^.vii. Nota. And here began
the.xii. strife in the church. And it was more worse than ever was any other
before / for it was so subtle / y^ the wysest men that were and the best of
conscience could not deserne with who me it was best to say and to hold. And
this strife dured.xl. year with a great sclau^dre unto all the clergy / and
great peril unto mennys souls for heresies and other evil things y^ which
were brought in than. In so much y^ there was no doctrine in y^ church for
mysdoynge And therefore from this Vrbant the.vi unto Martyne I know not whoo
was pope. The fest of y^ vysytacyon of our lady was ordained by Vrbane y^.vi.
aft the form of y^ sacrament of y^ awter for a peace and an unity to be had
among them through the merytees of our blessed lady Bonefactus the.ix. was pope
after Vrbane.xv. year. This Boneface was chosen at Rome in y^ stead of Vrbane /
and the strife continued / For Benedictus was chosen in Auynyon in the place of
Clement and was called Petrus de luna and he dured to the counsel of
Constantynus / and then he would not obaye but ever abode obstynate. And at y^
last he decessed in y^ kingdom of Aragon. And he commanded his Cardynals to
chese an other pope y^ which they did anon. And they set up an ydoll and
named him Clement / but they profyted not.

took her and welcomed her and all her fair company and made there all the
solempnyte y^ might be done. And than the king and his counsel asked of the
Frensshe lords whither all the couenau^tes and forwards with the composycyon

/ that is to say the two dukes and all their menys (...) comen over the water
to Gra^^nynge and they met with our two dukes / and euerychone took leave at
other and so they departed / and our lords camen again unto Calays / and the
Frensshe lords wenten over the water and so home into France again. And anon
after the king made him ready with the queen and all his lords and ladies and

commandment of England. Ad that time therle Marchall was Capytayne of Calays
And anon after by commandment of the king and by his false counseyll
commanded the capytayne to put him to the death. Add anon certain yomen that
had the good duke in keeping took their counsel how that they should put him

when he were in his bed and a sleep on a fetheren bed / and anon they
bound him hand and foot and charged him to lie still And when that they had
done thus they token two small towelles and made on them two rydy^ge knottes
and cast the towelles about his neck / and than they took y^ (...) y^ lay

of Arundell went at large unto the parlemente time / for he found suffycient
surete / to a abide the law and to answer to all manner points that the
king and his counseyll would put upon him / And the.xxi. year of king
Rychardes regne he ordained him a parliament at westmynster the which was
called the great parleamente / And this parleament was made for to Judge this
three worthy lords and other moo as they list at that time / And for that
Judgment / the king let make in all the haste a long house and a large of

year deyed sir John^ of Gau^t the kings uncle and duke of Lancastre in y^
bishops inn in Holdorne. and was brought fro thens to saint Poule and there
the king made and held this enterement well and worthily with all his lords

Herforde forterme of x. year. and the duke of Norfolk for euere more. And sir
Thomas of Aru^dell Archebysshop of Canterbury was exyled y^ same time for ever
and deposed out of his see for malice of the king. and anon these three worthy

And the duke of Norfolk went too Venece and there he deyed on whose soul god

falls counsel ymagynacyon of coueytous men y^ were about him were made and
ordained blanke chertres and made them to be enseled of all manner rich men
through out the reame / In so much that they compelled dyuerle people to set
their seals thereto / And this was done for great couetyse wherefore all good
hertes of the reame were clean turned away fro the king for ever after. And
that was utterly his dystruccyon and end to him y^ was so high and so
excellent prince and king and through covetous and falls counseyll falsely
betrayed. Alas for pity that such a king might not se: And tha^ king
Richard set his kingdom and his ryall land of England too ferme unto four
persons / the which were the se / Sir wyllyam strop earl of wyleshyre and
tresourer of England / and sir Johan Busshe / and Henry grene / and sir Johan
Bagot knights that which / turned them too myscheyf and death with in a little
time as ye shall find here afterward written. And than king Richard made
great ordinance and ^nte himself over see in to I^londe and many great lords
with him (...) a great host for to strenth their king with men of arms
archers and much great stuff and right good ordinance as longed unto war
And or he passed over see he ordained and made sir Edmonde of Langley his uncle

than he (...) see and came into Irlonde and (...) was well and worthily
received. And (...) rebels that been called would (...) came down to the
king and yolde them to him both body and goods all at his (...) will / and
swore unto him to be (...) lyege men / and there did to him (...) and feaute
and good seruyse / and thus he conquered the most part of Irlonde in a little
time. And whyse that king Richard was thus in Irlonde sir Henry of Bolyngbroke
earl of (...) the king had made before duke of ^^^forde / the which duke the
king had ^^led out of this land was comen (...) to Englende for to challenge

and with him came the earl of Aru^dell his sone and (...) y^ which was in
kepy^g of sir John^ shelley knight sometime with the earl of (...) and with the
duke of E^ces^^ y^ which was tho in y^ castle of Reygate in southsex and there
he stale him away and came too Calays and there he was keped well and worthily

lords with him and their nauye. And so thanne much people of the reame /
that when they herd of his coming and knewen where that he was and anon /
they drewen unto him and welcomed these lords and so gaaf them courage in
all manner thing and so passed forth into the land and gadred much people
to them. And when king Richard herd and wyste that these two lords were
comen again in to England and also were londed / Than the king left his
ordinance in Irlonde and come in to England ward in all the has^e that he
might and come to the castle of Flynte and there he abode to take his
counseyll and what might he done / but too him come none. And thanne sir Thomas
Percy earl of worcestre y^ was the kings steward wist and knew all this /
anon he came into the hall among althe people / and he brake y^ yerde of y^
ryall kings household / and anon every man was dysparpled and went his way
and forsook their master and sovereign lord and left him allone. And thus was
king Richard brought down and destroyed and stood himself allone with out
comforth or socoure or of any good coun^eylle of any man / alas for pity of
this ryall king. And anon came word that sir Henry of Bolyngbroke was up
with a strong power of people and that all the squyres of England reysen up
the shyres in strengthynge of him a yenste king Richard. And thus sone he was
come out of the North country to Brystowe and the re he met with sir wyllyam
Scrope earl of wyltshyre and tresourer of England and with sir John^ Busshe
and sir Henry grieve and John^ Bagot but he escaped from them and went over

and brought unto the duke / and a none the duke put him in fast ward and
strong hold unto his coming to London. And than was there a rumore in London
and a strong noise that king Richard came to westmynster / and the people of
London ran thither and would have done much harm and hurt in there woodnesse

London and put in prison in Newgate there to be kept and abide his answer.
And soon after the duke brought king Rychard pryuely unto London and put him
in the tour under sure keeping as a prisoner. And than came the lords of the
ream^ with all their counsel unto the Tour to king Richard and said to him
of his mysgouernau^ce and extorcyon y^ he had done made and ordained to
oppress all the comyne people and also to all y^ reame. Wherefore all the

yet mothe people in England and in other lands said he was alive many a year
after his death. But whether he was alive or deed the people held their falls
opinion and believe yt many had and much people came to great myscheyf and foul

Circa Annu^ dm^..M.CCCC.xxi.
Of king Henry the fyfte that was king Henryes sone.
ANd after the death of king Henry the fourth reigned king Henry his sone that
was borne at Monmouthe in wales that was a worthy king and a gracyous man and
a great conqueror And in the first year of his regne for great love and
goodness he sent to the freres of Langley there as his fader had do burye
king Richard the second and let take his body out of the earth again and did
bring it to westmynster in a ryall chare covered with black velvet and baners
of diverse arms abowte and all the horse drawyng the chare were trapped in
black and beten with diverse arms / and many a torche brenny^ge by all the
way (...) he came to westmynster / and there he let make for him a ryall and
solemn entereme^te and buried him by queen Anne his wife as his own desire
was on ^^^ther side of saint Edwardes (...) the abbaye of saint Peter's in
westminster on whose soul god have mer^^ (...) And in this same year were (...)
of lollers taken and falls heretykes that had purposed thrughe falls ^^eason
(...) to have slain our king and (...) destroyed all the clergy of the
reame and they might have had ther^ falls purpose. But our lord god would not
(...) / for in have our king had warning thereof and of all their falls
ordynau^ (...) werkynge and came suddenly with his power to saint Iohn^s with out
smythfelde and and ne they took a certain of yt lollers ^ falls herytykes and
brought the too the kings presence / and there they told all the^ falls
purpose and ordinance how they would have do and wrought y^ they might naue
reigned and had their will and there they told which were their capytayns and
governors and than the king commanded them to the tour of London and the
took mo too them both within y^ cite and with out and sent them to Newgate and
to both cou^ters and than they were brought in examyco^^ before the clergy
and the kings Justices and there they were conuyeted for their falls heresye
and dampened before the Justice for their falls treason. And this was their
iugeme^^ yt they should be drawn from y^ tour of London to saint Gylys field
and there to be hanged and burnt on y^ galowes. Also there was taken sir Roger
Acton knight for heresye and el^^ for treason against the king and the reame /
and he came before y^ clergy and was co^uycte for his heresye and dampened
before y^ Justice to be drawn from the toure of London through the cite to
laynt Gylys and to be hanged and brent. And in the second year of king
Henryes regne the fyft he held a counseyll of all the lords of the reame at
westmyster and there he put him this demand and prayed and besought them of
their goodness and of their good counsel and good will to show him as
touching the title of the right that he had to Normandye Gascoyne and Guyhen
the which the king of France withelde wrongfully and vnryghtfully / the
which his au^cestres before him had by true title of conquest and right
heritage / the which Normandye Gascoyn and Guyhen the good king Edward of
wyndesore and his au^cestres before hy^ had holden all their lives time. And
his lords gaaf him counsel to send enbassatours unto the king of France
and his counseyll that he should give up unto hy^ his right heritage yt is to
say Norma^ dye Gascoyne and Guyhen the which his predecessors had holden
before him or else he would it win with strength of sword in short time with
the help of almighty god. And than y^ Dolphyn of France answered to our
enbassatours and said in this manner that the king was over young and too
tender of aege for to make any war as ayenste him and was not like yet to be
a good warryour to do and make such a conqueste there upon him. And somewhat in
scorn and despyte he sent too him a town full of tenes balls because he
would have somewhat for to play with all for him and for his lords / for yt
would become him better than for to mayntene any war And than anon our
lords that were enbassatours took their leave and came in to England again and
told the king and his counseyll of y^ ungoodly answer that they had of the
Dolphyn / and of the present y^ which he had sent too our king. And when the
king had herd their words and the answer of the Dolphyn he was wonder sore
agreued and right evil apayed toward the Frensshmen and toward the king and
the Dolphyn / and thought to avenge him on them as soon as god would send him
gace and might / and anon let make tenes ^alles for the Dolphyn in all the
have that might be / and they were great gone stones for the Dolphyn to play
with all / And than anon the king sent for all his lords and held a great
counseyll at westmynster and told unto them the an swear y^ they had of y^
Dosphyn and of his worthy present yt he sent to him and to his lords to play
with all. And there the king and his lords were accorded that they should be
ready in arms with there power in y^ best array yt might be done / and get men of
arms and archers yt might be gotten and all other stuff that longed to war
and to be ready with all their retenue to mete at Southampon by Lammasse next
following without any delay. wherefore the king ordained his nauye of ships
with all manner stuff and vytayll that longed to such a wartyoure of all manner
ordeynaunce in the haven of Southampton in to the nombre of. CC C. and.xx.
saylles. And than fell there a great disease and a foul mychef / for there
were three lords which y^ the king trusted much on / and through falls couetyse
they had purposed and ymagyned y^ ky^ges death and thought to have slain him
and all his brethren or he had taken y^ see the which three lords were named
th^^slir Rychard earl of Cambrydg b^det to y^ duke of york / ye second was
the lord Scrop tresourer of England / the third was sir Thomas Gray knight
of the North country. And these three lords before said for lucre of money
had made a promise unto the Frensshe men for to have slain king Henry the
fyft and all his brethern by a falls train suddenly or they had be ware. But
god almighty held his holy hand over them and saved them from these
peryllous menye. And for too have done this they received of the Frensshmen a
Myllyon of gold / and yt was there openly known / and for their falls treason
they were all three Iuged unto the death / and this was the Judgment y^ they
should be ladde through Hampton and without North gate there to be heded / and
thus they ended their lives for their false couetyse and treason / And anon as
this was done y^ king and all his menye made them ready and went to ships and
saylled forth with.xv. hundred shxppes and aryued with in Seyn at Kydecause upon
our ladies even the Assumpcyon in Normandye with all his ordinance. And so
went him forth to Harflet and he besyeged the town all abowte by land and
elre by water and sent to the Capytayne of the town and charged him to deliver
the town. And the Capytayne said that he would deliver him none / ne none he
would him yield / but badde him do his best. And than our king laid his
ordinance unto y^ town / that is for to say Gonnes Engynnes and trypgettes
and shotten and cast at the walls and eke unto the town / and cast down
both towers and town and laid them unto the earth / and there he played at
the tents with his hard gonstones. And they that were within the town when
they should play their song was well away and alas yt ever such tenes
balls were made / and cursyd all tho y^ war began and y^ time yt ever they
were borne. And on the morn the king did cry at every gate of the town that
every man should be ready on the morneerly to make assaute unto y^ town. And
Wyllyam Boucher and John Grant with.xii. other burgeys worthy men came to the
king and be sought him of his ryall pryncehode and power to with draw his
malice and destruccyon yt he did to the^ and besought him of.viii. days of
respyte and trewes if any rescowe might come to them / and else to yield up y^
town unto hy^ with all their goods / and shan the king senf forth y^
Capytayne and kept y^ remenau^t still with him and the lord Gauco^^e yt was
Capytayne or y^ town went forth to Royn in all ye haste unto the Dolphy^ for
help and socour but there was none n^ no man of rescowe / for y^ Dolphyn would
not abide. And thus this Cap^tayne come again unto the king and yielded up the
town and delivered hrm the keys and had him go and put out all y^
frensshmen both men women and children and stuff his town of Harflet with
English people. And than the king sent into England and did cry in every
go de town of England that what (...) man would come thither and (...) him
there in that town he should have house and household to him and to his heirs
for ever more. And so th^de^^^ many diverse merchants and ^^^^men and
enhabyte them there to (...) the town and were welcome. And when the king
saw y^ this town was well stuffed both of vytayls and of men this worthy
prince took his leave and went to Lalays ward by land / and the frenssh men
herd of his coming they thought for to have stopped him his were that he
should not pass that way and in all the have that they might b^al^en all the
brydges where that as any passage was for horse and man in so much that the
remyghte no man pass ouere the Ryuers nothere on horse ne foot but if he
should have be drenchyd / And therefore our king with all his people went and
sough this way fer up to paris ward and there was all the ryall power of
France assembled and ready to give him battle and for to dystroye all his
people / But almighty god was his guide and saved him and all his menye and
defended him of his enmyes power and purpose thanked be god y^ saved so his
own knight and king in his ryghtfull title / And than our king beholdynge
and seeing the great multitude and nombre of his enmyes to withstand his way
and give him battle / than the king with a meke heart and a good spyryte
lift up his hondes to almighty god and besoughte him of his help and socoure
and that day to save his true servants And than our king gadred all his
lords and other people about and bad them all to be of good chere / for they
should have a fair day and a gracyous vyctorye and the better of all their
enemies / and prayed them all to make the^ ready unto y^ battle. for he would
rather be deed yt day in y^ field. than to be taken of his enmyes for he would
never put the reame of England to rau^some for his person. And the duke of
york fell on his knes and besought the king of a bone that he would grant
him that day y^ auau^twarde in his battle / and the king granted him his
asking and said / gramercy cosyn of york and prayed him too make him ready.
And than he bad every man to ordeyne him a stake of tree and sharp both ends
y^ the stake might be pyght in ye earth a slope that their enemies should not
overcome them on horsbacke for yt was there falls purpose and arrayed them for
too over ride our menye suddenly at the first coming on of them at y^ first
brunte. And all the night before y^ battle. the Frensshe men made many great
fyers and much revel with howtyng and showtynge and played our king and his
lords at y^ dyse / and an archer always for a blanke of their money / for
they wend that all had been theyrs / the morn arose the day ganne spring /
And the king by good auyse let array his battle and his wings and charged
every man to keep them hole to gyder and prayed them all to be of good chere.

ground and y^ place that the king and his counsel had assygned / and they
quyte them as good warryours unto their king. Now will I tell you which
were y^ chyef Capatayns and governors of y^ cite of Rone. Mon sir Guy Botyler

our king there were nombred by Heroudes in to three hundred thousand of men
and women and children what young and old / and among all these was many a
manfull man of his hondes and so they preued them when they issued out of the

the king came over the duke of Clarence was slain in France and diverse other

diverse other / and al was because they would not take none archers with them
but thought to have overcome the Frensshmen themself with out archers. And yet
when he was slain the archers came and rescowed the body of the duke which
they would have carried with them / god have mercy on his soul he was a
valiant man. And the same year between Crystmasse and can delmasse the town

this year in y^ month of August the king waxed seek at Boys de vynce^t / and
when he saw he should deye he made his testament and ordained many noble
things for his soul and deuoutelye received all the ryghtes of holy church /
in so far forth that when he was anointed he said the seruyfe with the priest /
and at the verse of y^ psalm of Miserere mei deus / y^ was Benign facdn^e in
bona voluntate tua syon / vt edif^centur mury Iherusalem / he ^adde tarry there
and said thus / O good lord thou knowed y^ mine intent has been and yet is if I
might live too reedyfye the walls of Iherusalem. And thanne the priest
proceeded forth and made an end. And anon after this most noble prince and

Of the law of king Henry y^ fyfth and what he ordained for king Richard and
for himself after his death.
Here is to be noted that this king Henry y^ fyfth was a noble ^ty^ce after
he was king and crowned how it before in his yongth he had been wild recheles
and spared no thing of his lust ne desires but acco^plysshed the^ after his
liking / but as soon as he was crowned enoynted and sacred anon soda^ly he
was changed in to a new man and set all his intent to live virtuously in
maynte nynge of holy church destroynge of heretykes / keeping Justice and
defend^nge of his reame and subgectes. And for as much as his fader had
deposed by his ^abour the good king Richard and pre^^ously made him to deye
and for y^ (...) done to him against his legeau^ce he had sent to Rome for to
be assoyled thereof For which offense our holy fader ^^e pope enjoined him to
make him to be prayed for perpetually and like as he had done too be taken
from him his natural life therefore he should do found four tapers to b^e^ne
perpetually about his body y^ for y^ ertyncco^n of his bodily life his soul may
ever be remembered and life in heaven in spyrytuall life And also y^ he should
every weke on y^ day as it come about of his death have a solemn mass of
requyem and on y^ even before a dy^yge with ix. lessons and a doole to poor
people always on y^ day of a.xi. shellynges and.vii pens to be deled penny mele
and ones in the year at his annyuersarye his termente to be holden in the most
honest wise / and to be deled y^ day.xx. pound in pens to poor people. And
to every monk.xx. shellynge which all these things performed this noble
king for his fader for king Henry the fourth his fader performed it notte
during his life of women as it is said that god did touch him and was lep^e o^
that he deyed And alsoo this noble prince let do call all the abbottes and
pryours of saint B^nets order in England and had all them in to the chapter
house of west mynstre for the reformacyon of their order wherein he had
comunycacyon / and alsoo with bishops and men of the spyrytualtee / in so
far forth that they doubted sore as that he would have had the pemporaltees
out of their hondes / wherefore by the advise labors and procuring of the
spyrytualte encouraged the king for to challenge Normandye and his right in
France to y^ intent to set him awerke there that he should not seek none
occasyons for too enter in to such matters. and than all his life time
afterward he labored and was besy in the war and in conquerynge a great
part of the reame of France and so afterward that by the grement of the
king Charles he had the governance and the rule of the reame of France /
and he was proclaimed regent and heir of France. And so notwithstanding for
all this great war that he had / nevertheless yet he remembered his soul
and also thought that he was mortal and needs must de ye / for which cause
he ordained by his life time the place of his sepulture where as he is buried /
and has every day three masses perpetually songen in a chapel over his
sepulture of the which the myddyll mass and the first and y^ last mass
shall be as it is assygned by him as it apperyth by these verses following.

And yet the noble king Henry y^ fifth founded two houses of relygyon one is
called Syon beside Braynforde of the order of saint Brygytte both of men and
women / and on y^ other side of the River of Tamyse an house of monks of
Chartrehous / in which two places he is contynually prayed for night and day.
for ever when they of Syon resten than they of y^ Chartre house do their service
and in like wise when they of y^ Chartre house resten the other gooth to / and
by ryngynge of the belles of either place each knows wha^ they have ended
their seruyse which he nobly endowed / and do daily there great alms deeds /
as in chartre house certain children be founden to scole / and at Syon certain
alms given daily. And yet beside all this he had founded a recluse the which
shall be always a priest to pray for him by the said chartre house which priest
is suffycyently endowed for him and a servant. Lo here may all princes take
ensample by this noble prince that reigned so little time not fully.x. year and
did so many noble acts as well for his soul to be perpetually remembered and
prayed for / as in his conquestes and he being in his most lusty aege
dysposed and eschewed sin and was a great Iusticer / in so much y^ all y^
pry^ces of crystendome dradde him and also of alsoo of hethenes / and he had
determined in himself if god would have spared him to have warred on y^
Sarasyns and for to know the aid of other princes and all the passages in y^
Iourneye he sent a knight of Henaude named Hugh de lanoye unto Iherusalem / but
or he returned he deyed at Boys de vyncente in the.xxxvi. year of his aege. on
whoos soul god have mercy Amen.

EElyx the.v. was pope when Eugenius was deposed.ix. year. this Felyx was duke
of Sauoye a devout prince and an old man. and he saw his childs child.
This man when he lived a holy life was chosen pope of y^ counseyll of Basyle /
and Eugeny was deposed. and there was strife long time / and he had no great
obedyence for y^ deposycyon of Eugenye. And at y^ last Eugenye decessed / and
than Felyx resygned to Nicholas for favor of peace to be had and he was made
Legate of France and Cardynall of Sabianus. This was y^ xxiii. strife bytwyxt
Eugedy and Felyx and it dured.xvi and year and this was a new cause and never
seen before. for y^ counsel of Basyle deposed Eugeny the vere pope and there
was no mo for he obeyed not the decrees of y^ counsel of Constantynople as
they said ne he charged not to obey y^ counsel of Basyle. but he said rather
the contrary should be done than as they decreed. wherefore there arose a great
alteraco^n in yt matter / for some said one way and some an other and could
notte accord to this day / for that one party said yt the counsel was
above y^ pope. and an other party said the contrary that y^ pope was above the
counsel. but they left it vndetermyned. and therefore god must dyspose for
y^ best. Albert was Emperor after Sygysmonde one year. this Albert was the
duke of Austre and neuewe too Sygysmond and therefore he was king of Beme and
of Vngary for his daughter for other heir he left none. This man was chosen
Emperor of Almayne but anon he was poysened and deyed / and he was in all
thing a virtuous man y^ all men said he was a presydent too all kings
Fredericus y^ third was Emperor after him. this Frederyk was y^ duke of
Osteryk and chosen Emperor of Almayne but it was long or he was crowned of
the pope for deuysyon. And at the last there was made an unity (...) he was
crowned with a great honor ^t the pope in the cite and was a (...) man and a
quyete and of a synguler pity and he hated not the clergy he wedded y^ ^^^ges
daughter of Portyngale and in his time whiles y^ he reigned he made a great
conuocacyon of princes in (...) for the Incours of the Turks (...) ^^^^ed unto
them that now (...) year. crystendom was made (...) hundred mile. and he
warned (...) they should be ready to resyst him. And the imperyall Cite of
Constantynople was taken at that same time of the mysbyleuynge Turks and
(...) by a Ianu^s whom for his lab^^re the Turk made a king as he ^^mysed
him. and the fourth day he called him to him and did hang him (...) his
dysceyte too his master. And ch^^ was great sorrow and weeping among the
christian people for the loss of that noble Cite / for many a christian man was
slain and innumerable were sold and y^ Emperor was slain and forenuye the
Turk caused his heed to be smyten of when he was deed. And al most all the
faith in the land of Greek failed.

Nicholaus the.v. a Ianuens was pope after Felyx.viii. year. This Nicholas was
chosen at Rome in the place of Eugenye / and yet the stryf henge still. and a
little and a little they obeyed him and all men merueyled y^ a man of so pore a
nacyon should obtain against y^ duke of Sauoy the which was cosyn and alyed al
most to all the princes of crystendome and euerychone left him. Than in y^
year after there was a peace made / and Felix resygned for it pleased our lord
his name to be glorified by an object of y^ world as that Ianuens was in
comparyso^ of the duke the pope. This Nicholas / was a master in dyuynyte and
an active man and a rich man in conseytes / and many things that were fallen
he buyldyd again / and all the walls of Rome he renewed for dread of the Turk.
And there was a verse made of this unity and publysshed in the cite. Lux fulsie
mu^do: cessit felix Nicholao. And yt in the year of our lord.M.CCCC.xlix. The
year of grace with a great devotion was confermed and Innumerable people went
to the appostles setes.

man's clothing and came into zelan de to a town of her own called Syrixe
And from thens she went to a town in Hollonde called the Gowde and there she

England and in France.
IN (...) great w^^che in (...) for a fraye y^ was between the bishop of
wynchestre. and the duke of Gloucestre protector etc. For the mayer with the
people of the cite would abide by y^ duke of Gloucestre as protector and

especyall by the labor of the prince of Portyngale / there was a poyntemente
taken that there was no harm done. And after y^ battle of Vernayl in Perch

In this same time was the counseyll of Ba^yle to y^ which counseyll Eugenye
the pope was cyted to come. And because that he ^ame not they deposed him but
he rought notne set not thereby but gate y^ cite of Ro^me and abode still

counsel was offered to the king of England great things by the mean of a
Legate that came fro Rome y^ which was Cardynall of saint Cross / which
offres were refused by the Cardynalle of England and other lords y^ there were

recompensynge of his faders death y^ count of Pontui / y^ lordshyp of Macon

came home again in worse caas than they went out For they lost there the duke
of Burgoyne which had been with his Burgoynons and Pycardes a synguler help
in all the conqueste of Normandye and of France This same year was a great
battle on the sea between the Ienewes and the king of Aragon of which
bataylle y^ Ienewes had the vyctory / for they took the king of Aragon y^
king of Nauerne and y^ great master of saint James in Galyce with three hundred
knights and squyres and much other people / and this was on saint Dominic^

three fold governance in the church that is to wete of Eugeny of the
counsel and of neutralyte. Also this same year a.M.CCCC.xxxiiii. was a
passing great wind by which steples houses and trees were overthrown. About
this time was an holy maid in Hollonde called Lyd with which lived only by
miracle not etynge any mete. This year the duke of Burgoyne began his order
at Lyle of the golden Fleys and ordained certain knights of the same order
and made statutes and ordynaunces much according unto the order of the
garter. Also this same year y^ Fre^sshmen had enterprysed too have stolen
Calays in the fysshyng time / for many botes of France had safeconduytes to
come to Cal^^^ for to take herynge. And the sondyours of the town had a
custume to come to the church. and leave their stanes standing at the church
door / which staves the Frensshe men that were arrayed like fysshers had
purposed for to have stolen their staves and wepen for to have won so the
town. but one of them lay with a comune woman y^ night before / and he told
to her there counsel / and she on the morn told it to y^ Lyuetenaunte which
forthwith all commanded that every man should keep his wepen in his hand
sakerynge time and other. And when the Frensshmen perceived this that they were
myspoynted they saylled streyghte to Deep and stale and took y^ town. And on
New years day / after they took Harflete. And thus y^ Englysshmen began to
lose a little and little in Normandye.

How Calays and Guynes were besyeged by the duke of Burgoyn and how they were
rescowed by y^ duke of Gloucestre.
THis year was a great noise all England through how y^ duke of Burgoyne would
come and besyege Calays / wherefore the earl of Mortayne with his army that he
had to have go with hy^ into France was commanded and charged y^ he should go
to Calays / which was at y^ time well vytayled and manned / for sir John^
Ratclyfe was Lyuetenaunte of y^ town for y^ king. and the baron of Dud lay
Lyuetenaunt of y^ castle. And the ix. day of Iulii the duke of Burgoyne. with
all the power of Flaundres and much other people came before Calays and set
his syege about the town / and every town of Flaundres had their tents by
themself. And this syege endured three were. In the meant while the duke of
Gloucestre being protector of England took y^ most part of all the lords
of England and went over the sea to Calays for too rescowe the town or for to
fight with the duke and his host if they would have byden. This time London
and every good town of England sent over these to this rescow certain
people well arrayed of the best and chose^ men for y^ war. And the second day
of August the foresaid duke of Gloucestre aryued at Calays with all his army
and.v. hundred ships and moo. And the duke of Burgoyne and all his host y^
lay in the syege / as soon as they aspyed the sails in y^ see / before they
approached Calays haven suddenly in a morning departed from the syege /
leuynge behy^de him much stuff and bytayle and fled in to Flau^dres and
Pycardye. and in like wise did the syege y^ lay before Guynes where as they of

king Henry ya af commyssyon preuarly to sir Edward Hull: sir Robert Roos /

other marriage. For the re should have be delyuerde. so many castles and towns
in Guyon / and so much gold should have be yeuen with her / y^ all England
should have be thereby euryrhed / but contrary wise fell. wherefore every great
prince ought to keep his promise / For because of brekynge of this promise:
and for marriage of queen Margarete / what loss has the reame of England had
/ by lesynge of Normandye / and Guyon / by dyuysyon in the reame / y^
rebellynge of comyns against there prince and lords / what dyuysyon among y^

king deposyd / and the queen with her sone feign to fle into Scotlonde / and
from thens into France. and so to Loreyne / the place y^ she came first fro.
Many men deem that the brekynge of y^ kings promise to y^ sister of the earl
of Armynak / was cause of his great loss and aduersyte.

THis year of our lord.M.CC^^ was the great grace of the Iubyle at Rome /
where was great (...) in so much y^ from all places in (...) dome / great
multitude of people (...) tyd thither. And in this same year was a great
assemble and gaderynge togy^der of the comunes of Kente in to greece nombre. And
made an Insurreccyon and rebelled ayenste the king and his laws / And
ordained them a Capytayne. called Johan Cade an Irysshman which named himself
Mortymer / cosyn to the duke of york. And this Capytayne held them together /
and made ordynaunces among them / and brought them to the black hethe /
where he made a byll of petycyons to the king and his counsel and showed
what Iniuryes and oppressyons y^ poor comyns suffered. and under color. for to
come to his above / and he had a great multitude of people. And the xxvii. day
of June. the king and many lords Capytayns. and men of werre went toward him

went too Senol: And the Capytayne with his felyshyp and met with them. and
fought ayenste them and in conclusyon slew them both and as many as abode
and would not yield them / were slain.

During this skyrmysshe. fell a gretr varyaunce among y^ lords men and
common people being on black heth aye^ste them lords and capytayns / saying
plainly y^ they would go unto the capytayne of Kent. to assyst and help him /
but if they might have / execuco^n on the traitors being about the king.
whereto y^ king said nay. And they said plainly that the lord Say tresourer
of England / and the bishop of Salysbury / and y^ baron of Dubby / the abbot
of Gloucestre / Danyell / and Treuilyon / and many mo were traitors / and
worthy to be deed. wherefore for to please the lords meny and also some of the
kings house / y^ lord Say was arested and sent to the toure of London. And
then the king herynge tidings of the death and ouerthrowenge of the
Staffordes he withdrewe him to London / and from thens to Kelyng worth / For
the king ne the lords durst not trust their own household men.: / Then
after that the Capytayne had had this vyctory. upon the Staffordes anon he
took sire Vmfreys salette. and his Brygantynes smyten full of gylte. naylles /
and also his gylte sporys and arrayed him like a lord and a ^apytayne and
resorted with all his menye / and also mo than he had before. to the black heth
again. To whom came y^ Archebysshop of Caunterbury / and the duke of Bokyngham
to the black hethe. and spoke with him / And as it was said / they found him
wytty in his talking and his request / and so they departed. And the third
day of July he came and entered into London with all his people And the re did
make cries in the kings name and in his name / that no man should rob / ne
take no manner goods / but if he paid for it. And came riding thrughe the
cite in great pride / and smote. his sword upon London stone in Can wyk
street. And he being in y^ cite se^te to the toure for to have the lord Say
And so they fette him / and brought him to the yield halle before ye mayre and
th alder men / where y^ he was examyned. And he said / he would and ought to
be Iugyd by his perys. And the comyns of Kente took him by force from the
Mayer and officers that kept him / and took him to a pressed / to shryue him. And
or he might be half shryuen / they brought him to the standarde in the Chepe
side / and there smote of his head / on whose soul god have mercy. Amen. And
thus deyed the lord Say tresourer of England. After this they set his
heed upon a spear. and bare it all about the cite. And the same day abowte
Mile end / Cromere was beheeded / And the day before at after noone / the
Capytayne with certain of his men / went to Phylyp Malpas house / and robbyd
him / and took away much good / And from thens he went to saint Margaretes
patens to one Gertys house / and robbed him. and took away fro him much good
also. At which rob bynge diverse men of London / of their neighbors were at
and took part with them. For this robbynge the peoples hertes fell from him
/ and every thryfty man was a ferde / for to be served in like wise. For there
was many a man in London / that awayted and would fayn have seen a common
robbery / which almighty god forbid. For it is to suppose if he had not
robbed: he might have gone far / or he had be withstonde. for the king / and
all the lords of the reame of England / were departed except the lord Scalys
/ that kept the toure of London. And the fyfte day of Iuyll. he did do smite
of a man's head in south work. And the night after the Mayer of London with
ye aldermen and the comynes of the cite / concluded to drive away the Capytayne
and his host. And sent to the lord Scalys to the toure and too Mathe gough a
Capytayn of Norman dye / that they would that night assayll the Capytayne with
them of Kent. And so they did come too London bridge / in Such work / or the
Capytayne had any knowledge thereof / and they fought with them that kept the
bridge. And the Ke^tysshmen went to harnes / and came to the bridge / and shot
and fought with the^ and gate the bridge / and made them of London too flee
and slew many of them. and this endured all the night to and fro / tylle one
of the clock of the morrow And at the last they burnt the draw bridge. where
many of them of London were drowned. In the which night sutt^n an Alderman of
London was slain Roger Heysaunte / Mathe Gough / and many other. And after this
the chaunceler of England sent to the Capytayne a pardon generalle for him and
an other for his menye. And then they departed fro Suth work / every man to
his own house. And when they were all departed and goon / there was
proclamacyons made in Kent / Southsex and other places / y^ what man could take
the capytayne quycke or deed / should have a thousa^de pound. And after this
one Alexander yden a squyre of Kent took him in a garden in Southsex / and in

Of the field y^ the duke of york took at Brentheth in Kent / and of the birth
of prince Edward / and of the first bataylle at saint Albons. where the
duke of Somerset was slain.
IN the.xxx. year of y^ king the duke of york came out of the Mar che of
walys / with therle of Deueush^^^ and the lord Cobham and great (...) for
reformacyon of certain (...) and wrongs and also to have Justice upon
certain lords being about y^ king / and took a field at Brentheth beside
^^^ ford in Kent. which was a strong field for which cause the king with all
his lords went unto the black hethe. with a great and a strong multitude of
people armyd / and ordained for y^ werre in the best wise. And when they
had mustred on y^ hethe / certain lords were tho sent unto him. for to
(...) and make apoyntment with him. which were the bishop of Ely. the bishop
of wynchestre / therles of Salysbury and of war wyk / And they concluded that
the duke of Somerset should be had to ward. and to answer to such artycles
as the duke of York should put on him. And then the duke of york should break
his field / and come to the king. which was all promised by the king. And
so the king commanded. that the duke of Somerset should be had in to
ward. and then the duke of York brake up his field and came to the king.
And when he was come contrary to the promise a fore made the duke of Somerset
was present in the field / awaytynge and cheyf abowte the king / And made the
duke of York ride before as a prysonere through London. And after they would
have put him in hold. But anoyse arose that therle of March his sone. was
coming with.x. thousand men to London ward wherefore the king and his
counsel feryd / And theme they concluded / that the duke of york should
depart at his own will. Abowte this time began great deuysyon in Spruce
between the great master and the knights of the duchye order / which were
lords of that country. For the comyns and towns rebelled against the lords
and made so great werre that at the last they called the king of Pole to be
their lord / the which king came and was worship fully received / And
besyeged the castle / of Mariengburgh / which was the cheyf castle of
strength of all the land. and wanne it and drove out y^ master of Daske / and
all othere places of that land and so they that had been lords many years.
lost all their seygnou^ye and possessions in tho lands And in the year of y^
Incarnaco^n of our lord.M.cccc.liii. on saint Edwardes day. queen Margarete
was delyuerde of a fair prince which named was Edward. That same day John^
Norman was chosen for too be mayer of London. And the day that he should take
his oath at westmynster / he went thither by water with all y^ crafts / where
before time y^ mayer / alderme^ and the crafts rode on horsbacke y^ which was
never vsyd after. For syn that tym they have ever goon by water in botes and
barges.

Ye have well understand before how y^ contrary to the promise of the king and
also the conclusyons take between the king and the duke of york at Brentheth
the duke of Semerset went not to ward but abode about the king / and had
great rule / And anon after he was made Capytayne of Calays. and ruled the
king and his reame as he would / wherefore the great lords of y^ reme / and
also ye comyns were not pleased: For which cause the duke of York / the earl
of warwyk / the earl of Salysbury with many knights and squyres / and much
other people came to remeue the said duke of Somerset and other fro the king /
And the king herynge of their coming / thought by his counsel for to have
gone westwarde and. not for to have met with them. And had with him the duke of
Somerset y^ duke of Bokyngham / y^ earl of Stafforde the earl of Northu^berlond
/ ye lord Clyfforde / and many other. And what time that the duke of york and
his felyshypp understood / that the king was departed with the lords from
London / anon he changed his way / and costed y^ country and came to saint
Albons the.xxiii. day of May. and there met with the king to whom the king
sense certain lords and desired them to keep the peace / and depart: But in
conclusyon while they treated on y^ one side / the earl of were wyk with the
March men and other / entered in to the town on that other side / and fought
against the king and his party / and so began the battle and fighting which
endured a great while / But in conclusyon the duke of york obtained. and
had the vyctory of that Iourneye / In which was slain the duke of Somerset
/ the earl of Northumberlonde. the lord Clyfforde. and many knights and
squyres / and many moo hurt / And on the morn after they brought y^ king in
great astate to London / which was lodged in y^ bishops palace of London. And
anon after was a great parliament at London / in which parlemente the duke of
york. was made protector of England / and the earl of werwyk Capytayne of
Calays / the earl of Salysbury Chaunceler of England. And all such persons
as had the rule before about the king were set a part / and might not rule as
they did before. And this same year deyed pope Nicholas the fyfte. and after
him was Calixt y^ third. This Calixt was a Catalane / and the acts of him
shall be showed here after following.

In this same year fell a great affraye in London ayenste the Lumbardes. the
cause began / bycauce a young man took a dager from a Lumbarde and brake it.
wherefore the young man on the morn was sent fore to come before y^ Mayer and
the aldermen and there for the offense. he was committed to ward. and then
the mayer departed fro the yield halle / for to go home to his dinner / But in
the Chepe the young men of the mercerye for the most party prentyses. held
the Mayre and Shyrefs still in Chepe. and would not suffer them too depart /
unto the time that their fellow / which was committed to ward / were delyue
red: and so by force they rescowed their fellow from prison. And that done the
Mayre departed and the Shyrefs also / and the prisoner delyuerd. which if he
had be put to prison. he had be in Ieoperdye of his life. And theme began a
rumoure in the cite against the Lumbardes And the same evening the hondcrafty
men of the town arose / and ran to y^ Lumbardes houses and dyspoyled and
robbed diverse of them. wherefore y^ May ^^ and the Aldermen came with the honest
people of the cite. and drove them thens / and sent some of them that had
stolen to Newgate. And y^ young man that was rescowed by his fellows / saw
this great rumoure. affraye and robbery / ensewed / of his first meuynge to
y^ Lombarde / departed and went to westmynster to sayntwary. Or else it had
cost him his life. for anon after came down an Oyer determyne. for to do
Justice on al them that so rebelled in the cite against the Lumbardes / On
which sat with y^ Mayre that time wyllyam Marowe / y^ duke of Bokyngham. and
many other lort des / to se execucyon done / But the comynes of the cite
secretly made them ready and did arm them in their houses and were in purpoos
to have rongen the comyne belle / which is called bow belle. but they were
let by sad men which came to the knowledge of the duke of ^^kyngham and
other lords. And in contynent they arose / for they durst no longer abide /
for they dowtyd that the hole (...) te should have risen against them. But yet
nevertheless two or three of the cite we re Iugyd to death for this robbery / and
were hangyd and Tyberne. Anon after the king and the queen / and other lords
rode to Coue^tre and withdrewe them fro London. for this cause. And a (...)

whom they had conde^pned in a great sum of money to the said Earl of
Salysbury / and therefore he was committed into prison in Newegate in London /
where when he had be a certain space he brake the prison / and three prisoners
with him / and escaped and went his way: and Also this year y^ earl of warwyk
and his wife went to Calays with a fair felysshyp and took possessyon of his
office / Abowte this time was a great reformacyon of many monesteryes of
relygyon in diverse parties of the worl de / which were reformed after y^
first Instytucyon / and continued in many places. This same year was a great
battle in the Marches between the land of Hungry and Turkey / at a place
called Septedrad / where Innumerable turkys were slain / more by miracle thann
by man's hand / for oonly the hond of god smote them / Saint John^ of

into y^ downs by night. And on the morn erly before day they londed and
came to Sand wytche / both by land and water / and took the town / and
ryfled and dyspoyled it / And took many prisoners / and left the town all bare
/ which was a rich place and much good therein / And ladde with them many

Flaundres Holonde and zelonde / children gadred them togyders by great
companyes / for to goo on pilgrimage to saint Myghels mount in Normandye /
which came fro far countries / whereof the people merueyled. And many
supposyd y^ some wicked spyryte meued the^ to do so. but it dured not long by
cause of the long way and also for lac / of vytaylle as they went. In this
year Reynolde Pecok bishop of Chestre / was found an heretyke / and the
third day of Decembre was adjured at Lambeth in presence of the Archebysshop

The names of this Ylonde. ca. j.
EIrste as Galfrydus says this land was called Albion after the name of
Albyne the oldeste daughter of Dyoclesyan and had.xxxii.systers. and theye were
first that enhabytede this land / And because she was the oldest sister she
named his land albion after her own name as the Cronycle reherseth: Othere
say that this land was named Albion as it were the white land of white
rocks about the clyues of the sea that were seen fro far. Afterward Brute
conquered this land and called it Brytayne after his own name. And then
Saxons or Englysshmen conquered this land and called it Anglia that is England
Or it is called Anglia of a queen that owed this land / that was named angela
and was a noble bukes daughter of the Saxons. Or as Ysyd says Ethi.xv. anglia
has that name as it were an angle and a corner of the world. Or else as Be da
says li. i: Saint Gregory saw Enlysshe children to sell at Rome and he
accorded to the name of the land. and said they ben sothely angles / for her
face shyned as angels / for the noblyte of the land shone in y^ children faces.
Alfre. The Bryttysshe Anglia is called y^ other world /and for great plente
of all good the great Charles called it his own chamber. Solinus The edge of
the frensshee clyf should be the end of the world / if the Ylonde of Britayn
ne were not / which is worthy to have the name of an other world. Alfry this
Ylonde is called insula for it is in salo / that is the se / and is beten of
with diverse course of waters with stremes and with wawes of the se.

Of the setting bou^dynge lenthe and bread of this land.
THis Britayne is acou^ted a noble land both in our stories and also in the
stories of Greeks. and is set ayenste Germania. Gallia. France and Spain
between the north and the west and the se between. This land is fyfty mile
from the clyf of the men that be called mormi gessorico. Beda li.i. And for
this ylond lies under the north head of the world. and it has light and
bright nyghtes in y^ somer time. So that oftentyme at mydnyght men have
questyons and doubt whether it be euyntyde or dawynge / y^ is for the time of
the year y^ the son goes not far under the earth by night but passes by
the north side and comes soono in to y^ eest again. And therefore in the somer
be^ their days full long df.xviii. hours and the nyghtes of.vi. hours. And
after in ye winter ben long nyghtes of.xviii.hours and short days of.vi.
hours. Also in Armenia. Macedonia. Italya and in other lands of the same line
the lengest day and lengest night also is of.xv. hours. and the shortest day
or night is of ix hours. Plinius in meroe. That ylond is chyef of blackemen /
there is the lengest day.xii. hours. In Alexandre in Egypt of xiii. hours In
ytalya of xv. hours. In Brytayne of.xviii. hours. In the ylonde named Tyle
all the.vi. somer months is day and all the vi. winter months in night.
Isyd li.xiii. Brytayne is set within Occean as it were without the world /and
is set against France and Spayn Giraldus. Brytayn is endlonge and larger in
the myddell than in the ends. Drosius. Brytayne stretches in le^ be out of
the south into the north / and in the southest it has France in y^ south Sp^^
in the north / Norwaye / and in the west H^ berma / that is Irlond. when
shyppemen passen the next clyf of that land the^ (...) a cite that heet Rupty

Of the worthynesse and peroga^nes. ca.iii.
AS France passes Brytayne so Brytayne passethe Irlonde in fair weder and
noblyte but not in bell / the. Beda li.i. For this ylonde is best. to bring
forth trees and fruyce. Ruther ne and beestes. And wine grows therein in some
place. The land has plente of fowls and of beestes of diverse manner of
kind. The land is plenteuous and the sea also. The land is noble copyous and
rich of noble wells and Ryuers with plente of fysshe. There is great plente of
small fysshe of samon and of celes. wilhel. de. pon.li.iii. So that the people
in so me place feed their swyne with fysshe. Beda.li.i. There ben oftentimes
taken dolphyns. See calves / and Balayne great fysshes as whales kind. and
diverse mane reshelfysshe / among the which shelfys she ben muskles that
within them have Margery peerles of all manner of color and hew of rody and
read purpure and of blewe / and specially and most of white There is also
plente of thelfysshe y^ men dyen therewith fine read / the redenes there of is
wonder fair and stable / and stayneth never with cold ne with hete. with wete
ne with dry. but ever the older the color is the fayrer. There ben also
saltewelles and hoote wells / thereof rennynge stremes of hot bathes departed
into diverse places according. For man and woman of al manner age old or
young. Basilius says. That the water the renneth and passes by veins of
certain metal takes in his course great hete. This ylond is plenteuous of
veins of metalles. bras of iron of leede of tyn / and of silver alsoo Plinius
li.vi.ca.vi. In this ylonde under the turfe of the land is found good merle.
the thryfty of the fatnes dries hy^ self therein / So that ever the thycker
the field is merled the better corn it will bear There is also a another manner
white mer le / that the land is the better four score year that therewith is
merled. Solinus In this ylonde grows a stone y^ is called Gagates / if ye
will know his fair nesse / it is black as ge^mes ben / if ye will know his
kind / It brenneth in water and quenches in oil and as to his my ght / if
the stone befroted and chaffed It holds what him neygheth as Succu^s a stone
that is so named. Ysydorus.li.xv. There ben sheep that beren good wul There ben
many hertes and wild beestes and few wulues / therefore sheep ben the surer
without keeping left in the field R. In this ylonde also ben many cytees and
towns fair and noble and rich / many great Ryuers and stremes with great
plente of fysshe / many fair woods and great / with right many beestes tame
and wild / The earth of that land is copyous of metal oor / and of salt
wells / of quareyes of marbyll of diverse manner stones / of reed of white of
soft and of hard / of chalk and of white lyme. There is also white claye and
read for to make pottes / crockes / stenes / and other vessel and brent tyle
to cover y^ houses and chirches as it were in y^ other samia / that is named
samos also. Flau^dres loves well the wull of this land. And Holand the
skynnes and felles of all manner of beestes Guyan ye iron and the leed. Irlonde
the oor and y^ salt All Europa loves and desires the white metal of this
land Alfredus. Bryta in has enough of matter that there needs to bye and sell
/ or is needful to man's use / there lacks neither salt ne yro^ Therefore a
versefyour in his meter prayseth this land in to this manner. England is a
good land fruytfull of wull / but it is a corner. England is full of play
free men well worthy to play / fre men / free tongues / free hertes / and free
ben all their things. their hand is more free / and better than their tongue.
Also England is beauteuous of land flower of londdes all about / that land
is full payede with fruit and good of his own / that land reueleth strange
men that has need thereto. And when hunger greuethe other lands that Land
fedethe them / That land bears fruit and corn great plente enough. That
land is well at ease as long as men live in peace. eest and weste in each
land been known well the Hauenes of Englonge: Her ships Foundes and often
helps many lands Their mete and money men have there more common always. And
for to learn me^ gladly give gifts. In land and stronde wide speak men of
England. Land honey milk chese this Ylonde thereof shall bear the price. This
ylonde has no need of other lands. all lands must seek help at this alone.
Of the liking of their woun / might wonder king Solomon The riches that there
is an / would desire octauyan.

Of the meruayles and wondres. ca iiii.
IN Brytayne been hot wells well arrayed and a dressed to the use of manhood /
maystres of thylke wells is the great spyryte minerua. In her house y^ fire
endures always that never changes into ashes / but there the fire slaketh /
it changes into stone clottes. Alfre. In Brytayn ben many wondres /
nevertheless four ben most wonderful the first is at Pecton there blows so
strong wind out of the chynes of the earth y^ it casts up again clothes that
men cast in. The second is at Stonhenge besides Salesbury there ben great
stoones and wonder huge. and been rered on high as it were yates set upon
other yates: Nevertheless it is not known clearly ne aperceyued how and
wherefore they ben so are red and so wonderful honged. The third is at
Cherdhoke there is a great holownes under the earth / often many men have
walked therein. and have seen / Ryuers and stremes but no where can theye find
none end. The fourth is that rayn is seen raised upon hills and none^y
spronge about in the feldes. Also there is a great ponde that conteyneth.lx.
ylondes couenable for men to dwell in / that ponde is beclypped about with
syx score roches / and upon every roche an egles neste and three score Ryuers
rennen into y^ ponde / and none of them all run into the sea but one. There
is a ponde closed about with wall of tyle and of stone. In that ponde men
wasshe and bathe right often / and every man feleth the water hot or cold
right as he will himself. There been salt wells far from the sea and been
salt all the weke long unto saterdaye at noone / And fresshe fro saterdaye at
noone unto mondaye. The water of these wells when it is soden torneth into
small salt fair and white. Also there is a ponde / the water thereof has
wonder werkynge / For though all an hooste stood by the ponde and turned their
face thyderwarde the water would draw him vyolently toward the ponde and wete
al their clothes / so should horse be drawn in the same wise. And if the face
be to^ned away fro the water the water (...) the not. There is a well that no
(...) neth fro ne neither thereto and yet (...) manner of fysshe be taken therein
se at well le is but.xx. foot long and xx. foot (...) de / and not deep but
to the knee. and (...) sethe with high banks on every side. In the country
about wynchestre is a den or a cave / out of that cave blo^^^eth always a
strong wind so that no man may endure to stand tofore (...) den or cave.
There also a ponde that torneth tree into iron if it be therein a year. And so
trees ben shapen into whestones. Also there is in the top of an hylle buryels
every man that comes and meteth that buryel / he shall find it even of his
own lenth and mesure. And if a pilgrim knele thereto anon he shall be all
fresshe and feel no gryef of wetynes. Gir in. top. Fast by the mynstre of
Wynbinney that is not far fro bathe is a wood that bears much fruit if the
trees of that wood fall into water or ground y^ is nyghe and lie there all a
year. the trees tornen into stones. Gir in (...) under the Cite of Chestre
renneth y^ River (...)

(...) nemons worms that were brought thither lived there / It was Iuged that
the^y land of man should long to Brytayne R. In that ylonde is sortylege and
wit checrafte used. For women there selle to shypmen wind as it were closed
under three knottes of threde. so that the moore wind he will have / the moo
knottes he must undo There often by day time me^ of that land seen men that been deed to fore hand byheded or hoole and what de the they deyed. Alyens
set their fete upon feet of the men of that land for too see such syghtes
as the men of that land done. Beda li.ii. Scotts dwelled first in this
Ylonde. Thanatos that is Tenet and is an ylonde besides Kente o and has that
name Thanatos of death of serpents for there ben none. And the earth thereof
sleeth serpents yborn in other sondes. There is noble corn land and
fruytfull. It is supposed that this Ylonde was hallowed and blessed of saint
Austen the first doctor of Englysshemen for there he arrived first.

Of the kings hye ways and streets Capitulo.viii.
MOlyuncyus king of Brytons. was the xiii. of them and ye first that gaf them
law. He ordained yt plow men folowes / gods temples and high ways that leden
men to Cytees and towns should have the fredom of color so that every man
that went to any of the yen for socour or for trespaas that he has do should
be saufe for poursute of all his enemies. But afterward for the ways were
uncertain and stryf was had. Therefore Belinus y^ king y^ was the foresaid
Moliuncius sone for to put away al stry fe and doubt / made four high kings
ways preuyleged with all preuylege and fredom. And the ways stretche through
the ylonde. The first and gretest of the four ways is called Fosse and
stretches out of the south into the north and begins from the corner of
Cornewale and passes forth by Deuenshyre by Somersete and forth besides
Tetbury upon Cottes would beside Couentre unto Leycestre / and so forth by
wild playnes toward New warke and ends at Lyncoln. The second chyef kings
high way is named wat lyngstrete and stretchethe thwarte ouere Fosse out of the
southeest into the norwest and begins at Dover and passes by the myddell of
Kente over Temse beside London by westmestre and so forth by saint Albon in the
weste side by donstaple by Scratforde by Towcetre by wedo^ by south Lylleborn
by Atheryston unto gylbertes hylle that now is called wrekene and forth by
Seuarne and passes besides wrokcestre and then forth to stratton and so
forth by the myddell of wales unto Cardykan and ends at Irysshe see. The
third way is called Erynnugestrete and streccheth out of the weste norweste
into the eest southeest / and begins in Meneuia that is saint Dauyds land
in weste Wales and stretches forth unto Southamton: The fourth is called.
Rykenyldestr^te and stretches forth by Worchestre by Wycombe and by
Birmyngeham by Lechefelde by Derby by Chestre field by York and forth unto
Tynmouthe.

Of the famous Ryuers and stremes Capitulo.viii.
THere ben three famous Ryuers re^ny^ge through Brytayn by y^ which three Ryuers
merchants of beyond the sea comen in ships in to Brytayn well nygh out of
all manner of nacyons and lands. These three Ryuers ben tem se. Seuarne and
Humbre. The sea ebbeth and flows at these three Ryuers and departs the three
prouynces of the Ylo^de as it were the three kyndoms asondre. The three parties
ben Loegria. Cambri a / and Northumbria. That been myddel England: wales. and
Northumbrelond R. These name Temse seems made one name of two names of two
Ryuers that been Tame and Yse for the River of Tame renneth besides Dorchestre
and falls in yse / therefore all the River frothe first head unto the eest see
is named Tamyse or Temse. Temse begins besides Tetbury that is three mile by
north Malmesbury. There the Temse spry^geth of a well that renneth eestwarde
and passes the Fosse and departs Glocestre shyre and wylshyre / and draws
with him many other wells and stremes and wexeth great at grecestre and passes
for the than toward Hampton and so forth by Oxenforde by wallynforde by
Redynge and by London. wilhelmus de pon. ca. ii. At haven of Sandwhiche it
fallethe in to the cest see / and holds his name xl mile beyond London: and
departs in some place Kente and Essex westsex and Mercia / that is as it were
a great dele of myddell England. R Seuarne is A River of Brytayn and is called
Habern in Brytons / and has that name Habern of Habern that was Estryldes
daughter Guendolon the queen drenched this Habern therein / therefore the Brytons
called the River Habern after y^ woman y^ was drowned therein / but by corrupt
latin it is called Sabrina Seuarne in English. Seuarne kegynneth in the
myddell of wales and passes first toward the eest unto Shrowesbury / and
then turned southward unto Bryggenorth wyrcestre and gloucestre and falls
into y^ west se besides Brystow and departs in some place England and wales.
wilhel de pon.li.iii. Seuarne is swyfte of sheme / fysshe craft is therein /
wodenes of y^s woe lowynge and of the whyrlynge water casts up and gadre to
hepe great hepes of gravel. Seuarne often aryseth and ouerfloweth the banks:
R* Humbre has that name of Humbre king of. Hunes. for he was drowned therein.
And renneth first a croke out of the southsyde of york and then it departed
the prouynce of Lyndeseye that longed sometime to the Merces from the other
contre Northumberlonde Trente and Ous (...) into Humbre and maken the River
(...) Treuysa. The merces were men as it were of myddell England as it shall
be said here after.

OF au^cyent cytees and towns. (...)
THe kyndome of (...) sometime made far (...) noble cytees without right many
(...) that were walled with toures with (...) and with bars strongly builded.
(...) These were the names of the (...) Caerlud that is London. Caerbran^^ that
is York. Caerkent that is (...) Caergoraukon that is worcethe. Caer^^rion that
is Leycestre. Caerdon that is. Gloucestre Caercolden that is Col^^stre Carrey
chat is Chichestre. Sarons called it sometime Cyssoncestre: Ca^^ry y^ is
Cyrcestre. Caerguent that is (...). Caergraunte that is Cambrigge. Caerleyll
that is Lugubalia and Karlylle. Caerpous that is Porchestre. Caerdrom that is
Dorchestre. Caerlud^^^ that is Lyncoln and Lynderolyn. Caer marthyn y^ is
Merlyns Cite Caersege^t y^ is S^e^tre and is upon Temse not fer from redyng
leon that is Caerlegyon also and byghtfyr ste Legecestre and now is named
Chestre Caerbathon that is bathe and hight sometime Athamannus Cite Caerpaladour
that is Septon that now hight Shaftes bury. R. Other cytees ben found in
chronicles for understanding of stories / of whom it shall follow. will de pon.
London is a ryall and a rich cite upon. tamyse. of burgeysses of riches of
merchants of chaffare and of marchau^dyse. Therefore it is that sometime when
derth of vytayls is in all England comnly at London it is best chepe because
of the buyers and sellers that been at London. Gau fre. Brute the first king of
Brytons builded and edyfied this cite of London y^ first cite in remembrance
of the cite of Troy y^ was dystroyed and called it Tro ye neweth and
Trinouantu^ that is new Troy Afterward king Lud called it Caerlud after his
own name. therefore ye Brytons had indygnacion as Gyldas / tells. Afterward
Englysshmen called the cite London / and yet after y^ Normans called it
londres. and is named in latin londoma. Rudhudibras king Leyles sone. was the
viii. king of Brytons / he builded Caunterbury the chyef cite of Kent and
called it Caerkent. Afterward Englysshmen called it Doroberma / but y^ is not
Dover y^ stondeth upon the clyf of y^ Frensshe se and is from this Dover.xii.
English mile. Afterward this Doroberma was and is called Canterbury. The
same king. Rudhudibris buyldede wynchestre. and called it Caerguent and after
Englysshmen called it went and wynchestre after the name of one wine an
English man that was bishop there All westsax on was subgette to him / the
same king builded Pasadour y^ is Septon that now is called Shaftesburye
Brytons tellen y^ an Egle prophesied there sometime. Bladud. Leyles sone a
Nygromancer was y^ ix. king of Brytons / he builded Bathe and called it
Caerbathon. Englysshmen called it after Athamannus cite. But at the last men
called it Bathonia that is Bathe. Wylhel. depon.li.ii. In this cite welleth up
and spryngeth hoote bathes and men wene that Iulyus Cezar made there such
bathes. R. But Gaufre. monemutensis in his brytons book / says that Bladud
made thylke bathes because wyllyam has not seen that brytysshe book wrote so
by telly^ge of other men / or by his own gessynge as he wrote other things
not best auysedly. Therefore it seems more sothely that Bladud made not the
hoote bathes / ne Iulyus cezar did such a deed though Bladud builded and made
the Cite. but it accordethe better to kyndely reason that the water renneth in
the earth by veins of brymstone and sulphur and so it is kyndly made hoot in
that course and spryngeth up in diverse places of the cite. And so there be^
hoote bathes that wassheth of tetres soores skabbes / Treuisa. Though men might
by craft make hot bathes for to endure long enough / this accords well to
reason and to philosophy that treats of hot wells and bathes that been in
diverse lands though the water of this bathe be more trobly and sourer of
savor and of smell than other hot bathes been that I have seen at Akon in
Almayne. And eyges in Sauoye / which been fair and clear as any well streme I
have been bathed therein and assayed them. R Claudius Cezar married his daughter
to Arui ragus king of Brytons. This Claudius cezar builded Gloucestre in the
wedding of his daughter. Brytons called this cite first after Claudius name
but afterward it was called Glocestre after one Glora which was duke of that
contree and stondeth upon Seuarne in the march of England and wales^
Shrowesbury is a cite upon Seuarne in the march of Englonge and Wales is set
up ponne the top of an hylle / And it is called / Shrowesburye of shrobbes
and fruit that grew there somtym on that hylle Brytons called it sometime
Pengwerne y^ is y^ head of a fair tree. Shrowesbury was sometime the head of
powesye that stretches forth thwart over y^ myddell of wales unto the Irysshe
see Notyngham stondeth upon Trente and sometime heet Notyngham y^ is the wonnyng
of dens / for y^ Danes dwelled there sometime and dygged dens and caves
under hard stones and rocks and dwelled there. R. Lyncoln is chyef of the
prouynce of Lyndeseye and was called sometime Caer ludcoit and afterward
Lyndecoln. It is uncertain who builded first this cite but yt it were king
Lud / and so it semethe by menynge of the name / for Caer is brytysshe and is
to say a cite and coit is a wood and so it semethe that Caerludcoit is to say
Luddes wode town King Leyr was Bladuddes sone and builded Leycestre / as it
were in the myddell of England upon the River Sos and upon Fosse the kings
hye way.

York is a great cite in either side of the water, of Ouse that seemed as fair
as Rome unto the time y^ the king wyllyam had with brennynge and fire defouled
it and the country a / boute. So that a pilgrim would now weep and he saw it
/ if he had known it tofore. Gaufre. Ebrancus the.v king of Brytons builded
York and called it after his own name Caerbranck he builded also two oath
cytees one i^ scotlo^d and is called Edinburgh / and an other toward Scotlond
in thend of England and is called Alcliud. R. Edinburgh is a Cite in the land
of Pictes between the River of Twede and the Scottesshe see and heet sometime y^
castle of Maidens and was called afterward Edinburgh of Edan king of pictes y^
reigned there in egfridus time king of Northu^brelond. Alcliud was sometime a
noble cite / and is now well nygh unknow to all Englysshmen. for under the
Brytons and Pyctes and englysshme^ it was a noble cite to y^ comy^g of the
Danes. But afterward abowtee y^ year of our lord.viii.C.lxx. it was
desstroyed when y^ Daues distroyed y^ countrees of Northumbrelonde. But in what
place of Brytayne that cite. Alcliud was builded. Auctours telle^ dyuersesy.
Beda.li.i. says that it was builded by west y^ arm of the sea that departed
between the Brytons and y^ Pyctes sometime there Seuerns famous wall ends
westewarde / and so it seems by him y^ it is not far from Caerleyll for that
cite is set at the end of that wall. Othere wyters of stories written that the
cite of (...) is that cite yt now is called Aldburgh y^ is to say an old town
/ and stands upon the River Ous not far fro Burgh^^^dge / that is.xv. mile
westwarde out of York / and it seems that he preueth that by Gaufride in his
bake of deeds of ^^^^tons / he writes that Elidurus king of Brytons was lodged
at the cite (...) by cause of solace and hunting and (...) his brother Argalon
maskynge in (...) de nygh there beside y^ high (...) but that wood Calatery
which is (...) in English recheth almost to York and stretches toward y^
north by Aldburgh in length by space of.xx ^nyle the most dele of that wode is
now drawn dow^e and the land ytylled Other men wo^de suppose y^ Alcliud was
that cite (...) called Burgham in the north conty^^ of westmerlonde fast by
Comberlond and stands upon the River Eden the cite is there wonderlyseen.
Demeye now where it is builded. Treuyla. It is not bar de to assoyle if men
take heed / that many towns bear one name as Cartage in Affryca and Cartag in
Spain. New port in Wales and Newparte in the parysshe of Barkeleye Wottonne
under egg and wotton passes Wykwar will: pain. and wyk in the parysshe of Bar
keleye. And two shyre town eythere is called Hampton / is Southamptonne and
Northampton so it seems by the stories that one Alcliud was in yorkshyre / an
other in westmerlonde / and one fast by the right side of the west arm of the
se that departs England and Scotlonde / But y^ Alcliud was a right strong
cite as Beda says. And y^ cite stands fast by a River y^ is called Cliud.
And there is no such River in yorkshyre neythere in westmerlonde as men of the
contre tell me. Some men say that the River Cliud is now named Sulwach.
Sulwatche is but five mile fro Caerleyll which is a cite in the contre of
north England / toward the northwest and has another name which is Luguball
Leyll the.vii. king of Brytons builded Caerleyll. R. In this cite is somewhat
of that famous wall y^ passes Northumberlonde. will hell. de pon In this cite
is yet a three chambred house made of vawte stones that never might be dystroyede
with tempeste. of weder ne with brennynge of fire also in the contree fast by
in westmerlonde in the front of a three chamber place is written in this manner.
Marn.v. ctori. What this writynge is to say I doubt somewhat but if it were so
y^ some of the Combres lay there some time when the counsel. Marius had put
him outof ytalye / But it seems better that it is written in mind of Marius
king of Britons yt was. Aruiragus sone. This Marius ouercom in yt place
Rodryke king of Pictes So says Gaufre in his brytysshe book. william
malmesburi saw never that book At Hagulstaldes church is a place.lxxx. mile
out of york norwestwarde y^ place is as it were dystroyed / so says
wylhel.li.iii. de pon. That place longed somtym to y^ bysshopryche of york /
there were sometime houses with vice arches and voutes in the manner of Rome.
Now that place is called. Hestoldesham and Heglesham al so. Beda.li.iii. ca.i.
says. That that place is fast by the long wall of the / work of Rome in
the north half. R. There is dyffere^ce between the prouynce of Lyndeffar and
the church Lyndefarne / For the prouynce of Lyndeffar and Lyndeseye is all one
/ and lyethe by cest Lyncolne and Lyncoln is the head thereof / of y^ which
says Beda.li.iiii.ca.xi. that Sexwulfus was first bishop there. but
Beda.li.iiii.ca.xxiii. says. That Lyndeffar church is an ylond that is called
holy ylonde in the River of Twede next Barwyk. And so it is gadred of Bedaes
sawes that, Twede renneth into the famous arm of the sea that now departs
Englysshmen and Scotts in the eest half and in that arm ben three ylondes,
that one is Maylros that now is called menros. Then above toward the west
is Lyndeffarn church that is called holy ylonde: Then y^ third is above
upward and is the ylonde Farn / and is called also ferny ylonde. Then upward
above that two mile is a ryall cite upon ye brynke of Twede / that sometime
hight. Bebanburgh that is Bobbes cite / and now is called Bamburgh and has
aryght strong castle. Gir. initenere. two cytees there ben either is called
Caerlegy on and Caerleon also. one is Demycya in southwales that is named
Caeruske also there the River of Vskefal^eth into Seuarne fast by Glamorgan.
Bellinus king of Brytons sometime builded y^ cite and was sometime the chyef
cite of Demecia in sough wales. Afterward in Claudius cezars time it was called
the. cite Legyons when at prayer of Geniust he queen Vespacyanus and
Aruiragus were accorded and Legyons of Rome were sent into Irlonde / tho was
Caerleon a noble cite and of great auctoryte / and by the Romans ryally
builded and walled about with walls of brent tyle. Great nobley that was
there in old time is there yet in many places seen as the great palayses
gyauntes toures noble bathes / releef of the temples places of the atrees /
that were places high and ryall to stand and syte in. and to behold about
The places were ryally closed with ryal walls that yet somdele stondeth right
nyghe cloos. And within the walls and without is great building under earth
/ water conduytes and ways under earth and stews / also thou shall see
wonderly made / with strayte side ways of brethynge that wonderly cast up
heete. In this Cite were sometime three noble chirches / one was of saint Iuliust
y^ martyr and therein a great company of vyrgynes. That other was of saint
Aaron that was of the order of black Chanon that church was right nobly
adourned. The third church was the chyef mother church of all wales and the
chyef see. But afterward y^ chyef se was turned out of y^ cite i^to meneuia yt
is saint dauyds lord in west wales. In this Caerleon was amphibalus born that
taught saint Albon There the messagers of Rome come too great Arthurs court /
if it is leeff ^ll too trow Treuisa. if / Giraldus was in doubt whether it
were leeffull for to trow or not / it were a wonder shewenge as me^ would wene
for to have evermore in mind / and ever be in doubt if all his books were
such what lore were therein and namely while he makes none euydence for in
neither side he tells what meue the him so to say. R. There is an other Cite
of Legyons. there his Chronicles were bytrauaylled as it is clearly known by
the first chapter of this book Treuysa. That is to understanding in the
latin writing For he that made it in latin turned it not into English ne it
was turned into English in the fame place that it was first in latin. The
understanding of him that made this Chronicles is thus written in latin in the
beginning of this book. Presentem cronicam compilauit frater Ranulphus
Cestrensis monachus. That is to say in English. Brother Ranulph monk of
Chestre compiled and made this book of the Chronicles. R. The Cite of Legyons
y^ is Chestre stondeth in the March of England toward wales between two
arms of the se that been named de and Mersee. This Cite in time of Brytons was
heed and chyef cite of all Venedocia / that is Northwales. The founder of this
cite is unknown For who y^ sees the foundementes of the great stones would
rather wene that it were Romans work or work of Gyauntes than it were set
by werkynge of Brytayns. This Cite sometime in Brytysshe speech heet. Caerthleon
Legecestre in (...) and Chestre in English and the cite of Legyons also. For
there lay a (...) legyons of knights that Julius (...) sent for to win
Irlonde. And (...) Claudius cezar sent Legyons out of (...) cite for to win
the ylonde that be ^^^led Orcades / what ever wyllyam ^^^mesbury by telling of
other men mente of this cite. This cite has plente of ^^^^uelode of corn of
flesh of fysshe and ^^^cyally of price of samon this ^rte ^^^^ueth great
marchaundyse and send (...) out also. Also night this cite ben (...) wells /
metal and oor Northumbres ^^^^troyed this cite sometime. But after (...) de
Elfleda lady of Mer^a builded (...) ^^gayne and made it much more. In (...)
same cyce ben ways under the c^th with vowtes and stone work wonderly
^^^^ought / three chamber works great stones ygrauen with old men's names
therein There is also Julius cezar name wonderly in stones ygraue and other
nooble men's also with the writing about. This is the cite that Ethelfride
king of Northumberlonde* distroyed and slew there fast by night two
thousand monks of the mynster of Bangor This is the cite that king Edgar
come the^^der sometime with un. kings that (...) subget to him. Amesrer
brekethe out in this manner in praysynge this cite. Chestre castle town as
it were name takes of a castle. It is unknown what man builded this cite
now. Tho Legecestria chees heet now town of legyones Now Walsshe and
English hold this cytee of great price. Stones on wall / seems work

Henry king / earth is there right dwelling / Of king Haralde / poudre is

Protheus and Pluta / regnen there in the town Treuysa. God wot what this is
too mean / but poets in their manner speech faynen as though every kind craft
and living had a diverse god eueryche from other. And so they feyned a god of
battle and of fighting called him Mars. and a god of couetyse and richesse
and marchaundyse and called him Mercurius. And so Bachus is called god of wine
Venus goddess of love and beauty / Lauerna god of theeft and of robbery.
Protheus god of falshede and of gyse and. Pluto god of hell. And so it seems
that these verses would mean / that these foresaid gods regne and ben served
in Chestre Mars with fighting and cokkynge. Marcurius with couetyse and
richesse. Bachus with great drinking. Venus with love lewdly. Lauerna with
theeft and robbery Protheus with falshede and gyle. Then is Pluto not unserved
that is god of hell R* There babylon lore more might has troth the more.

Of prouynces and shyres. ca.x.
Take heed that England conteyneth xxxii. shyres and prouynces that now ben
called Erldoms reserved Cornewale and the ylonde. Alfre The se ben the names of
the Erldoms and shyres. Kente Sousex Sothery Hampshyre Barokshyre that has his
name of a bare oak that is in y^ foreste of wyndesore for at that bare oak men
of that shyre were wont to come together and make their treatys / and there
take counseyll and advise. Also wyldshyre that heet somtymee y^ prouynce of
Semeran Somersete Dorsete Deuenshyre that now is called deuonia in latin.
These.ix. South shyres the Tamyse departed from the other deal of England
which were sometime governed and ruled by the westsaxons law Eestsex Myddelsex
Southfolke Northefolke Herdeforth shyre Huntyngdon shyre Northampton shyre
Cambridgeshyre Beddeforth shyre Buykyngham shyre. Leycestre shyre Derby shyre
Notyngham shyre Lyncolnshyre Yorkeshyre Durha^shyre Northumberlonde
Caerleyllshyre with Cumberlonde Appelby shyre with Westmerlonde Lancastre shyre
that conteyneth five little shyres. These fyftene North and Eest shyres were^
sometime governed and ruled by the law called Mercia in latin and marchene law
in English It is to wit y^ Yorkeshyre stretches from the River of Humbre
unto the River of Teyse / And yet in Yorkeshyre ben.xxii. hondredys: hundred
and candredes is all one. Candrede is one word made of walshe and Irysshe /
and is too menynge a country that conteyneth an hundred towns / and is also
in English called Wepentak / for sometime in the coming of a new lord
tenauntes were wont to yield up their wepen instead of homage. Duramshyre
stretches from the Rynere of Teyse unto the Ryuere of Tyne. And for to spke
propr ely of Northumberlonde it stretches froo y^ River of Tyne unto y^ River
of Twede That is in the beginning of Scotlonde. Then if the country of Northum
berlonde that was sometime from Hu^bre unto Twede be now a counted for one
shyre and one Erledom as it was sometime. Then ben in England but.xxxii shyres.
but if the country of Northumberlond be departed into.vi. shyres that been
Euerwykshyre Duramshire Northumberlonde Caerleylshyre Appelbyshyre Lancastre
shyre. then ben in England.xxxvi. shyres without Cornewale and also without
the ylondes. King wyllyam made all these prouynces and shyres to be descryued
and moten. Then were founden.xxxvi shyres and half ashyre Towns two and fyfty
thousand and four score Parysshe chirches.xlv. thousand and two Knights
fees.lxxv. thousand / whereof men of relygyon have.xx.vii. thousand and.xv.
knights fees. But now the woods ben hewn down and the land new tylled
and made much more than was at that time and many towns and vyllages builded
and so there ben many mo vyllages and towns now than were in that time. And
were as a fore is written that Cornewale is not set among the shyres of
England it may stand among them well enough for it is neither in wales ne in
Scotlond but it is in England and it Joins unto Deuenshyre / and so may
there ben atcompted in England.xxxvii. shyres and an half with the other
shyres.

De legibus legu^que vocabulis.
OVnwallo that hight Moliuncius also made first laws in britayne the which
laws were called Moliuncius laws / and were solempnely observed unto wyllyam
Conquerours time. Moliuncyus ordained among his laws that Cytees Temples and
ways that leden men thereto / and plowe men solowes should have preuylege and
fredome for to save all men that would fletherto for socour and refuge. Then
afterward Mercia queen of Britons that was Gwytelinus wife of her the prouynce
had the name of Mercia as somman suppose. She made a law full of wit and of
reason / and was called Merchene law. Gildas that wrote y^ Cronicles and
hystories of the Brytons turned these two laws out of Bryton speech into
latin. And afterward king Aluredus turned all out of latin in too Saxons
speech / and was called marchene law. Also the same king Aluredus wrote in
English and put to an other law that hight westsaxon law Then afterward
Danes were lords in this land / and so came forth the third law that heet
Dane law. Of these three laws saint Edward the third made one commune law
that yet is called saint Edwardes law. I hold it well done to write here and
expowne. many terms of these laws Myndebruch hurtyng of honor and

Of kyngdoms of bounds and marks between them. ca.xii.
THe kingdom of Brytayne stood without departing hole and all one kingdom
to the Brytons from the first Brute unto Julius Cezars time / and fro Julius
Cezars time unto seuerus time this land was under trybute to the Romans.
Nevertheless kings they had of the same land from Seuerus unto the last
prince Gracya^ successors of Brytayne failed and Romans reigned in Brytayn
Afterward the Romans left of their regnynge in Brytayne by cause it was
far from Rome / and for great business that they had in other side /
Then Scotts and Pyctes by mysledynge of Maximus the tyrau^t pursewed Brytayn
and warred there with great strength of me^ of arms long time unto the time
that the Saxons come at the prayenge of the britons against the Pyctes / and
put out Gurmonde she Iryss he king with his Pyctes and the Brytons also with
her king that heet Careticus and drofe hem out of England into wales / and
so y^ Saxons were vyctours and every prouynce after his strength made hy^ a
ky^ ge. And so departed England into seven kyngedomes. Netheles afterward
these seven kyngedomes euerychone after other came all in to one kyngedome^ All
hole under the prince Adelstone Netheles the Danes pursewed this land fro
Adelwolfys time that was Aluredes fader unto the third saint. Edwardes time
about a hundred.lxx. year that reigned contynuelly therein.xxiii. year and a
little more. and after him Haralde held the kingdom.ix. mouethes. And after
him Norma^s have reigned unto this time. But how long they shall regne he wot
to whom no thing is unknown. R. Of the foresaid seven kingdoms and her
marks mares and bounds when they began and how long they endurede here
shall I some what shortly tely. Alfre. The first kingdom was the kingdom of
Kente. that shetcheth fro the cest Occyan unto the Ryuere of Tamyle. There
reigned the first Hengistis / and began to regne by the acomptynge of Dyonise
the year of our lord a hundred.lv. that kingdom dured three hundred and:
lviii. year.xo. kings unto the time that Baldrede was put out and Egbert
king weste saxon Joined that kingdom to his own the second kingdom was at
southesaxon that had in the eest side Rent. in y^ south the sea and the isle of
wight / in y^ west hampshyre / and in the north sothery there Ella reigned /
first with his three sons / and began to regne the year after the coming of
y^ Angles even.xxx. but that kingdom within short time passed into the other
kingdoms / The third kingdom was of eestsaxon / and had in the eest side the sea / in the country of London / in the south Temse and in the north
southfolke. The kings of this country of westsaxon fro the first. Sebertes
time unto the time of the danes were.x. kings the which were (...) gect
somdele to other kings. Nevertheless ofteste and lengeste they were under the
kings of Mercta and unto that time that Egbert the king of westsaxon Joined
that kyngedome to his own The fourth kingdom was of eest Angles and
conteyneth Northfolke and southfolke / and had in the eest side / and in y^
north side the sea / and in the north west Lambrigeshyre / in the west saint
Edmo^des dyche and Herfordshyre / and in the south Estsex / And this kingdom
dured under twelve kings unto the time that king Edmonde was slain. And then
the Danes took wronfully both the kyngedoms of eest Angles and of estsaxon
Afterward the Danes were put out and driven away or made subgette. And then
the elder king Edward Joined both the kingdoms too his own. The fyfte
kingdom was of westsaxon and dured lengeste of al these kyngdo^s / and had in
the eest side southsaxon / in the north Tamyse / in the south and in the west
the sea Dccean. In that kingdom reigned Serdryk with his sone Kenryk. and began
to regne the year of our lord five hundred and: xix. and then after the
coming of Angles.lxxi. so says Denis the other kyngdoms passed into this
kingdom: The syxt kingdom was of Mercia and was grettest of all. The marks and
the meres thereof were in y^ west side of the River Dee fast by Chestre and
Scuarne fast by shrowesbury / unto Brystowe / in the eest the eest see / in
the south Tamyse unto London / in the north the River of Humber. and so
westwarde and downwarde unto the River Merse unto y^ corner of Wythall / there
Humbre falls into the west se. Penda Wybbes sone reigned first in this
kyngedom in the year of our lord Ihesu cris te.vi. hundred.xxvi. so says Denis
and fro the coming of Angles an hundred lxxv. year. This kingdom dured under
xvii. kings about two hundred.lxiii. year unto the last Colwulf the Danes
betoke that kingdom to keep when burdred the king was put out / but the elder
Edward the king put out the danes and Joined the kingdom of Mercia to his
own kingdom. Netheles at the beginning this kingdom of mercia was departed
into three / in west mercia / in myddell Mercia / and rest / Mercia The.vii.
kyngedome Was Northamhymbrorum that is y^ kingdom of Northhumberlonde / the
meres and Marks thereof were by west and by eest the se of Dccean / by southe
the Ryuere of Humbre and so downwarde to ward the weste by the end of the
shyres of Notyngha^ and of Derby unto the River of Merse and by north the
Scotts see that heet forth in Scotts / Weres in Brytysshe. the Scottesshe
see in English / This kyngedome of Northumberlonde was first dealed in two
prouynces That one was the south side and heet / Deyra and that other was the
north side and heet Brenicia / as it were two kyngedomes / and the River
departed these two kingdoms that time / for the kingdom of Deyra was from the
Ryuere of Humbre unto the River of Tyne. The kyngedome of Brenicia was fro Time
to the Scottysshe see / And when Py^^^ dwelled there as Beda says.li.iii.
ca.ii That Ninian that holy man converted men of the south side. Ida the king
reigned there first and began to regne the year of our lord five hondrede
xlvii. so says Dyonyse. In Deyra reigned king Elle the year of our lord
five hundred / xlix. These two kingdoms were otherwhyle as it is said
departed between two kings and somty me all hole under one king / and dured
as it were.xx. English kings. CCC. xxi. year At last Dsbartus and
Ellewere slain in the.ix. year of her kyngedom the Danes slew them / and
Northumberlonde was void without king viii. year. Then afterward the Danes
reigned in Northumberlonde.xxxvi. year unto the oonynge of the kingdom Adelstone
/ he made subgect the kings Danes Scott^sshe and walshe and reigned first
allone in England and held y^ ky^gedome of England all hole and all one
kingdom yt was the year of our lord. viii. C.xxviii That River of merse was
sometime y^ mark and mere bytweene the kingdom of Mercia and the kingdom of
Northu^berlond / yt may be showed in two manners first by this properte of this
mersee / yt is as much to say as a see y^ is a bound and a mere for it
departed one kingdom from an other. Also it is written in Cionides of Henry and
Alfrede y^ kynged ward y^ elder fastened a castle at Mamcestre in
Northu^berlonde / but y^ cite Ma^cestre is fro the River of Mersee scarsely
three mile.

Of bysshopriches and their sees ca.xiii
LVcius was y^ first king crystened of the Brytons / in his time were three
Archcbysshops sees in Brytayn / one was at London / an other at york / and the
third Caerusk y^ cite of Legyons in Glamorgan / that cite is now called
Cacrleo^. To these. Archebysshoppes sees were subgecte.xxviii. bishops and
were called flammes. To the Archebysshops sec of London was subgett Corn wayle
and all myddell England unto humbre. To York all Northumberlo^de from y^ bow
of Hu^bre with all Scotlo^de. To Caerleon all wales there were in wales.vii.
bishops / and now ben but four Tho Seuarne departed England and wales.
wilhel. de pon.liii. But in the Saxons time though saint Gregori. had granted
London the preuylege of tharchebysshops see. Netheles saint aus ten y^ was
sent into England by saint Gregory turned that charchebysshop see out of
London into Canterbury. After say^e Gregory's days at y^ prayer of king
Ethelbryght and Cytezeyns and burgeyses of Canterbury / there that hebysshops

restored to Caunterbury again. The worship of y^ see of York has dured there
always and yet dureth though Scotlonde be withdraw fro his subieccyon by
passing of time Gir initenere.li.i. The archebysshop pes see was turned out of

y^ bishop of Mencuia of saint Dauyds / and the bishop of Mencuia was sacredr
of the bishops of wales as of his suffrigans and made no professyon ne
subjection to none other church. Other bishops that come afterward were
sacredr at Caun terbury by compellynge and heest of the king / in token of
that sacrynge and subieccyon. Boneface archebysshop of Cau^ terbury that was
Legate of the Cross song in every Cathedral church of wa les solempnely.
Amas he was the first archebysshop of Canterbury that so did in wales / and
that was done in the second Henryes time. R. But now been but two primates in
all England of canterbury and of York. To y^ prymate of Caunterbury vert
subgettr.xiii. bishops in England and.iiij. in wales. The prymate of york
has but two suffeygans in England yt ben the bishop of Caerleyll and of
Durham: Of all these sees and chaungynge of her places I shall show you here
following. Take heed in the beynnynge of holy church in England bishops
ordained their sees in low places and simple y^ were couenable for
co^te^placo^n for prayers and devotion. But in wyllyam conquerours time by done
of law: Canon it was ordained yt bysshoppes should come out of small towns in
to great cytees. Therefore was the se of Dorchestre changed to Lyncoln:
Lychefelde to Chestre. Tetforde to Norwyche Shyrborn to Salesbury. wells to
Bathe. Cornewayle to Exestre / and Seleseye to Chichestre. The bishop of
Rochestre has no parysshe but he is the archebysshops chapelayn of
Canterbury. Sith y^ see of Canterbury was first ordained by saint Auste^ / it
changed yet never his place. Chichestre has under him oonly Southsex and y^
isle of wight / and had his se first in Seleseye in y^ time of y^ archebysshop
Theodore / and y^ see dured there. CCC.xxxiii. year under.xx. bishops fro yt

De episcopis occide^talibus wilhelmus
Have mind yt all the prouynce of westsaxon had always one bishop fro y^

of westsaxon. fro that time y^ cite and the sea of Dorchestre perteyned and
longed to y^ prouynce of Mercia / that cite stands within Temse. and y^ Temse
departed between Mercia and westsaxon. After that Agtbert was put out of
wynchestre that tho hight wynto^ the^ was there an English bishop that was
called wine. Some men suppose that this cite has y^ name of this wine / and is
called Wynchestre as it were wine cite. At y^ last he was put out / and after

was done after that Wilfred had been bishop of York / and Cumbert at
Hagustalde church / and Eata at Lyndeffar church that now is called holy
ylonde in the Ryuert of Tw^de. Aydanus found first the sea. And Theodorus
made Eadhedus bysshopp of Repoune yt was comen again out of Lyndeseye. Wilfred

thendes of England fast by Scotlonde in a place y^ heet Candida casa. and
whiterne also. there saint Ninian a Bryton was first founder and doctor. But
all these sees ourtake york failed little and little for the sea of Candida
casa yt is Gallewaye y^ tho longed to England and dured many years under.x.
bishops unto y^ it had no power by destroyenge of y^ Pectes. The sees of
Hagustalde and of Eyndeffa^ was sometime all one under.lx. bishops about four
score year and ten and dured unto y^ coming of y^ Danes. In that time under
Hyngar and Hubba arduf y^ bishop read long about with saint Cuberts body unto

Caunterbury has four suffrygans in Wales that been Landaf saint Dauyes Bangor
and saint assaph The archebysshop of York has now but two bishops under him
that been Durham and Carcleyll. R. And so ben but two prymates in England what
of hem shall do to the other and in what manner point he shall be obedyent and
under him. It is fully contained within about the year of our lord Ihesu
christ a thousand: lxxii. tofore the first king wyllyam and the bishops of
England by commandment of the pope. the cause was handled and treated between
y^ foresaid prymates and ordained and demed that the prymate of York shall be
subgette to the prymate of Caunterbury in things that longen to the worshypp
of god and to the believe of holy church so that in what place ever it be in
England the the prymate of Canterbury wit hot and constreyne togader a
counseyl of clergy the prymate of york is holden with his suffrygans for to be
there and for to be obedyent to the ordinance that there shall be lawfully
ordained When the primate of Caunterbury is dedeche primate of york shall come
to Caunterbury and with other bishops he shall sacre him that is chosen / and
so with othere bishops he shall sacre his own prymate / if the primate of
York be deed / his successor shall come unto the bishop of Caunterbury and
he shall take his or denaunce of him and take his oath with prosessyon and
lawful obedyence. After about the year of our lord.xi.C.lxxxxv in the time
of king Richard ben resons set for the right party for either prymate and
what one prymate did to y^ other in time of Thurstinus of Thomas and of other
bishops of york from the conqueste unto king Henryes time the third. Also
there it is said how each of them start from other. This place is but a
forspekynge and not a full treatys thereof / Therefore it were noyfull to charge
this place with all thylke reasons

Of how many manner people have dwelled therein. ca.xiiii.
BRytons dwelled first in this ylond y^.xviii. year of Hely y^ prophet /
y^.xi. year of Solmus postumus king of Latyns.xliii. after the taking of
Troy / tofore the building of Rome CCCC.xxxii. year. Beda.li. j^ They come
hyder and took her course from armonyk yt now is y^ other Britayn they held
long time y^ south cou^tres of y^ yloude It befell afterward in Despasianus
tym duke of Rome / that the Pyctes shypped out of Scycya in to Dccean / and
were driven abowte wiche the wind and encred in to the Norche costs of
Irlonde and found there Scotts and prayed to have a place to dwell I^ne and
might none get. for Irlonde as Scotts said might not sustain both people
Scotts sent the Pyctes to the north side of england and behyght them help
ayenste the Brytons that were their enemies if they would arise / and took them
wives of their daughters / upon such condition if doubt fylle / who should
have ryg ht to be king they should rather these he^ of y^ mother side tha^ of
y^ fader side of the wome^ky^ rather tha^ of y^ me^ ky^ Gaufre. In Vespasyan
the Emperous time when Marius Armragus sone was king of Brytons One Rodryk
king of Pyctes came out of Scicia and ganne to destroyed Scotlonde / Martus the
king slew this Rodryk and gave the north party of Scotlond that heet
Cathenesia to the men that were came with Rodryke and were overcome by him /
for to dwell inn / But thesemen had no wives ne none might have of the nation
of Brytons / therefore they saylled into Irlonde and took to their wives
Irysshmens daughters by that couenau^te that y^ mother blood should be put
tofore in succession of heritage. Girca.xvii. Netheles Sirinus super Vyrgilium
says that Pictes agatyrses that had some dwelling place about the waters of
Scicia / and they ben called Pyctes of Peyntynge and smiting of wounds /
therefore they are called pyctes as painted men. These men and these gorhes ben
all one people for when Maximus the tyrant was went out of Brytayne into
France for to occupye thempyre. Then Gratianus and Valentinianus that were
brethern and fellows of thempyre brought these goths out of Scicia with great
gifts with flaterynge and fair behestes intoo the north country of Brytayne.
for they were stalworth and strong men of arms and so these thieves and
brybones were made men of land and of country and dwelled in the north
countres And held there Cytees and towns. Gaufre. Carancius the tyrant slew
Bassianus / and gaf the Pyctes a dwelling place in. Al bania that is Scotlond
/ there they dwell led long time afterward and meddled with Britons. R.
Thensyth yt P^^tes occupied first the north side of Scotlonde. It seems that
the dwelling place that this Carancius gaf them is the south side of Scotlonde
that stretchethe from the thwarte over wall of Romans work to the Scottesshe
see: and con teyneth Galleway and Lodouia that is Lodewaye. Therefore
Bedeli.iii. ca. ij. speaks in this manner. Nirua^ the holy man converted the
southe P^tes. Afterward the Saxons come and made y^ country long too Brencia
the north partiee of Northumberlonde unto the time that Kynadius Alpinus sone
king of Scotlonde put out y^ Pyctes and made that county that lies between
Twed and the Scottesshe see long to his kingdom. Beda.li.i ca.i. Afterward
long time the Scotts were led b^du^^ Renda and came out of Irlonde that is
propre country of Scotts and with love or with strenth made hem place fast by
the pyctes in the north side of that arm of the sea / that breketh into the
lo^d in the weste side that departed in old time between Britons and Parts.
Of this duke Renda the Scotts badde the name and were called Darlendinus as it
were Rendaes part for in ber spe^h a part is called dal. G^p. The ^^^tes
might have no wives of Brytons but they took hem wives of Irysshe scotts and
promised bem fair for to dwell with them and granted him a land by the sea
side there the sea is narowe That land is called now. Galleway Martanus
Irysshe Scottesshe londed at Argall y^ is scotten clyf for Scotts londed
therefore to do harm to y^ Brytons or for y^ place it next to Irlonde for to
come a land in Brytayne: Beda And so the Scotts after the Brytons and Pictes
made the third people dwelling in Brytayne R. Then after that come the
Saxons at prayenge of y^ Britons to help them against the Scotts and Pyctes.
And the Brytons were sone put out into wales. And Saxons ocupyed the lord
little and little. and efte more too the Scottysshe see. And so Saxons made the
fourth manner of men in the ylonde of Brytayne. Beda li. v. ca.ix. for Saxons
and Angles came out of Germani a / yet some Brytons that dwell nygh callen hem
shortly Germayns. R. Netheles about the year of our lord.viii. hundred
Egbartus king of westsaxon commanded and bad all men call the men of y^
land Englysshmen. Alfre Then after that the Danes pursued the land. abowte a
two hundred year / that is for to say fro the forsayde Egbartus time unto
saint Edwardes time / and made the fyfte manner of people in the ylonde But
they failed afterward. Atter last come Normans unto duke wyllyam and subdued
Englysshmen / and yet keep theye the land and they made the syxth people in the
Ylonde. But in the first King Henryes time come many flemynges and received a
dwelling place for a time beside Maylros in the west side of England / and
made the seventh people in the ylonde. Netheles by commandment of y^ same
king they were put thens and driven to Hauerfordes side in the west side of
wales. R. And so now in Brytayn Danes and Pyctes fayllen all out / and five
nacyons dwellen therein that been Scotts in Albania / that is Scotlonde.
Brytayne in Chambria that is Wales: but that flemynges dwell in yt is weste
wales. And Normans and Englysshme^ ben meddled in all the ylond / for it is now
doubt in stories how and in what manner they were put away and dystroyed
out of Brytayne. Now it is too declare how the Pyctes were dystroyed and
failed Gir p^. ca: vii. Brytayne was sometime occupied with Saxons / and peace
was made and stablysshed with the Pyctes / then the Scotts that came with
the Pyctes saw that the Pyctes were nobler of deeds and better men of arms
though they were less in nombre than the Scotts Then the Scotts having
thereof envy turned to their natural treason y^ they have often used for in
treason they pass other men and ben traitors as it were by kind. for they
prayed all y^ Pyctes and specially the great of them to a feast. and waited her
time when the Pyctes were merry and had well drunk they drew up nails that
held up holowe be^ches under the Pyctes and the Pyctes unware suddenly fill in
over the hammes into a wonderful pytfalle. Then the Scotts fell on the
Pyctes and slew the^ and left none alive. And so of two manner people the
better warryours were holy destroyed. But the other that been the Scotts which
ben traitors all unlike to the Pyctes took prouffyte by that falls treason /
for they took all that land and hold it yet unto this time and call it.
Scotlonde after her own name / In king Edgarus time Rynadius Alpinus sone was
duke and leder of the Scotts and warred in Pycte land and destroyed the
Pyctes. he warred syx sythes in Saxon and took all the land that is between
Twede and the Scottysshe see with wrong and with strength.

Of the langages of manners and usage of the people of that land. ca.xv.
AS it is known how many manner of people ben in this Ylonde there ben also so
many langages and tongues. Netheles walsshe and Scotts that been not meddled with
other nacyons keep yet their langage and speech but yet y^ scotts y^ were
sometime confederate and dwelled with pyctes draw so^what after there speech But
the flemynges that dwell in y^ west side of wales have left her strange
speech and speken like to Saxons / also Englysshmen though they had fro y^
beginning three manner of speches. sontherne Northern and myddell speech in the
(...) of the land as they come of thee manner of people. Germania. Ne^eles by
commixion and medlynge first with Danes and afterward with Normans in many
things the country langage in appared / for some use straung wlaff (...)
terynge harrynge garrynge and gry^^ytynge This apparinge of y^ langage comes
of two things / one because y^ chylorene that gone to scole learn to speak
first English / and than ben compelled to constrewe her lessons in Frensshe
and that have been used syn the Normans come into England: Also gentylmens
children be learned and taught from their youth too speak frensshe / and up
londesshmen will counterfete and lyken himself to gentyl men and are besy to
speak frensshe for to be more set by / wherefore it is said by a common
proverb. Jack would be a gentyl man if he could speak frensshe Treuisa. This
was much used to for the great death. but sith it is somdele changed / for sir
Joan Corn wayle a master of gramer chaungede the techynge of gramer scole and
construccion of frensshe in too English. And other scole masters use the
same way now in the year of our lord. a.M.CCC.lxxxv. the ix. year of king
Richard the second / and leave all frenssh in scoles and use all constructyon
in english wherein they have auau^tage one way that is that they learn the
sooner their gramer / and in another dysauauntage. for now theyl erne no
frensshe nor can no ne / which is hurt for them that shall pass the sea. And
also gentylmen have much left to teache their children to speak frensshe. R.
It seems a great wonder y^ Englysshmen have so great dyuersyte in their own
langage in sown and in speaking of it which is all in one ylonde. And the
langage of Normandye is come^ out of an other land and has one manner sown
among all them that speak it in England / for a man of ^ence southern western
and Northern me^ speken frenshe all syke in sown and speech but they can not
speak their English so. Treuisa. Netheles there ben as many diverse manner of
frensshe in the reame of frau^^e / as diverse English in the reame of
England. R. Also of the foresaid touge which is departed in three is great
wonder / formen of y^ eest with men of y^ ^est accord better in sownynge of
the^^ speech / than men of y^ north with men of ye south Therefore it is y^ men of
mer^^ y^ (...) of myddell England as it were part^^ers with y^ ends understand
better y^ (...) ^^^gages northern and southern tha^ northern and southern
understood either other (...) held po^.li.iii. All y^ la^gage of y^
North^^bres and special at york^ is so sharp shyttynge frottynge and vnshappe
that (...) southern men may uneath understand that langage. I suppose the
cause but (...) they be nyghe to the alyens that speak straungely. And also by
cause the kings of England abide and dwellt more (...) the south country than
in the north (...) tree. The cause why they abide more in the south country
than in the north (...) tree / is by cause that there is better (...) land
more people (...) noble (...) profitable havens in the south (...) than in the
north country:

De gentis huius mo^^^bus. Gir. in. itinere.
FOr the manners and doing of walsshmen and of Scotts ben tofore somewhat
declared. Now I purpose to tell and declare the condycions of the meddled
people of England. But ye flemynges that been in the weste side of Wales be^
now all turned as they were English men by cause they company with
Englysshmen. And they be mighty and strong to fight / and ben the most
enemies that walsshmen have / and use marchau^dyse and clothing and ben full
ready too put themself in auentures and to peril in thesee and land because
of great winning and ben ready sometime to the plowe and sometime to deeds of
arms when time and place axeth. It seems of these men a great wonder that
in a boon of a wethers right sholder when the flessheis soden away and not
roasted they know what have be done / is done / and shall be done as it were by
spyryte of prophecye and a wonderful craft. They tell what is done in far
cou^ties / tokenes of peace or of war / y^ state of y^ royame / sleynge of men
and spousebreche such things theye declare certain of tokenes and signs y^
is in such a sholder bone.. R. But the Englysshmen that dwell in England ben
meddled in the ylonde and ben far fro the places that they spronge of first
tornenne to the contrary deeds lyghtelye without entysynge of any other men
by her own assente: And vnesy also vnpacy cut of peace / enemies of besynes /
and full of slouthe. Wilhel. de pon.li.iij. says. That when they have
dystroyed their enemies all to the ground / then they fyghten with theyme
self and sleeth each other / as void and an empti stomak werketh in it self.
R. Netheles men of the south ben esyer and more mylde than me^ of the north.
For they be more unstable and more cruel and more vnesy. The myddell men ben
parteners with both. Also they use them to glotony more than other men and ben
more costlewe in mete and clothing. Men suppose that they took that vice of
king Herdeknot that was a Dane. For he heet let forth twyes double mess at
Dinner and at souper alsoo These men ben spedefull on horse and a foot. Able and
ready to all manner dedys of arms / and ben wont to have vyctorye and maystrye
in every fight where no treasonis walking / and ben curyous and can well tell
dedys and wondres that they have seen. Also they gone in diverse lon des uneath
ben any men rich in her ow ne land or more gracious in far and in strange
land / they can better win and get new than keep her own heritage /
Therefore it is that they be sprad so wide and went that every land be their
own. The men be able to all manner sleyght and wit / but tofore the deed
blonderynge and hasty: And more wise after the deed than tofore. and leven of
lightly what they have begone. Solinus li.vi. Therefore Eugenius the pope said
that Englysshmen were able to do what ever they would / and to be set and put
tofore all other / ne were that light wit lets. And as Hanyball said that
the Romans might not be overcome but in there own country so. Englysshmen
may not be overcome in strange lands but in her own country they be lightly
overcome. R. These men despysen her own and praise other men's. And uneath
be pleased nor apayd with their own estate what befalls and becomethe other
men / they will gladly take to the^ / self. Therefore it is that a yeman arayeth
him as a squire / a squyere as a knight a knight as a duke / a duke as a king
/ Yet some go a boute and will be like to all manner state and ben in no state.
For they take every degree that be of no degree for in berynge outward they be
myntrals and herowdes. in talking great spekers In etynge and drinking
glotons / In gaderynge of catell hucksters and tauerners. In array tormentours.
In wynnynges argi. In travail tantaly. In taking head dedaly. In beds
sardanapaly / In chyrches mawmetes. In courts thondre only in preuylege of
clergi and in preben des they knowleche he^self clerks. Treuysa As touching
the terms of latin as argi / tantali / dedali / serdanapaly / ye must
understand them as y^ poets feyned of them. Argus was an herd and kept
bestes he had an hundred even: and Argus was also a ship / a shypman and a
chapman / and so Argus might se before and behind and on every side. Therefore
he that is wise and ware and can se that he be not deceived may be called
argus. And so the Cronycle says in plurell nombre y^ Englysshmen ben argy. y^
is to say they se about where as winning is / That other word tantaly / y^
poet feyneth that Tantalus slew his own sone wherefore he is dampened to
perpetual penance / and he stands always in water up to the neither lyppe
and has always ripe apples and noble fruit hanging down too the ouerlyppe /
but the fruit ne the water may not come with in his mouth. he is so hold
and stands between mete and drink and may neither ete ne drink / and is
ever an ho^gred and a thyrste that woe is him alive by this manner likeness of
Tantalus they that do right naught there as is much is to do in every side
ben called ta^ta^y. It seems that it is to say in tra uayll they be tantaly /
for they do right naught thereto. The third word is dedale / take heed that
Dedalus was a subtle and a slyeman. And therefore by lykenes they that been
subtle and slye theye be called dedaly. And the fourth word is sardanapaly /
ye shall understand y^ Sardanapalus was king of Assyrye^s and was full
unchaste / and used him for to lie soft. And by a manner of lykenes of him they
that live unchastly ben called sardanapaly. R. But among all Englysshmen
meddled togyders is so great a chaungynge and dyuersyte of clothing and of
array and so many manners and diverse shappes that well nyghe is there any man
known by his clothing and his array of what some ever degree that he be Thereof
prophesied an holy Anchor in king Egelfredes time in this manner. Henry ii.vi.
Englysshmen for as much as they use them to dron^ lewnes / to treason and to
rechelesnes of gods house / first by Danes and then by Normans / and at the
third time by the Scotts that theye hold the most wretches and lest worth
of all other they shall be overcome. Then the world shall be so unstable and
so diverse and varyable that the unstableness of thoughts shall be bytokened by
many manner dyuersytees of clothing.

Here follows the descrypcyon of the land of Wales. Of the land of wales.
ca. xvi
Now this book takes on hand
Wales after England.
So take I my tales.
And wend into wales.
To that noble blood.
Of Pryamus blood.
Knowleche for to win.
Of great Iupyters kynne.
For to have in mind
Dardanus kind.
In these four tytles I fond
To tell thestate of that land
Cause of the man I shall tell
And then praise the land and well.
Then I shall weyte with my pen.
All the manners of the men
Then I shall fond.
To tell meruaylles of the land.
Of the name and wherefore it is named wales. ca.xvij.
WAles now is called wallia.
And sometime it heet Cambri^
For Camber Brutes sone
Was prince and there did wone.
Then wallia was to mean
For Gwalaes the queen
King Ebrancus child
Was wedded theder mylde
And of that lord and walon
Withdraws of the soun
And put to l.i. a.
And thou shalt find wallia
And though this land
Be much less than England
As good glebe is one as other
In the daughter as in the mother
Of the commodytees of the land of Wales. ca.xviii.
THough that land be luyt
It is full of corn and of fruit.
And has great plentey wys
Of flesh and eke of fysshe
Of beestes tame and wild
Of horse sheep oxen mylde
Good land for all seeds
For corn gras and herbs that spredes.
There ben woods and medes
Herbs and flowers there spredes
There ben Ryuers and wells
Valeyes and also hills
Valeyes bring forth flood
And hills metals good
Cooll grows under land
And gras above at bond
There lyme is copyous
And slates for house
Honey and milk white
There is deynte and not lyte
Of braket meet and ale
Is great plente in that vale
And all that needs to the live
That land brings forth ryue
But of great riches to be draw.
And close many in short saw
It is a corner small.
As though god first of all.
Made that land so feel
To be selere of all hele
Wales is deled by.
A water that heet Twy.
North wales from the south.
Twy deleth in places full couth.
The south heet Demicia
And the other Venedocia.
The first shoteth and arowes beres
That other deleth all with speres.
In wales how it be
Were sometime courts three.
At Carmerthyn was that one
And that other was in Moan
The third was in Powysy
In Pegwern yt now is Shrowesbury.
There were bishops seven
And now ben four even
Under Saxons all at hand
Sometime under princes of that land
Of the manners and rytes of the wasshemen. cn.xix.
THe manner living of that land
Is well diverse from England
In mete and drink and clothing.
And many other doing
They be clothed wonder well
In a shyrte and in a mantell
A cryspe breche well feign
Both in wind and in rain
In this clothing they be bold
Though the weder be right cold
Without shetes always.
Evermore in this array
They go fight play and lepe
Stand sytte lie and sleep
Without surcot gown cote and kyrtyll
Without iopen tabarde clok or bell
Without lace and chaplet that her lappes
Without hode heart or cappes
Thus arayd gone the segges
And always with bare legs
They keep none other going
Though they mete with the king
With arowes and short speres
They fight with them that them dert^
They fight be^ter if they neden
When they go than when they ryden
Instead of castle and toure
They take (...)
When they seen it is to do.
In fighting they (...)
Gyldas says they ben (...)
In peace and not stable.
If men axe why it be
It is no vonder for to se
Though men put out of land
To put out other would fond
But all for naught at this stand
For all many woods ben at gronde
And put the sea among
Ben castles builded strong
The men may dure long un ete
And love well conume mete
They can ete and ben mury
Without great cury
They ete bread cold and hot
Of barley and of ote
Broad cakes round and thynne
As well seems so great kynne
Selde they ete bread of whete
And selde they done ones ete
They have gruell to potage
And lekes kind to companage
Also butter milk and chese
Yshape endlonge and corner wese
Such messes they ete snell.
And that makes hem drink well
Meet and ale that has might
Thereon they spend day and night
Ever the redder is the wine.
They hold it the more fine
When they drink at ale
They tell many a lewd tale
For when drink is in handlynge
They ben full of Jangling
At meet and after eke.
Her solace is salt and leke
The husbonde in his wise
Tells that a great price
To give a gaudron with growele
To hem that sytt^^^ on his mele
He deleth his meet at meele
And gives every man his del^
And all the (...) pluse
He keeps to his own use
Therefore they ha^^ (...).
And myshappes als^
They ete^ hot sam^^ always
All though physyk say may.
Her houles bes low with all
And made of yerdes small
Not as in cytees nyghe
But far a sonder and not to high
When all is eten at home
The^ to their neyghbou^s will they (...)
And ete what they may find and se
And then torn home aye
The lyte is idle that they ledes
In brennynge slepynge and such deeds.
Walsshmen use with her might
To wesshe their ghestes fete a night
If he wesshe her fete all and sum.
Then they know y^ they be welcome
They live so esely in a route
That selde they bear purs about.
At her breche out and home
They honge their money and comb.
It is wonder they be so hende
And hate crak at nether end
And without any core
Make their wardrope at door.
They have in great mange^y
Harp tabour and pyp for mynstralsy
They bear corpse with sorrows gre^^e
And blow loud horns of ghert.
They praise fast Troyan blood.
For thereof come all her broad.
Nygh kyn they will be
Though they pass an hundred deg^^e.
Above other men they will hem dyght.
And worship prestes with her might
As angels of heaven right
They worship servants of god almyght
Often gyled was this broad
And yerned battle all for wood
For Merlyns prophecye
And often for sortelegye
Best in manners of Brytons
For company of Saxons.
Ben turned to better right
That is known as clear as light
They tyllen gardy^^ ^^lde and (...).
And draw hem to good towns
They ride armed as w^ll god
And go y hosed and y shoode.
And sytten fair at her mele
And sleep in beds fair and feel
So they seem now in mind
More Englysshmen than walssh kind
If men are why they now do so
More than they wont to do
They lyuen in more pees
Because of their riches
For their catell should slake
If they used often wrake
Dread of loss of her good
Make them now still of mode
All in one it is brought
Have nothing and dread naught
The poet says a saw of preef.
The foot man syngeth tofore the thief
And is bolder on the way
Than the horse man rich and gaye
Of ye meruayls and wondres of wales ca.xx.
THere is a pole at Brechnok
Therein of fyssh is many aflok
Often he changes his hew on cop
And bears above a gardyn crop
Often time how it be
Shape of house there shall thou se
When the pole is frore it is wonder
Of the noise that is there under
If the prince of the land hot
Birds sing well merry note
As merrily as they can
And syngyn for none other man
Besides Caerleon
Two mile fro the town
Is a roche well bright of leem
Right against the son beem
Goldclyf that roche hight
For it shyneth as god full bright
Such a flour in stoon is naught
Without fruit if it were sought
If men could by craft undo
The veins of therth and come thereto
Many benytece of kind
Ben now hyd fro man^^es ^^ynde
And ben unknow yet.
For defaute of man's wit
Great tresour is hyd in ground
And after this it shall be found
By great study and besynes
Of hem that comen after us
That old men had by gr^te need
We have by besy deed Treuisa.
In books ye may read
That kind fails not at need
When noman had craft in mind
Then of craft halpe god and kind.
When no techer was in land
Men of craft by gods hand
They that had craft so then
Taught forth craft to other men
Some craft that yet come not in place.
Some man shall have by gods grace
R. An ylonde is with noise and strife.
In west wales at Kerdyf
Fast by Seuarne stronde
Barry hight that ylonde
In that hither side in a chen^
Shall thou here wonder dene
And diverse noys also
If thou put thyn cere to
Noys of leaves and of wind
Noys of metals thou shall find
Frotynge of yren and westones y^ shall here
Hetynge of ouens then with fire
All this may well be
By wawes of the sea
That breketh in their
With such noys and fare
At Pendrok in a stead
Feudes do often quede
And throws foul thing inn
And despyseth also sin
Neither craft ne bedes may
Do thens that sorrow away
When if greueth so
To the men it bodeth woo
At crucynar in west wales
Is a wonder butyals
Every man that comes it tose
Seems it even as much as he
Hoole wepen there a night
Shall be broken er day light
At nemyn in north wales
Alytell ylonde there is
That is called bardysay
Monks dwell there always
Men live so long in that hurst
That the oldest deyeth first
Men say that Merlyn there buried is.
That hight also syluestris
There were Merlyns tweyns
And prophesied beyne
One heet Ambrose an Merlyn
And was y gotten by gobelyn
In demicia at carmerthyn
Under king Vortygeryn
He told his prophecye
Even in snowdonye.
At heed of the water of coneway
In the side of mount eryry
Dynas embreys in walsshe.
Ambrose hylle in English
King Vortygere sat on
The watersyde and was fulle of wone.
Then Ambrose Merlyn prophesied.
Tofore him right the Treuisa
What wit would wene
That a fend might get a child
Some men would mean
That he may no such work welde
That fend that goth a night
Wymmen full often to gyle
Incubus is named by right
And gyleth men otherwhyle
Succubus is that wight
God grant us none such vile
Who that comes in her gyle
Wonder hap shall he smyle
With wonder deed
Both men and wymmen sede
Fendes woll keep
With craft and bring an hepe.
So fendes wild
May make wymmen bear child
Yet never in mind
Was child of fendes kind
For without eye
There might no such child deye.
Clergy makes mind
Death sleeth no fendes kind
But death slew Merlyn
Merlyn was ergo no gobelyn
An other Merlyn of Albyn land
That now is named Scotdonde also
And he has nemes two
Siluestris and Calidonius also
Of that wood Calidonie
For there he told his prophecye
And heet Syluestris as well
For when he was in batell
And saw above a grysly kind.
And fill anon out of his mind
And made no more abood
But ran anon unto the wood
Treuisa. Siluestris is wood
Other wild of mode.
Other else
That at wood he dwelles
R. Siluestris Merlyn.
Told prophecye well and fyn
And prophesied well sure
Under king Arthure
Openly and not so dose
As Merlyn Ambrose
There ben hills in snowdonye
That been wonderly hye
With hight as great a way
As a man may go adaye
And heet eryry in walsshe
Snowy hills in English.
In these hills there is
Leese enough for all berstes of walys
These hills on top berrs
Two great fysshe wears
Contained in that one ponde.
Meueth with the wind an ylonde.
As though it did swymme.
And neyheth to the krymme.
So that herdes have great wonder.
And wene y^ the world meueth under
In that other is perch and fysshe
Every one eyed is
So fares all well
In Albania the mylwell
In Rutlonde by Tetynwell
There is a little well
That flows not always
As the sea twyes a day
But sometime it is dry
And sometime full by the eye
There is in North wallia
In Mon that heet Anglesia
A stone according well night
As it were a man's thyghe
How far ever that stone
Be born of any mon.
On night it goth home his way
That he found by assaye
Hughe thereto of Shrowesbury
In time of the first Harry
For he would the sothe find
That stone to an other he began bind.
With great cheynes of yre^^
And threw all I feren
Ybounde at one hepe
Into a water deep
Yet amorowe that stone
Was seen erly in Mon.
A chorle held himself full slyghe.
And bound this stone to his thyghe.
His thygh was roten or day
And the stone went away.
If men done lechery.
Nyghe that stone by
Swote comes of that stone.
But child comes there none.
There is a roche right wonderly.
The rocht of herynge by country
Though there cry any man born
And blow also with an horn
Noise there though thou abide
Thou shalt here none in this side
There is an other ylonde
Fast by mon at hand
Hermytes there ben ryue
If any of them done st^yue
All the myse that may be get
Come and ete all their mete
Then cesseth never that w^^
Till the strife cesse also
As men in this land
Ben angry as in Irlonde
So saints of this contreye
Ben also wretchefull always
Also in this land
In Irlonde and in Scotlonde.
Ven belles and staves
That in worship men haues
And ben worshyped so then
Of clerks and of lewd men.
That dreden also
To sweren on any of tho.
Staff either belle
As it were the gospelle
At Basyng work is a well
That Sacer heet as men tell.
It sprengeth so sore as men may see
What is cast in it throws aye.
Thereof sprengeth a great stronde
It were enough for all that land
Seek at that place
Have both hele and grace
In the welmes ofter shan ones
Ben found reed spercled stones
In token of the blood reed
That the maid Wenefrede
Shad at that pytte
When her throat was kytte
He that did that deed
Has sorrow on his sede
His children at all stoundes
Berken as whelps and hounds
For to they pray that maid grace
Right at that well place
Either in Shrowesbnry street
There that maid rested sweet

IT is a comynsaw yt ye count which is now named Scotlo^de is a^
outstretchy^ge of y^ north side of Beitayn and is deperted in y^ south side
from Breitayn with arms of y^ se / and in y^ other side it is be clypped with
the sea. This land heet so metyme Albania and had y^ name of Al banactus y^
was king Beutes sone for Albanactus welled first therein / or of the prouynce
Albania y^ is a country of Scicia and nygh to amazona therefore scotts ben

shortly called Scotlonde of Scotts y^ come out of Irlonde and reigned therein.
CCC.xv. year unto reed Wyllyams time that was Malcolins brother.. R. Many
euydenees we have of this Scotlonde that it is often called and hight Hibernia as
Irlonde does. Therefore Beda.li.ii. ca.xi. says that Laurence archebysshop of
Dunbar was archebysshop of Scotts that dwelled in an ylonde that heet Hibernia
and is next to Brytayn Beda.li.iii. ca.xxvii. says Pestilence of moreyn bare
down Hiber nia Also li iii. ca.ii. says yt the Scotts y^ dwelled in the
south side of Hibernia Also: li iiii. ca. iii. he says yt Cladde was a
yonglynge and learned the rule of monks in Hibernia. Also li.iiii. ca.xxii.
Egfridus king of Northu^berlonde destroyed Hibernia. Also.li.iiii. ca.xv. the
most dele of Scotts in Hibernia and in the same chapitre he called Hibernia
proprely named / y^ west ylondr is an hundred mile from eueryche / Britayn and
departed with the sea between and called Hibernia that country that now is
called Scotlonde / there he tells that Adamua^ abbot of this ylond sailed to
Hybernia for to teache Irysshmen y^ lawful esterdaye And at last come again into
Scotlonde. Ysy. ethi.li.xiiii. Men of this Scotlonde ben named Scotts in their
own la^gage and Pyctes also. for sometime her body was peynted in this mancre /
they would sometime with a sharp egged tole prycke and kerue her own bodies and
make thereon diverse fygures and shappes and peynt hem with ynke or with other

ben not wone to be enoynted ne crowned. In this Scotlo^de is solemn and great
my^de of say^^ andrew thapostle: For saint Andrewe had y^ north parties of y^
world Scitts and Pyctes to his lot for to preche and convert y^ people to
crystes byleuees and at last be was martred in Achaia in gre^a in a cite y^ was
named Patras and his bones were kept.CC.lxii. year unto Consta^tinus
the^pe^rours time. and the^ they were translated^ to Co^sta^tinople and kept
there.C.x. year unto Theodosyus themperours ryme and then Vngus king of
Pycte^in Scotlonde destroyed a great part in Brytayne and was besette with a
great hooste of Brytons in a field called Mark. and he herd saint Andrewe
speak too him in this manner. Vngus vngus here thou me crystes apostle I
promise the help and socour when thou have over comen thyn enemies by my help
/ thou shall give y^ third dele of thyn heritage in alms to god almighty /
and in the worship of saint Andrew / and in the sign of the cross se went
tofore his host and the third day he had vyctory and so turned home a yene
and desed his heritage as he was boden. And for he was uncertain what cite he
should deal for saint Andrewe he fasted three days / he and his men prayed
saint Andrewe that he would show him what place he should chese. And one of the
wardeyns that kept the body of saint Andrewe in Constantynople was warned in
his sleep that he should go into a place whyder an angel would led him and so
he come into Scotlonde with vij. fellows to the top of an hylle named Ragmo^de.
The same hour light of heaven beshone and beclypped y^ king of Pyctes that was
coming with his host to a place called Carceuan. There anon were heled many
seek men. There met with the king Regulus the monk of Constantynople with the
relyques of saint Andrewe. There is founded a church in worship of saint
Andrewe y^ is heed of all the chirches in the land of Pyctes. To this church
comen pilgrims once of all lands. There was Regulus first abbot and gadred
monks And so all the tyenthe land y^ the king had assygned him he departed it
in diverse places among abbayes.

Of the descrypcyon of Irlond. ca xxii
HIbernia that is Irlonde. and was of old time Incorporate into y^ lordshyp of
Brytayne so says Gir. in sua pop^. where he descryueth it at fulle. Yet it is
worthy and sernely to praise y^ land with large praysynge / for to come to dear
and full knowledge of y^ lord these tytles that follow open the way Therefore I
shall tell of the place and stead of that land how great and what manner land
it is / whereof that land has plente and whereof it has defaute / also of what
men have dwelled therein first. Of manners of men of that land. Of the wonders
of that land / and of worthynes of halowes and saints of that land.

Of the boundynge of Irlonde ca.xxiii
IRlonde is the last of all the west ylondes and hight Hibernia of one Hiberus
of Spayn that was Hermonius brother / for these two brethren gate and wanne yt
land by conquest. Or it is called Hibernia of yt River Hiberus yt is in the
west end of Spayn / and yt land hight Scotlond also / for Scotts dwelled
there sometime er they came into yt othere Scotlond yt longed to Brytayn /
therefore it is written in the Martyloge. Such a day in Scotlo^d saint Bryde was
born / and yt was in Irlond. this lord has in y^ southest side spayn three
days saylly^ge the^s a side half / and has in ye eest side y^ more Britayn
the^s a days saylly^ge / in the west side y^ endless Occean and in y^ north
side. yselo^de three days saylly^g the^s. Solinus. But y^ see yt is between
brytay^e and Irlo^de is al y^ year full of great wawes and vnesy y^ me^ may
selde sail sekerly between y^ se is.C.xx. mile broad.

Of ye gretnes and qualyte of yt lord ca.xxiiii.
IRlo^de is an ylo^de grettest aft britayn / and stretches north ward from
Brendas hills unto y^ lord Colu^bina and co^teyeth.viij. days journey every
journey.xl. mile and from Deuell to Patriks hills and to yt se in y^ side in
bread.iiij. iourne is / and Irlonde is narower in the myddell thanne in the
ends / all otherwise than Brytayn is / as Irlonde is shorter northwarde than
Brytayne / so is it longer south ward the land is not plain but full of
mountayns of hills of woods of marayes and of mores / the land is soft
rayny wind and low by the sea side and within hylly and sondy. So linus. There
is great plente of noble pasture and of leese / therefore the bestes must be often
driven out of their pasture lest they ete ouermoche for they should shend him
self if theye might ete at their will. Gir. Men of that land have communely
their health / and strangers have of te a perylous flux because of the moisture
of the mete. The flesh of kyen is there wholesome / and swynes flesh
unwholesome. Men of that land have no fever but only the fever ague and that
right seld Therefore the holsomnes of that land and the clennes out of venyme
is worth all y^ bost and richesse of trees of herbs of sp^ cery of rich
clothes and of precious stones of y^ eest lands: The cause of the health and
holsomnes of that land is theat temperate hete and cold that is therein In
quibus rebus sufficit. In this land be^ moo kye^ than oxen / more pasture than
corn / more gras than seed / there is plente of samon / of lamprays / of eeles
and of other see fysshe. Of Egles / of cranes / of pecockes of / curlewes / of
sparouhaukes of goshaukes / and of gentle fawcons / Of wulues and right
shrewed myse there ben attercoppes / blood soukers ceftes yt done none harm /
there ben fayres little of body and full hardy and strong / there ben barnacles
fowls like to wild ghees which grown wonderly upon trees / as ^it were
nature wrought against kind. Men of religion etethe bernacles upon
fastyndayes because they ben not engendered with flesh / wherein as me thinks
they err for reason is ayenste that. For if a man had eten of Adams leg he
had eten flesh / and yet Adam was not engendered of fader nor mother / But that
flesh come ^onderly of the tree. In this land is ple^ of honey and of milk
of vine and of vyneyerdes. Solinus and Ysid. wetten y^ Irlonde has no bees
Netheles it were better written that Irlonde had bees and no vineyards. Beda
says that there is great hunting to roobuckes / and it is know that there
ben none. It is no wonder of Beda for he saw never that land but some man
told him such tales. Also there grows that stone Saragonus. and is called
Iris also as it were the rayn bow if that stone be hold against y^ son
anon it shall shape a raynbowe / there is also founden a stone that is called
Gagates and white margery perles:

Of them that first enhabyted Irlonde. ca.xxvi.
GIraldus says yt Casera Noes nere drad the flode and fled with three men and
fyfty wymmen into that ylonde and dwelled therm first y^ last rere tofor Noes
flode. But afterward Bartholanus Seres sone that come of Iaphet Noes sone come
thither with his three sons by hap or by craft.CCC. year after Noes flood and
dwelled there and encreaced to the nombir of.ix.M. men and afterward for
stenche of kareyns of gyau^tes y^ they had kylde they deyeden all save one
Ruanus y^ lived a M.v.c. year unto saint patryks time and informed the holy man
of y^ for foresaid mea and of all the doings and drd^^* When the third time
come thither Norwich once of S^^^ia with his.iiii. sons and dwelled
there.CC.xvi.year. And at last of his or ^^^ynge by diverse myshappes of
wars and of moreyne they were clean destrored and the land left void.CC.
year after. The fourth time five dukes y^ were brethern Gan^^^ Genandus
Sagan^^us Rutheragus Sla^^us of the said Nymesaes successors come out of
Greece g^^^h^red y^ tonde and deled (...) fyir parties genery party
co^teyneth.xxii. candredes. A Candr de is a country that conteyneth a
towns.(...). and they set a stone in y^ mydd else of y^ land as it were in
y^ naneii and beginning of five kynkdomes. Alte the last Slautus was made
king of all the land. The fyfth time when this nation was ixx. year together
they were feeble four noble men that were Millesins y^ kings sons come out of
Spain with many other in a nauye of.xl ships and two of y^ worthyest of these
iui brethern y^ heet Hyberus and Hermon deled y^ land between hem tweyn / but
Afterward couenaunte was broken between hem both and Hiberus was slain Then
Hermon was king of all y^ land. And from his fyme to the first Patryks tym
were kings of y^ nation: C.xxxi. And so fro the coming of Hibernensis unto
the first Patryk were.M.viii.c. year. They had y^ name Hibernensis and
Nybernia of y^ foresaid Hiberus / or else of Hiberus a river of Spayn. They were
called also gatels and Scotts of one Gaytelus that was Phenis neuewe. This
Gaytelus coudce speak many langages / after y^ langages that were made at
Nemproths tour And wedded one Scotta Pharoes daughter Of these dukes come y^
Hibernensis Me^ say y^ this Gaytelus made y^ Irysshe langage and called it
Gaytelaf as it were a langage gadred of all laugages and tongues. At y^ last
Belmus king of Brytaynr had a sone and hight Gurguncius come out of
Donnemarke at ylondes Orcades / he found men that were called Basclensis /
and were come theder out of Spain / these men prayed and besought to have a
place to dwell in. And the king sent them to Irlonde that was tho void and
waste. and ordained and sent with them dukes and captayns of his own / and so
it seems y^ Irlonde should long to Britayne by right of old time. From y^
first saint Patyrk unto Fedliundius y^ ky^ges time.CCCC. year reigned.xxxiii.
ky^ges eueriche after other in Irlonde. In this Fedliundius time Turgesins duke
and captain of Norwayes brought theder men of Norwaye and occupied y^ land and
made in many places deep deches and castles sengle double and tryble and many
wards strongly walled and many thereof stand yet all hole / but Irysshmen
retche not of castles / for they take wodes for castles and marayes and moors
for castle dyches but at last Turgesius deyed by gylefulles of women / and
Englysshmen say that Gurmundus wanne Irlonde and made thylke dyches / and made
no mention of ^^gesius / and Irysshmen speak of Turgius and know not of
Gurmu^dus. Therefore it is to were that Gurm^dus had won Britayne and dwelled
therein / and sent Turgesius with great strenth into Irlo^de for to win that
land / and because turgesius was captain and leder of that vy^ge and Journey
and seen among them therefore Irysshmen speak much of him as a noble man that
was seen in yt land and known. At last when Gurmu^dus was slain in France
Turgesius loved the kings daughter of Irlonde and her fader behyght Turgesius
y^ he would send her him to the low larherin with xv. maidens. and Turgesius
promised to mete there with xv. of the noblest me^ that he had / and held
covenant and thought no gyle / but there come.xv. young berdeles men clothed
like wymmen with short swerdes under her clothes / and fill on turgesius and
slew him right there / and so he was traytrously slain after he had
reigned.xxx. year Not long after three brethren Amelanus Siracus and Iuorus
come into Irlonde with her men out of Norwaye as it had been for love of peace
and afmarchaundyse and dwelled by the sea sides by assente of Irysshmen that
were always idle as Poules knights / and the Nor ways builded three cytees
Deuelyn Waterforde and Lymeryche and encreaced and after were rehell ayenste
men of y^ lend and brought first sparthes in to Irlonde So fro Turgesius time
unto roderyks time king of Connacia that was the last that was king of all
the land were.xvii. kings in Irlonde and so y^ kings that reigned in Irlonde
from y^ Hermons time unto the last Roderyks time were in all.C.lxxxi. kings
y^ were not crowned neither enoynted ne by law of heritage / but by might may
strye and strength of arms. The second Henry king of England made this
Roderyk subget the year of king Hentyes age.xl. and of his regne.xviii. y^
year of our lord.xi. hundred.lxxii.

Of the condidions and manners of Irlonde. ca.xxvii.
SOlinus says that men of this lord ben strange of nacon houseles and great
fyghters / and acou^t tyght and wrong all one thing / and ben syngle of
clothing / scarce of mete / cruel of heart / angry of speech / and drynketh
first blood of deed men that been slain and then wesshen their vysages therewith
and hold them paid with flesh and fruit instead of mete and with milk instead of drink and vsen much playen and yolenes and hunting and trauayll but
little. In their chyldhode they ben hard nourysshed and hard fed and they be
unseemly of manners and of clothing and have breche and hosen allone of wolle
and strayte hodes that stretches a cubyte over y^ sholders behind and
foldynges instead of mantels and of clokes. Also they (...) no sadels boots
ne spores when they (...) de. but they drive their horses with a ^^^bred yerde
in y^ over end. Instead of bytes with trenches and of brydels of reest / they
use brydeis that letce not (...) horse to etc their mete / they fight ona^med
naked in body / netheles with two darts and speres / and with broad sparthes
they fight with one hand. These men forsaken tyllynge of ldde and keyen
pasture for bestes. They use long berdes and long locks hanging down
behind her h^des / they use no craft of flax of wolle / of metal / ne of
marchau^dyse but give hem to ydelnes and to sloth and reken rest for liking
and for fredome for kyches / And though Scotlonde the daughter of Irlonde use
harp tymbire and tabour. Netheles Irysshmen be conning in two manner
Instruments of musyke / in harp and timber that is armed with wyre and
strenges of bias In which Instruments though they play hastily and swyfeely
they make tygher merye armonye and weladye with thyche tewnes werbles and notes
and begin from bemoll and playen secretly under dyme sown in the great
strenges / and torn again unto the same / so that the greetest party of the
craft hydeth the craft as it would seem as though the craft so hid should
be ashamed if it were take. These men ben of evil manners in her living they
pay no tythynges they wedde lawfully / they spare not their alyes / but the
brother wedde the brothers wife / they ben besye to betray her neighbors and
other they bear sperthes in their hondes instead of staves and fight against
them y^ trust most to them / these men ben varyable and unsteadfast trechours
and gylefull who that deals with the^ nedethe more to be ware of gyle than of
craft of peace than of brennynge brondes / of honey tha^ of galle / of malice
tha^ of kuyghthode / they have such manners that they ben not strong in war
and in battle ne true in peace / they become gossybs to them that they will
falsely be traye in the gossybrede and holy kynred Eueryche drynketh others
blood wha^ it is shed / they love somdele her nouryce and her playfers
which that souke the same milk that they souked while they were children. And
they purse where brethern / their cosyns and their othere kyn / and despysen
their kyn whiles they live / and avenge their death when they ben slain. So
long has the usage of evil custom endured among them y^ it has gotten the
maystrye over them and torneth treason into kind so ferforthe that they ben
traitors by nature. And alyens and men of strange lands that dwell among
them foloynge their manners that uneath there is none but he is besmetted with
their treason also. Among them many^men pyssen sitting and wymmen standing.
There ben many men in that lord foul shapen in ly^mes and in body / for in
their lymmes they lack the benefyce of kind So that no where ben none
better shapen than they that been there well shapen and none worse shapen than
they that been evil shapen And skylfully nature hurt and defouled by wyckednes
of living bryngethe such foul gromes and evil shapen of hem that with
unlawful delynge with foul manners and evil living so wyckedly defouled
kind and nature. In this land and in wales old wives and wy^men were wont
and ben yet as men say often for to escape themself in lykenes of hares for to
milk their neighbors kyne and stele her milk and often gray hounds rennen
after them and pursewen them and wenen that they be hares. Also some by craft
of Nygroma^cye maken fat swyne for to be reed of color and selle them in
markettes and fayres But as soon as these swyne pass onye water they torn
into their own kind whether it be straw heye gras of turues But these swyne
may not be kept by no craft for tendure in lykenes of swyne over three days:
Among these wondres and other take heed that in the vttermest end of the
world falls new meruaylles and wondres: As though ky^de playde with large
love secretlye and far in thendes / than openly and nygh in the myddell.
therefore in this ylonde be^ many gryselye wondres and meruaylles.

Of the meruaylles and wondres of Irlonde. ca.xxviii.
MAny men tellen that in y^ north side of Irlonde is the land of life. In that
ylond noman may deye but when they ben old and vexed with great fekenes / they
ben born out into y^ next land and deye there. There is an other ylonde in
Irlo^de that no woman therein may bear a child / but yet she may conceive. Also
there is an ylonde in which no deed body may roten. In vltonia y^ is Vlster is
an ylonde in a lake wonderly departed in tweyne In that one part is great
dysturbaunce and dyscomforth of fendes and in that other party gretely king
and comforth of holy angels There is also saint patryks purgatory yt was showed
at his prayer to co^ferme his prechynge and his lore when he preched to
mysbyleued men of sorrow and pain that evil men should suffer for her evil
works And of Joy and of bliss that good men shall resceyue for her holy deeds
he tells that who that suffers the pains of purgatory / if it be enjoined
him for penance he shall never suffer the pains of hell / but he deye finally
without repentance of sin / as the ensample. is set more full at this
chapter end. Treuisa. But truly noman may be saved but if he be very
repentau^t what someuer penance he do / and every man that is very repentaunt
at his lives end shall be sekerly saved / though he ueuer here of saint
Patryks purgatory. There is an ylonde in co^nacte Sale / that is in the se of
Conaccia hallowed by saint Brandon that has no myse / there deed bodies ben not
buried but ben kept out of the earth and roten not. In Mamonia is a well / who
that wassheth him with that water of that well he shall wax / hoar on his heed.
There is an other well in Vltonia who so^euer is wasshen therein he shall never
wexe hoar afterward / There is a well in Mounstre or Mamonia / if any man
touch that well a none shall fall great rain in all y^ prouynce / and that
rain shall never cessetyll a priest that is a clean maiden sing a mass in a
chapelle that is fast by and bless the water / and with milk of a cow that
is of one here bespryngr the well / and so reconcyle the well in this
strange manner. At Glyndalcan about thee (...) of saint Keyyn wythes betyth
apples as it were apple trees and ben more belsome than sa^^^ry. That holy /
saint ^ough forth these apples by pia yers for to hele his child that was seek
There is a lake in Vlster and much fyssh therein / which is.xxx. mile in
length and xv. in bread. The River Ban tennethe out of that lake into the
north Occean and men say that this lake began in this manner. There were men
in that country that were of evil living / coeu^tes cu^ brutis. And there
was a well in that land in great reverence of old time / and always covered /
if it were left uncovered the well would rise and drown all the land. And
so it happed that a woman went to that well for to fetch water and hyed her
fast to her child that wept in the cradell / and left the well uncovered /
then the well sprange so fa^^ that it drowned the woman and her child and
made all the country a lake and a fysshe ponde. For to preue that this is to
the it is a great argument / that when the weder is clear / fysshers of that
water se in the ground under the water round toures and high shapen as
steples and chirches of that land. In the north side of Irlonde in the country
of Ossyryens every.vii. year at the prayer of an holy Abbot / tweyne that been
wedded a man and a woman must needs be eryled and forshapen into lyknes of
wolves and abide out.vii. year. And at end of.vii year. if they live they come
home a gain and take again their own shappe / and then shall other tweyne go
forth in their stead and so forshapen for other.vii. year. There is a lake in
this land if a poole of tree pyght and stycked therein y^ part of the shafte
or poole that is in the earth shall torn into iron and that part y^ a bydeth
in the water shall come into stone / and the part y^ abides above shall be
tree in his own kind. Also there is a lake y^ tornethe basell into asshe and
asshe into hasell if it be done therein. Also in Ikonde been three samon lrpes
there as samons lepe ayemst a tothe a long speres lenthe. Also in Leginia is a
pound there be seen colmans birds / the herdes ben called certelles and come
homely to man's hand but if men do hem wrong or harm. they gone away and
come notte again / and the water there shall be bitter and stynke / and he
that did the wrong shall not after without wretch and myschyef but if he do
amends R. As touching Patryks purgatory. Ye shall understand that the
second saint Patryk that was abbot and not bishop while he preached in
Irlonde labored and studied for to torn thylke wicked men that lived as
bestes out of her evil life for dread of pains of hell / and for too
conferme hem to good life / and they said they would not ^orne but some of
them might know somewhat of the great pains and also of y^ bliss that he
spoke of Then saint Patryk prayed to god al mighty therefore / and our lord
Ihesu crist appyered to saint Patryk and took hy^ a staff and ladde him into a
wild place and showed him there a round pytte that was derke within and said
/ that if a man were very repentaunt and stable in believe and went into this
pytte and walkede therein a day and a night / he should se the sorrows and the
pains of evil men / and the Joy and bliss of good men. Then christ
vanysshed out of patryks sight / and saint Patryk are red and builded there a
church and put therein chanons reguler and closed the pyt about with a wall /
and is now in the church yerde at the eest end of y^ church and fast
shytte with a strong door for no man should nycely go in without leave of the
bishop. or of the pryour of the place. Many men went in and com out again
in Patryks time and told of pains and Joy that they had seen / and the
meruaylles that they saw been there yette written / and by cause thereof many
men turned and were converted to right by leave. Also many men went in and come
never again. In king stepneus (...) king of England a knight (...) Swayne
went into say (...) and come again and swelled ever after during his life in
p^des of (...) of Ludensis that is of ch^^dre of chyste (...) and told many
wonders that he had seen in Patryks per gatorye. That place is called
Patryks. purgatory and the church is named Reglis. Noman is enjoined for to
go into that purgatory / but cou^seylled that he should not come therein but
take upon hy^ other penance. And if a man have au^^rd and be stale and will
needs go therein, he shall first go to the bysshopp and then he shall be sent
which letters to the pryour of the place and they both shall cou^tseyll him to
leave and if he will needs goo thereto he shall be in prayers and in fasting.xv.
days and after.xv. days he shall be houseld and ladde to the door of the
purgatory with process you and ^et^ay and yet he shall be cou^scylled to le^^
it / and if he be stedefaste and will enter / the door shall be opened and he
blessed and go in on gods name / and hold forth his way / and the door
shall be fast shette till the next day / and when the time is y^ pryour
shall come and opene the door and if the man be comen he ledeth him into the
church with processyon / and there he shall be.xv. days in prayers and
fasting.

Of the meruaylles of saints of Irlonde. ca.xxix.
NEre Giraldus makes mind y^ as men of this nacyon ben more angry than other
men and more hasty for to take wretch whiles they ben alive / so saints and
halowes of this land ben more wretchefull than saints of othere lands.
Clerks of this land ben chaste and sayen many prayers and done great
abstynence a day / and drynketh all night so is aco^^ed for a miracle / that
lechery regneth not there as wine regneth / and ben chosen out of abbayes into
the clergy / and done as monks should / what they that been evil of them ben
worsto fall other. So good men among them choughe they ben but few been good
at the best / prelates of that country ben full slow in correccyon of trespass
/ and besy in contemplacyon and not in prechynge of gods word. Therefore it
is that all y^ saints of that land ben confessors and no martyrs among them
/ and no wonder / for all the prelates of this land clerks and prelates
should do is to them unknown Therefore when it was put against the bishop of
Cassyll how it might be that so many saints ben in Isio^de and never a martyr
among them all sythen y^ the men ben so shrewed and so angry / and the
prelates sorycheles and slow in correcco^ns of trespass. The bishop answered
frowardly enough and said our men benshrewed and angry inought to themself /
but to gods servants they leye never hand but do hem great reverence and
worship / but Englysshmen come into this land y^ can make martyrs and were
wont to use y^ craft. R. The bishop said so because that king Henry the
leconde was tho new comen into Irlonde fresshly after the martyrdom of saint
Thomas of Caunterbury. Gir In this land in wales and in Scotlonde. ben belles
and staves with crooked hedes and other such things for relyques in great
reverence and worship / so that men of this land dreden more for to swear up
on one of thylpe belles and gold staves than upon y^ gospel. ye chyef of all
such relyques is holden Thu^s staff that is at Deuelyn / with the which
staff they say that the first saint Patryk drofe y^ worms out of Irlonde.
Augus de ci. dei. ca.vii. If menlaxe how it may be that diverse manner of
beestes and of diverse kind y^ be kyndly gotten between mayl and female come
and ben in ylondes after Nots flode. Men supposen that such bestes swamme into
ylondes about and first to the next and so forth into othere Or else men
sayllynge into ylondes brought with hem such bestes for love of hu^tynge / or
angels at god almyghtyes commandment brought such beestes into ylondes about
or the earth brought them forth first and fulfilled tho gods commandment /
that commanded the earth to bring forth gras and quyche bestes.

Here ends the descrypcyon of Brytayne / the which conteyneth England wales
and Scotlonde / and also because Irlonde is under the rule of Englynde and of
old time it has so continued. therefore I have set the descrypcyon of the
same after the said Beytayne which I have taken out of Polycronycon. And
because it is necessary too all Engglysshmen to know the propretees co^medytees
and meruaylles of the. I wyllyam Carton have them set first in enprynt
according to the translaco^n of Tr^^sa / which art request of the lord Bar
keley translated the book of Polycronycon into English.
