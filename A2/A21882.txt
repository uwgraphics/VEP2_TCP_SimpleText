By the Queen.
A Proclamation to be published in Cornwall, Devonshire, Dorcetshire and
Hampshire, for restitution of goods lately taken on the Seas from the Subjects
of the King of Spain by way of Reprisall.
WHereas order from the Queens most excellent Majesty diverse ships of war
set forth this last Summer by the City of London, to join in consort with
her Majesty's Fleet and others, under the conduct of the Lord Thomas Howard,
have taken sundry prizes of Spanish ships coming from the West Iudies freight
with Merchandises and good commodities of sundry sorts: The which prizes the
Captains of the said London ships, have not directly brought home to the said
port of London, as they should and might have done, the wind serving
thereunto, but into other remote ports and havens of this Realm, with purpose
(as should seem) to take opportunity of such distant places for the risting of
the said prizes and the enriching of themselves and contrary to all right and
the trust reposed in them, the said Captains Masters and Maryners of the said
London ships, going upon wages, have taken out and embezelled diverse parcels
of the goods and commodities laden within the said ships and the same have sold
and exchanged to sundry persons dwelling within the said port Towns and other
adjacent places thereto to the great slander and prejudice of Sea discipline
and wrong to the adventurers by whom they were employed.

The Queens most excellent Majesty, not willing to suffer so great a disorder
nor so great a wrong and injustice to be done toward her self and other her
Subjects the Adventurers in the said Fleet, does straightly charge and
command, that al such persons as have bought, exchanged, or have any ways
received of any manner person, directly or indirectly, out of the said London
Fleet, any foreign Coin, Bollyon of Gold or silver, Jewels, Pearls, Stones
Musk, wrought or raw silk, Cochenelia, Indico, or any other marchandizes,
commodities or things whatsoever, or that shall have in their possession any of
the goods of the aforesaid natures: shall presently after the publication of
this Proclamation, or within ten days next following, bring in a true
particular note in writing of the same, with the several prizes what they
paid, and the names of whom the same was bought, or tokens deciphring the
person and persons, as near as they can remember, and the day, time and place,
where and when the same was bought, exchanged, or received, and forth of what
Ship or Prize the same was brought (as near as they can call to remembrance)
to Sir Francis Drake Knight, the Mayor of Plymmouth Christopher Harris, or any
two of them, being Commissioners appointed by her Majesty for the receiving of
any such goods in Plymmouth: And for goods taken near Dartmouth and Totnes, to
be brought to Sir John Gilbert, and the Majors of the same Towns: And of any
goods about Exceter, to be brought to the Mayor there, and Sir Robert Dennis:
And of goods about Southampton and Portesmouth, to be brought to any of the
Majors there, and Sir Thomas West, and Thomas Henslow, or any two of them. And
in case any that has so bought, exchanged or received of any of the said
Captains, Masters or Mariners, or others of the said Fleet and such treasure,
commodity or thing (as is abouesaid) and do not bring in and deliver a
particular note of the same in writing with the several prices they paid, and
the names of whom the same was bought, with the day, time, and place, where,
when, and forth of what Ship or Prize the same was bought, and deliver or cause
to be delivered the same within the time, and according as before is severally
specified and enjoined to the said Commissioners above named, shall be held,
and taken as Felons and Abbettors to Pirates, and to be proceeded against, as in
case of Felony is accustomed to be done by the Laws of this Realm.

Given at our palace of westminster the nine and twentieth day of December, in
the sour and thirtieth year of our Reign. 1591.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty.
