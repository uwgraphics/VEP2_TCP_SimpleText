Like as Iannes and Iambres withstood Moses, euenso ^o These [namely, the
Enemies of HN, and of the Love of Christ] also resist the Truth. 2. Timo. 3.
c. They slander that which they know not, and what they ^ovve naturally,
therein do they reversed;like as Beasts which are without reason; destroy
themselves. 2. Pet. 2. c. Jude. 1. c. VVoe unto them, for they go the Way of
Cain. Genesis ^ Iudae. 1. c. And for Lukers sake, they fall into the Errous ^
Balaam. Number. 24. Iudae. 1. c. They perrish or vanish away in the Vprour of
Chore. Leuit. 10. And are with their strange Fire, like as Nadab and Abihu,
consumed or brought to nothing by the Lords ire. Number. 16. Iudae. 1. c.
Imprinted in the Year of our Lord, M.D.LXXIX.

An Epistle written and sent unto the Communialtie of Love, by the chosen
Minister in the same.
IN-as-much as that there is Mercy chanced unto me / through the Love of God
the Father, so is my Spirit inclined to the same Spirit of God the Father, and
also to ye Ser^ice of my Neighbor: and that altogether to ^hesame Love.

^. To the Communialtie in the Love, unto whom we wish in the Lord / much
Felicity, Health, and Salvation.

^. MY Beloved in the Lord, the cause of my writing of this Epistle unto you,
is ^o geeue your Loves to understand, that the ^orde through his elected
Minister HN, has ^cripturelie setfourth and declared in full and ^mple manner /
the Man's Falling awaye^ tho^ough the Disobedience; from his God, and ^lso his
right Conuertion^ by Repentance; unto God: and in like manner how he should ^e
instructed, to his Growing-vp in the God^nes / even unto the everlasting Life.
He has ^so brought-fourth^ through the same his elec^d Minister; certain
Epistles of Correction and Exhortation out of hearty Love, to a pluc^ing under
the Obedience of the Love, and to ^epentaunce for ye Sins, unto them which
^^ink themselves wise, and therefore blaspheam our Service and our Communialtie
in the Lou^ Othersom also / as Exhortations, to warn the Lovers of the Truth
/ of all false Visions an^ Spirits, which makevp themselves out of the wicked
World / in this last dangerous Tim^

4. In conclusion, there is sufficient to answe^ eueryone, of what Mind either
Opinion soe^uer he be, if he will be answered by ye Trut^ And therefore we
need to do no more, but (...) make-manifest those-same Exhortations / ^
convenient time, as the cause does require it.

5. Notwithstanding, although wee^ th^rough the Goodness of the Lord; do our
d^ligence to make-manifest the Works of the Lord, to his Laud and Praise,
and to ye Converting of Sinners from their Sins, and to in^duce or lead them
to an upright Life / bo^ before God and Men, Yet are we counted ^ judged for
Seducers: and are slaundered wit^ all Wickedness, and bruted for Euel-dooer^ And
thissame is assuredly a great Misery upon the Earth.

6. Whosoever then can now in this wicke^ Time / perceive such wicked Deeds, The^
may also perceive therout, that thissame Tim^ is euenlike as was the Time of
Noe in the for^mer corrupted World, and as the Time of Lo^ in Sodom and Gomor:
and that in the same Tim^ all Iniquity and Falshod does beare-swaye.

7. They may farther note and perceive, the in this self-same Time / the World
is couere^ over with the Darknesses of Egypt, with the Plagues of Phara^, with
the Ignorance of the ^ananites, with the Contention and Discord of ^e
entangled Babel, with the Deceit and Insti^^tion of the false God services of
Jeroboam, with ^ wicked Enterprise or Device of Iezabel, with ^e sectuarish
Spitefulnes of the Scripture-lear^ed and of the Pharisees and Saducees, with
the ^mbition of Pilate, and with the Tirannie of (...), as also with all
heathenish Instabilitie: and ^at the Destruction is hard-at-hand.

FOr-as-much then ^my Beloved in the Lord; as that there are now so many
^rrible and abominable Euels risenvpp in ^ese Days: whereby we see that the
Abho^nation of Desolation possesses the Holy, ^erof there is prophesied by the
Lord Jesus ^^ist: and that there are also false Christ's and ^se Propheates,
even as there were many in ^se Days, which madevp themselves ^when ^ Lord
Jesus was personally upon the Earth; ^ellious^ie and blaspheamouslie: So are
there (...) now in this last Day ^which is the Com^-againe of the Lord Jesus
Christ, with the ^y Thowsandes of his Saints, according ^he Promises; many
Offallers, Adversaries, ^ Resisters, which makevp themselves re^iouslie and
blaspheamouslie / against the ^de and his most-holie Service of Love: of which
some of them have made-manifest ^selues, and their Names / by their slaun^us
Books: namely these are known vn^^ in England, Stephan Bateman (in his Book
^uled The golden Book of the leaden Gods: and ^hn Rogers Book / To the
Reader) John Rogers (in his Book entitled The Displaying of the Fam^lie of
Love) and John Knewstub and his Compan^^ons (in his Book entitled 1. Knewstub
against ^ Heresies of HN) together with their slaundero^ Blaspheamies, Cainish
bloud-thirstie Tira^nie, and extreme Persecution / for to shead (...) innocent
and giltles Blood.

9. For which occasion / we are forced ^th^rough the Love which we have unto
G^ and our Neighbor; to translate this Epistle Reproof and Exhortation
hereafter follo^ing out of the Works which are gon-fou^ through Abia
Nazarenus, a Fellow-elder w^ HN in the Family of Love: whereby it mou^ be
known, how the Lord has moved elected Elders, to write against the
Blasph^mers, Backbyters, and Slaunderers. etc. (...) therefore we will not
contend with them, submit our cause unto the Almighty, and h^ upon his Goodness.

10. Howbeit we have thought it goo^ make-manifest their Names / which are
(...) pheamous Writers: desiring the Goodwi^ which love God and his
Righteousness, to (...) intercession with us unto the almighty (...) head, with
these or suchlike Words. and ^

11. O God, prepare the Hearts of ye ^^ple to the Lowmyndednes, A Preparatiue.
that might stand in Meekmyndednes subm^ to the Love, and love the Coming of
thy (...) in his Lordlynes: through whom the (...) pass of the Earth shall be
judged with ^^eousnes: which also shall trouble all Mig^ ^iolence, and bring it
under his Obedience. and geeue-ouer or render unto thee ^O al^ightie God; the
Kingdom, that thou may ^e all in all.

^2. O God geeue this into the Hearts of ye Maiestrates for to behold, and
illuminate all ^inges, Princes, Lords, and Governors / with ^y godly Wisdom,
that they might fear ^y holy Name* stand submitted to thy Love and her
Service* and so turn them away from (...) Violence and Misuse: that the World
may ^^so be inhabited ^to thy Praise; in the Love and in all Truth: and that
all Men ^in true ^epentaunce for their Sins; may be turned unto thee* and the
horrible Plagues of ye Vn^odlines ^which are com over the World for ^er Sins
cause; cease or holde-vp.

^. O God, let us now find Grace before ^^ine Eyes, like as the City of
Niniue in times^ast, which thou receauedst to mercy: That ^ee perish not now
all as Sodom and Gomor. For ^ur Sins are many* and ^aboue measure; be^m
manifold.

^. O Lord and God ^O heavenly Father; ^are I beseech thee / the Prayer of
the Poor, and lead us in thy Ways. Gather us together ^on thy Paths, and
make our Hearts agree ^ one Band of thy Love, as One in all, and All ^ one /
which love the Right and Righteous^s. Cleanse our Minds from all ungodly Be^g,
and break all the Counsel of Vngodli^es, to thend that the Wickedness govern
not ways, and evermore.

15. BEhold, my Beloved: This is my frin^lie Exhortation unto you, that ye wi^
submit you under the mighty Hand of the Lord, and hope upon his Goodness:
abiding the Lord-his leisure, and putting your confi^dence in Him / according
to his Promises.

16. But if the Blaspheamers will not leaue^ of from their Blaspheamie, nor
take any Coun^saile out of the Word and Works of the Lord, which are
figured-fourth in the Seruic^ of Love / to their Reformation, so will we then
be blameles of their Destruction: for a^ much as we have figured-fourth ye
Counsel of the Lord before them, to their Reforma^tion and Preservation, in
all our former Ser^uice of the Love, and now in this Exhortation heere-after
following.

17. The Love of God the Father ^throug^ the Revelation of the Coming of our
Lord Jesus Christ; be with you, my Beloved: and ill^^minate your Spirit, in a
true Knowledge of the Life / in the Spirit, for to see liuinglie ^with right
Deserning; and to know the secre^ Counsel and Will of God, for that ye
monug judge ^with a right Judgment; according to the Truth. That grant us the
almyghtie Lord / through his Love.

AMEN.

O Lord God / Father and Lord of my Life, let (...) not com among the
Blaspheamers, and let me not (...) among them. Eccli. 23.
This is the Reproof spoken and setfourth b^ Abia / a Fellowe-elder with HN in
the Family of Love / against all seducing ^pocrites / which go-^ourth against
the Family of Love / for to seduce the Single-mynded.
Wher-withall their Falshod / which they ^to their own Destr^ction;
s^ew-fourth against the gracious Word of the holy Spirit of the Love of Jesus
Christ, and against Gods elected Ministers / as also ^to their Preservation in
the Godliness; the Conuertion from their Abominations / is figured-fourth
before their Eyes.

The First Chapter.
O Ye false Hearts / ye Ypocrites / together with all ye presumpteous
unsent Teachers / Wherefore do ye thus trouble and molest the Littleones / and
the single-minded Elect of God / for to withdraw them with your false and
unclean Doctrine of the goodthinking Knowledge / from the Single-mindednes which
they have to the pure Doctrine of the Service of the Love of Jesus Christ: and
so to lead them away and to estraunge them / from the merciful Grace of our
heavenly Father* from the Safe-making of our Lord Jesus Christ^ and from the
Love of the Holie-gost / whereunto they have humbly and obedientlie geeuen-ouer
themselves.

2. Woe unto you and your Presumption / ye false and seducing Spirits. ye
sathanish Hounds and renting Wolves. ye Generations of Vypers and Cains
Ministers. Yea woe unto you, ye Nestes of Dragons and Habitations of Deuels /
together with all ye wicked Hearts of the Scripture-learned: For ye and your
Fathers have betrayed Gods Propheates^ as also Jesus Christ and his Witnesses.
having falsely accused and defamed them: and euenso reversed;through the Hands
or Power of Sinners; persecuted and killed them.

3. O Thou wicked Nature / and ye Children of ^nbeleef / which forsake the
Purging in Jesus Christ / through the Belief / and the upright Being of the
Love of Jesus Christ, and expel the same out of your Hearts / together with the
Accomplishing of the true Oblation or Godseruice in the Holy / to the Slaying
and Burying of your Sins / and to the Renewing of your Spirit and Mind: Is
it not Wickedness and Euel-fact enough for you / that ye have turned-away
yourselues from the Requiring of ye Love and her Service / and from the
faithful Sheep or Children of thesame^ made your Portion with the Goates^
polluted yourselues in all Unbelief / contrary to the Safe-making of our Lord
Jesus Christ and his holy Spirit of Loue^ prepared you to Vessels of the Wrath
of God^ and reversed;with your false Judgments and Blaspheaming of the
Holie-gost; plucked upon your own Necks / the dreedfull Judgment and
wrathful Word of the Lord [Depart from me / ye Curssed, into the
everlasting Fire / which is prepared for the Deuell and his Angels or
Messengers] But that ye must also ^with your false Doctrine and unclean
Lips; pursue and persecute the Elect ^the faithful Children of the Love of
Jesus Christ^, for to rob them of their Inheritance of the Kingdom of God and
of the Love of Christ, to hold them captive in your damnable Being or Estate
/ and that ye might make them partakers with you and all wicked Spirits ^if
it were possible that ye could seduce them; of your Damnation.

4. For verelie / till unto the same Judgment of this your Condemnation / ye
are ^O ye Children of the Deuell / and Members of Antichrist; held bound with
the Bands or Chains of Darkness / to the end that the God of Heaven should ^in
this Day of his righteous Judgment; make-manifest and bring his Vengeance
over you / to your Recompencing with the Fire of Hell.

5. Yea / euen-thus will the God of Heaven presently in this Day / openly
bring-fourth and make-knowne ^before your Eyes / and before all Eyes of
Understanding; the Hardness of your Hearts / with your Lies and Blaspheaminges
of God / which ye have spoken against God the Father and his merciful Grace*
and against Christ and his Righteous-making from the Sin* as also against the
holy Spirit and his Making-aliue in the Love.

6. Euen-thus will presently in this Day of the righteous Judgment of God ^O
ye presumpteous Blaspheamers of the Holie-gost and his Family of Love; all
the Woe of the Ungodly com over you / to your Rewarding.

7. FOr-that-cause look now into your Abominations / and mark how ye have
separated yourselues with ye Goats / from the Sheep / with the which ye shall
also (if so be that ye do not wholly turn you away therfrom / and repent) be
constrained to bear your Sentence of Condemnation. Therefore look now rightly
into it / and repent / ereuer the Vengeance of God fall upon you. Yea look
well into it / how ye have madevp yourselues with your false Judgments /
against God-his righteous Judgment / and against the holy Spirit of the Love
of Jesus Christ, and his Communialtie of Holyones: In such wise / that ye have
also endeavored you / to seduce God-his elected Holyones / and to make the
gracious Word ^which God has raised-vp by us / according to his Promises;
and the Ministers of the same Word / horrible and despised / before all
Goodwillingones to the Righteousness: and so then to pluck them away from the
Communialtie of Love / and to lead them with you ^in your Chains or Bands of
Darkness; unto Damnation / to thentent that they should not by any-meanes be
taught ^through the Obedience of the Service of Love; to the Kingdom of Heaven
/ which ye shuttoo before Many / and com not therein yourselues^ but that they
should remain with you / ther-without.

8. Yea euen-thus / with your Falshod and forged Lies / and with your subtle
Slanders and flattering Words / ye com-fourth so knowledgfull / and occupy
also ^according to the Similitude or Figuring-fourth of the Scriptures; such a
colored Show of Christianity / for to leade-astraye / that ye should ^if it
were possible; seduce also the Elect / with your false or colored
Christianity.

9. But no: Ye are not able in this Day of Love / to seduce the Elect / nor
to accomplish your Seduction, with the Holyones of God of the Family of Love:
For ye living God of Heaven ^which ^s their God* and their Defender from all
Seduction; goes so stedfas^lie ^in his Service of Love; with his true Light of
the heavenly Cleernes of Jesus Christ / before them all which are his faithful
Children of Love / and geeueth them daily ^through his holy and gracious
Word; such a clear Diversity in their Hearts: and the true Light of all the
Righteous and Holyones of God / is so naked^ie distincted unto them / from the
Darknesses of the ^alse Light of all ye Unrighteous / and false Hearts of the
Scripture-learned or of the unsent Pr^ach^rs / That it is not possible that ye
should seduce them (if they hold them constantly on the Ser^ice of Love) from
the Way of the Love of Jesus Christ: nether-yet that ye should be able ^yee
wic^ed Generations of Cain, and ye false Prophets of Iezabel; to destroy or
keep-back in them / Gods Truth and Righteousness.

^0. Verelie our Lord and Savior / Jesus Christ, has well and rightly
spoken and prophe^ied of your subtle Falshod and dec^itfull Signs and Wonders
for to leade-astray: In such wise / that the Elect should also ^if it were
possible; th^^ough your subtle Falshod and lofty Knowledge / ^elead into
Error.

^1. But for the Elects-sake / the Days are now ^hortened: For God will
presently in this Day (...) his Love reversed;in ye which He will keep his
Judgment execute his righteous Judgment: and will euen^^ glorify his Elect /
in his Righteousness or Perfec^tion / and make them joyful reversed;with his
euerlastin^ Li^e; in his Kingdom of Heavens: as also mak^ manifest all false
Devices which are practi^ed for (...) leade-astray: and condemn you / with the
Vngod^lie and Blaspheamers of the holy Spirit of Love and with all Children of
the Deuell / in the Hel^ where-as reversed;in the beholding of their Ungodliness
all Woe / Wringing-of-handes / and Gnashing (...) Teeth shall take-holde of
them / everlastingly.

12. FOr-that-cause ought eueryone to look well to it / what he judges for
evil an^ blaspheameth: and to have a good regard on the Matiers which
concern God or his Service / for to understand those-same first well and
aright / ac^cording to the Truth / ereuer he judge them for e^uell / and
slander or despise them. For it will con^ very heauelie upon them / which
stretch-out the^ Hands to Gods Sanctuary / for to take-holde (...) the same
with unclean Hands / and to resist an^ blaspheame reversed;with unclean
Hearts / and with vn^circumcised Tunges and Lips; Gods Work^ with his
Holyones or Children of Love.

The Second Chapter.
OH reversed;alas; how many-maner (...) false hearts are there now! which do
(...) reversed;eueryone with his crafty Knowledge makeup themselves against
God and (...) Service of Love / and are not ashamed to spew^urth their horrible
Lies and Blaspheamies against Gods gracious Word and his Service of Love.

^. And then comes fourth the one Party from ^he one side* and the other
Party from the other ^yde / unto the Goodwilling to the Love of Jesus Christ,
and say unto them: Yea as I hear / ye ^ade also the Books of the Family of
Love / which ^^re setfourth by HN: He writes ^verelie; many ^xcellent Matiers
/ wherein he resiteth much of the Love / and teaches Men ^ther-withall; to the
vp^ight Being of Christ:

But what is that to the purpose: There lies ^reat Falshod hidden ther-vnder:
we know what ^ee have found-out by the same. Therefore take ye ^eed thereof /
and look well to it / that ye be not se^uced therewith* nor drawn to ye
Family of Love. (...) warn you of the horrible Seduction / and of the
^rronious Books of HN: to thend that ye be not ^lucked with the Family of
Love / into horrible Er^urs. And so they do then spew-fourth many for^ed Lies /
and beas^lie Matiers / wherewith they do ^^cuse and defame the Family of Love*
as also HN and the Elders which minister the holy and graci^^s Word / in the
Family of Love / for to make ^enso with their false Defamations / the Family
(...) Love / wherein God lives and walks* together ^ith HN God-his elected
Minister^ and the El^ers in the Family of Love / horrible and despised ^fore
all People.

^. Behold / such venomous Food of Death ^ontrary to the wholesome Food of
Life and of the ^rueth of God; can the Deuell prepare / through his Ministers
and Ministrices / and through (...) false Hearts of the Scripture-learned /
and (...) Ministers of the false Godseruices of Cain: (...) they know then how
to cover the same Falsho^ under a Show of Holiness and of Love which the bear
unto Men / to thend that they should not fa^ to fulfill the Measure of the
Iniquity of their F^^thers / and that the Days which reach to the^
Condemnation / might be shortened.

5. WOe unto you / ye false Hearts: (...) presently in this Day shall all
yo^ Lies and forged false Testimonies ^which ye yo^ selves have made very
filthy / with your vnclea^ Dirt; be condemned in the hellish Fire: For
th^^same your false Testimonies are brought-four^ out of the earthly
Ingeniousnes and Generat^^ of the Deuell: and ye have exalted yourselues (...)
your earthly Ingeniousnes; so hie / with thesam^ and with the Works of the
Fleash / to a great E^timation with Men / and planted your false Se^ so fast in
the Hearts of Men / that ye have vtte^ lie expeiled ther-out the God of Life
/ the safe-maki^ Christ, and the Holy-gost of the heritable Rich^ of the
h^ouenlie Beauty* also lead many men (...) unto Des^ruction* and brought many
in^o gre^ Heauynes and grievous Miscrie: and have eue^ so ther-through /
prepared the Judgment of yo^ Condemnation / the-sooner over yourselues.

6. Therefore shall also presentl^e ^through (...) your Fall; many upright
Hearts be able ligh^ to perceive / that ye are the same Messengers of (...)
Deuell / which are gon-fourth against God and (...) Service of Love / and
against his Truth / for seduce ^with your unclean Dirt and painted Holiness;
the simple Hearts / from the Family of Love ^like-as ye have don unto many
other ignorant Men / which walk without the House and Service of Love; and to
pluck them into your Snares. But verelie it shall not avail you in this Day
of Love / by the Faithfulones of the Family of Love / to spread-abrode your
seducing Seeds any farther. For your false Practices* and your Fall / are now
well perceived of the upright Hearts.

7. Yea consider well thereon ^O ye goodwilling Hearts to the Righteousness;
how slily these Messengers of the Deuell com unto you. this Brood of Lucifer.
these Resisters of the Truth / as Iannes and Iambres. these false Ministers of
the Priestes-office / as Nadab and Abihu. these Seditious-persons / as the
Company of Chore. and these unsent bloud-thirstie Preachers / as the Priests
of Iezabel: Consider (I say) advisedly thereon / how subtillie they
shew-fourth themselves / and can paint their false Nature / with an
Angels-colour / to thentent that one should not perceive the Falshod of their
wicked Hearts* and the Lusts and Desires of their Whordom and Adultery /
whereof their Eyes and Hearts are full: and that ^hey might euenso under a
colored Covering / ^loke their Uncleanness of Whordom and Adulte^ie / together
with their abominable Idolatry and ^alse Godseruices* as also lay those-same
their Ab^ominations and Uncleanness / upon the Necks ^f the Single-mynded and
Good-willingones to ^he Love of Jesus Christ, or report such-thinges of them*
and so accuse and defame them therwithall.

8. Behold / ye that have Eyes for to perceive / such false Hearts and
contentious Deuels-messengers / which seek not the Peace o^ Christ nor the
Concord in the Love. but bring-i^ all Renting and Dissension or Breach / are
driuen-fourth by the false Spirit of Antichrist, and by the lying Ingeniousnes
of the Fleash / for to practice al^ Deceit and Falshod / according to the
Works (...) the Deuell / and also to seduce the simple single-min^ded Hearts
/ like-as they do the Unfaithful and Waueringones in the Belief / unto their
Error.

9. And if then the Deuell cannot accomplish o^ bring the same to-passe ^at
full; through his Belia^lish Men / so brings he the same also into the Hands
of the false Women / which are inclined t^ such wicked Works / and have
cra^tie Subtlety to accomplish the false Devices of the Deuell.

10. Euen-thus verelie / do they all deal wit^ Deceit and Falshod / which
go-out from the wicke^ World: and also all those which have geeuen the^
thereunto. And so does eueryone of them diligentli^ apply him / to sow
euery-where his Mischeef an^ contentious Seeds. and to spew-fourth all
Blas^pheamie / against God and his Family of Love.

The Third Chapter.
^Hy on you / ye whorish Genera^tions and adulterous Children of the vn^cleane
and defiled Bed: How are ye thu^ ^seeing that ye yourselues are so vnclen^
grown to such Presumption! that ye com vn^^ the Elect of God and Children of
Love / and (...) upon you as also endeavor you / for to mingle your Uncleanness
of the Hedghogs-filthines and Swines-dung / among our pure and heavenly Food
/ or to bring it in besides the same / and to feed our sweet-hearted Children
of the Love ther-withall / like as ye have don / toward the Unfaithful and
unto many Worldlie-mynded. Phy / phy on the stinking Dirt of your Uncleanness.

2. Verelie / like as the Dirt of your Uncleanness ^s a filthy Stinck before
God / euenso is it also a filthy Stinck in our Noses.

3. And although ye garnish the same your stinc^ing Dirt ^when as ye bring
the same unto us; with Roses and Lillies / and with many-maner of ^aire Flowers
/ and strew it over with Rosemary^eaues and Cinnamon / yet does nevertheless
the Sun of Righteousness ^with his bright and whot Shyning; make the Stinck of
the same / manifest before us. Yea so manifest / that all those that have ^ynded
the Love and her Service / with upright and faithful Hearts / and show all
Obedience ^owardes the same / have a great Lothsomnes of the Stinck of the same
Dirt.

^. For the holy and gracious Word of God / which is heald-fourth before us
in living Power through the holy Spirit of ye Love of Jesus Christ, and through
God-his elected Minister HN; in the Service of Love / and which is ^as the true
Bread ^f Life / that is com unto us from Heaven; admini^red to a living Food
of our Souls / is so reue^nd and so godly for us to hear and to feed-of /
^^d we have also turned our Lust and Love so ^hollie thereunto / that we abhor
and have a great Lothsomnes / to hear of anything else. Yea and much-more a
Lothsomnes / to receive or enjoy anything of any strange Spirits / or of
anyone which is a Stranger unto the Family of Love.

5. Therefore / seeing that ^ee com not fourth out of the Family of Love / nor
have not Gods Word nor Spirit / in living Power by you. but only the
Imagination of your Knowledge / or the dead Letter / which all false Hearts of
the Scripture-learned / occupy to Contention and Di^corde: So bide then
hardly with your garnished Dirt / by yourselues: For here by the Faithful
and Electedones in the Family of Love / it is al-to-well known.

6. But if ye desire to repent / and to com by us in Sorrowfulnes ^or your
Sins / for to be converted and made-sa^e from all your Abominations* and
taught and instructed aright / in the Way of the Truth of Jesus Christ: and so
then to live vprightlie in all Truth of God and Christ: So forsake it then all
that ye have taken to you / without the gracious Word of God and the
Requiring of his Service of Love / and separate you wholly therfrom: and
assemble you than euenso to our Communialtie of Saints / to Unity of Heart
in the Love / so shall ye then be received of us with Joy: And thus in ye
Repentance / let yourselues ^vnder the Obedience of the Love and her Seruice^
be washed and cleansed from all your Sins / with the holy and pure Waters
of the holy Spirit of Love: and be than taught with the pure Doc^trine of ye
holy and gracious Word / to the King^dom of the God of Heavens / and
nourrished-vp (...) ^ncient Elders and Fathers of the Fa^ilie of ^oue; in the
holy and godly Understanding / to ^end that ye might know and observe /
all that which pleases God / and is reasonable and edifying ^ith Men* also
confess and publish-fourth the safe-^aking Belief of Christ and his upright
Fruits (...) Righteousness* and out of the same Treasure of ^ur Hearts*
rightly bring-fourth ^out of the true ^oue o^ Jesus Christ; the New and the
Old / to a ^od Instruction of other more.

FOr-that-cause ^according to the Counsel of the holy Scripture; become ye
No^ ^rned-about to obedient Children / and borne anew / ^^t of the Water and
out of the Holie-go^t: and (...) then ^as newborn Children; the pure
vncor^pted Milk / out of the virginlie Breasts of the ^oue: To thend that ye
might euenso after-that ^hen-as ye are entered into the Beginning of the
^ristian Doctrine* and nourrished-vp to ye Young^anship of the holy
Understanding; be fead with ^e strong Meat of the gracious Word* and and by
the Holie-gost of Love / into all Truth and ^haritie.

Thus have a good and right regard unto ^e Sentences of the Wisdom / and
receive the^me / to the Renewing of your Understanding / and to Goodwillingnes
to the upright Righteous^s: and endeavor you not first / to pluck-out the
^plin^er out of another Eye / ereuer ye have plu^^d the Beam out of your
own Eye. Nether-yet ^plye you also to be a Teacher / so long as the ^octrine
to the Kingdom of Heaven / is yeat need^ll for yourselues.

9. Apply you not also to live / nether-yet (...) show or witness the Life unto
another / ereuer the ye yourselues are passed-thorowe the Death* an^
gon-thorowe the small Way which leads vn^^ Life.

10. Likewise take not upon you / to euangeli the Euangelie of the Kingdom unto
anyman / e^cept that ye have in the Obedience of the Requ^ring of the Love /
received the Kingdom of Heaven seen with your Eyes ^in the upright Being
Christ; the Life which is everlasting* heard the same ^in ye Renewing of your
Spirit and Mind with your Ears* and handled or felt it ^in the v^ right
Righteousness and Holiness; with your hande^

11. Also speak not of any Mysteries of God (...) his Kingdom / except that
ye have so learned the same Mystery / in the Service of Love / and that be
profitable for to be declared and fruitful to hear^ and stretch to all Concord
/ Peace / and Righteousnes^

12. Likewise take not upon you to minister an^ Services of Christ, nor to
witness or preach t^ Knowledge of Christ according to the Spirit / e^^cept that
ye have first obedientlie fulfilled the Se^^uices of Christ and his Doctrine /
and that Christ have his Shape in you: and that euenso Christ himself / speak
the same Testimonies through you^

13. Fardermore / be not diligent to teach t^ Truth unto anyone / except that
ye have first b^ obedient unto the Truth and her Requiring* (...) are taught
by the holy Spirit of Truth / in t^ Service of Love* as also known to be
meet a^ ordained by the Elders in the holy Vnderstandi^ of the Truth / to the
Ministration of the True^^

^e not also blown hether-and-thether with (...) Winds or Spirits which rule
in the Air / ^ther suffer yourselues to be driven / by the Spi^es of Knowledge
/ which have their Working in (...) Children of Men which know not God / nor
^t their trust in Him.

But ground and stablish you on the euerlast^g fast-standing Foundation of Jesus
Christ: and ^sider in your Understanding / that ye are in ^th-wise called unto
Christ / through the holy Eu^gelie of Christ, for to have an upright Being
Christ, and so then to buyld upon Him.

THus let eueryone look well to it / and hold a sharp Watch over himself /
that (...) be not lead-astray by his own Knowledge / so ^ll he not then also
seduce an other. But let eue^one hold himself obedientlie on the pure Doctrine
^he gracious Word and Service of Love: For ^oso lets not himself
obedientlie / be taught and ^ected to the true Light of the everlasting Life /
vn^^ the Doctrine of the gracious Word and Ser^e of Love / nether-yet deals
and walks faithfully under the Obedience of Love / he shall not be able to
teach or lead other rightly. but they shall ^like-as ye Blind which lead
each-other; fall together into the Gulf or Pit of Destruction.

Take it effectually to heart. ^HARITAS EXTORSIT PER ABIA.
