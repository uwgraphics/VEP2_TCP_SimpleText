By the King.
A Proclamation for the restraint of the disorderly repair of Mariners and
Soldiers, unto the Kings Court, or City of London.
WHereas diverse Mariners and Soldiers, billited or bestowed in several parts
of this Realm, to attend his Majesty's service, and diverse other persons of
loose life, in their company, and by their example, have of late presumed in a
very disorderly manner, to come to His Majesty's Court, and do flock together
in companies and so repair unto, or toward the City of London, which
insufferable disorder may breed very great inconveniences, if a timely course
should not be taken to suppress the same: His Majesty's therefore, taking
these things unto His serious and Princely consideration, by the aduite of His
Privy Counsel, does straightly charge and command all Soldiers and Mariners,
which now are, or hereafter shall be so billited, or bestowed, as aforesaid,
That from henceforth they presume not, in any disorderly, or tumultuous
manner, or by companies or troops, or otherwise, (without the special leave of
those, who have, or for the time shall have, the command of them;) to come to
his Majesty's Court, or to repair unto, or toward the City of London, from
those places where they are, or shall be so billited, or bestowed, otherwise
then in their necessary passage thither, or from thence to those places,
whither they shall be commanded or sent, until they shall be duly discharged.

And His Majesty's does also straightly charge and command, all such Soldiers
and Mariners, and all other loose persons, who can give no good account of
their abode in these parts, that forth with they return to the places from
whence they came, and that they duly observe his Majesty's Royal Will and
pleasure herein, upon pain of incurring his Majesty's high indignation, and
such further penalties, as by Martial Law is appointed to be inflicted, or may
be inflicted upon offenders in that kind.

Given at His Majesty's Court at White Hall the seventh day of October, in the
second year of His Majesty's Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. God
save the King.
