A Proclamation commanding Conformity to his Majesty's pleasure, expressed in
his late Charter to the Tobacco-pipe-makers.
WHereas diverse of the poorer sort of Our Subjects have heretofore lived by the
trade of making Tobacco pipes, but for want of power to retain and keep their
Apprentices and servants in due obedience, and to restrain others from
intruding upon their Art, the ancient Makers have not so well prospered as
was desired: For prevention of which inconveniences, and for reducing the
workmen in that trade to such a competent number, as they might be governed
after the example of other Societies, who flourish by ranging themselves under
good Orders; We did by Our late Charter Incorporate a selected number of the
most ancient, and such others as they for skill and honesty should admit into
their Socitie: Thereby prohibiting all others who were not members thereof, to
make any sort of Tobacco-pipes within Our Realm of England or Dominion of
Wales; And thereby also commanding, that no person or persons directly, or
indirectly should buy Tobacco-pipes to sell again, of, or from the hands of
any others then the known Members of the said Society. Yet neuertherlesse
being lately informed by Certificate from sundry Our Justices of Peace of Our
Counties of Middlesex and Surrey (who in due obedience of Our Royal pleasure,
declared in Our said Charter, did in person assist the execution of the same)
That diverse lewd and obstinate offenders, had fortified themselves in their
houses with weapons, And in contempt of Our Regal Authority resisted them,
coming with the several Warrants of the Lord Chief Justice of Our Bench, and
other the Justices of Peace within Our City of London, and the said counties
of Middlesex and Surrey; And also that there were diverse il disposed persons
(who delighting to oppose al good orders) contemptuously maintained these
underhand offenders, some by harboring the unlawful Makers of Tobacco-pipes
secretly in their houses, there to make them contrary to Our Charter, to the
end to partake of the stolen profit thereof; Others, by buying secretly this
underhand made ware, in contempt of Our Authority, and with an evil intent of
overthrowing this Society which we have sought to establish.

Now therefore, that by the presumptuous example of these disobedient persons,
others may not be encouraged hereafter by impunity to presume to resist and
contemn Our Royal Commandment in matters of greater moment, or to withstand
the authority of Magistrates and government, These are to charge and straightly
command, that no persons whatsouer within this Our Realm of England and
Dominion of Wales shall hereafter presume to make any manner of Tobacco-pipes,
but such as are or shall be members of the said Society: nor shall presume
to harbor in their houses any Tobacco-pipe-makers to use their trade there,
who are not of the said Society; nor that any person or persons (especially
who buy Tobacco-pipes to sell again) shall at any time, or in any place buy or
obtain by any means, directly or indirectly any Tobacco-pipes whatsoever,
from any vnder-handmakers or others, but only from such as are known members
of the said Society, and that at their common Hall, or other known Warehouses
appointed, or hereafter to be appointed, where they may be bought by all Our
loving Subjects, upon pain of Our High displeasure, and such punishments as
are due for such contempts, whereof We shall require a strict account by
proceeding against the offenders in Our Court of Star Chamber.

Further commanding, that if at any time hereafter any person shall be so
audacious as to fortify themselves in their houses, or in the houses of any
other, or to withstand Our will and pleasure herein, or to resist Our
authority given and imparted to Our Lord chief Justice and others, in the
search or apprehension of them, or any of them; Then We do hereby will and
require, that sufficient power be had and taken by such who shall have such
Warrants, to apprehend such obstinate and contemptuous persons, and to carry
them before Our said chief Justice, or other Justice of the Peace, that
punishment may be inflicted on them in the seuerest manner Our Laws will
permit, by imprisoning their body, till they have put in sufficient surety
for their good behavior afterward. Hereby further, straightly charging Our
Attorney general for the time being, that he cause all and every such wilful
and disobedient persons, for such their high contempt in this behalf, to be
prosecuted in Our Court of Star Chamber (where Our will is they shall be
sharply punished) according to the measure of such their audacious and bold
resistance of Our Royal commandment. And to the intent that these frauds and
abuses may the better be found out and punished, Our pleasure is, that it shall
and may be lawful for any two, or more of the said Society, together with a
lawful officer to enter into any suspected place or places, at lawful and
convenient times, there to search for, and find out any underhand made, or
sold Tobacco-pipes; And all such so found to seize, take, and carry away, and
them safelye to keep to be disposed of, according to the tenor of Our said
Charter.

And lastly, for the full execution of this Our Royal Commandment, We will
and require the Lord Mayor of Our City of London, for the time being, and all
other Majors, Shiriffes, Justices of Peace, Bailiffes, Constables, and all
other Officers and Ministers whatsoever; That they and every of them in their
several Offices and places, be from time to time ayding and assisting to the
Master, Wardens, and Society of Tobacco-pipe makers in the due execution and
accomplishment of this Our Royal will and Commandment, as they tender Our
pleasure, and will answer the contrary at their peril.

Given at Our Court at Theobalds the seven and twentieth day of May, in the
eighteenth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. God save
the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, and John Bill, Printers to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty.
