DIEV ET MON DROIT

royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
WHereas We are given to understand, that the Lady Arbella and William Seymour
second son to the Lord Beauchampe, being for diverse great and heinous
offenses, committed, the one to Our Tower of London, and the other to a
special guard, have found the means by the wicked practices of diverse lewd
persons, as namely Markham, Crompton, Rodney, and others, to break prison, and
escape on Monday the third of June, with an intent to transport themselves into
foreign parts: We do hereby straightly charge and command all persons
whatsoever, upon their Allegiance, and duty, not only to forbear to
receive, harbor, or assist them in their passages any way, as they will
answer it at their perils, but upon the like charge and pain, to use the best
means they can for their apprehension, and keeping in safe custody, which We
will take, as an acceptable service.

Given at Our Manor of Greenewich the fourth day of June, in the ninth year
of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.
