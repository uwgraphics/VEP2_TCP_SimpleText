Dominions of the said King of Spain or Archduchesse, upon pain of

Ordnance, Tackle, Goods, and Merchandise, of, and in those Ships, to His
Majesty's use, which shall be found and taken within any of His Majesty's
Ports, or in any of the Ports of the said King of Spain or Archduchesse, or
upon the main Seas, or within any Creek thereof, either outward, or homeward
bound, upon any Voyage for Trade or Commerce, unto their, or either of their
Dominions: And this to continue and be observed, until his Majesty declare
His pleasure to the contrary.
