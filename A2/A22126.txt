royal blazon or coat of arms HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE By the King.
A Proclamation for the confirmation of all Authorized Orders, tending to the
Universal publishing and teaching, of a certain Religious Treatise, compiled
by Authority, and Entitled by the Name of GOD, And the KING.
WHereas the Oath of Allegiance devised by Our Parliament, and defended by Our
Royal Pen, has not only been impugned by Contradiction, but also has been
endeavored to be made frustrate, by diverse secret practizes, and devices,
whereby either to diswade Our Subjects from the taking of the same, or
otherwise to make them take it only in dissimulation, to anoyd the penalties
of Law, inflicted upon the refuser: We in Our Princely Wisdom, calling to
mind that the terror of Laws without Instruction and Education, is but an
imperfect remedy; have thought good, That there should be coupled a brief and
perspicuous Book or Treatise, Entitled, GOD AND THE KING, Or a Diologue,
showing that Our Sovereign Lord King JAMES, being immediate under GOD, within
his Dominions, does rightfully claim whatsoever is required by The Oath of
Allegiance: fit for the capacity of Youth, whereby in their tender years, the
truth of that Doctrine may be bred and settled in them, and thereby they the
better armed, and prepared to withstand any persuasions which in their riper
years, may be offered and used toward them, for the corrupting of them, in
their duty and Allegiance; And also, may prevent and anoyd their incurring
the danger of Our Laws for refusing the same. And although, We have by Our
special Direction, recommended unto Our right trusty and well-beloved
Counsailour, the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, and to the rest of the Bishops
of the Realm, to give order for the universal dispersing, and teaching of all
Youth in the said Book; Yet, for the better effecting of Our Princely purpose
therein, We do by these presents, straightly charge and command, all Our
loving Subjects, to obey such Direction and Order, as by the said Lord
Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Archbishop of York, or other the Bishops of Our
Realm, shall be taken, for and concerning the publishing and teaching of the
same: Upon pain, both of such Ecclesiastical Censure, as in the like cases
are to be inflicted; And also of Our Princely Indignation, and such other
punishment, as by the Law and Our Prerogative Royal, shall be due against the
contemners of this Our Royal Commandment.

Given at Theobalds the eighth day of November, in the thirteenth year of Our
Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the nine and
fourtieth.
God save the King.

Majesty. ANNO DOM. 1615.
