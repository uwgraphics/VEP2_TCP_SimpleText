A Proclamation for freedom of passage out of Ireland into England.
WHereas some restraint has heretofore been made by His Majesty by
Proclamation, of the free passage of His Subjects out of the Kingdom of Ireland
into England without License in that behalf: His Majesty by the advice of His
Privy Council, and upon the motion of both the Houses now here assembled in
Parliament, has thought fit to take off that restraint; And does therefore
hereby declare His Royal will and pleasure to be; That all His Ports of
Ireland shall be as open and free for all His Subjects to pass out of that
Kingdom into England as formerly they have been, notwithstanding any restraint
by Proclamation since His Majesty's access to the Crown.

And therefore His Majesty does straightly charge and command all Majors,
Sovereigns, Portreeves, Customers, Comptrollers, Surveyors, Searchers,
Waiters, and all other His Majesty's Officers and Ministers of all or any the
Ports of Ireland, or the members thereof; That they permit and suffer all such
of His Majesty's Subjects within that Realm as shall be minded to transport
themselves into England, to have freedom of passage at the said Ports
accordingly without any their lets or interruptions; Any His Majesty's
Proclamations to the contrary notwithstanding: And His Majesty further
requires that this His Royal pleasure be made known to all his Subjects, by
publishing the same in both the said Kingdoms.

Given at the Court at Whitehall the eighteenth day of November, in the
sixteenth year of His Majesty's Reign.
Imprinted at London by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1640
