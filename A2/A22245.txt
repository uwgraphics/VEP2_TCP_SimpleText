Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all and singular Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, Deanes, and their
Officials, Parsons, Vicars, Curats, and to all spiritual persons. And also to
all Iusties of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Constables, Church wardens
and Dead boroughes: And to all Officers of Cities, Boroughes, and Towns
corporate: And to all other our Officers, Ministers, and Subjects whatsoever
they be, as well within Liberties, as without, to whom their presents shall
come, greeting:
WHEREAS we are credibl^ given to understand, as well by the humble
supplication and petition of our poor distressed Subject Robert Law, Vicar of
the Mother Church of Saint Mary's, in our Borough of Huntington, and County of
Huntington, together with a Certificate from our true and loyal Subjects the
Bayliffes and Burgesses thereof, and Thomas Beard Doctor of Divinity, and one
of our Chaplins, As also by another Certificate under the hands of our right
trusty and well-beloved Oliver Lord Saint John, Thomas Maples Esquire, our high
Sheriff for our Counties of Huntington and Cambridge, Sir Oliver Cromwell, and
Sir Robert Pain Knights, Edward Germin Doctor of Divinity, Robert Awdley, and
Thomas Hetly Esquires, Justices of the Peace within our foresaid County of
Huntington, That our said poor Subject Robert Law, having all his life time
been a painful and industrious person in his calling, and a man of honest
use and conversation, is now fallen into great want and poverty, by reason of a
lamentable and scarefull Fire happening on the Frist day of July last past
about midnight, which consumed and burnt down to the ground not only his
dwelling House lately built, together with all his Household Stuff therein
being sulle furnished, and all his Books and Writings of good moment, with
great store of Timber ready squared, which he had provided for the building of
other Houses, Amounting in all the whole loss to the value of Two hundredth
pounds and upwards: but also the whole Town and people in their Beds was in
great danger to have been consumed, had not the Country Shepherds discovered
the same and raised the Town, to the utter undoing of our said poor Subject,
who before this untimely accident lived well, but has now lost in a moment
that little estate which with great care and travel all his life time he had
saved together to relieve himself, his poor Wife and Children in his latter
days, who being now near upon Threescore years and sickly, is not able to
take that pains in his vocation for his living as heretofore. And therefore be
has most humbly besought Us to commiserate his poor estate, and to commend
his wants unto the charitable consideration of all our loving and welsisposed
Subjects within certain Counties hereafter mentioned, not doubting but that
all good Christians well weighing with themselves the uncertainty of man's
estate in this world through these inevitable accidents, will be ready and
willing as feeling members one of another misery, to extend their charitable
contributions toward the relief and comfort of their poor afflicted brother
in this his great necessity, none knowing how soon nor whose chance may next
happen into the like calamity.

Know ye therefore, That of Our especial Grace and Princely Compassion, We
have given and granted, and by these our Letters Patents, do give and grant
unto our said poor Subject Robert Law, and to his Deputy and Deputies, the
bearer or bearers hereof, full power, license, and authority to ask, gather,
receive, and take the Alms and charitable benevolence of all our loving
Subjects whatsoever Inhabiting within our Counties of Middlesex, Essex,
Bedford, Buckingham, Northampton, Leicester, Cambridge, Huntington, Suffolk,
Norfolk, Lincoln, York, Nottingham, and Darby, with our Cities of
Peterborough, Norwich, Lincoln, and York with our University of Cambridge,
and Isle of Ely, with our Town and County of Kingston upon Hull, and our Town
of No^tingham. And in all Towns Curporate, Privileged places, Parishes,
Villages, and in all other places whatsoever within our said Counties and not
else where, for and toward the new building of his said House, the rerouery of
his loss, and the relief and comfort of our said poor Subject, his Wife, and
five Children.

WHEREFORE we will and Command you and every of you, that at such time and
times, as the said Robert Law, or his Deputy or Deputies, the bearer or
bearers hereof, shall come and repair to any your Churches, Chapels, or other
places, to ask and receive the gratuities and charitable benevolence of our
said Subjects, quietly to permit and suffer them so to do, without any manner
your lets or contradictions, And you the said Parsons, Vicars, and Curats, for
the better stirring up of a charitable devotion, deliberately to publish and
declare the Tenor of these our Letters Patents, unto our said Subjects upon
some Sabbath day, when as the same shall be tendered unto you. Exhorting and
persuading them to extend their liberal contributions in so good and
charitable a deed. And you the Churchwardens of every Parish, where such
Collection is to be m^de (as aforesaid) to collect and gather the Alms and
charitable benenolence of all our loving Subjects, as well Strangers as others
and what shall be by you so gathered to deliver it to the bearer or bearsts of
these our Letters Patents and to no other person, when as thereunto you shall be
required. And lastly, whereas we are informed of the great abuse which is now
crept in amongst these poor people, who sell their Licenses unto some other
person, whereby men's charity goes not the right way, but unto such as deserve
it least: That from henceforth our will and pleasure is, that if it may appear
unto you or any of you, that the said Robert Law, has contracted any
bargain, or made or shall make sale of these our Letters Patents, whereby the
benefit should pass from him to any other person, That thereupon these our
Letters Patents shall be void and of none effect. Any Statute, Law, Ordinance,
or Provision, heretofore made to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding.

IN witness whereof, We have caused these our Letters to be made Patents for
the space of One whole peace next after the date hereof to endure.

Eighteenth year of our Reign of England, France, and Ireland: And of Scotland
