the kings that were her lords would have castised him with fair speech and
behestes / and also by yeftes / and warned hem in fair manner upon all love and
friendship that they should amend her lyther condycyons / but all was for
naught. for they dydden her own will in all thing that hem lyked and had of

for they we^d that they would have amended her tacches and her wikked thewes /
but of such conditions they were. that for fair spech^ and warnyng they dydden
all the wers / and for betynges eftsoon mochel wers / Wherefore the king yt
had wedded albyne wrote the tacches and conditions of his wife albyne. and sent
the letter to dioclisian her fadre / And wha^ the other kings herd that
albynes lord had sent a letter to Dyoclisia^. anon they sent lettres ensealed
with her seals the condycyons and the tacches of her wyfes also. When the
noble king dyoclisian saw and herd so many complayntes of his doughtres: he was
sore ashamed and became wonder angrye and wroth toward his doughtres. and
thought both night and day how that he might amend it that they so mysded. And

to all that were under his lordship / And the thridde day after that
solempnite the noble king Dioclisian sent after his.xxxiij. doughtres that they
should come and speak with him in his chamber / and when they were come to her

dispytously hem reproved and vndernam and to hem he said that if they would not
be chastysed they should his love lose for evermore And when the ladies herde^
all this / they became^ moch^ abashed and greatly ashamyd and to her fadre they

wherefore sustres my counseyll is that this night when our husbondes ben^ a

where. And anon all the ladies consented and granted to this counseyll / And
when night was come^ the lords and ladies went to bed / and anon as her
lords were a sleep: they cut all her husbo^des throtes. and so they slowen
hem all. Whenne that Dioclisian the king her fadre herd of this thy^g / he

all the barons and lords of Surre counceylled not so for to do such
sternesse to his ownes doughtres. but only should void the la^d of hem for

And in that time reigned in France.xij / kings: and the.xj. kings assembled a

Prophecye of Merlyn declared of king edward the sone of king Edward Cap / CCxi
OF this king Edward prophesied Merly^ and said that there should come a goot
out of Care that should have horns of silver / and a berde as with as snow /
and a doppe should come out of his nosethirles that should betoken much harm
hunger / and death of the people: and great loss of his la^d and that in the
begynny^g of his regne should be haunted much lecherye. He said soth. allas ye
time / for king Edward that was king Edwardes sone was borne at canaruan in
Walys / for soth he had horns of silver and a berde as snow. when he was made
prince of walys / so much he yafe hy^ to riote and felonye / And soth said
Merlyn in his prophecye / that there should come out of his nose a doppe for in
his time was great hunger among ye pour people: and strong deth^ among the
rich that deyde in strange land with mochel sorwe. and in werre in Scotland /
and afterward he lost scotland and gascoigne: And whilles that him self was
king. there was much lecherye hau^ted And also merly^ told and said that this
goot should seche ye flour of life and of death. and he said sothe / for he
spoused Isabel the ky^ges daughter of france / And in his time Merly^ said
that there should be made brugges of folk upon dyches of ye see: and that was
well seen at bannokkesborne in scotland wha^ he was disco^fyted there of the
scotts And merly^ told also that stones should fall from castelles and many
towns should be made pley^ / and he said soth^: for wha^ king Edward was
discomfited in Scotland. and came tho southward. ye scotts besieged the
castelles and did hem moch^ harm and brent towns unto the hard erth^. And
afterward Merly^ said that an egle should come out of Cornewaille that should
have fetheres of gold / that of pride should have no piere: and he should despise
lords of blood: and after deye through a bear at Gauersise. and that prophecye
was full well know and fond sothe. For by the egle is understood sir Piers of
Ganastone. that tho was earl of Cornewaille^ that was a wonder proud man that
despised the baronage of england* but afterward he was beheded at gauersichet
through ye earl of Lancaster and through the earl of warrewyk. And merlyn told
that in his time yet should seem yt the bear should bre^ne. and that bataill
should be upon an arm of the sea in a field araied like a shield / where should
deye many white hedes. and he said sothe / for by the brennyng of the bear is
betokened great dread through cutty^g of swerd at that bataill ordained i^ a
field as a shield upon an arm of ye see. is betokened the bata^lle of mytone
For there came^ the scotts in manner of a shield in manner of a wynge and slew
upon swalle men of relygyo^ ^ prestes and seculers wherefore ye scotts kalled
that bataille in despyte of englysshme^ the white bataille: And after Merly^
said that ye foresaid bear should done the goot much harme^ and that should be
upon the southwest also upon his blood and said also that the goot should lose
moch^ dele of his land / till ye time that shame should hy^ overcome. and tha^
he should clothe him wit a lyo^s sky^ne and should wy^ne ayen^ that he had
lost. and much more through people that should come out of the northwest. that
should make hy^ been adrad. and him avenge of his enemies through cou^ceil of ij.
owls that first should be in peril to be undone / And that ij. owls should
wend over ye see into strange la^d / and there they should dwell till a
certey^ time: and after they should come into england ayene And the.ij. owls
should do moch^ harm unto many one / and that they should cownceylle the got
for to meve werre ayens the foresaid bear: and that the goot and the owls
should come unto an arm of the sea at Burton up trent and should we^de over:
and that for dread the bear should flee with a swan in his company unto bury
toward ye north through an unkind owtputter / and that the swan tha^ should be
slain with sorwe: and the bear should be slayn^ full nygh^ his own nest that
should sto^de upon Pou^frete^ upon whom the son shall shede his bemes / and
many folk him shall seche for the mochel virtue / And he said full sothe for
the good Earl thoa^s of Lancaster was borne in ye northwest and cosyn to the
king and sone of his uncle* And by law he made ye king lose much la^d. the
which had purch^ased wylfully^ till at the last the king thereof took shame and
him self filled with cruelte* And after he gate ayene that he had lost and
much more thereto / through folk that he let assemble out of ye northwest that
made him to ben^ adrad and aue^ged hy^ of his barons through cou^ceill of sir
hughe the spe^cer the fadre and of sir Hugh^ the sone that beforne were
outelawed of e^glo^d for her wykkednesse But afterward came ayene into England
sir hugh^ the spencer the fadre out of france / and so moch^ counceilled the
king that he should werre upon Thoa^s of Lancaster / so that the king and the
spe^cers and the earl of aru^dell and her power met with Thomas of Lancaster at
burton up trente and him there disco^fited. and sir Humfrey earl of Hereford
was in his company / and after fledde^ the foresaid Thoa^s and Hu^frey with her
conpanie at burbrugge with sir Andrewe of Herkela that is kalled the vnky^de
outeputter / And also sir symo^d ward earl of york they came and met with
Thomas of lancaster wit an huge company: and hem there discomfited / and in
that scomfiture the earl of Hereford was slain upon the brugge cowardely with
a spear in the foundeme^t: And the good earl Thomas was take and lad unto
pounfrete And tho he was beheded beside his own castle: but afterward many
men hy^ sought for miracles that god did for hy^: And in that time Merlyn said
for sorwe and harm should deye a people of his land / wherefore many lands should
be upon hem the boldre / and he said sothe: for by encheson of his barons that
were done to death for saint Thomas quarrel of Lancastre. people of many lands
became the bolder for to meue werre upon the king / for her blood was turned to
many and diverse nacyons.

And afterward Merlyn told and said that the foresaid owls should done much
harm unto the flour of life and of death: And they should bring her unto much
disease / so that she should goo and we^de oueruer the sea into france for to
make pees to the flourdelyse and there should abide till on a time that her
seed should come and seche her / and tho they should abide both^ till a time that
they should clothen he^ with grace: and the two owls she should seek and put hem
unto spitouse death And yt prophecye was well known and was full sothe: for sir
Hugh^ spencer the fadre and sir Hugh^ the sone did moch^ sorwe and persecucyon
unto queen Isabell through her procurement to her lord the king. So they
ordained among hem that she was put unto her wages that is to sey xx.
shillyng in the day. wherefore ye king of France her brother was wonder sore
a^noyed. and sent into England by his ^re^s unto king edward that he should
come to his parliament to Paris into France: but king Edward was sore adrad to
come there. for he wend have been arested till that he had made amends for
the trespace that sir Hugh spencer the fadre and the sone had done / and for
the harm that they had done to quen^ Isabell his suster. Wherefore through her
ordenau^ce and consent of the spencers the queen Isabell went over see into
france for to make accord bitwen^ king edward and the king of France her
brother. and there dwelled she in france till Edward her eldest sone came her
to seche and so they dwelled there both till that aliaunce was made bitwen^ hem
and the gentill Earl of Henaude that if they wit her help might destroy and
overcome the venyn and the falsenesse of ye spencers that sir Edward should
spouse dame Phelip the wurshipfull lady and the earls doughtyr of Henaude.
wherefore the quen^ jsabell and sir Edward her sone and sir edmond of Wodestoke

aftyr they pursweden the spe^cers till that they were taken and put unto
spytouse death as before is said and her conpanye. and also for the great
falsenesse that they did to the king Edward and to his people: and Merly^ said
also more that the got should be put into great disese and in great anguissh^
and in great sorwe he should led his life / and he said soth: for after the
time that king Edward was take he was put into ward till that ye spe^cers were
put unto the death / And also for encheson yt he nold not come unto his own
parliament at london as he had ordained and assigned him self and to his
baronage: and also would not govern and rule his people ne his Reaulme as a
king should done Sum of the barons of England came^ and yelde^ up her homages

his fadre had seized into his hond and put out Thomas of Lancaster his brother
and so was he Earl of Lancaster and of leicestre and eke styward of England as
his brother was in his time: but sir Edward that was king edwardes fadre made
sorwe wytout end: for cause that he might not speak with his wife ne with his
sone / wherefore he was in much meschyef / for though it were so yt he was lad
and ruled by falls counceill: yet he was king Edwardes sone / kalled Edward with
long shankes and come^ of the worthiest blood of the world / and thoos to whom
he was wonet to yeve great yeftes and large / were most pryue wit the king his

And among her company yt the freres had pryuely brought there was a friar
that was called Dunbenet: and he had ordained and gadred a great company of
folk to help at that need: but the friar was take and put in the castle of
Ponnfrete. and there he deide in prison: And sir Henry earl of Lancastre that

Mautrevers and they lad him from the castle of Kemlworth unto the castle of

king ordained an huge host for to fight ayens the scotts. and sir johan the
earls brother of Henaude fro beyond the sea came for to help king Edward and
brought wit him seven hou^dred men of arms and arrived at Dover: and they were
commanded to go forth till that they came^ to york there that the king abode

englysshme^ were clothed all in cotes and hodes peynted with lettres and with

was night Mortymer that had wach^ for to keep of the host that night
destourbled ye wach^ that no thy^g must be done / and in the mean while ye
scotts stele by night toward her own contre as fast as they might / and so

almighty god the king was not taken: and in great peril was tho the reaume of
England: and that night the moon shone full clear and bright and for all the
kings men the scotts escaped harmeles / and in the morwe when the king wist
that the scotts were ascaped into her contre / he was wonder sorry and full
hertely wept. and yet wist he not who hy^ had done that treson: but that falls

edward came again tho to york sorwefull: and his host departed and every man
went into his own contre with full hevy chere and morning semblant. and the
Henaudes took her leave and went unto her own contre: and the king for her

lancaster had often times herd the common clamor of the englysshmen: of the
diseses that were done in England. and also for diverse wrongs that were done
among the commune people. of the which the king bare the blame with wrong.
for he nas but full young and te^dre of age And thought as a good man for to
done away and slake the sklau^dre of the kings person if that he migh^t in
any manner wise So as the king was thereof nothy^g gylty. wherefore he was in peril
of ^^th and lymme And so he assembled all his retenau^ces and went and spoke
unto the^ of the kings honor and also for to amend his estate: And sir thomas
brotherton earl Marchall. and sir Edmond of wodestoke that were the kings
uncles. and also men of London made her oath him for to may^ten i^ that same
querell And her cause was this / that the king should hold his housold and his
meyny as a king ought for to done and have also his ryalte: and that the queen
Isabell should deliver out of her hand into the kings ho^de all manner
lordshyppes rentes towns and castelles that apperteyned to the crown of
england as other queen's had done before her: and meddle with none other thing /
And also that sir Rogier mortimer should dwell upon his own lands: for the
whych^ lands he had help disherite much people / so that common people were
not destroyed through her wrongefull taking / And also to enquere how and by
whom the king was betrayed and falsely deceived at Stanhope. and through whose
cou^ceyll that the scotts went away by night from the king. And also how and
through whose counceill the ordenau^ce that was made at the kings coronacion was

wysest lords of all ye reaume: and without hem should nothing be granted ne
done ne said. for the which couenaunts malycyously were put a down fro the

was ordained by the asse^t of the comynaulte in plain parliament for to be
vndyr the ward and governance of Henry earl of Lancastre his cosyn for

the March ayens all the barons will of England in prejudice of the king and of
his crown. and sir Ioha^ of Eltham ye ky^ges brother was gurt with a swerd of
Cornewaill: and tho was kalled Earl of Cornewaille. and evyrmore queen Isabell
so moch^ procured aye^s her sone the king that she had ye ward of the forsaid

not come. but ordained all his power ayens the queen Isabell and the Mortymer.
and men of London ordained hem wit v.C. men of arms. When queen jsabell wist
of this doing: she swore by god and by his names full angreli: that in evil

the king her sone as a knight armed for dread of death / And it was done the
king to understand that the earl Henry of Lancaster and his company would
have destroyed the king and his counceill for evyrmore / wherefore the king was
somdelle toward him hevy and annoyed When the Earl Marchall and the Earl of
kente the kings brother herden of this tydyng: they rydden so in message
bitwene hem that ye king granted his pees to the earl Henry of Lancastre for a

and also disgysed hy^ with wondre rich clothes out of all manner reason. both of
shaping and of weryng: whereof the Englysshme^ had great wo^dyr how and in what
manner he might co^tryue or find such^ manner pride: and they said among hem
all conmunely that his pride should not long endure. And the same time sir
Geffrey mortimer the yo^g yt was the mortimers sone let him kalle king of folly
/ and so it befell aftyrward in deed: for he was so full of pride and of
wrecchednesse yt he held a round table in walys to all men that thither would
come. and cou^trefeted the manner and the doy^g of king arthures table but
openly he failled. for the noble king artur was the most worthy lord of

unto the pope Johan the xxij. at avyuion^ and said that almighty god had
oftetymes done for Thomas love of Lancaster many great miracles to many men and
women that weren through diverse maladies undone as unto the world / and through
his prayer they were brought unto her health. and so sir Edmond prayed the pope
hertely. that he would grant hi^ grace that the forsaid Thomas might be

time that he were bettyr certefyed of the clergy of England. and sent by her
obedience what thing god had done for the love of Thomas of lancaster aftir the
suggestyon that the foresaid Earl of Kent had unto hy^ made. and when this
edmond saw that he might not speed of his purpose. as touching the translacyon
/ he prayed him of his cou^ceill as touching sir Edward of Carnarva^ his

might best be done as touching his delyurance sith that a commune fame is
through england that he is a life and hole and sauf. When the pope herd him
tell that sir edward was a lyve / he commanded the earl upon his benyson that
he should help with all the power that he might him to be deliured owte of
prison: and save his body in all manner that he might / And for to breng this
thing to an end he assoilled hy^ and his company a pena and culpa and all tho
that help to his deliurance / Tho took Edmond of wodestoke his leave of the
pope and came again into England / and when sir Edmond was comen. sum of the
freres preschours came and said that sir edward his brother yet was a live in

made his oath unto the foresaid king Edward over his astate and his will / of
which oath the pope hi^ assoilled through by his bylles to hy^ sent / and anon
as king edward wist thereof. he ordained anon^ his barons and came unto Berewyke
/ and conquered the town: at which conquest there were slayn^ xxv / M and
vij.C / and ye bailloll that was king of scotland came and yield hy^ unto king
edward: and the king afterward delivered him out of the tower of London / and
all the great lords of Scotland with him that were take at Berewyke and yaf
hem saufco^duit to go into scotland / and the scotts since through her
falsenesse werred upon king Edward. and when sir Johan bailloll king of
scotland saw all this he went and put him over the sea unto Du^pier and lived
there upon his own lo^des as well as he might. till that the scotts would
amend hem of her misdeeds and trespace / and lad with him sir Edward his sone.
wherefore ye scotts in despyte of him called him Ioha^ turnelabard for cause
that he would not offend ne trespace ayens king Edward of England and so he
forsook his reame of Scotland and set thereof but littel prys: and this sir
Johan long time dwelled in France till that he deyed there / And sir Edward
his sone vnderfeng his heritage And did homage unto the king of France for his
lands of Dunpied and so it fell afterward that Edward that was joha^ baillols
sone had with him a squire of England yt was bore in york shyre that was
kalled Johan of Barnaby. and this Edward baillol loved him moch^ and was ny him
and full pryue And so this Johan barnaby was at debate with a Frenshman in ye
town of Dunpier. and so he quelled hy^ / and went his way in all that he might
/ into the castle for to have socour and help of his lord: and anon came
the officiers of the town^ to take Johan of Barnaby as a felo^ and sir edward
his lord halpe him: and rescued him / and by nigh^t made him wend owte of the
castle and so he went his way and came into England without any harm / And
when the king of France. saw that sir Edward had rescued his felo^ he became
wonder wroth ayens sir Edward. and anon^ let hy^ be arestyd. and took into his
hand all his land. Tho dwelled sir Edward in prison unto the time yt sir
Henry of Beaumou^t came into France / the whych^ Henry sometime was earl of
Angos in Scotland through his wife and was put out of the forsaid Erledom^ when
ye accord was made bytwen^ England and scotland through ye quen^ jsabell and sir
Rogier the mortymer and her company / for the marriage that she made bitwen^
David that was Robert the brus sone and dame Johan of ye tour king Edwardes
sustyr of England / and well understood this that at the end he should nevyr
come to his right / But if it were through the h^elpe of sir Edward Bailloll.
the which that was right heyr of the reaume of Scotland. And the king of the
reaume of france which was called Lowys loved moch^ this sir Henry / and he
was wit him full pryue and thought for to make a deliura^ee of sir Edward
baillols body if he might in any manner wise / Tho prayed he the king that he
would grant hem of his grace sir Edward baillols body unto ye next parliament
that he might live wit his own re^tes in the men^ time. and that he must
stand to be iuged by his perys at ye parliament The king granted him his
prayer and made the forsaid Edward be delyured owte of prison in the manner
above said: And anon^ as he was out of prison: sir Henry took him forth with
hy^ and lad hy^ into England and made hy^ dwell prevely at the manner of sande^
up onse in yorkshire with ye lady vescy and so he ordained hi^ there an great
retinue of people of Englysshmen and also of aliens for to conquer ayene his
heritage / And so he yafe moch^ silver unto sowdeours and to aliens for to
help hi^ / And they promised to help hy^ in all that they might / but they
failled hy^ at his most need / And at that time Donald earl of Morrif herd
tell how that sir Edward was preuely come. and went to him and made with hy^
great joy of his comy^g ayene and said to him and behight him that all the
great lords of Skotlande should be to hy^ ente^dau^t / and should hy^ hold for
king as right heir of scotland. and so moch^ they would done that he should be
crowned king of that land. and dyden to hy^ homage and feaute / Tho came Sir
Henry of Beaumont to king Edward of england and prayed him in wey of charity
that he would grant of his grace unto sir edward bailloll that he must saufely
goo by la^d from sand hall unto scotland / for to co^quere his right heritage
in scotland / The king answered and said unto him. if that I suffer ye bailloll
went through my la^d into scotland than the people would say there I should be
assentyng to the company: Now sir I pray you that ye would grant hy^ leave
to take unto him Sowdeours of englisshme^ that they might saufely led hy^
through your land unto scotland / and sir upon this covenant that if it so
befell that god it forbede that he be disco^fyted in bataille through the
scotts that j and also all the lords that holde^ with bailloll ben^ for
evermore tint out of owr rentes that we have in england. And the king upon
this covenant granted her bone as touching him. and tho that weren of the
same quarrel yt which claymed for to have lands or rentes in the reaulme of
Scotland

And these were the names of ye lords that purswede^ this matter that is to
say. sir Edward ye bailloill that challenged the reame of Scotland. sir Henry
Beaumou^t earl of Angos. sir David of stroboly earl of Athelees / sir Geffroy
of monbray: Waltier Comyne and many other that were put owte of her heritage in
scotland. when the pees was made bitwen^ England and scotland as before is said
And ye shull understood that the lords took with hem v. hundred men of arms
and two thousand archiers and of footmen / and tho went into ship at
Rauenespore. and sailled by the sea till that they camen to land at Kynkehorne
xij mile from seint Ioha^nes town. and anon sent out her ships ayene for
they should not be hurt ne e^pired nethir that no man should gon^ into the shipp
ayen^ though they had nede^ but abide at all perilles and not flee* but stand
/ and rather suffer death than flee for to maynten her true quarrel. wha^ the
Earl of fiffe a fers man and a storne herd that the Bailloll was comen for to
take the land of scotland: he came in haste to king horn with x. thousand
scotts for to distrouble him that he should not come to land. But sir Edward
bailloll and his company there him disco^fyted at the which disco^fiture sir
Alizau^dre of Feto^ was there quelled and many other. The Earl of fiffe was tho
sorry and full ylle a shamed that so littell a company had him discomfyted and
shamefully put hy^ and all his company that were a lyve for to flee Tho came
sir Edward Bailloll and took the contre all about him / till he came unto ye
abbey of Du^sermelyne and there he fownde vytailles for him and for his folk
and among all other things he fond in a chau^bre about v honderd of great
staves of fine oak with long pykes of yren and of stelle. he took he^ and
delyured he^ to ye most strengest men of his conpanie And anon after he went
fro the^s and loged him in a field ij. mile from seint Ioha^nes town / And
when ye burgeys of the toun^ herd how the earl of Fiffe was disco^fyted through
ye Bailloll / they were sore adrad and brak their brygges that they had made
over the water of erne: so that Bailloll might not gon^ over / wherefore he
logged hy^ there all that night / but littell head he tok of rest and said unto
his people. Now fair lords ye know full well that we ben^ now y logged
bitwen^ our enemies: and if they mow us hampre there is no bote but deth^.
wherefore if we abide here all this night still / I thy^ke that it shall turn us
to much sorwe and harm For the power of the scotts may every day wex and
encresse and we may not so done / And we been but littell people / as ayens hem.
wherefore I pray you for the love of almighty god make we us bold and hardy.
and that we may myghtely take the scotts this night and boldly werre upon hem
and let us purswe hem this night. and if they be trauailled through us and they
see our hardynesse. so that other scotts that comen and mete hem and see hem
so trauailled and weary / the sorer wull they be a drad with us for to fight.
and fersly than we shull fight wit he^. and upon hem purswe. so that through the
grace of god almighty all the world shall speak of ye doughtynesse of our
cheualrye. And syres vndersto^deth well that all the company come^ with sir
Erward Bailloll granted well unto that cou^ceil and were thereof glad and anon
purswed upon the scotts that they becomen wonder weary And the bailloll and his
company sore followed hem and did he^ moch^ sorwe through her assault: so yt
they might not for feeble hem help and for littell people But tho said ye
scotts among hem / what is now befall that so littell a people as the
Bailloll has in wynge done us so moch^ trauaille and sorwe. Now certes it
seems us that he wreccheth by grace / for he is wonder g^cyous in his quarrel:
and all we certes shul ben^ deed er that we may come to him us for to yield
since that his fadre set of us no prys And among all other things ye
bailloll passed the watyr of Erne so that sir Rogier of Swynerton^ the sone was
fers and angrj and went forth. and there they saw people of arms full well
arrayed. and forth they went unto hem / and with hem fowghten and quelled as
many as would abide or took. And notheles at that same assault the Baillols men
wend it had been the most great hooste of Skotlande. And when it came to the
morn. they gadred he^ to gedre and rrsted hem a while But the while that the
Englysshmen rested hem: the noble baron Thomas of wesy: and also ye noble and
gentle baron of stafford pryked her horses up and down by the hills for to
keep the of Estres of the contre And as they pryked up and down they saw a
great host of good array ordained in three wings with helmes and sheldes
shynyng coming upon hem. And when the two for said lords saw that / they
came^ ayene unto Baillols folk with great have and said. Now for the love of god
almighty ben^ of good comfort: for ye shall have bataill anon right. And tho
spoke sir Fouke the sone of Gareyne a worthy baron / of great renomme / and of
deed of arms: Syres lordynges understands well that I wull say unto you. I
have seyn^ many diverse wings as well among sarazens and jews as among the
scotts / And yet saw I never in any time the ferthe part of the wynge fight.
and therefore if we will abide our enemies / we ben ynowe for to fight ayens
he^^ But if we be not of good heart and of good will for to fight wit hem: for
certes we been full few ayens this company: And there for the love of god take
unto us good heart And let us ben^ bold and thenke we nether on our wyfes ne
on our children: but only to co^quere hem in bataille / and through the help of
our lord god our enemies we shull overcome and wit that came the host of the
scotts toward hem full fersly / and aye^s sir Edward the bailloll in iij.
batailles well araied in armure. and wonder fersly they camen toward the
Baillolls men. But when sir Donald Earl of Marchille saw all this. he said to
Robert Brus ye sone of Robert ye brus these words. Sir Robert quod he full
sore me fortinketh at mine heart yt thees folk that the bailloll has brought
with him should deye wit dynt of scottessh swerd sith that they ben christian men
as well as we ben: and therefore me thy^keth that it were great charity to send
unto hem for to yield hem unto our mercy and grace. and rau^sone he^ through
grevous raunsone for asmoch^ as they have taken our la^d. and done ylle / Now
certes quod sir Robert the Brus I have well perceived that thou art on enemy
and a traitor unto scotland sith that thou wilt consent to save our dedely
enemies that have done us much sorwe and shame: and now it seems well that ye
ben of her asse^t. Certes Robert quod sir Donald falsely ye lie / j am not of
her company ne of her consent / and that hastily ye shul see. for I will fight
with hem rather than any of this company: And certes sir Robert said he j shall
maugre thin heed assaille he^ er thou / And with that they prykede^ her stedes
fersly upon Caskemore / and wings hem folewed on a re^che And tho came they
and mete the bailloll and his company at an hongyng bought of the more in a
streit passage. and so fast they hasted hem unto the Englysshmen. so that
thousendes fell to ye ground the one up yt other into a hepe both horse and
man. The bailloll tho and his men mygthely stood ayens hem and fast quelled the
scotts unto the ground and many sore they wounded so long till yt they
stoden upon hem and foyned hem with her swerdes and speres through her bodies /
and so sore trauaylled upon hem till that they becamen full weary and wist not
what for to done / and the scotts that were left a lyve fledde^ away for to
save hi^ self in the best manner as they might. And tho purswed he^ sir Edward
bailloll and his men and quelled of he^ till that was night / and fro thens
they went unto seint Johannes town. and took it and held hem there. and
vitailled he^ self at her own will: for they fo^den ynowe wherewith to make
he^ merry. Tho made the bailloll his men that were wounded gon^ to shipp for to
wend into England for to hele her wowndes / And in that time there was a
flemmyng in the sea a strong thief and robber that was called Crabe. And this
flemmy^g was driven out of flau^dres for his wykkednesse. and therefore he came
into scotland to hold with the scotts and did as moch^ harm unto Englysshmen
as he might. And this crabbe met in ye see ye baillols men that were wounded i^
bataille that were sent ayen^ into England for to hele her wou^des / and this
Crabbe yafe unto hem a great assaute and would have quelled he^ euerichon^ / but
the englisshmen defended hem well and manly / and discomfyted crabbe and his
company. and tho begone he flee into scotland / and as he came toward seint
Johannes town he fond a great company of scotts that were come ayene to
geddre after the discomfyture of Gaskemore: the which besieged baillol and his
men in the same town of sey^t johan. and anon told the scotts how that he
was discomfyted of the englysshmen that were wounded at Gaskemore that went
toward England for to hele her wo^des and said to the scotts that they should
have no might ne grace ayens Edward bailloll / for enche^o^ that he sco^fyted
and empeired all ye cheualrye of scotland with an hand full of men as to
account as ayens the scotts that were slain: wherefore he cou^ceilled for to
remeue the siege from saint Ioha^nes town and keep hem in the best manner that
they cowde and might. The scotts understood that the Crabbe said soth and
forsook the liege and went thens by night. and halpe hem self in the best
manner that they might / When this thing was known through scotland how that
the lords and knights were scomfyted at Gaskemore of Scotland through sir
Edward the bailloil ye shul understood that ye lords and ladies and the
ge^tyls of scotland came^ wonder fast to seint joha^nes town^: and yelde^ he^
to ye baillol / and to hy^ dyden homage and feaute for her lands and yelde^
he^ to his pees. and he received he^ freely And fro the^s he went to the abbey
of Scone. and there he was crownyd king of ye reaume of Scotland. And after he
let cry his pees through owte all the land: And at that time it be fell that
king Edward Bay^^o^l held his parliament among his lieges at the new Castle
up tyne for to amend all the trespaces and the wrongs that had be done in
his la^d And sir Edward the bailloll king of scotland came to him thither and
did to hy^ feaute and homage for the reaume of scotland: And in this manner king
Edward of England gadred ayen^ the homages and feautes of scotland / whereof he
was put out through cou^ceyll and assente of dame Isabell his modre and of sir
Rogier the mortimer earl of the march / Tho took Bailloll king of Scotland his
leave of king edward of england: and went the^s into his own land of scotland.
and set but littel by hem that had cou^ceylled hi^ and helped him in his
quarrel: wherefore they went fro him and lived by her lands and rentes in
scotland. And so it befell after not long that the king of Scotland ne remeued
and came to the town of Anaude / and there took his dwelling and thither came
to hy^ a company of knights strong men and worthy / and yield he^ unto the
king and bear hem so fair in deed and in continau^ce / So that he trust moch^
hem And anon^ as the traitors saw that he trust moch^ upon hem: they ordained
among hem fyfty in a company and would have quelled her king but through the
grace of almighty god he brake through a wall an hole in his chamber: and as god
would he ascaped her treachery and all his men were quelled. and he escapyd with
moch^ dread unto ye town of cardoill / and there held he him sore annoyed: and
this befell in our ladies eve the conceptyo^ / Tho sent king edward the
Bailloll to king Edward of England how falsely and how traitoursly he was in
littell time put to shame and sorwe. through his liegmen: upon whom he trusted
wonder moch^. and prayed him for the love of god yt he would maynten^ him and
help hy^ ayens his enemies / The king of England had of him tho great pity.
and behight him help and socour / and sent him word that he should hold hy^
in pees stille in ye forsaid cite of Cardoylle till that he had gadred his
power: Tho ordained king Edward of England a cou^ceill at london. and let gadre
his me^ in diverse shires of England. and when he all was ready he went toward
the town of Berewyke up twede: and thither came to him king Edward Baillol of
scotland with his power and besieged the town. and made withowte the town a
fair town of pauillons / and dyked he^ all about / so that they had no dread
of the scotts: and made many assaute with gonnes and with other engynes to the
town wherewith they destroyed many fair howses and chyrches. also were beat
down unto the earth with great stones that spitousely came out of gonnes and
of other engynes^ And notheles the scotts kept well the town that the two
ky^ges might not come therein long time. and notheles the ky^ges abide there so
long till thay^ that were in the town^ failled vitailles and also they were so
weary of wakyng that they wisten not what for to done. And ye shul vndyrsto^de
that the scotts that were in ye town of Berewyke through commune cou^ceill and
her assente let cry upon the walls of the toun^ that they might have pees of
the Englysshmen. and thereof they prai den the king of his grace and mercy and
prayed hy^ of trewes for viij days upon this covenant that if they were not
rescued in that side of ye town^ toward scotland of the scotts within viij.
days that they would yield hem unto the king and the town^ also. and to hold
this covenant they profred to the king xij. hostages out of the town of
berewyke. When the hostages were delyured unto the king: anon they of the
town^ sent unto ye scotts and told hem of her sorwe and meschief. And the
scotts camen tho preueli over ye watyr of Twede to the bought of the abbey.
and sir william Dyket that tho was stiward of Skotland and many other that
camen with him put he^ there in great peril at that time of her life: for they
came^ over a brigge that was to broken and ye stones a way. and many of her
company were there drenched. but ye forsaid wyllia^ went over and other of his
company and came by the ships of England and quelled in a barge of hull xvi.
men / And aftyr they went i^to the town of Berewyke by ye watyr side /
wherefore the scotts held tho the town reskued and asked her hostages ayen^
of the king of England. and the king sent word ayen^ that they axed the
hostages with wrong since that they came^ into the town^ of Englo^des side: for
ye covenant was bitwen^ him that the town should be reskued by ye half of
scotland. And anon^ king Edward tho commanded to yield the town^ or he would
hang ye hostages. And the scotts said that ye town was reskued ynowe and
there to they would hold he^. Wha^ king Edward saw yt the scotts break her
covenant that they made / he was wonder wroth. and anon let take sir Thomas
fitz willya^ and sir Alexandre of seto^ wardeyne of Berewyk. the which Thomas
was person of du^bare: and led they^ before all the other hostages for
encheso^ that sir Alixau^dres fadre was keeper of the town And commanded every
day that ij. hostages of the town should be hanged till that were all done
unto the death. but if they would yield the town / and so he should teache hem to
break his couenauntes / And wha^ they of ye town herd thees tydinges / they
became^ wonder sorry and sente^ to the king of england that he would grant he^
other viij days of respite. so that bitwen^ two hou^dred men of arms and xx.
men of arms might be strength^ gon^ bitwene hem to the town of Berewyke hem
for to vytaille that the town^ must be hold for rescued: And if so were that
xxi or xxij or more were slain of the two hou^dred before said that the town
should not be hold for rescued: and this covenant to be holden they sent to
him other xij of ye town^ in hostage: The king of England granted he^ her
prayer / and took the hostages on saint Margaretes even / in the year of grace
a M.ccc. and xxxij. The scotts came fersely in iiij we^ges well araied in arms
for to mete king Edward of england: and edward the king of scotland with her
power / and came fast and sharply ayens eue^so^ge time: and the same time was
flode at Berewyke in the watyr of Twede: that no man might went over on her
horse nor on foot / and the watyr was bytwen^ the two kings and the reaume of
England / and that time abyden ye scotts in that other side / for encheson
that the Englysshmen should have ben^ drownyd or slain

This was the array of the scotts how that they camen in bataylles ayens the

lvi.M.vij.C xlv. and these lxv. great lords ladde^ all the other great lords
above said in four batailles as it is said before: And king Edward of England
and Edward king of Skotla^d had well apparailled her folk in four bataylles
for to fight on foot ayens her enemies: And the Englysh^ minystrelles blewe
her tru^pes and her pypes / and hydously ascryed the scotts. And tho had every
englyssh bataille two wy^ges of prys archiers / the which at that batalll
shoten arewes so fast and so sore. that the Scotts might not help hem self.
and they shoten the scotts thowsandes to ground. and they gone for to flee fro
the Englyssh men for to save her life. And when the Englissh^ pages saw the
scomfiture: and the scotts fall fast to the ground / they priked her maystres
horse wit the spores for to keep he^ fro peril / And set her maistres at no
force. And when the Englissh men saw that they lepte^ on her horse and fast
pursued the scotts and all that they abyden they quelled down right. There
might me^ see the doughtynesse of the noble king Edward and of his men how
manly they pursued the scotts / th^at fledden for dread / and there might men
see many a scottissh man cast down^ on the grownde dede^ And her baners
displayed hakked into pecys: and many a good haberione of stelle i^ her blood
bathe. and many a time the scotts were gadred into companies but evermore they
were discomfyted / and so it befell that as god almighty would that the scotts
had that day no more foyson ne might ayens the Englysshmen: than xx. sheep
should have ayens v. wolfes. and so were the scotts discomfyted: and yet the
scotts had well v. men ayens one englysshman / And that bataille was done on
halydonnehille besides the town of Berewyke: at the which bataille were
slain of ye scotts xxxv.M.vij.C and xij / Of englysshmen but only xiiij /
and that were footmen And this victory befell to the Englisshmen on sey^t
margaretes eve In the year of ye Incarnacyon of our lord Ihesu crist MCCCxxxij
And while yt this doing last the englyssh pages took the pilfre of the scotts
that were quelled every man that he might take without any chalengyng of any
men: And so after this gracious victory the king turned him ayene unto the
same siege of Berewyke: and when they besieged saw and herd how king Edward had
sped they yolden to him the town with the castle on the morwe after that the
bataille was done. that is for to seye: on saint Margaretes day: And than the
king ordained Sir Edward baillol with other noble and worthy men to be kepers
and governors of scotland in his abse^ce / and hy^ self turned ayen^ and came
into England after this victory / with moch^ joy and wurship. and in the year
next sewy^g that is for to say the year of Incarnacion of our lord Ihesu crist
a MCCCxxxiij / and of king Edward vij / he went ayen^ into scotland in the
winter time. at which viage the castle of Kylbrigge in scotland. for him and
for his men that wit hy^ came he recoured / and had aye^s all the scotts will
at his one lust. And in that same year sir Edward baillol king of scotland
held his parliament in scotland wit many noble lords of england yt were at
that same parliament for encheson of her lands and lordshippes that they had in
the reaulme of scotland: and helde^ all of the sam^ Bailloll / And in the viij.
year of his regne. abowte the fest of sey^t Johan baptist sir Edward baillol
the very and true king of scotland as by heritage and right line made his
homage and feaute unto king Edward of England for the reame of scotland at the
new castle upon tyne in the presence of many worthy lords and also of
co^munes both of the reaume of England and also of scotland. And anon^ aftyr
in the same year king Edward of England received of the duke of Bretaigne his
homage / for the Erledo^me and lordship of Richemond. And so following in their
year of his regne / after Mychelmasse king Edward rood into scotland: and there
was he fast by seint Ioha^nes town almost all the winter time / and he held
his crystmasse at the castle of Rokesburgh. And in the same year through out
all England about saint Clementys tide in ye winter there arroos such^ a

IN the xxij year of king edwardes regne he went over the sea in the wy^ter
time / and lay all the winter time at ye siege of Caleys. ye which year the
while the siege lasted Philp ye king of France cast and purposed trechouresly
and with fraud to put away the siege and came ye xxvij day of Iuyll in the
same year with a great host and strong power and neyg^ed unto the siege of
Caleys: the which Phelipp the last day of Iuyll sent to king Edward word that
he would yeve hy^ pleme bataill the iij day next after that about eueso^g time:
if he durst come fro ye siege y abide it: And when king Edward herd that.
without any long tarieng er long avyseme^t he accepted gladly the day and
hour of bataill that Philip had assigned. and when the king of France herd
that the next night aftir he set his te^tes a fire. and remeved and went away
thens cowardly Then^ they yt were in the town and in the castle besieged.
sey^g all this how that they had non^ other help ne socour of the king of
France ne of his men and also that her vitailles withi^ne hem were spended and
vasted. and for defaute of vitailles and of refresshing they eten horse hou^des
cattes and mys for to keep her throuth^ as long as they might. And wha^ they
saw and was fonde^ among he^ at the last that they had no thing among hem for
to ete ne live by ne no socour ne rescuynge of the Fre^sshme^ of that other
side. they wist well yt they must needs deye for defaulte. or else yield the
town. and anon they wenten and token down the baners and the arms of
france on every side that were honged owte / and wenten on the walls of the
town on diverse places as naked as they were borne save only shyrtes and her
breches / and helden her swerdes naked. and the point donward in her hondes and
putte^ roppes and balters about her nekkes and yelde^ up the keys of the
town and of the castle to king Edward of England wit great fere and dread of
heart / And when king Edward saw this as a mercyable king and lord received all
thay^ to grace. and a few of the gretest personers of state and of governance
of the town he sent in to England there to abide her rau^sone^ And the kings
grace suffered all the co^minalte of the town to go whidder they would in pees
/ And without any harm let hem bear wit hem all her things that they might
bear and carry away keeping the town and ye castle to him self: Tha^ through
mediacion of cardinals that were sent fro the pope trews was take there bitwene
france and England for ix / months tha^ next folewy^g. and about Mychelmasse
king edward came ayen^ into England: with a glorious victory. And in the
xxiiij year of his regne / in the eest parties of the world there arose and
began a pestylence and death of sarazens and paynyms that so great a death was
never herd of before / and that wasted away so the people that uneaths the tenth
person was left a live. And in the same year about the southcou^trees and also
in the west cou^tres: there fill so moch^ rain and so great watres that from
Crystmasse unto midsomer there was uneaths day ne night but that it rayned
somewhat / through whych^ watres the pestilence was so enfected and so abundau^t
in all countries and namely about the court of Rome and other places by the sea costs that uneaths there were left lyuy^g folk to bery hem that were deed
honestly / but maden great dyches and pittes that were wonder broad and deep.
and theryn buried hem and maden a renge of deed bodies and casten a littel
earth to hele hem above: and than cast in an other re^ge of deed bodies. and
an other re^ge of earth above hem. And thus weren they buried and none othyr
wise: But if it were ye fewer that were^ great men of estate were buried as
honestely as they might: And after all this in the xxiiij year of king Edwardes
regne. it was hy^ done to wit and understood of a treso^ that was bego^ne at
Caleys and ordained for to seell ye town for a great sum of flory^s unto
king Phelipp of France: through ye falsenesse and ordinance of a knight yt was
kalled sir Geffrey of Cha^^ney that was wonder pryue with king Philip of France

and many other worthy and orped men of arms that were there p^sent wit hy^ for
the sole^pnite of that high fest: and well and wisely in all the have that he
might and also as preuely as he might he went over see And that same year the
good king Edward held his Cristmasse at hauery^g: And the morwe after
Neweyeres day the king was in the castle of Caleys with his men of arms that
none of the aliens wist thereof / And that falls conspi^atour and traitor
Geffrey of charney saw that he might not openly have his purpose of the
castle: preuely and stelyngly he came in and held the town with a great
host / and when he wit his men was comen in: he paid the forsaid so^me of
Flory^s as covenant was bitwen^ hem to a Genevey in the town that was keeper
of the castle. and co^sentyng to the same Geffrey in all this falsenesse and
treachery. and bou^de^ the e^glyssh ministres and servants that were in the
castle that they might not help he^ self. ne let hem of her purpose: and
tha^ weny^g that they had be sure ynow: they spake^ all her wykkednesse and
falsenesse opynli an high yt all men might here And now shull ye here how
they were disceyued for they came^ in by a pryue posterne over a little brygge
of tree: and when they were comen in. softely and pryuely ye brygge was drawn
up and kept. that non^ of hem that came^ in might gon^ out. ne no mo come unto
he^. and anon^ our Englysshmen wenten out at pryue holes and wy^dowes / and
over the walls of the town and of the castle / and wente^ and foughten manly
with the frensshmen that were without. and had the better of hem: the which
wh^en they weren occupied by hem self on her side / the king was withy^ the
town hauy^g with him scarcely but xxx me^ of arms / drew owte his swerd /
and with a loud voys cried an hygh^ / a saint Edward / a saint George / And
when the folk herd that / they camen renny^g unto hi^ and yauen there to her
enemies so great assault that there were mo than two hou^dred men of arms and
many other slain and many fledden away: and so by the grace of god almighty ye
victory fill to the Englysshme^: Tha^ the king took with hy^ this Geffrey that
was fynder of this treachery. And also many other frenssh prisoners / and
withy^ a while after he came aye^ into England / And in this same year and in
the year a fore and also in ye year next after was so great pestilau^ce of men
fro the eest into the west. and namely through boches that tho yt siked on this
day deyed on the thridde day / the which me^ that so deyde^ i^ this pestilence
hadden but littell respite of lyggyng: The pope clementz of his goodness and
grace yafe he^ full remissyo^ and foryevenesse of all sins that they were
shriven of / and this pestilence lasted in London fro Michel mass unto august
next folowy^g almost an hole year. And in these days was death wytoute sorowe^
weddy^ges wtoute friendship. wyllfull penance and derth^ wytoute scarcite. and
fleyng without refute or socour: for many fledde^ fro place to place. because
of the pestyle^ce but they were enfecte and might not askape the death After
that the Prophet Isaye says. Who that flees fro' the face of dread / he
shall fall into the dyche. and he that we^deth him owte of the dyche / he
shall be hold and teyde with a gre^ne / but when this pestilence was rested as

marchau^ts and other rich men of his reaume seeing yt it should be dispended in
defendy^g of holy church and of his reaume neuerthelater it profyted naught.
wherefore about mydsomer aftir he made a great host of the worthiest men of
his reame among who^ were some lords. that is for to say the lord fitz
water: and the lord graunson and other worthy knights: of which knights the
king ordained sir Robert knolles a proved knight and a well assaied in deed of
arms for to be governor / and that through his cou^ceill and governance all
thing should be governed and dressed. and when they came^ into france as long
as they dwelled and held hem hool to gedre the Fre^sshmen durst not fall upon
he^ And at the last about the beginning of winter for envy and couetyse that
was among he^ and also discord they sondred and parted he^ into diverse
co^panyes unwisely and folely. But sir Robert knolles and his men wente^ and

pry^ce as other cites in Guyhe^ne did for great taxes costages and rau^sones
that they were put and set to by pry^ce edward / which charges weren
importable and to chargeable. wherefore they turned fro hy^ and fyllen to the
king of France. And when pry^ce Edward saw this: he was sore chafed and
grieved and in turnyng hom^ward ayen^ into England wit sore scarmysshes and
fighty^g and great assautes fought with he^ and took ye forsaid cite and
destroyed it almost to the ground and slow all yt were found in the cite /
and tha^ for diverse sikenesse and maladies that he had / and also for defaute
of money that he not might wythsto^de ne tarry on his enemies: he hyed hy^
ayene into England / with his wife and his meyne / leuyng behind him in
gascoygne the duke of Lancastre and sir Edmond Earl of Cambrygge with other

Normandye. where king edward had left certain seges in his stead till he came

so the king of Nauerne wit great wurship and great yeftes took his leave and
went home again And about the beginning of March wha^ the parliament at
westmy^ster was begone. the king axked of the clergy a subsidy of.l.M.
pownde. the which by a good auyseme^t and by a general co^uocacyon of the
clergy it was granted and ordained that it should be paid and raised of the

and of other diverse places for diverse things and points of treson that they
were difamed of. that is for to say that they were rebelle and would rise
ayens the king.

This same year the duke of Lancastre and the earl of Cambryge his brother
came^ owte of Gascoigne into England. and toke^ and wedded to their wifes
petres daughters sometime king of Spaygne / Of which two daughters the duke
had the elder / and the earl the yo^ger: and that same time there were sent two
cardinals fro the pope. that is to say. an Englyssh cardinal and a Cardynall
of Paris to trete of pees between the ij reaumes: the whych^ when they had be^
both long each in his prouy^ces / and in places and in contres fast by tretyng
of the forsaid pees / at the last they took with hem her lre^s of procuracie.
and went again to the court of Rome ward / withowte any effect of her purpose.
In this same year also there was a strong bataill on the sea bytwen^
Englysshme^ and Fle^my^ges and the Englisshmen had the victory and toke^ xxv.

vnwyty^g hem that they were of that co^tre: And redly moch^ harm had fall
because thereof / ne had pees and accord ye sonner between he^ be made: And in
this same year the Fre^sshme^ besieged the town^ of Rochell: wherefore the earl
of Pe^broke was sent into Gascoigne with a great company of men of arms for
to destroy the siege The whych^ passed the sea and came sauf to the Haven of
Rochell / and when they were there at the haven mouth or that they might enter
/ suddenly came upon he^ a strong nauye of Spaigne / the which overcame tho ye
Englysshmen in moch^ blemysshyng hurtyng and sleyng of many persons / for as
much as the Englysshme^ were not than ready for to fight ne ware of he^. and
in the comi^g upon of the Spaignardes all the Englysshme^ other they were take

and there they took ye earl wit an huge tresoure of ye reame of england / and
many other noble men also on mydsomer even the which is sei^t Etheldredes day.
and ledden hem with hem into Spaigne / And of this meschief was no great wonder
for this earl was a full evil liver as on open lechour. and also in a certain
parliament he stood and was aye^s the ryghtes and frau^chyses of holy church^.
And also he counceylled ye king and his cou^ceill that he should axke more of
men of holy church tha^ of other persons of the lay fee / And for that the
king and other of his cou^ceil accepted and toke^ rather evil opynyo^s and
causes aye^s me^ of holy church / than he did for to defend and maynten^ the
right of holy church: it was seen many times after for lake of fortune and
grace / they had not ne bear awey so great victory ne power ayens her enemies
/ as they did a fore. This same year the king with a great host entered the sea
to remeue the sege of Rochell. but ye wy^de was even contrary unto hy^ and
suffered him not long time to go far fro the land. wherefore he abode a certain
time upon the sea costs abydyng after a good wind for hem / and yet came it
not so at ye last he came thens with his men to land ward ayen^ / and anon^ as
he was a land. the wind began to turn and was in an other cost tha^ he was

he should leave of and meddle not in his court of the kepinges and reseruacyo^s of
benefyces in e^glo^d / and that they that were chose^ to bisshoppes sees and
dignites freely and with full right might joy and have and be confermed to the

king was agreued and had me^t and purposed to have exilled ye monks of the
same house / and so they spe^ded moch^ good or they might have ye ky^ges g^ce

that the king should not gra^te ne let no bn^fyces by his write. that is called
quare i^pedit. but as touchy^g the electyo^s above said: there was no thy^g
touched ne do: and yt was wyted and put upon certain clerks the which rather
supposed and hoped to be auau^ced and promoted to bisshopriches / which they

worthy men of both reames to trete of pees between the two ky^gdomes: And this
tretys lasted two year with great costs and houge expe^ses of both^ parties.
And at the last they went and departed the^s without any accord or effect /

of London was made Erchebisshop. and maistir Willya^ Curteney that was bishop

This same year deyed sir Edward the lord spencer a worthy knight and a bold.

which perlement he axed of the co^munalte of the reame as he had done before a
great subsidy to be granted to him for defendyng of him and of his reame. but
the communes a^sweryd that they were so often day by day grieved and charged with
so many tailliages and subsidies that they might no longer suffer non^ such^
charges: and that they knew and wiste well that the king had ynow for sauy^g of
him and of his reame. if the reame were well and truwely gouerned^ but that it
had be so long evil gouernyd by evil offyciers that the reame might nether
be plenteuous of chaffare and marchau^dise ne of richesse: And these things
they profred hem self. if ye king would certeynly to preue and sto^d by / And if
it were fond and preued after that. that the king had need. they would than
gladly every men aftyr his power and state hy^ help and lene / And after this
there were publysshed and showed in ye parliament many pleyntes and defautes of
diverse offyciers of the reame. and namely of the lord Latimer the kings
Chamburleyne both to the king and eke to the reame / And also at the last there
was spoken and treted of Dame Alice peers for the great wrongs and evil
governance that was done by her and by her cou^ceill in the reame: the which
dame Alyce peers the king had hold long time to his lemmen. wherefore it was
the less wonder though through ye freelte of the woma^nys excity^g and stery^g
he consented to her lewdness and evil cou^ceill. ye which dame alice and
also ye lord latymer and other such^ that stered ye king to evil governance
aye^s his profit and ye reames also / all the comminalte axed and desired
that they should be meved and put away: And in her stedes wise men and worthy
that weren true and well assayed and proved and of good governance should be
put in her stedes / So among all other: there was one among the co^munes that
was a wise knight and a true and an eloque^t man whose nam^ was piers de
lamare: and this same Piers was chosen to be speker for the co^munes in the
parliament And for this same piers told and plublisshed the truth and rehearsed
the wrongs aye^s the foresaid dame alyce and other certey^ persons and the
kings cou^ceyll as he was desired by the co^munes And also trusty^g moch^ for
to be supported and may^tened in this matter by help and favor of the pry^ce:
Anon as the pry^ce was deed at ye instau^ce and request of the foresaid dame
Alyce this Piers de lamare was iugged to perpetual prison in the castle of

Ectour all men both christian and hethen while he lived and was in good point
wondered moch^ and drad him wonder sore whose body is wurshipfully buried in the
church at Caunterbuey. And in this same year: the men and the Earls tenau^tes
of warrewyk aryse^ malicyously aye^s ye abbot and ye covent of Ensham and her
tenau^tz. and destroyed fiersly ye abbot and ye town and wounded and bet her
me^ and slowe^ of he^ many one / and we^te^ to her manners and places. and did
moch^ harm and breke^ down her parkes and her closes and brente^ and slowe^
her wild bestes and chached he^ brekyng her fisshpondes hedes and let the
water of her po^des stews and ryuers re^ne out and toke^ the fyssh and bear it
with he^ and did he^ all ye harm that they might in so ferforth that forsooth
they had destroyed perpetuely that abbey with all her me^bres and appertenau^ces.
but if the king the so^ner had helped it and take heed thereto. and therefore the
king sent his lre^s to ye Earl of Warrewyk chargy^g hy^ and conn^^u^dy^g that
he should redress and amend tho evil doers and brekers of his pees: and so by
many lords and other fre^des of both^ sides pees and good accord and love was
made bitwen^ hem. and for this hurly^g as it was said / ye king would not be
governed at yt time by his lords yt there were in ye perleme^t. but he took and
made his sone the duke of Lancastre his governor of ye reaum^ / the which
stood so still as governor till ye time yt he deyde. The same year anon^ after
ca^delmasse or ye perleme^t was done ye king asked a subsidy of the clergy
and of ye lay fee / and it was granted him / that is for to say that he should

year were a certain of lollardes taken / and falls heretics that had purposed
through falls treson to have slain our king. and for to have destroyed all the
clergy of ye Reame if they might have had her falls purpose. but our lord god
would not suffer it. for in have our king had wary^g thereof and of all her falls
ordinance: and came suddenly wit his power to seint Ioha^nes wtoute smythfeld /
and anon they toke^ a certain of the lollardes and falls heretics / and
brought he^ unto the kings presence and there told all her falls purpose and
ordinance how they would have done and wrought if they might have reigned and
had her will. and there they told whych^ were her capitay^s and governors And
tha^ the king conmau^ded he^ to be lad to ye toure of London. and tha^ took moo

Gilles feld. and there to be ho^ged and bre^t on the galewes. And also there
was taken sir Rogier acton knight for heresy and eke for treson aye^s ye king
and the Reame. and he came a fore the clergy and he was co^uicted for his
heresy to be bre^d and dampened before the justices to be drawn from the tower
of london through the cite to seint Gilles field and to be honged and bre^t. And
in the second year of king He^ries regne the v. he held a cou^ceill of all the
lords of the Reame at westmy^ster. and there he put hy^ this dema^de and
prayed and besought he^ of her goodness and of her good cou^ceill and good
will to show him as touchy^g the title and the right yt he had to Norma^die /
Gascoygne. and Guihe^ne: the which the king of france wit held wro^gfulli
and vnryghtfully / the which his au^cestres before hy^ had be true title of
co^queste and right heritage: ye whych^ Norma^die Gascoign^ and Guyhe^ne the
good king Edward of wy^desore and his au^cestres before hy^ hadde^ hold all her
life's time And his lords yafe hy^ cou^ceyll to send e^bassatours unto the king
of France and his cou^ceill / and that he should give unto hy^ his right
heritage. that is to say Norma^dye Gascoygne: and Gwyhe^ne: the which his
predecessors hadde^ hold a fore him: or else he would it wy^ne with dynt of
swerd in short time with the help of Almighty god / And than the Dolphyne of
France answered to our embassatours and said i^ this manner / that the king was
over young and to tender of age to make any werre as ayens him. and was not like
to be no good werriour to do and to make such^ a conquest thereupon him and
somewhat in scorn and despyte he sent to him a tonne full of tenys balls.
because he should have so^what for to play with all for hy^ and for his lords
/ and that became hy^ better tha^ to maynten any werre And than anon^ our
lords that weren Embassatours toke^ leave / and came^ into England ayene. and
told the king and his cou^ceil of ye ungoodly answer that they had of the
Dolphyne / and of the present ye which he had sent unto the king And when
the king had herd her words and the answer of the Dolphyn: he was wonder
sore agreued and right evil paid toward ye Fre^sshmen and toward the king and
the Dolphyn. and thought to avenge him upon hem as soon as god would send him
grace and might / and anon^ let make tenys balls for ye dolphy^ in all ye have
yt they might be made / and they were great go^ne stone for the dolphyne to
play with all / And than anon^ the king sent for all his lords and held a great
cou^ceille at westmynstre. and told unto hem the answer that they had of the
dolphyne and of his worthy present that he sent to him and to his lords to
pley with all: and there the king and his lords were^ accorded that they should
be ready i^ arms with her power in ye best array that might be done: and get
me^ of arms and archiers yt might be gotten / and all other stuff that lo^ged
to werre and to be ready with all her retenue to mete at Sowtha^pton be lammasse
next sewy^g without any delay. wherefore ye king ordained his nauye of ships
with all manner of stuff and vitaille yt lo^ged to such^ a werrour of all manner
ordinance in ye haue^ of southampton into the no^bre of CCC / xx. sailles /
And than fill there a great disese and a foul meschyef. for there were three
lords whych^ yt the king trust most moch^ on. and through falls couetise they
had purposed and ymagined the kings death and thought to have slain him and
all his Brotheren or he had take the sea The which were named thus sir Rychard
earl of Ca^brygge brothyr to ye duke of york. The second was the lord scroppe
tresorer of England. and ye thridde was sir Thoa^s gray knight of Northco^tre:
and these lords a fore said for lucre of money had made promise to the
fre^sshmen for have slain king Henry and all his worthy brethren by a falls
train suddenly or they had be ware But al mighty god of his great grace held
his holy ho^de over he and saved he^ from his peryllous meyne and for to have
done this they received of the Frensshmen a million of gold: and that was there
opynly preued. And for this false treson they were all there iuged unto the
deth^ / And this was the iugemet that they should be ladden through Hampton and
without Northgate there to be beheded / And thus they ended her life for her
falls couetyse and treson.

Anon as this was done the king and all his meyne made hem ready and wenten to
ship and toke^ and sailled forth with xv.C. ships and arrived withyn seyne
at kyde cause upon our ladies even in the assumptyon jn Normandye with all his
ordenau^ce and so went hi^ forth to Hareflete: and besieged the town all
about by land and eke by watyr And sent to the capiteyne of the town and
charged him for to deliver the town And the capyteyne said that he none
delyured him and none he would yield to him but bad hy^ done his best. And tha^
our king laid his ordinance unto ye town that is for to say / go^nes Engynes
and trypgetes and shete^ and cast to the walls and eke unto the town / and
kast down both toures and town / and laid he^ unto the grownde / and there
he played at the tenys with his hard go^ne stone / And they that were withyn
the town when they should play their song was well away and allas that ever
such^ tenys balls were made. and cursed all the^ that werre began / and the
time that ever they were borne And on the morwe the king did cry at every Gate
of the town that every man should be ready on the morwe erly to make assaute
unto ye town And willyam Bouchier and Johan grant with xij. other worthy
burgeys came^ to the king and besought him of his ryall pryncehode and power to
withdraw his malice and destructyon that he did unto hem / and besought hi^ of
viij days of respyte and trewes if any reskue might come unto he^ / and else
to yield up the town unto he^ with all her goods. And tha^ the king sent for
the capyteyne and kept the remenau^t still wit him. And the lord Gaucorte that
was Capiteyne of ye town went forth to Rone in all have unto the Dolphyne for
help and socour. But there was non^ ne no man of reskue. for ye dolphy^ would
not abide And thus this Capiteyne came ayene unto the king and yolde up the
town and delivered him the keys: and than he kalled his uncle the Earl of
Dorset: and made hy^ capiteyne of the town^ of Harflete / and delivered him the
keys and bad him gone to put out all the frenssh people both men women and
children and stuffed this town of Harflete with Englysshme^ And than the king
sent in England and did cry in every good town of England that what crafty
man would come thither and inhabyte him there in that town: he should have hows
and howshold to hy^ and to his heirs for ever more And so thither went mani
diverse marchau^ts and crafty men and enhabyted he^ there to stre^gth^ ye town
and were^ welcome: and when the king saw that this town^ was well stufed both
of vitaille and of men This worthy pry^ce took his leave and went to caleys
ward by land. and the frensshmen herd of his comy^g / they thought to stop
him his way that he should not pass that way and in all ye haste that they
might breke^ all the brigges there any passage was for horse and man in so much
that there might no man pass over the rivers nothyr on horse ne on foot / but
if he should be drowned: And therefore our king with all his people went and
sought his way far up to Paris ward. and there was all the ryall power of
France assembled and ready to give hy^ bataille and for to destroy al his
people But almighti god was his gydde and saved him of his enemies power and
purpose thanked be god that saved so his own^ knight And king in his rightful

enemies to which were in his wey to give him bataill. tha^ the king with a
meke heart and a good spirit left up his hands to almighty god and besought
hy^ of his help and socour: and that day to save his true servant: ad than
owr king gadred all his lords and othyr people about / and bad hem all be of a
good cher^. for they should have a fair day and a gracyous victory and the
better of all her enemies: and praid he^ all to make hem ready unto ye bataill
for he would rather to be deed that day in the field than to be taken of his
enemies: for he would never put the noble Reame of England to Rawnsone for his
person. And the worthy duke of york fell on his knees and besought ye king of
above that he would grant him that day the avauntward in his bataille^ and the
noble king granted him his asky^g and said grant mercy cousin of york and
prayed him to make him redj And tha^ he bad every man to ordeyne a stake of
tree and sharp both^ ends / that the stake might be pight in the earth a
sloppe: that her enemies should not over come he^ on horsebake* For that was her
false purpose. and araied he^ all there for to over ride our meyne suddenly at
the first coming on of he^/ at the first brownt And all night before the
bataylle the fre^shmen maden many great fyres and moch^ revel with howtyng and
showting and pleyde our king and his lords at the dise / and an archier for a
bla^ke of her money / for they wenden all had been heirs. The morn arose /
the day began to spryng: And the king by good auyse let array his bataille and
his wings. and charged every man to keep hem hole to gedres and prayed hem all
to be of good chere. And wha^ they were ready he asked what time of the day it
was. and they said Pryme / than said our king: now is good time. for all
england prayed forvs / and therefore be of good chere and let us go to our
journey. and tha^ he said with an high^ voys In the name of almighty god and of
seint George avau^t baner and seint george this day thine help / And tha^ the
Frensshmen came prykyng dou^e as they would have over ryden all our meyne. but
good and our archiers made hem sone to stomble: for our archiers shet never
arowe amys. but it perisshed and brought to ground man or horse For they shote^
that day for a wager And our stakes made top over terne each on other that
they lay on hepes two spear le^gthe of heyghte. And our king with his meyne and
with his men of arms and archiers that tokked on hem so thikke wit arewes and
leyde on tho stakes and our king with his own hands faught manly. And thus
almighty god and sey^t George brought our enemies to ground and yafe us that
day the victory. and there were slain of Frensshme^ that day in the feld of
Agyncourt moo than^ xi.M. with prisoners: that weren taken / and there were
no^bred that day of Fre^sshme^ in the field moo than six socore thousand: and
of Englysshme^ not vij.M: but god that day fought for us: And after came there
tydinges to our king that there was a new bataille of Frensshme^ ordained ready
to stelle on him and came^ toward him Anon our king let cry that every man
should slay his prisoner that he had take. and anon arrayed his bataylle ayen^
ready to fight with the frensshmen: And when they saw that our me^ killed dou^e
her prisoners: than^e they withdrowe he^ and brake her bataill and all her
array / And thus owr king as a worthy co^querour had that day the victory in
the feld of agyncourt in Pycardie. And tha^ our king returned ayen^ there yt
the bataill was to see what people were deed of englysshme^ and if any were hurt

And so the king came rydyng with his prisoners through the cite of London where

and to speak wit hy^ / and with king Henry of England. and he was worthily
received and logged in the bisshoppes ynne of Ely: and all at the ky^ges cost.
And when the Emperor had well rested him and seyn the lo^d in diverse parties
and knew the co^modytes than by process of time he took his leave of the king
/ but or he yede he was made knight of the Gartier / and received and wered the
lyuery. and than he thanked the king and all his worthy lords. And the king
and he went over the sea unto Caleys: and abyde^ there long time to have an

and yt was on saint Lukes eve that he came to Lambythe / And on ye mo^day next

chyuetaine and many other worthy lords with him with me^ of arms and archiers
to go to the sea that none Enemies defowled ne destroubled his nauye / ne
entered his lo^d in no party for to let his vyage ne his journey: And anon the
forsaid Earl took his meyne and went to shypp: and skymmed the sea: and kept
the sea costs that no manner of Enemies durst rowte upon the sea. And anou^ the
king sent his heraudes unto the capytayne of Towke / and charged him to deliver

keys to the king: and besought him of grace. and the king delivered the keys
to sir Johan kykely. and made him capytayne: and commanded him to put out all
Frensshmen both of the town and of the castle. And there beside was the
castle of Lovers / and thither the king sent ye Earl marchal with a fair
meyne. and sauted the town anon it was yolde to the Earl / and brought him
the keys / and he brought the keys to the king and the king took him the
keys and made him captain of the castle of Lovers: and of all that lo^ged

held forth his wey to Cane that was a strong town a fair and a ryall castle
thery^: And anon^ he sent his Heraudes to the Captain and charged him to
deliver the town and his castle or else he would hem get with strength^ of
hand: And they answered and said that he took he^ none. ne none he would
deliver unto him / and than anon^ he laid his siege unto the town: and laid
gonnes on every side / and bette a down both walls and towers and slow also
moch^ people in her houses and eke in streets / and the good duke of Clare^ce
laid a down the walls on his side unto the ground. and so withy^ a while the

Clarence had entered into the town and slow down right till he came to ye
king and spared nothyr man ne child and ever they cried a Clarence and saint
George. and there was deed on ye walls on the ky^ges side a worthy man that was
kalled Springes^ the which the king commanded to be beryed in the abbeye of
Cane fast by wyllia^ conqueror: on whose soul god have mercy amen / And than
the king came into the town with his brother the duke of Clare^ce and many other
worthy lords with moch^ sole^pnyte and myrthe. and tha^ the king comau^ded the
capytayn to deliver him his castle. and he besought the king to yeve
him.xiiij. days of respyte if any rescue would come. and if none came to

and villages i^to the no^bre of xiiij. yolde Upon ye hill before ye castle of
Cane owr king pyght all his te^tes that seemed a town as moch^ as Cane / And
by that came tidings that no rescue would come there / And so at the xiiij.
day at End the capytayne came out of the castle and delivered the keys and
the castle to owr king and barons. and other xiiij. towns weren delivered
unto hi^ also. And anon the king delivered the keys to the duke of Clare^ce:
and made him capytayne both of the toun^ and of the castle: and made hy^
capitayn^ of Baious and of all the other towns also. and so entered he the
castle / and the town also. and there he held seint Georges feste / And

And the same time ye earl of warrewyk leyd a siege to Dou^frau^te and gate it

the king ordained to skym ye see: and to keep the costs of England for all
manner enemies: the wy^de arrose upon hem that they we^de all to have be lost
But throughout ye grace of god almighty and good governance they rydde^ a fore

marchau^dises and ethyr goods / and all the people that were wirhynne and an
othyr Carik drove before Hampto^ and threw his mast over the town walls: and

worthy earl of March took his ships wit his meyne and went to the sea. and
londed in normandye at Hogs / and so rydden forth toward the king. and ever

pight in the grownde and that went over the River of seyne that no vessel
might pass in no kind: and about that cheyne ye king let make a brygge over
the watyr of Seyne that man and horse and all other carriage might go to / and
fro all times when need were: and than came the earl of warrewyke and had got
Dounfront unto the king Henry of England And anon the king sent the Earl of
warrewyke to Cawdebeke to besiege it / And when he came before the town he
sent his heraudes unto the capytayne and bad hy^ yield the town upon pain of

might come to his presence and speak with hi^: And so the good Earl granted
him and than he came out and four other burgeys with him / and entreted so
with this Earl that this same town was vndyr compositio^ to done as the cite
of Rone did: and the earl grawnted and consented there to upon this condition
that the kings nauye with his ordinance might pass up by hem in saufte
without any manner let or desturbawnce. and to this co^posicion they set to
their scales. and the ships passed up by hem in saufte and came before ye

and made he^ right good chire And than came tidings unto the king that the
king of France and the Dolphyne and ye Duke of Burgoygne would come a down to
rescue the Cite of Rone with a strong power of all manner of nations and break
the siege / and he casted him to enter on the Northside of the host / because
that there was the best enter / and most pleyne grownde. and therefore the king
assygned the pryour of Kylmayne with his power. and logged him on the Northside
of ye host to stop her passage / and was by the forest of Lions And of this
ordinawnce they were full glad: and so they went forth in haste and kept the
grownde and the place that the king had assygned hem And they quitte he^ as
good werriours unto her king. Now will I tell you which were ye chief
Capytayns and governors of ye cite of Rone. Mon sir Gwy Boltlire was chief
capytayne both^ of the cite and of the castle: and mo^ sir Termegan he was
capytayne of port Decaux. mon sir de la roche he was capytay^ of the Disnerf.
Mo^ sir Anthoyne he was lieutenau^t to mon sir Gwy botyller. Henry cha^tfien he

And grant Iakes a worthy werriour he was capytayne of all men of werre. and
^e was governor outeward both^ on horsebake and a foot of all men of arms /
when they issued out of the cite of all the ports he he^ araied as they should
contre with our meyne: And each of these capitayns lad v.M. men of arms. and
sum moo. and at the first coming of our king there were no^bred by heraudes
withyn ye town.ccc.M. men and women and children what young and old. and
among all thees was many a man full man of his ho^des. and so they preued he^
wha^ they issued of the cite both on horsebake and on foot: for they came
never at one gate owte all one: but at three or four yates / and at every yate
two or three thousand of good men's bodies well armed / and manfully contred
wit our Englisshmen / and moch^ people were slain diverse times with go^nes
quarelles and other ordinance / And this siege dured xx. wekes. and eueri they
of the town^ hopped to have be rescued / but there came none / so at the last
they kept so long the town^ yt there deyde many a thousands withy^ the toun^

Of ye lawde of king Henry ye v. and what he ordeye^d for king rychard and for
hy^ self after his death Cap. cc.xlvi
hEre is to be noted yt this king Henry the fyffte was a noble pry^ce. after he
was king and crowned. how be it to fore in his yongthe he had ben^ wild
recheles and spared no thing of his lusts ne desires but accomplisshed them
aftyr this likynge But as soon as he was crouned enoy^ted and sacred. anon^
sode^li he was changed into a new man: and set all his intent to live
virtuously in may^teny^g of holy chyrch^ destroyng of heretics / kepy^g
justice and defendy^g of his Reame and subgettys / and for asmoch^ as his fadre
had deposed by his labor ye good king richard and pitously made him to deye /
and for thefe^ce done to hi^ against his ligeau^ce. he had sent to Rom^ to be
assoilled thereof. for which offense ye pope our holy fadre enioned hy^ to make
hy^ be prayed fore perpetuelly. and like as he had done to be taken from hi^
his naturel life therefore he should be found iiij tapers to bre^ne perpetuelly
about his body. yt for ye exti^cto^n of his bodily life. his soul may ever be
remembered and live in heaven in spirituel life: and also yt he should every weke
on ye day as it comith about of his death have a sole^pne mass of Requie^ on

he had comynycacyo^. and also of ye bisshoppes and me^ of the spiritualte. in
so ferforth yt they doubted sore to he would have had the teporal tees out of
their ho^des: wherefore by thauys labor and procury^g of the spiritualte
encoraged the king to challenge Norma^die and his right in France. to the^de to
set^e hy^ a work there yt he should not seek occasions to e^tre into such^
matters: and all his life aftyr he labored in ye werrys in co^query^g great
part of ye Reame of france: yt by the a greme^t of the king charles had at the
governance of the reame of france and was proclaimed rege^t and heir of
France And so not wythsta^dyng all this great werre that he had yet he
remembered his soul / and also that he was mortal and must deye: for which he
ordained by his life the place of his sepulture: where he is now buried: and
every day three masses perpetuelly to be songen in a fair chapel over his

lords and knights of the shires with burgeises came and saw hy^ lie deed but
wo^de ne toke^ could they perceive how he deyde. Here may me^ mark what the
world is / this Duke was a noble man and a great clerk and had wurshypfully
ruled this reame to the ky^ges behoue: and never could be found fault to hy^.
but envy of the^ that were governors and had promised ye Duchy of Angeoy and
the erledome of main caused the destructyon of this noble man. for they drad

said Felix was made legate of france and cardinal of sauoye / and resigned ye

and as it is said almighty god showed miracles for hy^ / This was the xxiij
scisme bytwen^ Eugenye and felix. and dured xvj year / ye cause was this: the
general counceill of Basille deposed Eugenye / which was only pope and
indubitate / for asmoch^ as he observed not and kept the decrees and statutes
of ye cou^ceill of Co^stau^ce as it is a fore said: nethir he rought not to
give obedience to that general cou^ceill in no manner wise / whereof arose a
great alteracyo^ among writars of this matters pro et contra / which can not
accord unto this day. One party says. that the cou^ceyll is above the pope:
that other party said: nay. but the pope is above the cownceyll. God blessid
above all things give and grant his pees in holy church spouse of Crist.

ordained for the werre in the best wise And wha^ they had musteried on the
blakeheth / Certain lords were sent to hy^ for to trete and make apoy^teme^t
with hy^. which were the bishop of ely. and the bishop of wynchestre: and the

somersette should be had to ward and to a^swere to such^ articles as the duke
