By the King.
WHereas We have been informed of the great frauds and deceits used in dying
of all kinds of Silk, but especially in black, which has so far exceeded,
that by the mixture of diverse bad and hurtful things in dying thereof, as
namely of a corrupt matter or stuff called Slip, there has been an
extraordinary increase of weight, sometimes to the doubling of that which it
was before, and sometimes more and sometimes less, whereby the silk so
deceitfully Dyed, is so rotted, corrupted and spoiled, that it is not fit to be
worn or used, and yet is falsely made fair to the eye, to deceive and abuse
the buyer and wearer thereof: And whereas also We have taken knowledge that an
Act of Common Council has lately passed for reformation of such kind of
deceitful Dying of Silk within our City of London and the Liberties thereof:
And that the careful putting the said Act in execution has already wrought
some good effect within the said City and the Liberties thereof, for the
abolishing of the said fraud and deceit: And whereas also We are informed, that
great quantities of the said corrupt dyed Silk is not only daily brought into
this Kingdom from foreign parts, but also the same is covertly Dyed, and sold
in many places of this Realm, whereby We do perceive and foresee, that if
there be not present restraint, and that a public Reformation thereof be not
executed in all parts of the Realm, Our loving Subjects will be still abused
and deceived; notwithstanding any good order that can be taken within Our said
City of London for reformation thereof: Wherefore We having with the advice
of Our Council conceived that it is very requisite to prohibit and suppress
the Dying and selling of such corrupt Dyed Silk in all places of this our
Realm, and to give Order that no person or persons whatsoever, shall hereafter
bring into this Kingdom from foreign parts, any such deceitful heavy dyed
Silk: have thought fit to signify Our pleasure to Our loving Subjects by Our
Proclamation in that behalf: Willing, and straightly charging and commanding
all and all manner of persons whatsoever, as well Our natural borne Subjects, as
Denizens or Strangers, that none of them, nor any other person or persons
whatsoever, do at any time or times hereafter attempt, or presume to bring or
cause to be brought into this our Realm, or Dye or cause to be Dyed in any
parts thereof, or sell or put to sale, or cause to be sold or to be put to
sale, any Silk dyed with that corrupt matter or Stuff called Slip, or any
other matter or stuff, which causes any increase of weight in the said Silk
more then of necessity is required for the color thereof, upon pain of
forfeiture of all and every quantity and quantities of Silk so corrupted,
Dyed, or so brought or caused to be brought into this Our Realm, or sold or
put to sale, or caused to be sold or put to sale contrary to this Our present
Commandment; And also upon pain of confiscation of the said Silk to be
burnt, and of Our high indignation and displeasure, and of such further pains,
penalties and punishments, as for the contempt of Our Commandment Royal in
this behalf may any way be inflicted upon them or any of them so offending.
And We also straightly charge and command all and singular Justices of peace.
Mayors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes Constables, Headboroughs, and all other our
Officers and Subjects whatsoever, that they do at all times hereafter
carefully and diligently see and take order, that this Our ordinance and Royal
Commandment hereby signified and expressed be in all points duly performed,
and that as often as information shall be brought to them of any Silk of that
kind so falsified in the weight, either brought into this Kingdom or Dyed
here, That they do seize the same, and advertise Ou(...) Council of the
quantity and the parties faulty, that order may be taken for the punishing of
them, and destroying of th(...) corrupt Stuff.

Given at Theobalds the 17. day of July, in the tenth year of Our Reign of
Great Britain, France and Ireland.
