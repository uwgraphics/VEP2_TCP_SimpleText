By the King.
A Proclamation inhibiting the resort of His Majesty's people to the Court, for
Cure of the Kings Evil, until the middle of Lent, and to restrain the
access of others from infected places.
WHereas His Majesty, for that sundry parts of the Realm were Infected, did
of late by his Proclamation inhibite resort to be made unto His person for
curing of the Malady called, The Kings Evil, until certain times in his former
Proclamation specified And having of late received advertisement from sundry
parts of this Realm, that it has not as yet pleased Almighty God to withdraw
his hand, but that the Infection is still much dispersed. Now by the advice of
His Privy Council, does again straightly inhibite all His loving Subjects
whatsoever, That none of them resort to his Majesty, or places to His Court
adjoining for Cure of the said Infirmily, called, The Kings Evil, until the
middle of Lent next, at which time he purposes (if God shall be so pleased) to
admit them to His presence, and for them to do as has been used: Straightly
charging all His Officers and Ministers, whom it shall concern, That they make
stay of as many as they shall find travailing, or preparing themselves to his
Majesty for Cure of that infirmity, and to turn them and others whom they
shall find to come from places Infected to the places of their Residence, not
suffering them to approach to His Majesty's presence, or His Court, or the
Court or Household of His dearest Consort the Queen, as they will avoid His
Majesty's displeasure, and the Pains by His Laws ordained against contemners
of His Command.

Given at the Court at Whitehall, the eighth day of November, in the seventh
year of His Majesty's Reign.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
MAJESTY: and by the Assigns of John Bill. M.DC.XXXI.
