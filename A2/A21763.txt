By the Queen.
FOrasmuch as the Queens Majesty our sovereign Lady is credibly enfourmed,
that the infection of the plague is at this present in sundry places in and
about the cities of London and Westminster, and in other Towns and places,
through the which her loving subjects are to pass, coming to her Majesty's
said cities, whereby great peril and danger might not only ensue unto her
most royal person, but also to her most loving subjects repayring thither for
their suites and causes, and thereby also give occasion of dispearsying of the
same in other parts of the Realm: Her Majesty for the said necessary
considerations, and hoping that the same will by the goodness of almighty God,
with the coldness of the year, and such wholesome orders as are taken in her
said cities, the rather cease by the adiournment of part of this next Term
of Saint Michael now at hand, from the vtas of the same, until the fourth
return of the said Term, called Mense Michaelis next coming. Her Majesty
therefore of her especial favor and clemency, for the respects aforesaid, is
pleased and contented to adiourne the said Term of Saint Michael, that is to
say from the vtas thereof, unto the said fourth return of the said Term,
called Mense Michaelis next coming, which her Majesty signifies to all and
singular her loving subjects of this her Realm, to the intent that they and
every of them which has cause or commandment to appear in any of her
highness courts at Westminster, in, or at any day or time from and after the
said vtas of Saint Michael, may tarry at their dwellings, or where their
business otherwise shall lie, without resorting to any of the said Courts for
that cause, before Mense Michaelis next coming, and that without danger of
forfeyture, penalty, or contempt, to incur toward her highness in that
behalf. And nevertheless, her Majesty's pleasure is, that two of her
Justices, that is to say of either Bench one, shall the first day of Michaelmas
Term, called Octabis Michaelis, according to the ancient order of her laws,
keep the ^^soignes of the said Octabis Michaelis, at which vtas of Saint
Michael, writtes of adiournement shall be directed to the said Justices, giving
them authority to adiourne the said Term of Saint Michael, that is to say,
from the vtas thereof, until Mense Michaelis as before is said, and the said
adiournement shall be made in the first day of the said vtas, commonly called
the day of the essoignes. And further her Majesty's pleasure is, that all
matters, causes, and suites depending in any of her other Courts between part^e
and party, as in her highness Courts of Chauncerie, Star chaumber, and
Exchequer, Courts of wards and Liueries, Duchy of Lancaster, and Court of
Requests, shall have continuance, and the party shall have day from the date
of these presents, unto Mense Michaelis as before is said.

Provided always, and her Majesty's pleasure and commandment is, that all
Collectours, Receauers Sheriffs, and other accomptaunts, and all other persons
that should or ought to account or pay any sum or sums of money in any of
her Majesty's Court of Exchequer, Courts of Wards and Liueries, or of her
Duchy of Lancaster, or in any of them, or to enter into any account in any of
the said Courts, shall repair unto the accustomed places at Westminster,
where her highness has appointed such officers and ministers, as for that
purpose her Majesty has thought expedient, and there to pay and do in every
behalf, as though no such Proclamation of adiournment had been had or made. And
her highness further pleasure and commandment is, that all Sheriffs shall
return their writs and processes against all such accomptaunts and detters, at
the days therein appointed. And if any person or persons, who ought to attempt
or pay any sum or sums of money to her Majesty in any the Courts and places
aforesaid, do make default therein, that then her highness writs and processes
shall be awarded and sent forth against every such person and persons, and the
same to be duly and orderly served and returned by the Sheriffs and officers
thereunto appointed, in such like manner and form, as the same should have
been if this present Proclamation had not ben made. And if any Sheriff or
other officer shall make default, or be negligent in the serving, executing, and
returning of any the writs and processes aforesaid, that then every such
Sheriff and other officer, shall incur such pains and penalties, as by the said
Courts, or any of them, shall be taxed and assessed. willing and commanding all
and every of her Majesty's Sheriffs, officers, ministers, and subjects, to
whom it does or shall appertain, to observe and keep their assemblies and
apparaunces, with all their returns and certificates, in her highness said
Courts at Westminster in Mense Michaelis next coming, then and there to be
holden and kept, and there to do their offices and duties in every behalf, in
like manner and form as they should or ought to have done, if this present
Proclamation had not ben had or made, as they will answer to the contrary at
their perils.

Given at her Majesty's manor of Woodstocke, the xxvi. day of September, in
the xvii. year of her Majesty's reign.
Imprinted at London by Richard Judge, Printer to the Queens Majesty.
