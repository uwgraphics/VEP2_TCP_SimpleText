HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
WHereas, at the humble suit and request of sundry Our loving and well disposed
Subjects, intending to deduce a Colony, and to make a plantation in Virginia
We, for the enlarging of Our Government, increase of Navigations and Trade, and
especially for the reducing of the savage and barbarous people of those parts
to the Christian faith, did incorporate diverse Noblemen, Gentlemen and others,
adventurers in the said Plantation, and granted unto them sundry Privileges
and Liberties; amongst which, for their better help and assistance to raise
some competent sums of money to prosecute the same Plantation to a happy end,
We did grant them license to set forth, erect, and publish Lotteries, to
continue for one year after the opening of the same, and further, during Our
pleasure; which liberty has been by the same Company put in use diverse years
past. Now forasmuch as We are given to understand, that although We in
granting the said License, had Our eye fixed upon a religious and Princely end
and design, yet the said Lotteries, having now for a long time been put in
use, do daily decline to more and more inconvenience, to the hinderance of
multitudes of Our Subjects.

We whose care continually waits upon the general welfare of Our people,
have thought it expedient, for the general good of Our Subjects, to suspend
the further execution of the said Lotteries, until upon further deliberation
and aduisement, We shall be more fully informed of the inconveniences and evils
thereby arising, and may ordain due remedy for the same, without any conceit
of withdrawing Our favor in any degree from the said Company or plantation,
and good work by them intended.

And therefore We do hereby expressly charge and command the said Company and
their successors, and all their Officers, Ministers, and Servants, and all
others, That from henceforth they desist and forbear, to use or execute any
manner of grant or License from Us for the keeping and continuing of any
Lotterie, or to keep or continue any Lotterie, within this Our Realm of
England or the Dominions thereof, until such time as We shall declare Our
further pleasure therein. And We likewise require all Justices, Officers, and
Ministers whatsoever, from henceforth, diligently and carefully to see this
Our pleasure executed, and to punish the infringers thereof, as contemners of
Our Royal command.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster the eighth day March, in the eighteenth
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.

most Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XX.
