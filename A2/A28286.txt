Herein is held forth the GIFT AND Good Will of God TO THE WORLD, And how it
is tendered.
MAny are the redeemed of the living God, unto whom Songs of Deliverance and of
everlasting Peace are come, who once witnessed the acceptable ^tar of the Lord,
and the Day of Vengeance of our God. ^^erefore now all you who are found in
that which the wrath (...) God is to, are under Death's dominion, over whom
death ^^^gns, and must (from Adam until Moses) be witnessed. The ^^ing Spirit
of Life is uttering forth its voice; therefore e^^ry one now hearken and hear,
that the everlasting Word (...) Gospel of Jesus Christ) you may all hear, and
be made ^^ssessors of, every one in your own Vessels, that the Bread ^^ich
comes down from heaven you may all know, and feed ^^on, and the Water of Life
to drink of, and every one to ^^ssess the opening of the pure tender bowels of
Eternal love, which opens forth and pours down continually the ^ood will of the
powerful God of Life to lost man. The good ^ill of God precious it is;
therefore now that every one may (...) brought to know the tendering of it, I
am moved in the same bowels which opens it self in the dearness and tenderness,
which is beyond tongue to utter, or pen to express the infiniteness of the love
which springs forth from everlasting bowels of Divine Love, which only is
known in the pure nature and life of Christ: Oh what may I do for you who are
found in the Adultery and Transgression of that life and love! Even the Lord
God Almighty bring you to his fear, faithful and obedient to his Witness, that
his voice you may hear in you, which calls to you daily to return, that to his
help you may all come, even you who from it are departed, his help you know
not, who are running further and further from his Witness, into the many
paths, embracing the many things, and offending in all; and so the one thing
is lost which is only needful, in which you might be made to wear the garment
which is unchangeable, and to walk in the path which is pure and equal, and
know the eye to be opened again, which the god of this World has blinded;
which eye as it is opened, sees Jacob which inherits the blessing, and brings
savoury meat, such as the Father loves, even while Esau's Garment he did wear,
yet Jacob's voice was known. So now the voice hearken diligently to hear, which
calls out of the earthly, out of the changeable, out of the mortal, that to the
Immortal Word all may come, where the immortal birth is known, and the Babe of
glory seen and enjoyed, and man by him, and in him, come to possess the power
of God, by which power the power of death comes to be destroyed, and all which
has subjected man under it, and man by it brought to be free again, in the
pure life which is endless; And truly sadness often possesses my heart when I
behold the World in the alienation, out from the power and pure life, driven
from the presence of the living God, into the earthly nature and carnal mind,
there laboring and seeking, professing, getting into Churchfellowships, and
all acting in that which adulterates from God, both Priest and people.

Oh deaf people! For the Seed's sake, which is Christ, are many made to cry
aloud, and not to spare, but give up their bodies, and suffer cruel whippings,
stockings, all manner of scoffings, scornings, and despiteful usuage,
imprisonments in stinking holes until death, and for no other cause but because
that love which we our selves have been beloved of, has laid a necessity upon,
and constrains many to hold forth the good will of God to mankind, and to
declare the everlasting Gospel (the Word of God) hid in the heart, and that (in
every conscience) may be manifested, that all men may know again the kingdom of
God in them, and that near them, and not a far off from them, but hid in them,
which leads into the kingdom of God; and truly this I know to b^ the breathings
of Eternal Love in man, which checks and reproves him in secret, even for
things which no eye sees, nor no ear hears, nor no tongue reproves (which are
visible;) but there is no sin so secret, but that spirit (which searches the
heart, and tries the reins) finds it out, and will pursue by checking and
reproving all things that is done or acted in that nature where the
transgressor lives: And this is the free gift of the pure God to man, that
thereby man may come to know his call by his reprovings, his pure gift; and
though it be the first and least manifestation of Divine Love in the creature,
yet is it distinct from the creature, not of him, though in him, pure as God is
pure, who is the giver of it, and as unchangeable as he is.

Therefore you who have been long wording of it, Oh that there were an heart in
you to answer to the Lords love, in returning to his Witness! the
long-suffering of God, the slaying of the holy and just One, the piercing and
wounding, oppressing as a Cart with sheaves, the pure life and love (which is
God) you are not come to know, who live in the pride, in the vanity, in the
pleasures, who answers not to the Witness, and you that are not come hither,
knows nothing, nor answers the Call of the Lord, though you may profess it in
words.

Now honestly consider, What testimony bear you to Christ's death? Are you dead
with him? What, and your iniquity alive? And you who are ministering forth to
others, what testimony bear you to these things before mentioned? Hitherto when
you have been tried by any of the Lords people, either you run away, or cause
the people shamefully to hale away them that come in Christ's Spirit to demand a
reason of the hope that is in you, which shows you are ashamed of your
testimony, and afraid to be tried.

But many there be (sons and daughters) who witness his death and resurrection,
who hold forth a true testimony of Jesus to the World, whose Ministry stands in
Christ (the Power of God) and is come to try you; your Testimony, and Ministry.
Now be patient, and fly not, and do no more as you have done, to betray the
holy Seed Christ, and lose that which should be able to make you stand in the
day of trial; truly my heart is grieved for you, to see how you involve your
selves and others into that which leads you, and lays you under eternal Woes,
and yet you are pleasing your selves with a false hope, which clothes you with
vails of darkness, and a faith which makes not perfect, and purifies none, but
has its ground in that which is exalted above purity, and oppresses him who
is the pure unspotted life, the Rock of Ages, which the true Faith which
makes perfect, is grounded in; and this the just lives by; and all they who
vvitness this, are not afraid to be tried, nor are ashamed of their Testimony,
neither do they manifest such an impatient spirit to turn their back, or run
away, or be impatient or wrathful, but can willingly (in the true fear of God,
with meekness and love) be ready to give an answer to every one that asks,
and in the same spirit (and mind which was in Jesus) calls to all you who are
bringing forth your own begettings, and that which the comprehender has
formed in your own minds, every one bringing forth that conception which the
powers of darkness forms; but they that lives in Gods pure light, sees all
this and you in the pit, carrying your graves about with you, and your clothing
is death; and sees all that which led you thither, and sees what is doing in
all Kingdoms. He that can receive it, let him.

Now Christ Jesus the light of the World, is witnessed to be the Word of God,
in whom is life, and his life is the light of men: Therefore now all you who
are busying your minds, and carnally reasoning what it should be, some calling
it a natural light, others saying that it is not sufficient to show every sin; I
say, Cease your quarrelling against that which should lead you to the help of
the Lord, John 14. John knevv what it was he did bear a true Testimony, he
said he was not that light, but came to bear vvitness of that light, and h^s
Testimony is true. Many are now Witnesses of it with him, (praised by the
Lord) and he said, That the life of Christ was the light of men; [mark] It is
the life of Christ is the light of men, and this is it that lights every man
that comes into the World, (according to the measure of life received) and I
bring in my Testimony* (though one of the least who witness life) according to
the measure of life received, That it is light, and does enlighten, and gave
light to me, in which I saw all things that acted in me contrary to the life of
Christ; and being believed in, and obeyed, it has led me out of the Devils
Kingdom, into Christ, and so to God the Father of Spirits, and truly people,
there is no other way to Christ, but by owning that which checks and reproves
you in secret; therefore I beseech you return to the light every one who are
quarrelling against it, living in the careless mind so long until you say you
know no such thing in you; that is a dreadful state, near the Reprobate who
knows not Christ in thee; for they that knows not that which reproves or shows
sin, knows nothing of Gods gift, nor of his good will to man, and so are
walking in the beastly state, without bit or bridle; the love of God cries Woe,
Wrath, and Vengeance to such a one, and that man has shut himself out from the
salvation of God, and has no way to come near it again, but by waiting to feel
God's reproof by his Witness; for man being given over to the power of the
Devil, and his Vessel being filled with his spirit, can easily sin against Gods
Witness, and with his will and great delight, easily join himself to the
Transgressor, against the light, the life of Christ, and willingly lie down in
Transgression, and in this state the God whom he serves (which is the Prince of
the Air) will furnish him with a hope which must perish, and give him a faith
which may exercise his tongue to talk of, but will never make him perfect as
pertaining to the conscience. And here lies all the World, (who are found in
the wickedness) out of Gods Wisdom, out of his Fear, and found in the iniquity,
in the alienation from God, denying the light, and transgressing the life, out
from the help of the Lord, not answering his call, but giving up themselves to
the Devil, and answering to him and offering up all that they have, and are, to
him, both in their Worship, and in their daily practice; and now being run far
from God, that call cannot be heard, nor that voice which calls to him to
return; yet something there is which lets men in this state know, and convinces
them that they are sinners, and lets them see that they are weak, and have no
power to do well, (though they know not what it is) because the beastly nature
has covered them with gross darkness.

And though God has made his dewlling place in darkness, that so he might come
near to manifest his love to man; yet man being shut up in unbelief, cannot
believe that he is so near him, or that this is he who visits him every day,
and afflicts him every moment; and this is Gods visitation in man, which
pursues man with reproofs, Gods good will to the creature. Now all who slights
this, hardens their hearts against the reproof of the Lord, and are found
despisers of his counsel, and will none of his reproof; therefore he that made
them, will not save them; he that formed them, will show them no favor; when
ye call, he will not answer; and when ye cry, he will not hear nor help; and so
all your crying in that spirit, does but tempt the Lord to pour down vengeance
and wrath upon you: Yet does the good will of God to man follow him with
reproofs again, and herein he manifests his long suffering and forbearance,
though he be pressed as a Cart with sheaves, yet still his good will cease
not, and his mercy and love waits to be gracious; and all this he does that
man might return, or be left without excuse; for a sufficiency there is in Gods
gift to let man see what is good, and what is evil; therefore fear and tremble
you wanton ones, who are walking at ease in iniquity, dreadful will your
sentence be, when he shall swear in his Wrath you shall not enter into his
rest; and that be pronounced, My spirit shall no longer strive with man.
Therefore now consider while you have time, and know that that spirit shall
strive for its time, and bear its testimony in you against all the powers of
darkness; for though the Devil be strongly seated in man's heart, yet the
weakness of God is stronger then that; for though that that checks is the least
manifestation of God in the creature, and the lowest and weakest that can be in
appearance, yet is it so strong that all the powers of sin and the Devil cannot
hinder it from bearing it is testimony, until it has left the creature without
excuse; and you who are not found faithful to improve the one Talent, are not
found worthy to receive any more. And so let the Lord be clear of the blood of
all men, and whether you receive this, or no, yet a generation has he begotten
to himself, who will bear witness to his gift, and sing Halelujah for evermore.

A word unto you Rulers, Justices of Peace, Constables, and other Officers.
IN the fear of the Lord you are warned by one who stands a true Witness to the
Lord amongst the generation which the living God has raised up in his power to
bear witness to his perfect Gift which is now to be held forth to Kindreds,
Tongues, and Nations, by a despised people to be lifted up, that so he might
draw man unto him; even this is he who amongst the generation of them that are
saved, is become Lord over all; even he who is the light of the World, who must
be lifted up among the Nations, that so healing every one may witness who comes
to him, looks upon him, believes in him, power they may receive to become the
sons of God; therefore be ye warned (who are beforementioned) how you seek by
your Power or Authority to hinder the Testimony by suppressing the Meetings of
the Lords People, his Sons and Daughters, who are made in Christ's spirit to
declare to all people how they come to witness Christ Jesus the Savior, (as
near to deliver, as the Devil is to tempt and destroy) glad tidings to the
thirsty, weary soul, and a possibility to all men; The blood of souls shall cry
vengeance upon that in all men which seeks to suppress this our Testimony And
you Priests who preath for money, and prepare war if you have it not, the blood
of the innocent ones who have dyed in stinking holes and dungeons, (thrown in
there by you because they could not deny Gods Witness in them, to pay you your
money) that blood cries loud, Vengeance, Vengeance: And also that blood which
has been shed by cruel whippings for no other thing but declaring Christ the
light in all men, with the blood of souls which cries loud in the ears of the
Lord, who will render vengeance in the day when he makes inquisition for blood
upon you who are found in such practices.

From a lover of the Seed of God in all, Sarah Blackborow.

THE END.
