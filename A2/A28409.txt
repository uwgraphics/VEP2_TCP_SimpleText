The Bloody Inkeeper, OR Sad and Barbarous News from Gloucestershire.
BEING A true Relation how the Bodies of seven Men and Women, were found
Murdered in a Garden belonging to a house in Putley near Gloucester.
I Shall not, like too many of our modern Pamphleteers, nauseate the Reader
with a tedious, or Impertinent Preamble, let it therefore (to awake his
attention) suffice to say, ^^at the sad and Tragical Relation, I am hear ^o
give him, is no less remarkable for its certainty, then its Bloody Cruelty, and
equally most true, and most Barbarous, the Circumstances being thus.

Some years ago a person that had served as a Soldier in Cromwels Troop, being
after our present Sovereigns most happy restoration, had put a Period to the
necessity of those chargable standing forces disbanded, and having Married a
Scotch woman, whilst he resided in that Nation, and brought her with him into
England, they took a small House situated in a Vilage called Putley on the
Road between Glocestor and Bristol, and therein sold Drink, and Entertained
Passengers and Travelers, that had occasion to lie there as a little Inn, and
particularly his Wife being a Scot as aforesaid, diverse Persons of that Nation
who usually Travel from thence into England with Scotch Cloth and other
commodities, resorted thither, and chose rather to Lodge there than elsewhere,
for her sake, as being their Countrywoman;

But their Custom being but now and then for a night or two, and their Trade
otherwise very small and inconsiderable, their House standing in a place out of
the way, where no great Ghests could be expected, all their Neighbors
concluded that if they could but live, and keep even with the world, it was as
much as they could hope for, but contrary to all expectations, they began to
thrive amain, furnishing their house rarely well with all sorts of Household
goods, and convenient Utensils, and having money on all occasions to lend his
Neighbors at a pinch, which all that knew them much admired at, as being
sensible that very few years before, when they first came thither, they were
very poor and necessitous, and which way they should increase their stock so
well, they could not Imagine, for the Man being of a fair plausible carriage,
and making large pretenses of honesty and just dealing, they had not the least
suspicion or mistrust of the unhappy truth, that this spring tide of Fortune
was swelled with blood, and his Gains taked together with the Barbarous hands
of Robbery and Murder.

Indeed Fortune is only the Imaginary Goddess of fools, there is nothing really
happens without its means and propper causes, when we see the hand move on a
Dyal, reason tells us there must be some wheels and springs within (though
unseen) which produce that motion: Solomon assures us that he that is hastily
rich, is really innocent, those that from nothing on a sudden heap up great
estates, without any visible trade or way to obtain them, give us grounds to
suspect they take some indirect courses, and tread bypath no way justifiable.

After this person whose name I forbear, merely that I may not seem to
prejudice him, before the Law passes on him, had remained some years in this
little House, he sound himself so well furnished with money, that he resolves
to take a greater, and accordingly settled himself very Comodiously and
completely in all respects in a large Inn near the City of Gloucester, sometime
after which a Smith happening to hire the said house he went out off for the
convenience of his Trade, was forced to erect a small shed, to serve as a shop
on part of the Garden belonging thereunto, and digging pretty deep to seet up
his Anvil, which requires a good foundation that it might stand fixed and
steady, he found the bones and part of the flesh of a man buried there, the
sight whereof strangly surprised and affrighted him, and caused him to acquaint
his Neighbors therewith, who upon serious consultation about it, advized him
to dig further thereabouts, offering him their assistance therein, which being
done, they in short time found the Skeletons or Bones of seven several
persons, the bodies or flesh of them were much consumed, yet some of them had
certain remnants of woollen and linen Garments remaining, whereby it might be
perceived that they were buried there in their Clothes.

Strangly various were the Peoples Censures and apprehensions of this sad
accident, as not knowing on whom to fix the guilt of so much Inhumane
Barbarousness, for it plainly appeared that these persons must be Murdered and
Interred there for concealment, at last just Heaven, whose purer eyes could not
suffer such villainy to escape unpunisht, wonderfully opened a way to the
discovery, for as they were viewing more narrowly the bones and corpse, and
removing the earth and rubbish to behold them the plainer, they perceived a
Knife Stuck in by the Blade bone of one of their breasts, which being taken up
and scoured from the rust, they found thereon engraven the name of a man who
owned it, which together with diverse other Circumstances being considered, the
Neighborhood had violent suspicions of him who had been the Author of all
these horrid Murders.

FINIS.
