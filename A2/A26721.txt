DIRECTIONS FOR THE Right Receiving OF THE Lords Supper.
Question. TO whom does the Sacrament of the LORD's SVPPER belong?

Answer. Not to the unworthy, but to the worthy.

Q. Who are unworthy Guests at the Lords Table?

A. All grossly Ignorant, and openly Scandalous.

Q. Why are all grossly Ignorant to be kept back from the Sacrament?

A. Because being Ignorant, they want an eye to discern the Lord's Body, a Hand
to receive him, and a Mouth to feed upon him: and therefore in so coming they
eat and drink Judgment to themselves, 1 Cor. 11.29.

Q. Why are openly Scandalous to be kept from the Sacrament?

A. Because such in presuming to touch such holy things with unholy hearts,
lips and lives, they dishonor and provoke God; pollute and profane his
Ordinance; grieve and make sad the Godly; and make themselves guilty of
Murdering Christ, and D^mning their own souls, 1 Cor. 11.27.

Q. Who are grossly Ignorant?

A. Such as are ignorant of the Nature, Ends and Use of the Sacrament, and not
able to give a Reason of their Faith and hope to be saved, 1 Pet. 3.15.

Q Who are openly Scandalous?

A. Such as live and lie Impenitently in a course of Sinning, and by their
speeches and practices give just off^nce to any of the Godly, 1 Cor. 10.32, 33.

Thus of such as are unworthy Guests to come to the Lords Table.

Q. Who are worthy Communi^ants? Worthy Communicants.


A. Such as are willing and in some measure able to give a Reason of their
Faith and Hope to be Saved, and whose Conversation is suitable to their
Profession, Ephesians. 4.1.

Q. Are there any worthy in themselves of this honor?

A. No, but the Lord is pleased to account and accept them so, in, and for, and
through the Righteousness of Christ imputed to them, Rev. 3.4. And because
their desire, and endeavor is to walk worthy of, and suitable to their
profession, Ephesians. 4.1. Col. 2.6.

Q. What is required of those that would come as worthy Guests to the Table of
the lord?

A. A Due Preparation before, Requisite to a Right Receiving.
A Right Disposition in, and an Answerable Carriage after.

Q. Why is every one bound Duly to prepare himself?

A. Because in coming unpreparedly he not only dishonours God, and pollutes the
Ordinance; but makes himself Guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ, and eats
and drinks Judgment to himself, 1 Cor. 11.27, 29.

Q. What is that Preparation that is required?

A. It is double, Habitual, and Actual.

Q. What is Habitual Preparation?

Habitual Preparation.
A. The Examination of our selves, Whether we have the Habit or Seed of those
Graces that do qualify and fit us for the Sacrament.

Q. Why is every one to examine whether he have those Gra^es?

A. 1. Because this is expressly required, 1. Cor. 11.28.

2. Because without Examination, we cannot come to know the truth of Grace in
us, nor act our Graces, Jer. 8.6.

3. Because without a work of grace, the Sacrament will be but a Seal to a
blank; of no benefit, but much hurt.

Q. What are those Graces that we are to examine whether we have them?

A. They are six: 1. Saving Knowledge. 2. Faith. 3. Repentance. 4. Obedience.
5. Love: and 6. A Holy desire, or an Appetite to the Sacrament.

Q. Why is every one bound to examine whether he have a competent measure of
Knowledge?

11.29.

2. Because without Knowledge we cannot please God in the service of him, Prove.
19.2. Hos. 6.6.

3. Because we shall have no salvation, but eternal destruction, without
Knowledge, 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. 2 These. 1.7, 8, 9.

How the Sacrament strengthens faith above the Word.
Q. How does the Sacrament of the Lords Supper strengthen Faith above the

Ear only.

Joh. 1.1, 2, 3.

Q. What are the signs in the Lords Supper?

A. Bread and Wine, The Signs.
and the Actions of the Minister, and the Receivers in and about them.

Q. What is signified by the Bread and Wine?

A. The Body and Blood of Christ. Things signified.


Q. But the Body and Blood of Christ are in Heaven, and how then can we receive
that being here on earth?

A. Although we receive Christ truly and really, yet not corporally or
carnally, but spiritually, by faith, Joh. 6.3. Faith goes from Earth to
Heaven, and takes hold on Christ, and the Spirit comes from Heaven to Earth,
and applies Christ unto us, 1 John 4.24.

Q. But the Papists say, the Bread and Wine are transubstantiated, or turned
into the very body and blood of Christ, and therefore we receive him not only
Spiritually but Corporally.

A. That is a false, gross, and absurd Doctrine contrary to Scripture, sense
and reason; 1. Contrary to Scripture which expressly says, The Heavens must
contain him until the restitution of all things, Acts 3.21. And at the last
day, he shall descend from Heaven with a shout, 1 These. 4.16. 2. Contrary to
sense, for we see and taste nothing but bread and wine, 1 John 1.12. And
Christ's Body and Blood remained distinct from this Bread and Wine, when he
spoke those words, This is my Body; and 3. Contrary to reason, Because Christ
having a true Humane Body like to us, Heb. 2.14. and 4.15. and being ascended
in his body up to Heaven, Mark 16.19. he cannot be here on Earth too, at the
same time, for it is contrary to the nature of a body to be in many places at
once.

The signification of the Actions.
Q. What is signified by the Ministers taking, and setting apart the Bread and
Wine, when he comes to the Table?

1. Of setting apart.
A. God the Fathers setting of his Son apart from all Eternity for our
Redemption, Heb. 7.26.

Q. What is signified by the Ministers action of Consecrating, or seeking a
Blessing upon the Bread and Wine?

2. Of Consecration.
A. God the Fathers actual sending of Christ, and Christ's actual performing the
great work of Redemption for us, Gal. 4.4.

Q. What is signified by the Ministers action of Breaking the Bread and Pouring
out the Wine? 3. Of Breaking and Pouring out.


A. All the Sufferings of Christ; especially, the Breaking of his Body, and the
Shedding of his Blood upon the Cross, Heb. 9.14.

Q. What is signified by the Ministers Bringing, and Offering the Bread and
Wine?

A. God the Father freely offering of Christ, 4. Of Bringing and Offering.
and Christ freely offering of himself, with all his Benefits to true Believers.

Q. What is signified by the Receivers Receiving the Bread and Wine at the hand
of the Minister?

A. His Believing of the truth of what Christ has done, and God has Promised.
5. Of Receiving.


Q. What is signified by your Eating the Bread, and Drinking the Wine?

A. The Applying of all that Christ has Done, and God has Promised, 6. Of
Eating and Drinking.
to my self in particular; so as to say with Thomas, Joh. 20.28. My Lord, and

Thus you see what those things are that you are to know, that you may come as
worthy Guests to the Lords Table.

any more strength of Grace, and power over Corruption.

Q. What if we cannot find this, what are we then to do?

A. To search out the cause, whether we were not careless in our Preparation
before, or in our Disposition and behavior in the time of Receiving, and to
humble our selves accordingly.

but that we endeavored to prepare our selves to it, and behave our selves in
it as we ought: what are we then to do, if we cannot find comfort?

A. To wait upon God for the discovery of his Love to us. Because, as Physic
does not presently work, nor Meat presently nourish: So neither does the
Sacrament always presently comfort; but in Gods time.

Grace, to cherish the motions of it. And to lay hold on all opportunities of
honoring God, and of doing and receiving good.

Q. Why is every one to be so careful of remembering, and making good his vows
and promises of more circumspect walking after the Sacrament?

A. Because otherwise we cannot expect that God should make good his vows, and
promises unto us: we should but mock with God, and deceive our own souls. We
should deprive our selves of peace and comfort, and expose our selves to Gods
displeasure for the future. For it is better never to vow, than not to perform
that which we have vowed, Eccles. 5.4, 5.
