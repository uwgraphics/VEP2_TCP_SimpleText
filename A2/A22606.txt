A Proclamation for restraint of Fishing upon His Majesty's Seas and Coasts
without License.
WHereas Our Father of blessed memory King JAMES, did in the seventh year of
His reign of Great Britain, set forth a Proclamation touching Fishing;
whereby for the many important reasons therein expressed, all persons, of what
Nation or quality soever (being not His natural borne Subjects) were
restrained from Fishing upon any the Coasts and Seas of Great Britain,
Ireland, and the rest of the Isles adjacent, where most usually heretofore
Fishing had been, until they had orderly demanded, and obtained Licenses from
Our said Father, or His Commissioners in that behalf, upon pain of such
chastisement as should be fit to be inflicted upon such wilful Offenders:
Since which time, albeit, neither Our said Father, nor Our Self have made any
considerable execution of the said Proclamation, but have with much patience
expected a voluntary conformity of Our Neighbors and Allies, to so just and
reasonable Prohibitions and Directions as are contained in the same.

And now finding by experience, that all the inconveniences which occasioned
that Proclamation, are rather increased then abated: We being very sensible of
the premises, and well knowing how far We are obliged in Honor to maintain
the rights of Our Crown, especially of so great consequence, have thought it
necessary, by the advice of Our Privy Council, to renew the aforesaid
restraint of Fishing upon Our aforesaid Coasts and Seas, without License first
obtained from Us, and by these presents to make public Declaration, that Our
resolution is (at times convenient) to keep such a competent strength of
Shipping upon Our Seas, as may (by Gods blessing) be sufficient, both to hinder
such further encroachments upon Our Regalities, and assist and protect those
Our good Friends and Allies, who shall henceforth, by virtue of Our Licenses
(to be first obtained) endeavor to take the benefit of Fishing upon Our Coasts
and Seas, in the places accustomed.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster the tenth day of May, in the twelfth year
of Our Reign of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1636.
