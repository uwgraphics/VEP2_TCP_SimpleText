A Treatise made by Athanasius the Great, concerning the use and virtue of the
Psalms.
ALl holy Scripture is certainly the teacher of all virtue, and of the true
faith: but the book of the psalms does express after a certain manner the
very state and condition of the soul. For as he which intends to present
himself to a King will first compound himself to set in good order both his
gesture and his speech, lest als he might be reputed rude and ignorant: even
so does this godly book inform all such as be desirous to lead their life in
virtue, and to know the life of our Savior, which he led in his conversation,
putting them in mind in the reading thereof, of all their affections and
passions whereto the soul is inclined.

Moreover, the psalms inform and teach every man with diverse instructions,
whereby he may not only spy the affections and state of his soul, and to
win a good pattern and discipline how he may please God, but also with what
form of words he may amend himself, and how to give God thanks, least if he
should speak otherwise then were convenient, he should fall into impiety by
his vnreuerent estimation of God: for we must all make account to the Judge,
as well of our idle words as our ill deserts.

IF therefore thou would at any time describe a blessed man who he is, and
what thing makes him to be so, thou have the 1.32.41.112.128. Psalms.

and would give him thanks for that he has heard thee with his help sing the
4.40.116. psalms.

5 If thou see that evil men lay snares for thee, and therefore desire
Gods ears to hear thy prayer, sing the 5. psalm.

6 If thou feel Gods dreadful threats, and see thy self afraid of them,
