royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
WHEREAS the Kings most Excellent Majesty has continued this Parliament
together, longer then has been usual, or might well have stood, either with
his important affairs of State, or with the public business of three whole
Terms, spent in the two last Sessions, or with the occasions of the Country,
where the service and Hospitality of many Persons of quality has been missing,
and diverse Shires, Cities and Borough Towns have been burdened, with
allowances made to the Knights, and Burgesses whom they employed, besides the
particular expense of the nobility, and others attending that service; And all
this in expectation of a good conclusion, of some of those weighty causes,
which have been there in deliberation, not only for the supply of the
necessities of his Majesty's estate, but for the ease and freedom of his
subjects, in many things proposed by his Majesty in Parliament, far differing
and surpassing the favors and graces of former times, both in nature and value:
His Majesty has now resolved, (for preventing of further trouble, of all
those that would prepare themselves, to be here against the time limited by the
last prorogation) to declare by these presents, that they shall not need, to
give their attendance at the day appointed, for any service to be done, as
members of this Parliament, because his Majesty (for many good Considerations,
known to himself) has now determined to dissolve this Parliament, by his
Commission under the great Seal of England.

Given at His Majesty's Palace of Westminster the 31. day of December, in the
eight year of His Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings Most Excellent
Majesty. Anno 1610.
