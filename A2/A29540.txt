A DISCOURSE ON THE Late FUNDS of the Million-Act, Lottery-Act, and Bank of
England. SHOWING, That they are Injurious to the Nobility and Gentry, and
Ruinous to the Trade of the Nation. Together with PROPOSALS for the Supplying
their Majesty's with Money on easy Terms, Exempting the Nobility, Gentry, etc.
from Taxes, Enlarging their Yearly Estates, and Enriching all the Subjects in
the Kingdom. Humbly offered and submitted to the Consideration of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament assembled, By J. B.

London, Printed in the Year MDCXCIV.

TO THE KING and QUEENS Most Excellent Majesty's.
May it please your Majesty's;
THE present Enjoyment of our Religion and Liberty being wholly owing, under
Heaven, to your Majesty's; and the Preservation of them having engaged your
Majesty's in an expensive War with the most powerful Enemy to the Religion and
Prosperity of this Nation; It is become the Duty of every particular Person (as
well as of the whole Body of the People) to contribute his Endeavor for
securing and perpetuating those inestimable Blessings. This Consideration
engaged me upon those Thoughts which I have digested in the following Treatise,
and now m^st humbly present to your Majesty's: Wherein I principally aimed to
furnish your Majesty's with the Hearts and Purses of your Subjects, by
proposing such a Method for the Supply of your Majesty's, that it shall be
their very Interest to support your Majesty's and the Government, whether in
Peace or War.

It is the peculiar Felicity of our Constitution that makes this Design
practicable only in England, (for no People under an Absolute or Arbitrary
Government is capable of it;) and if my Zeal does not blind my Judgment, I
think I have laid a Foundation for this Nation's Greatness and Riches, which
none of our Neighbors are capable of disturbing, or arriving to themselves.

That your Majesty's may long enjoy the Fruits of it, and the Nation long enjoy
the Happiness of your Government, is the hearty Prayer of

Your Majesty's most obedient, and most faithful Subject and Servant, J.
BRISCOE.

THE PREFACE.
WE generally suspect that Person to be in a declining Condition who pays
extravagant Interest for Money to support his Credit, or whose Bills or Notes
under his Hand are refused to be discounted by monied Men, unless for more than
an ordinary Premium or Consideration; and it cannot but trouble every true
English Man (who has any Esteem for his Country) to see the Nation (not
inferior in Riches to any in Europe) treated like a Bankrupt, the Nation's
Bills (if I may so call Exchequer Tallies, Debenters and Sea-mens Tickets)
signed by their Majesty's Commissioners, being less esteemed than a Note under
the Hand of an ordinary Tradesman, to the no small Diminution of the Honor of
the Nation, and the great Discouragement of our English Seamen, who hazard
their Lives in Defense of their Country: and their Majesty's are obliged to pay
Extortion for almost every thing they buy; and none for that Reason will trust
the Public but upon the Prospect of most extravagant Profit and Advantage.

And if we would enter into the Account of it, do not these Losses fall upon
the Nation? If their Majesty's must pay three Millions for what might be bought
with ready Money for two Millions, must not the Nation pay one Million in three
extraordinary, out of their Estates, more than is necessary, for want of taking
other and better Measures? The War it self must needs be very expensive; and
ought we not then to exercise all the good Husbandry we can to make the Taxes
as easy as may be to the Subject? Was there ever so great a Complaint of the
Scarcity of Money as now there is? It would be endless to show the many
Hardships and Pressures which many of the Subjects labor under, all which is
charged to the Account of the Government, as if their Majesty's were the
Occasion of them, when the real Causes proceed from our selves, as will appear
in the ensuing Treatise. A most unworthy and disingenuous Requital to their
Majesty's, who have been the Instruments (under God) to restore our expiring
Liberties, when we had scarce any thing left of our ancient Rights.

I must confess I do not delight to think of these things, but heartily wish
all were buried in Oblivion, could it be, and we not forget who were our
Restorers. It is therefore my Duty to do their Majesty's that Right, as to let
the Subjects know where a great part of the Money goes which they pay for the
Use of their Majesty's, and that their Majesty's have the least part of it to
carry on the War: And therefore if any of the Subjects be grieved, it is fit
they should be acquainted, that their Pressures (if any are upon them) proceed
not so much from the Taxes as from other Causes, which (if not removed) will in
a few Years ruin the Kingdom.

I have, it is true, declared my Opinion against the Manner of raising Money
upon the late Funds, I mean of the Million-Act, Lottery-Act, and Bank of
England; and I believe (when my Arguments are well weighed) it will appear not
to be without Reason. I doubt few have entered into the Account of it; but
whoever lives but a few Years, will find them (if some other Methods are not
taken to prevent it) like a Canker, which will eat up the Gentlemen's Estates in
Land, and beggar the Trading Part of the Nation, and bring all the Subjects in
England to be the monied Men's Vassals.

Some probably may think I am for destroying the Settlements made on those
Funds wherein the Parliament have been pleased to invest the several
Contributors with a Property: whereas I am not for destroying them, but for
preventing their destroying others; and am content that they continue till Time
wears them out, so that a Stop be put to the raising more Money after the like
manner, so pernicious to the whole Nation: and therefore I hope none need to be
offended if I lay before the Great Council of the Kingdom the many Evils that
of Necessity do and will attend the great Encouragements given those who
advanced Money on the said Funds, which are already too visible: nor that it
will be looked upon as a Presumption in me, if I humbly propose to their great
Judgments other Methods of raising Money for the future; so far from being
grievous, that they will be for the Ease, Satisfaction, and Advantage of the
Subject.

It is likely that some may wonder that the Parliament should pass the said
Acts, seeing they ever had a very great Regard to keep up the Value of their
Lands, and for the sake of which they were pleased to prohibit the importing of
Irish Cattle, which (some are of Opinion) was no small Advantage to the trading
Part of the Nation; whereas (if it be well examined) it will appear that the
Encouragement given to Persons to advance Money on the said Funds, will be more
ruinous to Gentlemen's Estates, than would have been the bringing in Irish
Cattle for a thousand Years; and will certainly (if not remedied) bring Lands
to less than fourteen Years Purchase; Land-Security (formerly reputed the best
Fund or Security in the Nation) being now disregarded, and Gentlemen of
Estates, how great soever are their Necessities, cannot without very great
Difficulty raise Money on Land-Security; while some Men's Bills, on a less
substantial Fund, pass current in Payment as so much Money. What may be said to
solve this Riddle is, That there was a Necessity for Money to carry on the War,
and no better way was then thought of for raising it, and the Parliament chose
rather to supply their Majesty's by giving Encouragement to all those who would
advance Money on the said Funds, though thereby they impaired the Value of
their own Estates, than to subject their Lives, Liberties, Religion, and all
that is dearest to them, to the Will of the French Monarch: however I am not
without Hopes, if the Methods I have laid down shall be approved of, and put in
Practice, that it will set us all again upon a right Basis; their Majesty's
will be enabled to carry on the War with a yet greater Vigor than ever, being
so plentifully supplied with Money; the Subjects will be easy under their
Taxes; Trade will increase and flourish; the Value of Lands will be inhanced,
and (what may seem at first a Paradox) the more Money any Persons shall advance
to their Majesty's, the more they will have; and the longer the War shall
continue, the richer will be the Subject.

I am not unsensible that by my writing on this Subject I shall create my self
many Enemies, such who propose to raise their Estates by making Merchandise of
the Government, and who care not if they hazard the Kingdom, or ruin their
Fellow Subjects, so they can enrich themselves.

I doubt not in the least but there are very many who have advanced Money on
the late Funds, who are Persons of public Spirits; and if their Majesty's can
be supplied with Money a better way, and the Subject eased, they will be as
forward as any to encourage it. And this Method I have proposed will not only
supply their Majesty's, and ease the Subject, but it will enable all the
Nobility, Gentry, and others in the Kingdom, who have any Encumbrances upon
their Estates, (and who are even ground to pieces between their Creditors and
the Taxes) to clear their Estates, to raise Portions for their Children, and to
lend their Majesty's Money at easy Interest: And as it lies in the Parliament's
Power to help all the Freeholders in the Kingdom who are under any pinching
Straits or Exigencies, so Providence seems to concur in their Deliverance, in
making it the very Interest of the whole Nation to relieve them.

ALL Kingdoms and States being more or less opulent and potent, as Trade and
Industry is promoted and encouraged by them; and no Nation being better
situated for Trade than this Kingdom of England, it is certain that nothing can
hinder our being the most flourishing People in the Universe, if our own
Endeavors are not wanting to promote it. Trade therefore being the only Medium
whereby Riches can be conveyed to us, we ought to exert the utmost of our
Abilities to encourage it, and to take care that nothing be done which may
prove injurious, much less destructive to it.

Now there having been greater Sums of Money required to carry on the War
against France, than could be raised on Lands, Houses, Personal Estates,
Poll-Money, etc. the Parliament have been necessitated (for the enabling their
Majesty's to prosecute the same) to raise Money by such new Methods as they
thought would be least burdensome to Trade, and most easy to the Subject, such
as are the Funds of the Million-Act, Lottery-Act, and Bank of England; but
though the Duties upon which such Funds are settled may not be very prejudicial
to Trade, yet it is to be feared that the great Encouragement given to those
who advanced Money on these Funds will be very detrimental to Trade, and
injurious to the greatest Part of the Nation. And because it may be reasonably
supposed that those who have tasted the Sweetness of high Interest, and other
the like Advantages, will endeavor the next Sessions of Parliament to promote
the raising more Money by the same Methods; I think my self obliged in Duty to
their Majesty's, and for the preserving many Gentlemen and poor industrious
Traders and their Families from Ruin, occasioned by the Scarcity of Money and
high Interest, to represent the many Evils that will unavoidably ensue the
great Encouragements given such who advanced Money on the late Funds, and then
humbly to propose Ways by which the Parliament (if they shall think fit) may
not only plentifully supply their Majesty's with Money, but how they may enrich
the Subjects, by the very Taxes which shall be raised upon them. But before I
enter upon it, it may not be improper to make some few Remarks upon the
aforesaid Acts.

The Million-Act settles a Fund for ninety nine Years, to pay an hundred
Thousand Pound per annum, for the first seven Years, and seventy Thousand Pound
per annum for the Residue of the ninety nine Years, free of all Taxes, to the
Contributors of a Million of Money, or their Nominees, with Benefit of
Survivorship, until there shall be but seven Nominees living, after which there
shall be no more Benefit of Survivorship; but upon the Death of any of the said
Nominees, such Nominees seventh Part shall revert to their Majesty's, their
Heirs or Successors: but in case the whole Million of Money were not advanced
before the first Day of May, 1693. upon Survivorship, then any Person after the
said first Day of May, until the twenty ninth Day of September following,
should have fourteen Pound per Cent. per annum, free of all Taxes for every
hundred Pound paid in by him or her during the Life of such Nominee.

The Lottery-Act settles a Fund to pay an hundred and forty Thousand Pound per
annum, free of all Taxes to the Contributors of one Million of Money for
sixteen Years, to be divided among them according to their several Lots or
Adventures.

The Act for the Bank of England settles a Fund to pay an hundred Thousand
Pounds per annum for ever, free of all Taxes, to the Subscribers of twelve
hundred Thousand Pound, with this Reservation, that if the twelve hundred
Thousand Pound shall be repaid them at any time after the first Day of August,
Anno Dom. 1705. the yearly Payments of one hundred Thousand Pounds per annum,
from thence forward shall cease and determine.

Now that it may appear upon what Disadvantages to the Nation their Majesty's
are supplied with Money on these Funds, I have hereunto subjoined exact Tables,
calculated (for the more Exactness) to the 20 th part of a Farthing, showing in
what term of Years the several Contributors or Adventurers will be repaid their
whole Principal, and Interest, with Interest upon Interest, after the rate of
five Pound per Cent. per annum, on which Terms any Man might have had Money
upon good Security, before this unhappy way of raising Money on these Funds
took place; and also how much the Nation must pay over and above after they
shall have fully paid and satisfied the advanced Money, and Interest, and
Interest upon Interest.

And herein I have no Regard to what any particular Person may receive, by
reason of Survivorship, or as fortunate or unfortunate, but only what the
Nation (bona fide) must pay, among all those who advanced their Money on the
said Funds: And as I have computed the advanced Money at five Pound per cent.
per annum Interest, with Interest upon Interest; so I have cast up the Money
payable yearly out of these Funds, at five Pound per cent. per annum Interest,
with Interest upon Interest, but with this Advantage to the Contributors, that
although their Majesty's pay the Money, arising by some of these Funds weekly,
I have cast it up as if it was paid to the Contributors at every Year's End
only, as will more plainly appear upon Examination of the following Tables.

To apply the said Tables to my present Purpose.

Had the Million-Act been filled up with Annuities, and admitting that upon
each Nominee's Life, one with another, there had been 500 l. advanced, there
would have been in the whole 2000 Nominees, among whom (supposing there were
several Children and young People) it is very probable that 7 of the 2000
Nominees would be living sixty Years after the Commencement of the Act; and so
long as seven shall be living, the whole yearly Fund of seventy thousand Pounds
per annum must be paid to the Survivors. Now the whole Million advanced, and
Interest, with Interest upon Interest, being over-paid (as appears in the
Table) in 19 Years, the Nation must pay 70000 l. per annum to the Survivors,
for 41 Years after the Principal and Interest, and Interest upon Interest shall
be paid, which comes to 9314216 l. 13 s. 9 d.

The Annuity on the Lottery-Act is not so disadvantageous to the Nation,
because it is of a shorter Continuance; yet the whole Million advanced being
paid in about nine Years time, with Interest, and Interest upon Interest, the
140000 l. per annum must notwithstanding be continued to be paid for seven
Years longer, after the Contributors shall be repaid the whole advanced
Million, with Interest, and Interest upon Interest, as aforesaid, which amounts
to 1129174 l. 5 s. 2 d. so much being given for an Encouragement to advance one
Million of Money for 16 Years.

The Bank of England (if not redeemed by Parliament at the 11 Years end) will
be the most detrimental of all the three, as hereafter will more plainly
appear: For supposing the Contributors to the Bank should pay the whole 1200000
Pounds they have subscribed in to the Bank, they will be repaid the whole
1200000 l. and Interest, with Interest upon Interest, in less than nineteen
Years, and then the Nation must notwithstanding pay them 100000 l. per annum
for ever, although the full Principal and Interest, with Interest upon
Interest, is paid: However, we will suppose it were to terminate at 60 Years
End, (for so far I have traced it) the Contributors will receive almost 14
Millions more than their Principal and Interest, with Interest upon Interest; a
most prodigious Sum for advancing 1200000 Pounds, besides those many Advantages
in discounting Merchants Bills, Exchequer-Tallies, etc.

Having thus shown the Advantages the Contributors will receive for advancing
their Money on these Funds, I now come to show the many Evils that unavoidably
attend the raising Money by those Methods.

And here I might take notice how the monied Men are enriched by the Ruins of
the poor and industrious Traders, how Gentlemen (whose Estates are in Land) are
pressed with Taxes, while the monied Men are in a manner Tax-free; the
Landed-man paying more Taxes to their Majesty's out of an Estate of 100 l. per
annum, than the monied Men do for 10000 l. in Money, (what they advance on
those Funds being excused from Taxes by Act of Parliament) notwithstanding they
receive more Profit by 1000 Pounds in Money than a Gentleman can receive out of
an Estate in Land worth 3000 Pounds, as I doubt not but to make appear.

I might also have shown how landed Gentlemen and the poor industrious
Tradesmen raise Money not only to carry on the War, but to enrich those who
advance Money on these Funds, they having no small Part of the Money raised, as
appears by the foregoing Tables.

I might also take notice of the extraordinary Advantages given to monied Men;
such as putting a Person into a Capacity for 500 l. or less, to receive from
100 l. per annum, to 10000 l. per annum Annuity, as in the Million-Act; and for
10 Pounds, to have from 10 Pounds per annum, to 1000 Pounds per annum, as in
the Lottery-Act: But I shall wave these, because if this had been all the
Grievance, the Evil had been the less, in regard the Nation would have been
never the poorer, but only one Subject enriched by the Spoils of another; but I
will prove, that this new Method of raising Money endangers the Nation it self,
and that in diverse Respects.

First; It will most certainly ruin our Trade, without which the Nation cannot
long subsist, much less be able to maintain a War.

Secondly; It will be a Means to carry out our Wealth, and thereby will
impoverish the Kingdom.

Thirdly; It will ruin many Gentlemen of Estates, and bring Land to 12 or 14
Years Purchase.

That these Funds will ruin our Trade, I prove by these Arguments. Whatsoever
draws the Money out of Trade, or impairs the Credit of Traders, must
necessarily be very injurious, if not destructive to Trade, because no Trade
can be managed without Money or Credit: but these Funds do draw the Money out
of Trade, and impair the Credit of Traders, and consequently are very
injurious, if not destructive to Trade.

My first Proposition all Men must grant; I shall therefore apply my self to
prove the second Proposition, viz. That these Funds draw the Money out of
Trade, and impair the Credit of Traders.

To prove which I shall consider Traders as trading with their own Stocks, or
borrowing Money at Interest, to drive their Trades. To begin therefore with
such who trade with their own Stocks: Before these Encouragements were given to
those who advanced Money on these late Funds, our Merchants, and considerable
Traders, if they could get 12 or 14 per cent. per annum clear for every 100
Pounds they had in Stock, were well contented, thinking themselves sufficiently
rewarded for their Pains and Industry, not knowing any other way, wherein to
employ their Money to the like Advantage: but these late Funds have diverted
that Humor, and turned their Genius from Trade, quite another way; for whereas
formerly a great Part of their Time was taken up in contriving how to improve
their Money to the best Advantage in the way of their Trade, and to provide for
their Families, by an honest Industry; now almost their whole Discourse is of
Lottery-Tickets, Annuities, Bank-Bills, etc. and in contriving how they may
draw their Money out of Trade, to put it in upon some of these late Funds, upon
the Prospect of the great Advantages they are capable of receiving thereby,
beyond what they can expect to gain by their Trade, and that also free from
Taxes. Now although their Majesty's have been supplied with Money by these
Means, yet the greatest Part of the Money so advanced being drawn out of Trade,
must necessarily impair and lessen the Trade of the Nation, for want of
sufficient Stock to carry it on: which will more plainly appear, if we cast our
Eye upon the poor industrious Traders, who not having Stock enough of their
own, wherewith to drive their Trades, having been forced to borrow Money at
Interest, to supply that Defect; their Creditors who formerly (not being able
otherwise to dispose of their Money) courted them to take their Money at easy
Interest, knowing them to be Honest and Careful in their Business; now call in
their Money, alleging they can make 10, 15, or 20 l. per Cent. per annum, by
lending it to the Government, or by paying it in upon these Funds: which sudden
Demands, the poor Tradesmen being unable to comply with, they are forced to
pacify their Creditors, with Promises of larger Interest. But the poor Men, not
being able to drive their Trades on such disadvantageous Terms, and to provide
for their Families, are forced to leave off their Trades, and get in their
Money to pay off their Creditors, and betake themselves to some other
Employments for their Livelyhoods, or else they sink under their Burdens, being
no longer able to bear the Pressures of them.

I come now to show how Injurious these Funds are to our Foreign Trade, the
Preservation whereof is of no small Import to the Nation; for that being once
Lost, is not easily Regained: and that these Funds are Injurious to our Foreign
Trade, I prove by these Arguments. Those Merchants who can sell their
Commodities cheapest at any Foreign Markets, may Engross to themselves the
Trade of those Foreign Parts; those who pay a less Interest for Money, as
supposing 3 or 4 per Cent. per Annum, can sell their Commodities cheaper, than
those who pay a greater Interest, viz. 8 or 10 per Cent. per Annum: but some of
our Neighbors pay no more than 3 or 4 per Cent. per Annum for Interest, and
our English Merchants must pay 8 or 10 per Cent. per Annum for Interest; and
consequently those our Neighbors may Engross to themselves the Trade of those
Foreign Parts.

The Truth of these Propositions are so obvious, that I need not bring any
Proof to corroborate them, but I shall only illustrate them by one plain
Instance, viz. I suppose none will deny, that Interest of Money in Holland, is
not above 3, or at highest 4 per Cent. per Annum, and any Dutch Merchants may
have what Money they please on those Terms; now how is it possible for our
English Merchants, who must pay almost 3 times the Interest for Money, to sell
their Commodities so cheap as the Dutch Merchants? for suppose a Dutch Merchant
takes up Money at Interest, and therewith trades to Turkey, or to any other
Part, where our English Merchants trade, if the Dutch Merchant makes 20 or 25
per Cent. Profit of his Money, and has his Returns in a Year or t^^ he is well
satisfied with his Gain, and continues on his Trade, having 12 or 14 or 16 per
Cent. Profit, more than his Interest; but if our English Merchant makes but 20
or 25 per Cent. Profit in the like time, the great Interest he must pay, will
swallow up almost his whole Profit, leaving him little or nothing for his
Adventure. Now this in process of Time, will dishearten our Merchants,
discourage Navigation, ruin our Trade, and will leave it in the Hand of those
who can trade with less Disadvantages than we can, and who having once got the
Trade in their Hand, will not easily part with it.

Object. If any Object, that there is not such scarcity of Money among
Merchants, or Traders, as I have set forth; neither do they give such high
Interest for Money as 8 or 10 per Cent. per Annum.

Answ. I Answer, the scarcity of Money, and the great Complaints of all sorts
of Traders for want of Money, (since it has been drawn out of Trade, to
advance on the late Funds) is a Truth too well known, to be denied; and that
our Merchants, and other Traders, must pay 8 or 10 per Cent. per Annum Interest
for Money (if they want it) is as demonstrable; for admit a Trader must take up
Money at Interest, can it be reasonably supposed, that any Man will lend his
Money for 5 or 6 per Cent. per Annum, when he can make 8 or 10 per Cent. per
Annum, by advancing it on these Funds? or can it be thought, that Persons will
continue their Money in Tradesmens hands at the usual Interest, when they can
have almost double the Interest, by lending it to the Government; especially
when they come to be well satisfied, that what they advance on the said Funds,
is safe and secure?

Object. But a great part of the Money was advanced by such who had plenty of
Money, and did not employ it in Trade, and not by Tradesmen.

Answ. That very many Traders paid in large Sums of Money from 1000 to 10000 l.
apiece, cannot be denied by any, who have seen the Lists of the Names of the
Contributors to the several Funds; and the Money advanced by those who had no
Trade, was notwithstanding taken out of Trade, as being drawn out of Tradesmens
hands, to whom such Money was lent, as has been already set forth.

Object. But many of our Merchants trade with their own Stocks, and have no
occasion to take up Money at Interest.

Answ. This amounts to one and the same thing; for if our Merchants can get as
much by advancing their Money on these Funds, as they can by Trading abroad,
can we think they will be so imprudent, to venture their Estates to Foreign
Parts out of their Reach, and subject to so many Risques, as Dishonesty or
Insolvency of Factors, hazard of the Sea, and danger of the Enemy? At the best,
it cannot be supposed they will employ so much of their Estates in Trade, as
they would have done, had they not had this Opportunity of making such
considerable Advantages of their Money at home, by paying it in on these Funds;
and no doubt when they have found the Sweet of it, they will draw the remainder
of their Estates out of Trade, in expectation of the like opportunity, if the
Parliament shall think fit to raise more Money by the like Methods.

I come in the next place to show, that the great Encouragements given to
Persons to advance Money on the late Funds, will be a means to carry out our
Wealth, and thereby will impoverish the Kingdom. I need not form any Arguments
to prove this Assertion: those who know what high Interest is, must acknowledge
it is generally destructive to those who pay it, but is a certain Profit to
such who receive it; and there being leave given to all Foreigners to advance
Money on the said Funds, and very considerable Sums (as I have been informed)
being remitted from Foreign Parts, and paid in by Foreigners for that purpose,
it cannot be expected but the Interest of such Money, must be sent out of the
Nation every Year, as it grows due, which in 16 Years, will be above 330 l. for
every 100 l. advanced by them on the Lottery Act, and above 3000 l. for every
100 in 60 Years time, for all they pay into the Bank of England; besides their
Parts or Shares in the great Advantages, that will be made by discounting
Bills, Exchequer-Tallies, etc. And if that Maxim holds true, as it must and
does in this present case, That the Wealth of a Nation is greater or lesser in
Proportion, according as its Imports and Exports do more or less exceed each
other; I am sure, the great Sums that must be sent over yearly for the Interest
of Money advanced by Foreigners from abroad, must in time beggar the Nation;
since we receive nothing again in return for what is so sent out: and if it be
an Evil (as it really is) to enrich a few of our own Subjects, by the ruin of
the far greater Part, I am sure, a fortiori, it is a much greater Mischief for
us to enrich Foreigners by the Spoils of our English Subjects: and therefore
whatsoever value any Person may put upon the bringing great Sums of Money into
the Nation from abroad; it is plain it is not for the Nation's Interest to
encourage it.

I come now to show, that the great Encouragements given to those who advanced
Money on the late Funds, fall no less heavy on Gentlemen whose Estates are in
Land, the value of which always bears some proportion with the Interest of
Money, these being pincht both ways: for as the Taxes (necessarily laid on
Lands) make Land less esteemed, and consequently less valuable than formerly;
so this Encouragment given to the Contributors to the late Funds (which is in
effect a creating a new sort of Purchases much more advantageous than Land)
will certainly bring Land to 12 or 14 Years purchase, if not less. For Men will
hardly be prevailed with to keep, much less to purchase Estates in Land, by
which they cannot have 4 l. per Cent. per Annum for their Money, when they can
buy a perpetual Rentcharge on the Crown, (as in the Bank of England) which
will bring them in above 8 l. per Cent. per Annum, clear of all Taxes, besides
the other proposed Advantages. For admit any Person has 50 l. per Annum Estate
in Land, the Taxes of 4 s. in the Pound, Charges for finding Arms,
Trophy-Money, etc. swallow up 11 or 12 l. per Annum, by which means the Owner
has not above 38 or 39 l. per Annum at most, clear to himself; if therefore he
sells his Land but at 12 Years purchase, it will yield him 600 l. with which he
may purchase 50 l. per Annum in the Bank free of all Taxes, which is 11 or 12
l. per Annum more than he could receive out of his Estate during the War, and
as much as his Estate will bring him in in time of Peace, besides his Interest
in the aforementioned Advantages.

And who will not choose to have the Bank-Bills rather than Land at 20 Years
Purchase, if they go current, with 3 l. per cent. per annum Interest? which is
almost as much as his Lands will bring him in; the Bank-Bills being so much
more preferable than Land, as they are always as so much ready Money by a Man
to answer any present Occasions; while the Land, like a Drug, lies on his
Hands, upon which he is not able to raise half the Value, unless he sells it
outright, which he cannot do without great Expense of Time and Money, in
examining Titles, drawing Conveyances, levying Fines, etc. Far better had it
been for the Gentlemen whose Estates are in Land, to have paid half their
yearly Incomes in Taxes, since that would have pinched them only for the
present, during the War; and by retrenching their Expenses, they might have
preserved their Estates; which, if notwithstanding they had been necessitated
to sell, they might have had as many Years Purchase within a Year or two, as
they could have had before the Taxes were laid upon them, the Purchasers
knowing these Taxes will not last always. But now perpetual Rent-Charges (if I
may so call them) being to be bought, so far more advantageous than Land, and
the Bank-Bills being so profitable, and (for the Reasons aforesaid) more
eligible than Land, it cannot be expected if the War were ended, that Land
should sell for 18, much less for 20 Years Purchase, when a Man at the same
time may buy a perpetual Income from the Crown, free from Taxes, for 12 Years
Purchase.

Object. But it may be objected, that there are not any Estates in Land to be
sold at such low Rates as 12 or 14 Years Purchase, as has been suggested.

Answ. I grant it, for tho there are many Estates to be sold, and never more
than at this time, those who have lent Money upon Gentlemen's Estates calling it
in to advance upon some of these late Funds; yet Persons are very loath to part
with their Estates at an Undervalue, tho part with them they must, such whose
Estates are in Mortgage: and if they cannot sell their Estates for what they
would, they must sell them for what they can get, or else must expect to be
ejected, or barred of the Equity of Redemption. Besides, these Funds being as
yet but Novelties, every one is not ready to embarque in them; but when People
once find that when they go to the Exchequer, or to the Bank, they have their
Annuities or Interest-Money paid them punctually every half Year, upon Demand,
without any farther Trouble or Defalcation for Taxes, it will quickly cause
them to disesteem Land, with which they meet with so much Trouble, and upon
which are so may Taxes; and therefore it is not rational to take our Measures
from the present Value of Lands, but rather from the Value we may reasonably
suppose Lands will come to be sold for, when Gentlemen whose Estates are
mortgaged, are under a Force and absolute Necessity of selling their Estates,
and when Persons are a little better acquainted with, and reconciled to these
new sorts of Purchases.

Object. I shall answer one Objection more, no less frivolous than common, viz.
That the Money paid in on these Funds will circulate.

Answ. I grant it does circulate; for Money is made to pass from one to another
in Payment, but does it circulate into the Tradesman's Stock again, out of
which it was taken, so as to enable him to drive as great a Trade as formerly,
before he lessened his Stock, by advancing his Money upon these Funds? Is the
poor Trader relieved thereby, who was forced to draw his Money out of his Trade
to satisfy his Creditors? Is the Gentleman whose Estate is mortgaged, any thing
the better for this Circulation? or is the Interest of Money lowered thereby?
or does it not rather in time circulate into the Pockets it came out of? as I
have already shown it does.

Much might be said of the Bank of England in particular, as they are a Body of
Men incorporated by their Majesty's, and confirmed by Parliament. And I cannot
but take notice of the prudent Foresight of our Legislators, who wisely
provided against the Danger of creating so great a Body, without fit Bounds and
Limitations, and did therefore prohibit the Bank, to buy, sell, or trade in any
Goods or Merchandise, that so the Subject might not be oppressed by their
monopolizing with their commanding Stock; but yet I find they are enabled to
purchase and enjoy to them and their Successors, Lands, Rents, Tenements and
Hereditaments, of what Nature or Quality soever (Crown Lands excepted) without
any such Limitation, as is usual in other Charters: and if by the Statute of
Mortmain, 15 Rich. 2. all petty Corporations of Cities, Towns, or Boroughs,
which have a perpetual Commonalty, were prohibited to purchase Lands, because
they have perpetual Succession, I doubt not but the Parliament (if they shall
think fit to continue the Corporation of the Bank for a longer time than eleven
Years) will be pleased to put them under some Limitations, in respect of
Purchases. For suppose this Bank have never no other Fund or Revenue settled
upon them, upon their advancing more Money to their Majesty's, (which without
doubt they have an eye to, and those who enter not into the Account of it, may
think it will be no small Advantage to their Majesty's and the Kingdom, to have
such a Bank ready at any time to assist their Majesty's with Money upon any
extraordinary occasions) the Bank (with the 100000 l. per Annum already settled
upon them, if it be continued to them and their Successors for 60 Years) may
divide 5 l. per Cent. per Annum, every Year among them, and may have above
fourteen Millions (being more than all the Money supposed to be in the Kingdom)
in their hands: So that (in such case) all Persons must in time come to them
for Money if they want it, and must give them what Premium, or Consideration
they shall think fit, for the Loan of it; and being once Masters of the whole
Cash of the Nation, what shall hinder them of being (in time) Masters of the
Land too, since there will be indigent Persons to the End of the World, that
will sell their Estates? And if the Directors of the Bank manage their Business
as they may, none else having Money, there can be no Buyers but themselves; and
consequently they may have Gentlemen's Estates at their own rates, and will be
Masters of the Estates as well as the Cash of the Nation: and what shall hinder
them, but they may in time make the Nation it self pay what they please for the
Loan of Money, if they shall stand in need of it? And tho I doubt not, but many
may make a Jest of this my Suggestion; yet nothing is more plain than that it
may be so, if they are continued a Corporation for 60 Years, (the time I have
supposed) against which we have no other Security, but the Gentlemen's good
Nature, that they will not be so unkind to their Prince, nor so severe to their
Fellow Subjects: for if it be granted, that there be not 12 Millions of Money
in the Nation (whereas some compute, that there are not 8 Millions in the
Kingdom) and the Governor and Directors of the Bank are not obliged to make
Dividends but when they please, as I do not find by the Act they are, they may
have all the Money in the Nation three times over in 60 Years.

Obj. But some may say, that all this Business which I make such a Scarecrow
of, is but 3 l. per Cent. per Annum extraordinary Interest, paid to such who
advance Money to their Majesty's; and the Nation must be in a very sorry
Condition, if the paying 3 l. per Cent. per Annum extraordinary Interest, will
ruin it.

Answ. Those who make a Butt of 3 l. per Cent. per Annum, know not what they
say; they may as well say, it is but 30000 l. per Annum extraordinary for a
Million of Money, and that in 60 Years time comes to above 11 Millions, at 5 l.
per Cent. per Annum Interest, with Interest upon Interest, upon one Million of
Money only; and what loss must it be then to the Nation, if we should take up
many Millions at the same Terms? And yet this is the least of the Nation's
Loss, for it occasions the loss of our Trade, the ruin of Families, and the
destruction of Gentlemen's Estates, as has been already shown: so that nothing
is more obvious, than that the raising Money on Funds, by the late Methods,
will ruin Trade, discourage our Navigation, lessen their Majesty's Customs,
impoverish the Subjects, abate the value of Lands to 12 or 14 Years Purchase;
and if the War shoud continue a few Years longer, I cannot foresee which way
the Parliament can raise Money, to enable their Majesty's to prosecute the War,
or how they will be able to settle Funds sufficient, whereon to raise Money for
the supply of their Majesty's, if they pursue the same Methods of raising it.

Having thus shown, upon what disadvantageous Terms both to their Majesty's and
the Kingdom, their Majesty's are supplied with Money on the said Funds; I now
come to show, how their Majesty's may be plentifully supplied with Money, and
the Subjects enriched by the Taxes raised on them.

PROPOSALS.
First, That it be enacted, that any Person who has an Estate in Fee, of
Freehold, or Copyhold Land, may settle such their Estate upon twenty
Commissioners, viz. four Commissioners to be appointed by their Majesty's,
their Heirs or Successors; six Commissioners by the House of Lords, and ten
Commissioners by the House of Commons, in Trust for a Security, to make good
all Bills, as shall be issued out upon the Credit of such their Estates, to be
settled for such Purposes.

Surname, Profession, Place of Abode, the Particulars of, and his or her Title
to such Estate, which he or she desire to settle for the space of six Months;
in which time, if no Claim be laid to, nor Caveat entered against the settling
of such Estate, the said Estate shall be settled, and Bills of Credit (not
exceeding the value of 20 Years Purchase) shall be issued out upon the Security
of such Estate, as the present yearly Value of such Estate shall appear to be
upon Examination to be made by the Commissioners, and by the Oaths of two or
more credible Witnesses.

Fourthly, That the Commissioners shall appoint three or more understanding Men
in each County, who shall make a strict Enquiry in the several Counties, after
the Value, Titles, Prop^^^^^s, Occupiers, or Tenants of each and every Estate,
entered in the County-Registers in order to be settled, and shall transmit their
several Informations to the Commissioners.

Caveat shall be entered, or where the Counsel are not clear in their Opinion,
that the Title is good, until such Title shall be cleared.

no right to, the Party (whose Estate it shall appear to be) shall (upon good
Proof thereof) be entitled to the Estate and all the Profits arising, or that
shall or may arise by such Settlement, and shall have his Remedy at Law,
against the Person who made such undue settlement of his Estate, for all the
Bills of Credit or Profits he shall have received by virtue of such Settlement;
and may sue for, and recover treble Damages, with cost of Suit, to the Party
aggrieved by such undue Settlement; to be recovered by Action of Debt, Bill,
Plaint or Information, in any of their Majesty's Courts at Westminster, etc.
prout in other Acts.

of the Mortgagee, until such time that the Mortgagee shall be fully paid his
Principal, Interest, and all reasonable Charges by the said Mortgagee expended
or laid out upon such mortgaged Estate, or for or by reason of such Mortgage,
before and until such time of notice given in Writing, by the Mortgager to the
Mortgagee, of such intended Settlement.

28th. That every Commissioner or Director, who shall issue out Bills of
Credit, upon the Security of any Estate, to a greater value than 20 Years
purchase of such Estate, as the same shall be sworn to be worth by two or more
credible Witnesses; or shall issue out Bills of Credit, for the Security of
which, no Estate shall be first settled; or shall lend, or advance to their
Majesty's, any Bills of Credit, otherwise than upon a Parliamentary Fund, and
by the Consent and Authority of Parliament, shall incur, and suffer the Pains
and Penalties of High Treason.

29 th. That it shall be High Treason to counterfeit any of the said Bills, or
to offer them in Payment, knowing the same to be counterfeited.

Having thus finished my Proposals, I shall mention something of those many
great Advantages which their Majesty's and the whole Nation will reap by this
proposed Method.

First; Their Majesty's will be plentifully supplied with Money on much easier
Terms, and far greater Sums might have been raised on the Million-Act,
Lottery-Act, and Bank of England, by this proposed Method, than were raised by
the said Funds by the late Methods; and the like may be done on any future
Fund: and the more Money any Fund raises, the fewer Funds will need to be
settled, and consequently the Nation will be less burdened.

Secondly; It will certainly unite their Majesty's and the People, and engage
them insepara^ly in each other's Interest.

Thirdly; These proposed Bills of Credit being a new Species of Money, and to
all Intents and Purposes as useful as Money, it will be (as it were) an
introducing of so many more fresh monied Men into the Kingdom, with several
Millions of Money more than was before, for the Supply of their Majesty's; and
will answer all Occasions, as the bringing in so many Millions of Money into
the Nation would or could have done.

Fourthly; Money naturally begetting Money, every Million value in these Bills
of Credit will produce as much Profit as a Million of Money; and if employed in
Trade, and but 6 l. per cent. per annum got by it, each Million value in Bills
of Credit issued out upon the Security of Gentlemen's Estates, will bring in
60000 l. per annum Profit every Year to the Nation.

Fifthly; It will keep great Sums in the Nation, that otherwise will be sent
out of the Nation for Interest; and will enable us to lend, who are now forced
to borrow of others.

Sixthly; It will animate our Merchants, and set them upon the same Level, in
respect of Trade, with our Neighbors.

Seventhly; It will encourage all Artificers and Handicrafts, and bring new
Manufactures into the Kingdom; which cannot now be wrought here by reason of
high Interest; and set all our Poor at work, many Thousands of whom are now in
a starving Condition for want of Employment: and it will turn the Genius of the
Subjects into the right Channel again, by putting them upon the improving their
Money in Trade.

Eighthly; It will ease all the Nobility and Gentry from Taxes, who shall
advance Bills of Credit to their Majesty's upon the Security of their Estates,
and will add 50 or 60 l. per annum to every 100 l. per annum of their present
Estates.

Ninthly; Gentlemen will have an Opportunity of improving their Estates by
building, repairing, planting, draining or watering their Lands; who are not
now able to do it, by reason of Scarcity of Money, and high Interest: by which
means many thousand People, who are now chargeable to the Parishes, will be
employed in all the several Parts of this Kingdom.

Tenthly; It will enable all such whose Estates are mortgaged, or otherwise
engaged, to clear their Estates from Encumbrances: and those may have Bills of
Credit upon the Security of their own Estates for 10 s. per Cent. per annum, as
in Proposal 22, who now pay 5, 6 or 7 l. per Cent. per annum; or else by paying
a small Annuity, as in Proposal 23. they may by Degrees, and upon easy Terms,
pay off Principal as well as Interest.

Eleventhly; They may with Ease raise Portions for their Children, without
parting with their Freeholds.

Twelfthly; It will put all People, who have Money, upon buying Land; and will
in all probability, raise the Value of Land to 40 or 50 Years Purchase.

But because Examples are the best for Illustration, I have hereunto subjoined
Tables with the Explanations of them drawn up pursuant to my Proposals, which
will fully demonstrate, and plainly make appear, the most unspeakable
Advantages this proposed Method will be to the whole Kingdom in general.

Commissioners and Directors.

The Use of the first and second Tables, applied to the Proposals.
ADmit a Gentleman has barely 100 l. per Annum Estate to live on, and has a
Wife and four Children to provide for: This Person, supposing no Taxes were
upon his Estate, must be a great Husband to be able to keep his Charge, but
cannot think of laying up any thing to place out his Children in the World: but
according to this proposed Method, he may give his Children 500 l. a-piece, and
have 90 l. per annum left for himself and his Wife to live upon; the which he
may also leave to such of his Children as he pleases after his and his Wife's
Decease: For first having settled his Estate of 100 l. per annum, as in
Proposals 1, 3. he may have Bills of Credit for 2000 l. for his own proper Use,
for 10 s. per cent. per annum, as in Proposal 22. which is but 10 l. per annum
for the 2000 l. which being deducted out of his Estate of 100 l. per annum,
there remains 90 l. per annum clear to himself.

But suppose this Gentleman has mortgaged his Estate for 1000 l. for which he
pays 60 l. per annum Interest, he has but 40 l. per annum left, which will
hardly keep his Wife and Children from starving, especially if he pays 20 l.
per annum Taxes out of that small Pittance; having settled his Estate in Land,
and taken up 2000 l. Bills of Credit upon it, he may pay off his 1000 l.
Mortgage, and give his Children 250 l. a-piece, and have 50 l. per annum more
than he now has left him to live upon.

But admit a Gentleman has 1000 l. per annum; upon which we will suppose he
owes 10000 l. at 6 l. per cent. per annum Interest, (not to mention Procuration
and Continuation) the bare Interest comes to 600 l. per annum, the Taxes of 4
s. in the Pound to their Majesty's comes to 200 l. per annum more; reckoning
Repairs, Militia-rate, Trophy-Money, etc. he has not 200 l. per annum left him
to maintain himself and Family.

If this Gentleman settles his Estate as in Proposals 1, 2. he may have Bills
of Credit for 20000 l. as in Proposal 22. with this he may pay off his 100000
l. Mortagage: for which 10000 l. he must pay 10 s. per cent. which is 50 l. per
annum to the Commissioners and Directors; he may lend the other 10000 l. to
their Majesty's, for which he shall have 3 l. per cent. per annum, as in
Proposal 16. which comes to 300 l. per annum; and be exempted from half the
Taxes upon account of the 10000 l. lent their Majesty's, as in Proposal 20. So
that this Gentleman who has not now 200 l. per annum clear, will have almost
1150 l. per annum coming in; as appears by the following Parallel.

The Gentleman's present Circumstances. His Circumstances by my Method.
Interest of 10000 l. -- 600 l. per annum. Taxes of 4 s. in the Pound -- 200 l.
per annum. Remaining for himself, not reckoning Militia-rate, etc.200 l. per
annum. 1000 l. per annum.
His Estate -- 1000 l. per annum. Interest of 10000 l. lent to their Majesty's
-- 300 l. per annum. 1300 l. per annum. Paid the Commission, and Direct. for
10000 l. Bills -- 50 l. per annum. Taxes -- 100 l. per annum.
150 l. per annum. Remains to the Gentleman -- 1150 l. per annum.
And his 10000 l. Mortgage paid off.



But if this Gentleman has any Children, he may give them 10000 l. among them,
and have 700 l. per annum left, viz. Paid the Commissioners and Director,
120000 l. Bills of Credit100 l. per annum. Paid Taxes at 4 s. in the Pound --
200 l. per annum. Remains to the Gentleman -- 700 l. per annum. 1000 l. per
annum.


So here is 10000 l. Mortgage paid, 10000 l. given among his Children, 200 l.
per annum to their Majesty's for Taxes, and 7^^ l. per annum the Gentleman will
have to live upon.

But suppose the Gentleman who owes 10000 l. upon his Estate of 1000 l. per
annum, has a mind to pay it off gradually by a small Annuity for a Term of
Years, he shall have 10000 l. Bills of Credit to pay off his 10000 l. (for
which he must now pay 600 l. per annum for Interest, and not a Farthing of the
Principal paid) upon the Payment of 250 l. per annum for 50 Years, and never
pay the Principal; or if the Gentleman desires to pay it in a less time, he may
have 10000 l. Bills of Credit for 550 l. per annum Annuity for 20 Years, and
his Estate then cleared; which is less by 50 l. per annum than he must now pay
for simple Interest only; and at the 20 Years end he will still owe the whole
10000 l. Principal. Or does any Gentleman owe greater Sum upon his Estate,
suppose 50000 l. he must pay 3000 l. for the bare Interest; whereas by this
Method, he shall pay no more than 250 l. per annum for 50000 l. which is 2750
l. per annum saved to him out of 3000 l. per annum.

Instances of this Nature are numerous: I shall now show that it. is no less
advantageous to the public, than it is to private Persons.

The Use of the third Table.
IF the Parliament had raised Money by this Method upon the Fund of 10000 l.
per annum settled on the Bank of England, they might have had 3333333 l. 6 s. 8
d. which is 2133333 l. 6 s. 8 d. more than was raised upon it; and the
Gentleman who settled their Estates for Security of the Bills of Credit, would
have been excused from Taxes, and have had 60 l. per annum added to every 100
l. per annum present Estate they now have: So that whereas the Parliament upon
a Fund of 200000 l. per annum, is not able to raise above 2400000 l. which is
not the half of one Year's Taxes; the Parliament may raise by my Method almost
seven Millions upon a Fund of 200000 l. per annum, and oblige the Gentlemen of
England into the Bargain by an Exemption from Taxes, and a considerable
Augmentation of their yearly Estates: But if the Parliament had settled the
said Fund of 100000 l. per annum only for a certain number of Years, when the
same should have expired, and the Nation eased of the Fund; if the Parliament
(instead of a Perpetuity) had settled it but for 66 Years and 8 Months, they
might have raised 2500000 l. which is more by 1300000 l. than they have for a
Perpetuity; and the Gentlemen of England would have had 62500 l. per annum,
part of the said Fund, in Augmentation of their Estates.

Or admit they had raised a Million of Money, as in the Lottery-Act, they might
have had a Million for 100000 l. per annum for 13.4 Months; whereas they gave
140000 l. for 16 Years.

The Use of the fourth Table.
ADmit the Parliament had raised 1200000 l. by my proposed Methods, they might
have had it for 36000 l. per annum; which is 64000 l. per annum less than is
paid to the Bank of England: or they might have raised a Million upon the
Payment of 87500 l. per annum Annuity for 16 Years, which is less by 52500 l.
per annum than is paid on the Lottery-Act; or else upon the 140000 l. per annum
Fund paid on the Lottery-Act, might have been raised 1600000 l. the Gentlemen
must have settled 80000 l. per annum in Land for the Security of the Bills of
Credit; for which they should have 40000 l. per annum paid them out of the
Parliamentary Fund, and the remaining 100000 l. per annum should have paid off
the 1600000 l. in 16 Years.

So that by these Means the Nation is not only served on much easier Terms, but
Gentlemen will be exempted from Taxes, and have a considerable Addition to
their Yearly Estates.

I now come to consider what Objections may be raised against these Proposals,
and shall endeavor to answer them, and that as briefly as I can.

Obj. You propose in Proposal 22. that any Man, who shall settle his Estate for
the Security of Bills of Credit, may have what Bills of Credit he pleases to
the present value of his Estate for his own proper Use: now admit a Man settles
an Estate to which he has no Right, and takes up all the Bills of Credit on
his own proper Account, and buys Goods or Merchandise with the said Bills, and
goes beyond Sea, what must the Person do who has the lawful Right and Title to
such Estate? for the Estate being settled in due form, as in Proposal 3. the
right Owner is left remediless, if the Person who made such undue Settlement be
out of his reach.

Answ. 1. No Man can settle an Estate, who may not as well now sell the same
Estate: for in regard no Estate can be settled but where 3 able Counsel shall
give it under their hands, that the Person who settles such Estate has a good
Title to it, as Proposal 5. so any Person who can show so fair a Title to an
Estate as to deceive 3 Counsel, he may as well now sell the said Estate, and go
beyond Sea with the Money: and tho the Person whose Estate it really is, will
not be injured, yet the Purchaser will lose his Money; and it is no less evil
for the one to lose his Money, than it would be for the other to lose his Land.

Answ. 2. If such undue Settlement should be made, and twenty Years Purchase of
the Estate received in Bills of Credit, the remaining Part of the Estate will
be more worth to him who has the legal Right to the Estate than the whole will
be worth if no Settlements be made: but for brevity sake I refer my Reader for
a further Answer to Proposal 7. and to Queries 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

Obj. But you have proposed 3 l. per Cent. per Annum for Interest, and 2 l. 10
s. per Cent. per Annum for Annuities, to such who shall settle their Estates
for the security of Bills of Credit, to be issued out and advanced to their
Majesty's upon any Parliamentary Fund, as in Proposals 16, 17, 18, 19. now what
Man in his Senses will settle and encumber an Estate of 2000 l. Value, for so
inconsiderable an Advantage as 50 or 60 l. per Annum, for the payment of which
he has no other Security than a Revenue payable out of the Exchequer: and if
the payment of that Annual Fund should be slopt, he will be in a sorry
Condition, his Estate being notwithstanding obliged to make good the Bills of
Credit issued out upon the Security of it.

Answ. 1. None who have read what Advantages a Gentleman of a real Estate will
reap by this Settlement, will call his Prudence in question, for settling his
Estate in order to partake of those many Advantages, but will rather doubt of
his Judgment, if he should not do it: pick out the most Profitable of the late
Funds, and I will compare with it. For 2000 l. in Money, a Man may have 166 l.
13 s. 4 d. in the Bank, being 12 Years Purchase; on this we will suppose he may
take up 1500 l. or more, at an hour's warning, at 5 or 6 l. per Cent. per
Annum, and pay it in again when he pleases; besides he will have part of other
Advantages of discounting Merchants Bills, Exchequer-Tallies, etc. Suppose now
that I had 2000 l. by me: I would lay it out in Land, (upon an assurance that
this proposed Method would meet with Encouragement) for which 2000 l. I may buy
100 l. per Annum, this Estate I would settle for 2000 l. Bills of Credit, which
being lent their Majesty's, will bring me in 60 l. per Annum, as in Proposals
16, 17. so that I should have 160 l. per Annum, for my 2000 l. and if 20 l.
saved be 20 l. got, he who has now 100 l. per Annum, must pay 20 l. per Annum
Taxes, which will be saved, if he advances his Bills of Credit to their
Majesty's, as in Proposal 20. And then as to other Advantages, mine will be far
superior to his, for I can have 2000 l. upon my 100 l. per Annum, after the
Estate is settled, on as short a warning as he can have his 1500 l. and need
pay no more than 10 s. per Cent. per Annum, as in Proposal 22. when he must pay
ten times 10 s. per Cent. per Annum: or I can give 2000 l. among my Children,
and have 90 l. per Annum left; or if I have a mind to sell my Estate, I may in
probability sell that for 5000 l. that cost me but 2000 l. vide Query 17.

Answ. 2. As to the Security of the Parliamentary Fund, I cannot doubt that the
Parliament will take less care of the Freeholders of England, than they have
done of the monied Men.

Answ. 3. As to the Annuities for which Gentlemen have but 2 l. 10 s. per cent.
per annum, they are rather better than the 3 l. per cent. per annum. Interest,
in regard that he who settles his Estate for 2000 l. Bills of Credit, to
advance them to their Majesty's communibus annis, stands engaged but for a 1000
l. only, in that the Annuity being paid every Year, the Sum for which their
Estates stood engaged, becomes thereby lessened, and consequently the Security
strengthened. Vide Proposals 18, 19.

Object. But you oppose the monied Men making Advantages of their Money, and
propose greater Advantages to Gentlemen of real Estates.

Answ. I confess I do, and that for several Reasons.

First, Gentlemen of yearly Estates have born the burden of the Taxes, while
the monied Men have paid little or nothing for the carring on the War, or
support of the Government, but on the contrary many of them have enriched
themselves by it.

Secondly, None can possess or enjoy Lands but the Subjects of this Realm; but
monied Men are of all sorts, Foreigners as well as our own Subjects: and if an
Advantage be to be made, it ought to be to our own Subjects rather than to
Foreigners.

Thirdly, It is less hazardous to trust the Riches of the Nation in the Hands
of our own Subjects, who are settled here with their Families, than with those
who being born in Foreign Parts may, and in all likelihood (when they have got
our Money) will carry it out of the Nation.

Fourthly, The Landed Gentlemen will deserve this Encouragement, in that they
will raise above double the Sum of Money upon any Fund by this proposed Method,
more than was raised by the late Methods.

Fifthly, This proposed Method increases Trade, enriches the Subjects, and will
raise the Price of Land: the late Method destroys Trade, impoverishes the
Subject, and depretiates Land.

Obj. But in a little time the Bank of England will be in great Repute, and
they will issue out their Bank-Bills, which will go for Money; and these Bills
the Directors will lend Gentlemen upon the Security of their Estates for 61.
per cent. per annum Interest, and also to Merchants at the same rate, upon a
deposite of Wares or Merchandise in the Custody of the Bank for a Security.

Answ. If Land be a Security, why may not Gentlemen be enabled by this proposed
Method, to issue out Bills of Credit upon a Fund of Land settled out of their
own Estates, as well as these Gentlemen Bank-Bills upon a Fund settled on the
Excise? Is not 100000 l. per Annum in Land a better and more valuable Fund than
100000 l. per Annum payable out of the Excise? I am sure it was esteemed so
formerly, and it is in the Power of the Parliament to make it so still if they
please; and yet the Gentlemen with 100000 l. per Annum in Land (if they want
Money) must be glad to accept of the Bank-Bills for half the Value of their
Estates, for which their whole Estates must be engaged, and must give them 6 l.
per Cent. per Annum into the Bargain, when the Security such have who take
these Bank-Bills, is not near so good a Security as these Gentlemen's Estates
are, who yet must be forced to mortgage them for those Bank-Bills: to which I
can make no fitter a Comparison, than for a Man to pawn a Guinea for a Counter,
or a Diamond for a Bristol- Stone; and therefore I confess I can see no reason
why Gentlemen should give 6 l. per Cent. per Annum for Bank-Bills, when they
may have Bills of Credit upon their own Estates, which are better Securities,
for 10 Shillings per Cent. per Annum.

Object. But it is not consistent with the Wisdom or Justice of the Nation, to
grant the Gentlemen of the Bank an Act for their Establishment, and to repeal
it next Sessions; for the Parliament may as well repeal the Act, as to enact
that Lands shall pass for Money, which is in effect to set up another Bank, or
rather so many several Banks as there are landed Men in the Nation, who then
need not come to the Bank to borrow Money upon their Estates, but will be able
to lend Money to others.

Answ. It is not material what some Gentlemen of the Bank might propose to
themselves, but what the Parliament granted them, which was better than 8 l.
per Cent. per Annum for 11 Years, and longer, if it were not injurious to the
Nation: and since it appears to be so already in so eminent a degree, it shows
rather the great Justice of the Parliament in continuing them for 11 Years, and
paying them 100000 l. per Annum, to the great Prejudice of their own Estates,
when they may have the same Sum of 1200000 l. for 36000 l. per Annum, and their
Estates considerably augmented thereby.

Object. But you propose to force the Subject to take pieces of Paper for Money
which have no intrinsic Value in them, which will never be allowed of by an
English Parliament, who, tho they made the Bank-Bills assignable, yet they
compelled no Person to take them.

Answ. 1. I grant there ought to be no force on the Subject to take any thing
in Payment which has not an intrinsic Value in it self, or which conveys not
an intrinsic Value along with it, whereby the Receiver may be no loser: and
therefore it was not without good reason that the Parliament did not oblige the
Subject to take the Bank-Bills, because the Bank has a Fund for the Security
of 1200000 l. only; and they may issue out Bills for as many Millions as they
please, for which there is no Security but the Members of the Bank, which is
but a Personal Security.

Answ. 2. These proposed Bills of Credit convey an intrinsic Value with them,
there being a Fund of Land proposed to be settled for their Security before
they are issued out, to the full value of the Bills of Credit issued out
thereupon, and also a Fund settled by Parliament for all Bills of Credit
advanced to their Majesty's upon the Payment of any Annuity; which tho but a
collateral Security for the Bills of Credit, yet it may reasonably be supposed
it will be as good a Security as the Fund of the Excise. The Bills of Credit
being therefore settled on the Security of private Men's Estates as well as a
Parliamentary Fund, are of an intrinsic Value, as they will convey above
double their Value along with them, viz. a Fund of Land and a Parliamentary
Fund; and therefore for so public a Good, where all will be benefited and none
can be losers, I know no reason can be assigned why the Subject should not be
obliged to take them: besides, this is no new thing for Land to pass for Money;
for if a Man mortgages his Estate for 1000 l. if the Mortgagee owes 1000 l. to
another, may he not pay him this 1000 l. by assigning over this Mortgage, and
the Assignee to a third, and so toties quoties ad infinitum? Is not this
passing Land up and down for Money as much as by my proposed Method? All the
difference is, I have proposed for the convenience of the Subject, to divide
the 1000 l. into 100 or 200 parts, which by the usual way is past in Payment in
one entire Sum; and yet if the Title of the Estate be good, need any Man
complain for taking a Skin of Parchment for 1000 l. which conveys an Estate of
1000 l. value along with it?

Answ. 3. Gold and Silver (to which, when coined, we give the Name of Money)
was made the Medium of Trade and Commerce by reason of its portability, and
carrying an intrinsic Value along with it; the Government (for that reason)
bearing the Charge of the Coinage, because the intrinsic Value should not be
lessened by the Charge bestowed upon it, to turn it into Money, and by the
Coinage-Act 18 Car. 2. an Imposition was laid upon Wine, Vinegar, etc. to bear
the Charges of the Mint; and whosoever brought any Gold or Silver into the
Mint, was to have the same Weight out again coined without any Charge or
Deduction; and whatsoever was formerly sold, he who received his Money for what
he sold, had the full value of the Sum he was to receive, in Gold or Silver;
the Money (if melted down) being worth the Value for which he received it: and
Persons were so careful that the Money which they received was of an intrinsic
Value, that they usually carried small Weights and Scales in their Pockets to
weigh any piece of Money which they suspected was too light, and if they found
any piece too light they refused it. I am sure, should we try our Money now, we
might write Mean Tekel upon 99 Shillings in every 5 Pounds, many of the
Half-Crowns we take not having 12 penny worth of Silver in them, and Shillings
and Six-pences as light in proportion; and therefore since our Money has been
so abused by clipping, it has lost that essential Quality which did at first
recommend it, viz. its intrinsic Value, the Stamp serving now to show what it
was, not what it is worth; scarce 100 l. we receive being worth 50 l.
intrinsic Value: and what Fund or Security is there to make good the other 50
l. clipped off? and yet take it we must, or else we must go without our Money,
which is a Coertion with a witness; but yet People quietly receive it, because
they know they can pass it away again for the same Value for which they know
took it: and I make no question but 100 l. pecuniis numeratis of such Money as
is generally now passable, will be allowed by our Judges and Juries too to be a
good and lawful Tender, and a good Plea in Bar of any Action that shall be
brought against a Person for the said Sum after such Tender made; and if they
should not, I know not how any Tender can be made in what we may call good and
lawful Money of England, unless we pick 100 l. out of 3 or 4000 l. and yet, as
if Money had acquired a greater Excellency by being clipped, the Consideration
for the Loan of it is raised to almost double the Value which it was a few
Years since, tho it was then much weightier, and consequently better than now
it is: and therefore why it should be looked upon as a Hardship to oblige the
Subject to take Bills of Credit, which convey far more than the intrinsic
Value of the Sum therein mentioned along with them, when at the same time they
take in Payment Money which is not more than half the intrinsic Value, and
Bank-Bills, for which there is no certain Fund, for my part I know not, but
shall be obliged to any Person who can give a Reason for it.

Object. But shall we not have too many of these Bills of Credit?

Answ. 1. These Bills being a new Species of Money, and to all Intents and
Purposes answering the End of Money; we may as well fear that we shall have too
much Money in the Nation, which no wise Man will complain of.

Answ. 2. I do not find that this was objected or considered in the
Constitution of the Bank of England; there is no Limitation to them, but they
may coin Bank-Bills for as many Millions as they please, to an unlimited Sum;
and all the Security the Subjects have for the Bank Bills, issued out for above
the Value of 1200000 l. is but only a Personal Security, many of whom are
Foreigners: And if the Members for the Time being, and not the Subscribers, are
bound, we know not who are our Bondsmen, by reason of the daily Transferrences:
And why should we be afraid of having too many Bills of Credit, more than of
having too many Bank Bills, when the Nation may be Losers by the Bank Bills?
But it is impossible for any Man to be a Loser by Bills of Credit, since no
Bill of Credit may be issued out before a real Security out of some Gentleman's
private Estate or Freehold, shall be first settled for the Security of such
Bill or Bills.

So that if the Nation must have a great Number of Bills circulating, I doubt
not but every one will concur with me, that the Bills of Credit are preferable
to the Bank Bills, so far as a Real Security is to be valued before a Personal
Security; vide Proposal 3.

Answ. 3. None can be injured by our having great Numbers of these Bills of
Credit: but several hundred thousand Families will be relieved by these
proposed Bills; and almost as many Families will be ruined and undone, if some
such Method be not taken to help them. How many Gentlemen are there who pay 50,
60, or 70 l. per Annum, for Interest Money out of 100 l. per Annum; must
notwithstanding pay 20 l. per Annum more for Taxes, out of the little they have
left to buy their Children Bread; while he who has the Estate in his Clutches,
and receives one half or two thirds of the Gentleman's yearly Income for
Interest, pays not a Penny toward the Charge of the War, or Support of the
Government: And therefore unless it can be proved, that a greater Number of the
Subjects will suffer, than will be relieved by these Bills of Credit; I think
if the great Plenty of the said Bills should be an Inconvenience, (whereas it
plainly appears to the contrary, that they will be for the Ease and Advantage,
both of their Majesty's and all the Subjects in general) I think a greater Good
ought to be preferred before a Lesser, and a lesser Evil chose before a Greater.

Much more might be said, which, for brevity-sake, I omit, and shall only
present those Gentlemen with the following Queries, who doubt of the
Practicability or Reasonableness of my Proposals.

QUERIES.
Q. 1. WHether any Person who has an Estate, in Fee of Freehold, or Copyhold
Land, can make a good Security out of such his Estate, to any Person who shall
lend him Money upon a Mortgage of such his Estate? Vide Query 8

Q. 2. Whether the Person who shall pay the Morgagee the Money by him lent upon
any Estate, and have thereupon an Assignment of such Mortgage from the
Mortgagee, has not as good a Security for his Money as the Mortgagee had
before such Assignment?

Q. 3. Whether the Assignee of such Assignee, and every subsequent Assignee
that shall have any mortgaged Estate assigned over to them, upon their payment
of Principal and Interest due from the Mortgager to the several Persons
assigning, have not (by virtue of such Assignments) as good a Security as the
Mortgagee or first Assignee had before they assigned over their Interest in,
and Title unto the mortgaged Estate?

Q. 4. If 1000 l. be lent upon the Security of an Estate of 100 l. per Annum;
and if the Morgagee, or Assignee, shall owe twenty Persons 50 l. apiece,
whether such Mortgagee, or Assignee, cannot assign over the said Estate to any
one or more Person, or Persons, in trust for the said twenty Persons? and
whether every one of the said twenty Persons may not in such case, be as secure
for their several 50 pounds as the Mortgagee, or Assignee, might or could be
for the whole 1000 l.

Q. 5. Whether a Person can make as good a Security out of his Estate, unto
Commissioners to be appointed by the King, House of Lords, and House of
Commons, in Trust for private Persons, as he can or may do to any one or more
private Persons in Trust for others? Vide Proposal 1.

Q. 6. If the Parliament should Enact, that all Mortgages, and Assignments of
Mortgages, shall be current in payment, (by Indorsment, toties quoties) as the
lawful Coin of the Kingdom, whether every Person who shall receive such
Mortgages, or Assignments in payment, will not be as much entitled to such
Estates, as any Mortgagee or Assignee now is? Vide Proposal 9.

Q. 7. Since I have proposed that all Persons may settle their Estates who have
good Titles, and that none may be permitted to settle their Estates, who have
no good Titles to such their Estates till their Titles are cleared: And since
20, or more, of the Ablest Counsel in the Kingdom, are likewise proposed to be
employed, to peruse and examine the Titles of all the Estates proposed to be
settled upon the Commissioners; besides 3 or more understanding Men in each
Country to take care of the Registers, and to examine and make Enquiry after
the Titles, Owners, Occupiers, and Particulars of all and every the Estates
that shall be entered in the County Registers, in order to a Settlement: Whether
Three, Four, or upon occasion all the said Counsel, by perusing the Writings,
and examining the Titles of any Estate that shall be proposed to be settled;
together with what Information they shall receive from the porposed Agents, in
the County where such Estate lies, may not be as well able to judge, whether the
Title of any Estate, which is proposed to be settled be a good Title, as well
as any one Counsel in England can judge whether the Title of any Estate is Good,
that is made over for a Security from a private Person borrowing, to another
private Person lending Money upon the Security of such Estate? Vide Proposals
4, 5, 6.

Q. 8. If a Gentleman's Estate can be a Security to any Man who shall lend
Money upon such Estate, Whether it may not be made by Parliament, as good a
Security of Bills of Credit to be issued out upon the Crdit or Security of such
Estate; and whether every Person who shall receive such Bills of Credit by
Indorsment toties quoties, may not be as secure as the now Mortgagees or
Assignees are or can be? Vide Query 1. Proposal 9.

Q. 9. If a Gentleman's Estate may be made a good Security for Bills of Credit
that shall be issued out upon the Credit of his Estate, why should he pay 6 l.
per Cent. per Annum Interest for Money taken up upon his Estate, when he may be
supplied with Bills of Credit upon the Security of his Estate for 10 Shillings
per Cent. per Annum, or for a small Annuity, as 4 l. 10 s. per Cent. per Annum,
for 25 Years, or 5 l. 10 s. per Cent. per An. for 20 Years, and never pay the
Principal? Vide Proposals 22, 23.

Q. 10. If a Personal Security be thought sufficient by the Parliament for the
Creditors of the Bank, who shall take the BankBills for more than 1200000 l.
each Member of the Bank being answerable for no more than their Proportions of
such Debts according to their Interests, or Subscriptions; whether Gentlemen's
Estates in Land settled for the Security of Bills of Credit, issued out upon
the Credit of such Estates, be not a better Security for such Bills of Credit
than the Subjects have for the Bank-Bills? the one being a real, the other but
a personal Security: among whom are many Foreigners and others, who upon any
Failure will doubtless think it high time to shift for themselves.

Q. 11. The Stock of the Bank being transferrable, and to be bought and sold,
what Security has the Nation that the Stock may not be bought by such, who,
having chose what Directors they please, may carry away all the Gold and Silver
they can get together out of the Kingdom, and leave the Members and Creditors
of the Bank to help themselves as well as they can?

Q. 12. Whether it will not be more safe and reputable for the Kingdom to have
the Riches of the Nation in the Hands of 20 Commissioners appointed by their
Majesty's, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons, and 25 Directors to be
chosen once in every three Years by the Nobility and Gentry of the whole
Kingdom, rather than in the Hands of a few private Persons, who may sell and
transfer their Interest, and consequently the great Trust reposed in them, to
Foreigners, or to Persons dissaffected, if not perfect Enemies to their
Majesty's and the Kingdom? Vide Proposal 1, 10, 11, 13, 14, 27, 28.

Q. 13. If Gentlemen advance the Bills of Credit, which are issued out upon the
Credit of their Estates, to their Majesty's upon a Parliamentary Fund, settled
for the Payment of an Annuity every Year toward the discharging and cancelling
such Bills of Credit, till the Whole shall be paid and cancelled; whether (such
Security being strengthened every Year by paying off part of the Bills of
Credit, for which such Estates are engaged) it does not render Gentlemen's
Estates in Land a far better Security, than the Fund settled on the Bank of
England; which will always have the full Value of 1200000 l. due and owing,
upon the Security of it? Vide Proposals 18, 19.

Q. 14. Supposing there were 10 or 12 Millions of Money in the Kingdom, whether
the Subjects, sooner or later, must not lose 5 or 6 Millions by clipped and
counterfeit Money, if ever our Money be brought to its right Standard? And
whether the Council to be appointed pointed by the Commissioners to examine the
Titles of Estates proposed to be settled, must not be extremely negligent and
blameworthy, if all the Subjects in the Kingdom be injured to the Value of
500000 l. by undue Settlements? Vide Query 19.

Q. 15. If we were certain that several of the Subjects in the Nation would be
injured to the Value of a Million by undue Settlements, whether that
Consideration ought to be any Hindrance to the Settlement of Estates by my
proposed Method, which I will prove will be above 100 Millions in value
Advantage to the Estates of the Kingdom? And whether the Nation had not better
make good the Loss of such particular Persons, (if any should be) than to lose
those great Advantages, that will arise by these proposed Settlements? Vide
Queries 17, 18.

Q. 16. If the Money advanced on the late Funds had been raised by my proposed
Method, whether the Subjects would not have saved much more than can be lost by
undue Settlements? Vide the Tables and their Uses, in page 32, to 40.

Q. 17. If a Man can (at any time) take up the Value of 20 Years Purchase in
Bills of Credit upon his Estate, and may therewith clear his Estate, and
provide for his Children, and sink but one tenth Part of his Yearly Income for
the Use and Benefit of the same: or if a Man can advance such Bills of Credit
to their Majesty's upon the Security of a Parliamentary Fund, and be exempted
from Taxes, and have 50 or 60 l. per annum added to every 100 l. per annum
Estate he has, whether Estates in Land will not be worth 40 or 50 Years
Purchase? Vide Proposals 17, 19, 20, 22, 23. and the Tables in page 32, to 37.

Q. 18. If a Man can buy a perpetual Rentcharge of the Crown, free from Taxes,
for 12 Years Purchase, and can take up any Sum less than the Capital, or
purchase Money, at an Hour's warning, for 5 or 6 l. per cent. per annum
Interest, and pay it in again whenever he pleases; or if he can have 60 l. 16
s. 8 d. per annum Interest for 2000 l. value in Bank-Bills, and have in effect
2000 l. always lying by him; whether any Man will give 20 Years Purchase for
Land loaded every Year with Taxes, and upon which he cannot without great
Charge, loss of Time and Difficulty, take up one half of the Purchase-Money
paid by him for his Estate?

Q. 19. If any Person should settle an Estate to which he has no Right, and
shall take Bills of Credit to the Value of 20 Years Purchase upon the Credit of
such Estate, whether the remaining Part or Fee of the Estate will not be worth
much more to the Right-owner, than the whole Estate will be worth, if no such
Settlement be made? Vide Query 17. Proposal 7.

Q. 20. Whether a Trustee, or Guardian, who is not now able to sell, will be
able to settle the Estate of any Orphan, or other Person of whom he has the
Care or Guardianship, if an Act of Parliament should pass for these
Settlements? And whether such Trustee or Guardian will not be as accountable
for his Trust in case this Act should pass, as he now is before the passing
such Act? Vide Prop. 7.

Q. 21. Whether the Ruining our Trade, the Impoverishing the Nobility and
Gentry, the Burdening the Subjects with Funds, the Bringing Land to 14 Years
Purchase, the Flinging the Money and the Estates of the Kingdom into a few, or
into unsafe Hands, the Carrying the Money out of the Kingdom to pay the
Interest for Money advanced by Foreigners on the late Funds, will not be of far
worse consequence, and more mischievous to their Majesty's and the Kingdom,
than can be all the undue Settlements which we can reasonably imagine, or
suppose may possibly be made?

Q. 22. Whether the exempting the Nobility and Gentry from Taxes, and making
their Estates much more valuable; enlarging their Yearly Incomes, enabling them
to clear their Estates, and to raise Portions for their Children; the
increasing Trade, Navigation, and Building of Ships; the setting to work
Handicrasts, Artificers, and all the idle Hands in the Kingdom; the bringing
new Manufactures into the Nation, the burdening the Subjects with fewer Funds;
will not be an Ease to the Subjects, enrich the Nobility and Gentry, and make
the Nation vastly rich by our great Trade to foreign Parts, and be a most
unspeakable Obligation to the Nobility and Gentry, and all the Subjects in the
Kingdom? And whether it will not river them not only in Interest, but in
Affection to their Majesty's? Vide the Tables and their Uses, page 32, to 40.

POSTSCRIPT.
SOmetime after I had drawn up my Proposals in order to present them to the
Parliament; which is now about three Months ago; and since I have been printing
them, I have been several times cautioned not to publish or propose any thing
to the Parliament that might be opposite to the Interest of the Bank of
England; for if I did I must not expect to succeed, because the Gentlemen of
the Bank had a very great Interest in the Parliament, and would be too hard for
me: And another told me that they would certainly cross-bite me; to which I
replied, that it was no hard matter to foil me, but that the Controversy (if
any were) would not be between the Bank and me, but between the Nobility,
Gentry and Freeholders of England, who were almost ruined with those Funds,
and the Bank; and therefore I was not sollicitous about it, having also such an
Opinion of many Members of the Bank, that I did not doubt but they would have
preferred the public Good of the Kingdom before any little narrow Interest of
their own; insomuch, that the Person whom I first pitched upon to show my
Scheme to for his Approbation, is one of the Members of the Bank, and none of
the meanest of them, but he being at a considerable distance in the Country
prevented me. And sometime since a Friend of mine, whose Name I shall not
mention, proposed to bring the DeputyGovernour of the Bank and me together,
telling me I was a thinking Man, and that it might be for my advantage to be
acquainted with the Deputy Governor: I thanked my Friend, but although I have a
great Respect for the Deputy Governor, as being a very deserving Person, yet
(for some Reasons) did not close with his Offer: however, they have (as they
call it) cross-bit me; and I resolve to let the Parliament and the Gentlemen of
the Kingdom know so, and that these Acts of Grace lately published by the
Directors of the Bank were not designed in kindness to them, but to render
ineffectual what I had to propose to the Parliament: for having in the Preface
to my Discourse on the late Funds, mentioned how destructive these Funds are to
Trade, and that Exchequer-Tallies, Debenters and Sea-mens Tickets signed by
their Majesty's Commissioners were less esteemed than a Note under the Hand of
an ordinary Tradesman, to the great diminution of the Honor of the Nation;
these Gentlemen published an Order in the Gazette dated the 3 d and 10 th of
September last, That all Persons who have Tallies and Orders on Funds, etc.
which are not remote, may have Money for them without any Allowance; together
with all past Interest to the day on which they were brought: and that Foreign
Bills of Exchange will be discounted after the rate of 4 l. 10 s. per Cent. per
Annum.

This was but a small Bite; but whereas in Page 18, 19, 20. and in several
parts of my Treatise I set forth the sad Condition of the Gentlemen, as well as
the trading part of the Nation, occasioned by the late Funds, and that
Gentlemen whose Estates are in Mortgage are called upon for the Money, and know
not how to raise it, and are therefore ejected out of their Estates, and barred
of the Equity of Redemption; and in my Manuscript had introduced the Gentlemen,
laying these their Grievances before the Parliament, which I omitted printing
for fear of being too tedious: The Directors of the Bank being conscious of the
Truth of what I had writ, and supposing it might put the Parliament out of
Humor with them, to cross-bite me (for I shall not forget that Expression)
published the following Order in the Gazette of the first Instant.

The Court of the Directors of the Bank of England give notice, That after the
first day of January next (when they have paid into the Exchequer the Remainder
of the 1200000 l. subscribed) they will lend Money on Mortgages and real
Securities at 5 l. per Cent. per Annum.

And I doubt not but they will publish the same in Monday's Gazette again,
being the day before the Parliament meets; for there is nothing like to timing
of Business, especially when they know so dangerous a thing as my Treatise and
Proposals is to come before the Parliament.

And I hope they will bite me again, and offer the Parliament when they meet,
to furnish their Majesty's with their Bank-Bills for 5 l. per Cent. too.

But that which is one of their Masterpieces, is one of their Bylaws concluded
yesterday, Novem. the 2d. at a General Court. Which because every one may not
understand the meaning of, I shall unfold it.

The Gentlemen of the Bank knowing my Proposals to be so just and reasonable,
and for the great Advantage not only of their Majesty's but of all the Subjects
in the Kingdom, they feared that the Parliament would be ready to receive my
Proposals, which they supposed would endanger the Bank; this it seems put them
upon considering how to bassle my Design. They could not object against my
proposed Fund, for that would have brought an old House upon their Heads, to
maintain that a Fund payable out of the Excise, is more valuable than a Fund
settled upon the security of Gentlemen's Freehold Estates; nor could they
therefore maintain that any Man might be injured by taking these proposed Bills
of Credit, secured by such a Fund: it was also no less evident that it is
better for the Nation to have their Majesty's supplied with Money, at 3 l. per
cent. per annum, who do now pay the Bank above 8 l. per cent. per annum, and
that there would be occasion for fewer Funds, and that it must needs be a great
Ease and Satisfaction to the Nobility and Gentry to be excused from Taxes, and
to have a considerable Addition to their yearly Estates: nor can they deny but
many a poor Soul would be relieved by this proposed Method, whose Estates are
entangled, and who between the Taxes and Interest-Money, are reduced to such
straits that they even want Bread for their Families: nor is it less obvious
that there are many who are pinched in their Fortunes, and cannot spare their
Children any thing while they live, but are forced to turn them adrift into the
World without a penny to help themseves, that by my proposed Method, would be
enabled to provide for their Children plentifully with a very small dimunition
of their yearly Estates: and they must be forced to acknowledge, that it will be
a great encouragement for Merchants and Traders to have Money to trade with at
3 l. per cent. per annum; and that the Trade of the Kingdom would be very much
enlarged thereby. Well, what Arguments will they use with the Parliament
against my Proposals? why, say they, we will acquaint the Parliament that these
Proposals are not practicable, for the Nation will be so pestered with these
Bills of Credit, that we shall have more of them than we know what to do with:
but this say they he has unluckily answered, (which I shall give in the words
of my Manuscript, having varied some thing from it in my printed Book) viz. The
Bank of England is not limited to any Sum, but may issue out Bank-Bills for 50
Millions, (if they please) for which the Nation has only a personal Security,
of whom several are Foreigners, and consequently the Subjects may be losers;
whereas no Bills of Credit can be issued out until a sufficient Security out of
Gentlemen's real Estates be first settled. Yes say they, but there we have
cross-bit him again by our Order or By-law, at the last General Court, held at
Grocers-Hall, the 2 d of this Instant November, viz. That the Governor, Deputy
Governor, and Directors, shall not borrow under the Common Seal any Sum
exceeding in the whole 1200000 l. upon the Penalty of 1000 l. etc.

And now I hope I have unriddled and shown the meaning of that Order or By-law,
which doubtless made many thinking Men at a stand to know the meaning of it: so
that our mighty Bank, that is to help their Majesty's with I know not what
great Sums, and to furnish all the Gentlemen in England with Money, upon the
Security of their Estates, at 5 l. per cent. per annum, and to set up a Lumber
to lend Merchants and Tradesmen, Money upon their Goods, and to perform I know
not what other extraordinary Feats, and supply the defect of many Millions of
Money, for to serve a turn and to cross-bite me, are contented to dwindle for
the present into a little diminutive Bank of 1200000 l.

Well Gentlemen, but cannot those who made those Orders when their turn is
served, and that they have thereby baffled my Proposals, break those Orders
again, for great and weighty Reasons? but I hope the Parliament will not suffer
themselves and the Nation to be cross-bit, tho the Gentlemen may use their
pleasure with me. What I have proposed, is for the good of the whole Kingdom:
it lies in the Parliaments Power, if they please (and I cannot but hope they
will) to make this the most flourishing Kingdom, and the Subjects the most
happy People in the Universe; to whose great Wisdom, I have humbly submitted my
Proposals, and withal this as an undoubted Maxim, That nothing can be more
Fatal to any Government, than to discountenance and cross-bite those who make
it their Study to promote the Good and Welfare of it. But I am well satisfied,
I shall meet with no such evil Treatment from their Majesty's or the Parliament.
