THE Agreement IN DOCTRINE Among the Dissenting Ministers IN LONDON.

Subscribed December. 16. 1692.

LONDON, Printed for Thomas Cockerill at the Three Legs over against
Stocks-Market; And John Dunton at the Raven in the Poultrey. 1693.

Heads of Agreement BETWEEN Mr. Chauncy, etc. AND Mr. Williams, etc.
WHereas some Differences have of late arisen, occasioned by a Book written by
Mr. Williams Entitled Gospel Wherein Doctor Crisps Works reprinted are
considered.
Truths stated, and vindicated, and by certain Books written by Mr. Chauncy, in
opposition thereto; and by an Approbation of diverse of us prefixed to Mr.
Williams his Book, and by a Paper subscribed by Mr. Griffith, Mr. Cole, Mr.
Mather, Mr. Trayle. and Mr. Ri. Tailor, in conjunction with Mr. Chauncy,
expressing their Dissatisfaction therein.

1. It is hereby respectively declared, That neither they, who subscribed that
Approbation prefixed to Mr. Williams his Book, did therein more than signify
(as their own words express) that they judged he had in all that was material,
fully, and rightly stated the Truths and Errors therein mentioned as such,
without delivering their sense about the Preface, Explications, or Proofs
thereto belonging, which Declaration is not to be esteemed as a Disapproval of
the said Preface, Explications, or Proofs: Nor they, who with Mr. Chauncy,
subscribed the abovesaid Paper, did therein offer any particular Exceptions
against the said state of Truths, and Errors, which ^et is not to be understood
as an Approval of that State of Truth, and Errors.

2. That in order to the more effectual Composing of matters in Controversy,
we all of us, having referred our selves to the Holy Scriptures, and the
Doctrinal Articles of the Church of England, the Westminster, and Savoy
Confessions, the Larger, and Shorter Catechisms, do subscribe these following
Propositions, as what do most fully provide against the Arminian, Antinomian,
Socinian, and Popish Errors; and shall always be content, that any Sermons or
Books of ours be interpreted by the said Articles, and Confessions; desiring
all others, if they meet with any expressions from any of us, that are to them
of Doubtful signification, they would judge of them, and interpret them by the
Holy Scriptures, and said Articles and Confessions.

1. Of the Fall of Man, of Sin, and of the Punishment thereof.
1. OUR First Parents being seduced by the Subtilty and Temptation of Satan,
sinned in eating the Forbidden Fruit. Genesis 3.13. 2 Cor. 11.3.
This their Sin God was pleased according to his Wise and Holy Counsel to
permit, having purposed to order it to his own Glory. Romans 11.32.


2. By this Sin they fell from their Original Righteousness, and Communion with
God, Genesis 3.6, 7, 8. Eccles. 7.29.
and so became Dead in Sin, Genesis 2.17. Ephesians. 2.1.
and wholly defiled in all the Faculties and Parts of the Soul and Body. Tit.
1.15. Genesis 6.5. Jer. 17.9. Romans 3.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.


3. They being the Root of all Mankind the Guilt of this Sin was imputed, Genesis
1.27, 28. Genesis 2.16, 17. Acts 17.26. Romans 5.12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. 1 Cor.
15.21, 22, 45, 49.
and the same Death in Sin and Corrupted Nature conveyed to all their Posterity
descending from them by ordinary Generation. Psalm. 51.5. Genesis 5.3. Job 14.4.
Job 15.14.


4. Every Sin, both Original, and Actual, being a Transgression of the
Righteous Law of God, and contrary thereunto 1 John 3, 4.
does in its own Nature bring Guilt upon the Sinner, Romans 2.15. Romans 3.9.19.
whereby he is bound over to the Wrath of God, Ephesians. 2.3.
and Curse of the Law, Gal. 3.10.
and so made subject to Death, Romans 6.23.
with all Miseries, Spiritual, Ephesians. 4.18.
Temporal, Romans 8.20. Lam. 3.39.
and Eternal. Matthew. 25.41. 2 These. 1.9.
Assemb. Confession, Chap. 6. Sect. 1, 2, 3, 6.

II. Of God's Covenant with Man.
1. THE First Covenant made with Man, was a Covenant of Works, Gal. 3.12.
wherein Life was promised to Adam, and in him to his Posterity, Romans 10.5.
Romans 5. from 12. to 20.
upon condition of Perfect, and Personal Obedience. Geo. 2.17. Gal. 3.10.


2. Man by his Fall, having made himself incapable of Life by that Covenant,
the Lord was pleased to make a second, Gal. 3.21. Romans 8.3. Romans 3.20, 21. Genesis
3.15. Isa. 42.6.
commonly called the Covenant of Grace, wherein he freely offers unto
Sinners, Life and Salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them Faith in Him,
that they may be saved, Mark 16.15, 16. John 3.16. Romans 10.69 Gal. 3.11.
and promising to give unto all those that are Ordained unto Life his Holy
Spirit, making them willing and able to believe. Ezekiel. 36.26, 27 Joh. 6 44, 45.
Chap. 7. Sect. 2, 3.

3. This Covenant of Grace was made with Christ, as the Second Adam, and in Him
with all the Elect as his Seed. Gal. 3.16. Romans 5.15. Isa. 53.10, 11.
Larger Catechism.

4. The Grace of God is manifested in the Second Covenant, in that he freely
provideth and offers to Sinners a Mediator, Genesis 3.15. Isa. 42.6. John 6.27.
and Life and Salvation by Him 1 John 5.11, 12.
and requiring Faith as the Condition to Interest them in Him, Joh. 3, 16. Joh.
1.12.
promises and gives his Holy Spirit Prove. 1.23.
to all his Elect, to work in them that Faith, with all other Saving Graces,
Gal. 5.22, 23.
and to enable them unto all Holy Obedience, Ezekiel. 36.37.
as the Evidence of the Truth of their Faith Jam. 2.18, 22.
and Thankfulness to God, 1 Cor. 5.14, 15.
and as the way which he has appointed them to Salvation, Ephesians. 2.10.
Larger Catechism.

III. Of Christ the Mediator.
1. IT pleased God in his Eternal Purpose to Choose and Ordain the Lord Jesus,
his only begotten Son, to be the Mediator between God and Man, Isa 42.2. 1 Pet.
1.19, 20. John 3.16. 1 Timothy 2 5.
the Prophet, Act. 3.22
Priest, Heb. 5 5 6.
and King, Psalm. 2 6. Luke 1.33.
the Head and Savior of the Church, Ephesians. 5.23.
the Heir of all things, Heb. 1.2.
and Judge of the World, Acts 17.31.
unto whom he did from all Eternity give a People to be his Seed Joh. 17.6.
Psalm. 22.30. Isa. 53.10.
and to be by Him in time Redeemed, Called, Justified, Sanctified and
Glorified. 1 Timothy 2 6. Isa. 55.4, 5. 1 Cor. 1.30.


2. The Lord Jesus by his Perfect Obedience and Sacrifice of Himself, which He
through the Eternal Spirit once offered up unto God, has fully satisfied the
Justice of his Father, Romans 5.19. Heb. 9.14, 16. Heb. 10.14. Ephesians. 5.2. Romans
3.25, 26.
and purchased not only Reconciliation, but an Everlasting Inheritance in the
Kingdom of Heaven, for all those whom the Father has given unto Him. Dan.
9.24, 26. Col. 1.19, 20, Ephesians. 1.11, 14. John 17.2. Heb. 9.12, 15.


3. To all those for whom Christ has purchased Redemption, he does certainly
and effectually apply and communicate the same, Joh. 6.37, 39. John 10.15, 16.
making Intercession for them, 1 John 2.1, 2. Romans 8.84.
and Revealing unto them in, and by the Word, the Mysteries of Salvation, John
15.13, 15. Ephesians. 1.^ 8.^. John 17.6.
effectually persuading them by his Spirit, to believe and obey, and governing
their Hearts by his Word and Spirit, John 14.6. Heb. 12.2. 2 Cor. 4.13. Romans
8.9, 14. Romans 15.18, 19. John 17.17.
overcoming all their Enemies by his Almighty Power and Wisdom, in such manner
and ways as are most consonant to his wonderful and unsearchable Dispensations.
Psa. 110.1. 1 Cor. 15.25, 26. Mal. 4.2, 3. Col. 2.15.
Chap. 8. Sect. 1, 5, 8.

IV. Of Effectual Calling.
1. THE Spirit applies to us the Redemption purchased by Christ, by working
Faith in us, and thereby uniting us to Christ in our Effectual Calling. Shorter
Catechism.

2. All those whom God has predestined unto Life, and those only he is
pleased in his appointed and accepted Time, effectually to call Romans 8 30 Romans
11.7. Ephesians. 1.10, 11.
by his Word and Spirit 2 These. 2.13, 14. 2 Cor. 3.3.6.
out of the state of Sin and Death, in which they are by Nature, to Grace and
Salvation by Jesus Christ; Romans 8.2. Ephesians. 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 2 Timothy 1.9, 10.
enlightening their Minds, spiritually and savingly to understand the things of
God, Act 26.18. 1 Cor. 2.10, 12. Ephesians. 1.17, 18.
taking away their heart of stone, and giving unto them an heart of flesh,
Ezekiel. 36.26.
renewing their Wills, and by his Almighty Power determining them to that which
is good, Ezekiel. 11.19. Phil. 2.13. Deuteronomy. 30.6. Ezekiel. 36.27.
and effectually drawing them to Jesus Christ; Ephesians. 1.19. John 6 44, 45.
yet so as they come most freely, being made willing by this Grace. Cant. 1.4.
Psalm. 110.3. John 6.37. Romans 6.16, 17, 18.


3. This Effectual Call is of God's free and special Grace alone, not from any
thing at all foreseen in Man, 2 Timothy 1.9. Tit. 3.4, 5. Ephesians. 2.4, 5, 8, 9. Romans
9.11.
who is altogether passive therein, until being quickened and renewed by the
Holy Spirit, 1 Cor. 2.14. Romans 8.7. Ephesians. 2.5.
he is thereby enabled to answer this Call, and embrace the Grace offered and
conveyed in it. Joh. 6.37. Ezekiel. 36.27, John 5.25.
Chap. 10. Sect. 1, 2.

V. Of Justification, Faith, and Repentance.
1. THose whom God Effectually calls, he also freely justifies, Romans 8.30.
Romans 3.24.
not by infusing Righteousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, and by
accounting and accepting their Persons as Righteous; not for any thing wrought
in them, but for Christ's sake alone; nor by imputing Faith it self the Act of
Believing, or any other Evangelical Obedience to them, as their Righteousness;
but by imputing the Obedience and Satisfaction of Christ unto them, Romans 4.5,
6, 7, 8. 2. Cor. 5.19, 21. Romans 3.22, 24, 25, 27, 28. Tit. 3.5, 7. Ephesians. 1.7.
Jer. 23.6. 1 Cor. 1.30, 31. Romans 5.17, 18, 19.
they receiving and resting on Him, and his Righteousness by Faith, which Faith
they have not of themselves, it is the Gift of God. Act. 10.44. Gal. 2.16.
Phil. 3.9. Act. 13.38, 39. Ephesians. 2.7, 8.
Chap. 11. Sect. 1.

2. By this Faith a Christian believes to be true, whatsoever is Revealed in
the Word, for the Authority of God Himself, speaking therein, Joh. 4.42. 1
These. 2.13. 1 John 5.10. Acts 24 14.
and acts differently upon that which each particular passage contains,
yielding Obedience to the Commands, Romans 16.26.
trembling at the Threatenings, Isa. 66.2.
embracing the Promises of God for this Life and that which is to come. Heb.
11.13 1 Timothy 4.8.
But the principal acts of Saving Faith are, accepting, receiving, and resting
upon Christ alone for Justification, Sanctification, and Eternal Life by virtue
of the Covenant of Grace. Joh. 1.12. Acts 16.32. Gal. 2.20. Acts 15.11.
Chap. 14. Sect. 2.

3. Faith thus receiving and resting on Christ and his Righteousness, is the
alone Instrument of Justification, John 1.12. Romans 3.3. to 28. Romans 5.1.
yet it is not alone in the Person Justified, but is ever accompanied with all
other Saving Graces, and is no dead Faith, but works by Love. Jam. 2.17, 22,
26. Gal. 5.6.
Chap. 11. Sect. 2.

4. God did from all Eternity decree to Justify all the Elect, Gal. 3.8. 1
Pet. 1.2, 19, 20. Romans 8.30.
and Christ did in the Fullness of Time die for their Sins, and rise again for
their Justification; Gal. 4.4. 1 Gal. 2.6. Romans 4.25.
nevertheless they are not Justified until the Holy Spirit does in due Time
actually apply Christ unto them. Col. 1.21, 22. Gal. 2.16. Acts 13.38, 39. Tit.
3.4, 5, 6, 7.
Chap. 11. Sect. 4.

5. That we may escape the Wrath and Curse of God due to us by reason of the
Transgression of the Law, he requires of us Repentance toward God, Faith
toward our Lord Jesus Christ, Acts 20.21. Matthew. 3.7, 8. Act. 16.30, 31 Joh.
3.16, 18.
and the diligent use of the Outward Means, whereby Christ communicates to us
the Benefits of his Mediation. Prove. 2.1, 5. cap. 8.33, 35. Isa. 55.3.
Larger Catechism.

6. Repentance unto Life is an Evangelical Grace, Ezekiel. 12.10. Acts 11.18.
the Doctrine whereof is to be Preached by every Minister of the Gospel, as
well as that of Faith in Christ. Luke 24.47. Mark 1.15. Acts 20.21.
Chap. 15. Sect. 1. Although Repentance be not to be rested in as any
satisfaction for sin, nor any cause of the pardon thereof, Ezekiel. 36.31, 32.
Ezekiel. 16.61, 62, 63.
which is the act of God's Free Grace in Christ; Hos. 14.2, 4. Ephesians. 1.7.
yet it is of such necessity to all sinners, that none can expect pardon
without it. Luke 13.3, 5. Act. 17.30, 31
Chap 15. Sect. 3, 4. As there is no sin so small but it deserves damnation;
Romans 6.23. Romans 5.12. Matthew. 12.36.
so there is no sin so great that it can bring damnation upon those who truly
repent. Isa. 55.7. Romans 8.1. Isa. 1.16, 18.


7. God does continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified; Matthew.
6.12. 1 John 1.7, 9. 1 John 2.1, 2.
and although they can never fall from the state of Justification; Luke 22.32.
1 John 10.28. Heb. 10.14.
yet they may by their sins fall under God's fatherly displeasure, and not have
the light of his Countenance restored unto them till they humble themselves,
confess their sins, beg pardon and renew their Faith and Repentance Psalm.
89.31, 32, 33. Psalm. 51.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Psalm. 32.5. Matthew. 26.75. 1 Cor.
11.30, 32. Luke 1.20.
. Chap. 11. Sect. 5.

VI. Of Good Works.
1. MAN by his Fall into a state of sin has wholly lost all ability of will to
any spiritual good accompanying Salvation, Romans 5.6. Romans 8.7. John 15.5.
so as a natural man being altogether averse from that good, Romans 3 10, 12.
and dead in sin, Ephesians. 2.1, 5. Col. 2.13.
is not able by his own strength to convert himself, or prepare himself thereto
John 6.44, 65. Ephesians. 2.2, 3, 4, 5. 1 Cor. 2 14. Tit. 3.3, 4, 5.
Chapter 9. Sect. 3.

2. Works done by unregenerate men, although for the matter of them they may be
things which God commands, and of good use both to themselves and others; 2
King. 10.30, 31. 1 King. 21.27, 29. Phil. 1.15, 16, 18.
yet because they proceed not from a heart purified by Faith, Genesis 4, 5. Heb.
11.4, 6.
nor are done in a right manner according to the Word, Cor. 13.3. Isa. 1.12.
nor to a right end, the glory of God, Mat. 6.2, 5, 16.
they are therefore sinful, and cannot please God, or make a man meet to
receive Grace from God; Hag. 2.14. Tit. 1.15. Amos 5.21, 22. Hos. 1.4. Romans
9.16. Tit. 3.5.
yet their neglect of them is more sinful and displeasing unto God. Psalm. 14.4.
Psalm. 36.3. Job 21.14, 15. Matthew. 25.41, 42, 43, 44, 45. Matthew. 23.23.
Chapter 16. Sect. 7.

3. Good works are only such as God has commanded in his holy Word, Mich. 6.8.
Romans 12.2. Heb. 13.21.
and not such as without the warrant thereof are devised by men out of blind
Zeal, or upon any pretense of good intention. Matthew. 15.9 Isa. 29.13. 1 Pet.
1.18. Romans 10.2. John 16.2. 1 Samuel 15.21, 22, 23.
Chapter 16. Sect. 1.

4. These good works done in obedience to God's Commandments, are the fruits
and evidences of a true and lively Faith. Jam. 2.18, 22.
and by them Believers manifest their thankfulness, Psa 116.12, 13. 1 Pet. 2 9.
strengthen their assurance, 1 John 2.3, 5. 1 Pet. 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
edify their Brethren, 2 Cor. 9.2. Matthew. 5.16.
adorn the Profession of the Gospel, Tit. 2 5, 9, 10, 11, 12. 1 Timothy 6.1.
stop the mouths of Adversaries, 1 Pet. 2.15.
and glorify God, 1 Pet. 2.12. Phil. 1.11. John 15.8.
whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto; Ephesians. 2.10.
that having their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end everlasting life.
Romans 6.22.
Chapter 16. Sect. 2.

5. The Persons of Believers being accepted through Christ, their good works
also are accepted in him; Ephesians. 1.16. 1 Pet. 2.5. Exodus 28.38. Genesis 4.4. Heb.
11.4.
not as though they were in this life wholly unblameable and unreprovable in
God's sight; Job 9.20. Psalm. 143.2.
but that he looking, upon them in his Son, is pleased to accept, and reward
that which is sincere, though accompanied with many weaknesses and imperfections.
Heb. 13.20, 21. 2 Cor. 8.12. Heb. 6.10. Matthew. 25 21, 23.
Chapter 16. Sect. 6.

VII. Of the Perseverance of Saints.
1. THey whom God has accepted in the Beloved, effectually called, and
sanctified by his Holy Spirit, can neither totally, nor finally fall away from
the state of Grace; but shall certainly persevere to the end, and be eternally
saved. Phil. 1.6. 2 Pet. 1.10. Joh. 10.28.29 1 John 3.9. 1 Pet. 1.5, 9.


2. This Perseverance of the Saints, depends not on their own Free will, but
upon the Immutability of the Decree of Election, flowing from the free and
unchangeable Love of God the Father; 2 Timothy 218, 19. Jer. 31.3.
upon the Efficacy of the Merit and Intercession of Jesus Christ, Heb. 10 10,
14. Heb. 13.20, 21. Heb. 9.12, 13, 14, 15. Romans 8.33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39.
John 17.11, 24. Luke 22.32. Heb. 7.25.
the abiding of the Spirit, and of the Seed of God within them; Joh. 14 16, 17.
1 John 2.27. 1 John 3.9.
and the Nature of the Covenant of Grace; Jer. 32.40.
from all which arises also the certainty and infallibility thereof. Joh. 10
28. 2 These. 3.3. 1 John 2.19.


3 Nevertheless, they may, through the Temptations of Satan and the World, the
prevalency of Corruption remaining in them, and the neglect of the means of
their Preservation, fall into grievous Sins; Mat. 26.70.72, 74.
and for a time continue therein; Psa. 51. title, and v. 14.
whereby they incur God's Displeasure, Isa. 64.5, 7, 9, 2 Samuel 11.27.
and grieve the Holy Spirit; Ephesians. 4.30.
come to be deprived of some measure of their Graces and Comforts, Psalm. 51.8,
10, 12. Rev. 2.4. Cant. 5.2, 3, 4, 5.
have their Hearts hardened, Isa. 63.17. Mark 6.52. Mark 16.14.
and their Consciences wounded, Psalm. 37.3, 4. Psalm. 51.8.
hurt and scandalize others, 2 Samuel 12.14. Psa. 89.31, 32. 1 Cor. 11.32.
and bring Temporal Judgments on themselves. p Chap. 17. Sect. 1, 2, 3.

VIII. Of the Moral Law.
1. THE Moral Law does for ever bind all, as well justified Person as others,
to the Obedience thereof; Romans 13.8, 9, 10. Ephesians. 6.2. 1 John 2.3, 4, 7, 8.
and that not only in regard of the matter contained in it; but also in respect
of the Authority of God the Creator who gave it, Jam. 2.10, 11.
neither does Christ in the Gospel any way dissolve, but much strengthen this
Obligation. Mat. 5.17, 18, 19. Jam. 2.8. Romans 3.31.


2. Though Believers be not under the Law as a Covenant of Works, to be thereby
justified or condemned; Romans 6.14. Gal. 2.16. Gal. 3.13. Gal. 4.4, 5. Act.
13.39. Romans 8.1.
yet it is of great use to them, as well as to others, in that, as a Rule of
Life informing them of the Will of God, and their Duty, it directs, and binds
them to walk accordingly; Romans 7.12, 22, 25. Psalm. 119.4, 5, 6. 1 Cor. 7.19.
Gal. 5.14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.
discovering also the sinful Pollutions of their Nature, Hearts and Lives; Romans
7.7. Romans 3.20.
so as examining themselves thereby, they may come to further Conviction of,
Humiliation for, and Hatred against Sin; Jam. 1.23, 24, 25. Romans 7.9, 14, 24.
together with a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ, and the
Perfection of his Obedience. Gal. 3.24. Romans 7.24, 25 Romans 8.3, 4.
It is likewise of use to the Regenerate, to restrain their Corruptions, in
that it forbids Sin, Jam. 2.11. Psa. 119.101, 104, 128.
and the Threatenings of it serve to show what even their Sins deserve, and what
Afflictions in this Life they may expect for them, although freed from the
Curse thereof threatened in the Law. Ezra 9.13, 14. psalm 89.30, 31, 32, 33, 34.
The Promises of it in like manner show them God's Approbation of Obedience,
and what Blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof, Lev. 26. to v.
14. 2 Cor. 6.16. Ephesians. 6.2, 3. Psalm. 37.11. Matthew. 5.5. Psalm. 19.11.
although not as due to them by the Law as a Covenant of Works; Gal. 2.16. Luke
17.10.
so as a man's doing good, and refraining from evil, because the Law
encourages to the one, and deterreth from the other, is no evidence of his
being under the Law, and not under Grace. Romans 6.12, 14. 1 pet. 3.8, 9, 10, 11,
12 psalm. 34.12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Heb. 12.28, 29.
Chap. 19. Sect. 5, 6.

IX. Of Christian Liberty.
THey who upon pretense of Christian Liberty do practice any sin, or cherish
any lust, do thereby destroy the End of Christian Liberty; which is, that being
delivered out of the hands of our Enemies, we might serve the Lord without fear
in Holiness and Righteousness before him all the days of our life. Gal. 5.13. 1
pet. 2.16. 2 pet. 2.19. Joh. 8.34. Luke 1.74, 75.
Chap. 20. Sect. 3.

Though we have selected these Propositions, as conceiving them most accommodated
to some Points at this time controverted: yet we profess to have an equal
respect to all other the main parts of Doctrine, contained in the
foremen-Articles, Confession, and Catechisms; as judging them tion'd, agreeable
to the Word of God.

3. That we shall always, through God's gracious Assistance in our future
Ministry, to our uttermost, avoid all Appearances of Opposition to one another,
so as not to hinder, or prejudice; but as far as in us lies, to promote the
Success thereof, and the common Benefit thereby.

December. 16. 1692. This day the Brethren who endeavored to Accommodate this
Controversy, did with Mr. Williams, Mr. Chauncy, and those other five
Brethren, who with him objected against Mr. Williams his Book, subscribe to
this Agreement, and these Doctrinal Propositions.

Daniel Williams. Isaac Chauncy. Samuel Annesley John How George Griffith
Matthew Barker Vincent Alsop Thomas Cole Edward Veal George Hamond Nath.
Mathers John James Richard Mayo Robert Trayle Stephen Lobb. Samuel Slater
Richard Tailor.
The Concurrence of the United Ministers.
On December. 19. 1692. This Expedient was brought to a Meeting of the United
Ministers, who unanimously expressed their Approbation in the following words;
Viz.

That those Brethren, who at the desire of the United Ministers considered some
Objections against Mr. Williams his Book, having brought in the abovementioned

Ministers have weighed it, and approve of the same. Besides, it was further
declared by them, That whereas the United Ministers Collectively considered,
and as such, have not been desired to Approve of Mr. Williams his Book: In like
manner, they do not by any thing in this Agreement imply an Approbation of Mr.
Chauncy his Writings in this Controversy: But yet they do rejoice that both
Mr. Williams and Mr. Chauncy have accepted this offered Expedient.
