By the Queen.
THe Queens most excellent Majesty, finding the great misusage in the
execution of sundry her Highness graunts made to diverse persons, touching
certain penal statutes, made and set forth for the common benefit and
utility of her people, and touching the obtaining and recovery of lands and
tenements concealed, and of sundry bands, forfeitures, and other things
pretended to be unjustly withholden and concealed from her Highness and her
Crown: By pretense whereof, she perceives a great multitude of her loving
Subjects, contrary to the intention of her Majesty's said graunts, in many
cases (though not offending) to have been greatly vexed and molested, and the
laws not thereby any thing the better executed, but in some parts rather
unpaired, nor any such profit recovered, or obtained to her Highness use upon
such executions and concealments, as was pretended: most graciously minding the
common quiet and profit of her loving Subjects, and willing to remove all
occasions of such griefs to her people, as thing whereof she always has had,
and yet still has utter misliking: Expressly wills and commands that the
execution of all such special graunts and commissions, made to particular
persons touching the premises, and all commissions not being returned into any
her Majesty's courts of Records made upon, or by virtue of any such graunts,
shall from henceforth cease. And that no new commissions upon any the graunts
aforesaid, do from henceforth pass any her Majesty's Scales, nor any process
or writ to be awarded, nor informacion from henceforth received, upon or by
virtue of any such grant or commission out of any her Majesty's courts of
Record whatsoever.

And further her Majesty commands, that no Commissions of Commissioner, or
other person whatsoever, already authorized to execute and such grant or
Commission, shall from henceforth deal proceed any further by inquisition of
Jurors, examination of witnesses, or certificate, or by any other ways or
means whatsoever, to execute any the said graunts or Commissions upon pain of
imprisonment, and incurring her Majesty's displeasure. And her Highness does
further straightly prohibit and forbid all her Justices of the peace, Majors,
Sherifs, Constables, Bailiffes of liberties, and other her Officers and
Ministers whatsoever, as they tender the avoiding of her High displeasure, from
henceforth to be in any wise ayding or assisting to the execution of any the
said Statutes or Commissions. And for the better execution of the Premises, if
any person or persons, contrary to her Majesty's Proclamation and prohibition,
shall presume to execute any the said graunts or Commissions, or to be in any
wise ayding or assisting thereunto: Then her Highness will, and express
commandment is to all Justices of the peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bailiffes, and
all other her Officers, and Ministers whatsoever, to whom it shall or may
appertain, to attache and apprehende all and every such Offendour and
Offenders, and them to commit to the common Jail of the country where such
offenses shall be committed, there to remain without Bail or Mainprise, until
her Highness pleasure shall by her Honorable privy Counsel, or otherwise be
signified what shall be further done in that behalf.

Provided nevertheless, that where by means of the said graunts, diverse
suites are already commenced by the parties, and some of them depending in
sundry her Majesty's Courts by way of Information or otherwise, at the charge
of the said Patentees, her Highness also minding to put the same suites to some
good end, with the reasonable contentation of her Subjectes, does by virtue
hereof authorize the Lord Chauncellor of England, the Lord Treasurer of
England, the Chauncellor of her Court of Exchequier, and the Barons of the
same Court, or two of them, whereof the Lord Chauncellor to be one, for all
causes determinable in the Chauncerie, and the Lord Treasurer one, for all
causes determinable in the Exchequier, to hear, order, end, or compound all
the said causes, as shall stand with equity, to the quiet of the parties
molested, and the reasonable satisfaction of the Patentees aforesaid, ratifying
and allowing whatsoever the said Lord Chauncellor, Lord Treasurer, Chauncellor
and Barons as above is limited, shall do or conclude touching the premises.

Given at our Manor of Grenewich the fiftenth of December, the two and
twentieth year of our reign. An. 1579.
Imprinted at London, by Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queens most
excellent Majesty.
