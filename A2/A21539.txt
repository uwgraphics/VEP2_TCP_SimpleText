By the Queen,
Forasmuch as diverse light, and sedicious persons, delytyng in continual
alterations, and never contented with the present estate, have of late much
presumed, and yet cease not to inuente, spread, and publishe many false,
untrue, and vain rumors, and brutes, rashely discoursyng upon the great, and
most weightye affairs, touching the Queen's hyghnes royal person, and state of
the realm, contrary to their bounde^ duties of allegiaunce, and contrary to
al good order, in such outragiouse sort, as (if remedy were not provided in
time) great inconvenience might ensue. FOR remedy whereof, her hyghnes
considering, that of the sufferaunce of such lewd liberty of speaking, evil
doings, and attemptes, have many times followed, does therefore streyghtly
charge and command al her loving subjects, of every sort and degree, from
henceforth, not only for their own parts to forbear, to publyshe any such
rumors or tales: but also to declare to the next justice of peace, or other
officer, any person, whatsoever he be that they shall know to be offenders in
this behalf, to the intent, they may (by the said officers) be committed to
prison, and further punyshed by pillory, or otherwise, as the quality of the
person, and of his offense may seem to deserve.

AND her highness further pleasure is, that if the hearers of any such light,
sediciouse, or naughty talk, spoken in his or their presence, shall not,
according to this proclamacion, open the same to the next Justice, or other
officer, (as aforesaid,) that then the same person, so hearing, and not
declarynge the same, and being thereof justly convicted, shall be reputed, and
taken for the first author of the said rumors, and have such punyshmente
for the same, as the first author should, if he were apprehended.

REQVIRING, and straightly charging and commanding all justices of peace,
Mayours, Bayliffes, Sheriffs, Constables, Hedboroughes, and al other her
highness officers, and ministers, whatsoever they be, to do their best endeavor,
for the effectual execution of this present proclamation, and due punishment of
all offend ours in this behalf, as they will answer to the contrary at
their perils.

God save the Queen.
