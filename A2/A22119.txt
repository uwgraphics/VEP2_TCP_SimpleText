Whereas, John Pinnell, Robert Trow, Robert Baxter, Edward Friar, George Batch,
Solomon Law, Thomas Be, Edward Pigget Richard Windar, Peter Edwards, Edward
Heather, John Harlow, John Achley, John James, Edward Strensham, Thomas
Ghostlee, Thomas Radnor, Richard Luck, William Pedel, William Eley, Jasper
Coard, John Hostler, and others, makers of playing Cards within Our Realm of
England, have by their humble petition lately showed, and complained, That
these being natural borne Subjects of Our Realm of England, trained and
brought up in the Art trade and skill of making of playing Cards within this
Kingdom, and whereon their only maintenance and means to live depends,
have been, and still are much decayed and impouerished in their said trade by
the Importation, conueying and bringing of playing Cards into Our said Realm
of England, from sundry the parts beyond the Seas* whereby not only many of
Our poor subjects of that, and other trades, do want those means whereby they
were formerly set on work, but other Our loving subjects also by the said
Cards deceitfully made in the said parts beyond the Seas, and Imported and sold
in this Our Realm, are greatly deceived to their no small hurt and damage: For
reformation whereof the said makers of playing Cards, for themselves and
others, have humbly petitioned Us, to nominate and appoint some fit and
discreet person, for to view, search, scale and allow, as well of all such
playing Cards, as shall be hereafter made within Our Realm of England and
Dominions thereof, as of all such playing Cards, as shall hereafter be
conveyed, imported, or brought into Our said Realm and Dominions thereof, from
any the parts beyond the Seas; voluntarily offering, That if they the said
Cardmakers or any of them, or any others by their means or procurement, shall
at any time hereafter deceitfully make, or cause to be made any playing Cards,
and the same shall sell or offer and put to sale, That then all such Cards
should become wholly forfeited unto Us: whereby the said frauds and abuses now
practiced, might be taken away, and the said Cardmakers of this Our Realm much
relieved. And whereas the said Makers of playing Cards before named, have made
choice of Sir Richard Cognisby Knight, one of Our Gentlemen Vshers in
Ordinary, for the viewing, searching, scaling and allowing of all such playing
Cards as shall be hereafter made within, or be Imported into this Our Realm, or
the Dominions thereof: and have already granted and assured unto the said Sir
Richard for the term of one and Twenty years, five Shillings upon every
Gross of playing Cards by them or any of them, to be hereafter made and
uttered within this Our Realm or the Dominions thereof, in recompense of the
pains, care and attendance of the said Sir Richard, or his Deputies, in and
about the viewing, searching, sealing and allowing of the same playing Cards,
to be from time to time made and uttered within this Our Realm or the
Dominions thereof. And the said Cardmakers of this Our Realm have further
humbly prayed, that for the better repressing of the Importation into this Our
Realm of the said playing Cards deceitfully made in the parts beyond the Seas,
We would be pleased to impose, lay, and cause to beleuied to Our own use the
^ike sum of five Shillings, for and upon every Gross of the said playing
Cards to be so imported, brought in, and conveyed unto this Our Realm or the
Dominions thereof as aforesaid. And that the same playing Cards so to be
Imported, might first be viewed, searched sealed and allowed by the said Sir
Richard Cognisby, or his Deputies, before the same should be uttered, ^old, or
put to sale within Our said Realm, and the Dominions thereof. And whereas We
much commiserating the de^ayed estates of Our said poor Subjects, referred the
consideration of their Petition to Thomas Earl of Suffolk Our high Treasourer
of England, Henry late Earl of Northampton deceased, and Edward Earl of
Worcester Master of Our horse, then our Commissioners of and for Our Treasury,
who having duly considered of the contents of the said Petition, gave like^ng
and passage thereunto, So as the same might not prejudice the then Treaty with
the French. And for their better satis^action in that behalf, referred the
same to the consideration of Sir Julius Caesar knight, then Chancellor of Our
Court of Ex^hequer, Sir Thomas Parry knight, Chancellor of Our Duchy of
Lancaster, and Sir Daniel Dun knight one of Our Masters of Requests: who
thereupon certified that there was nothing in the last Treaty with the French,
which did or might impeach ^he said suite of the said Cardmakers, and that
thereby good profit might arise to Us without damage to Our Subjects of ^his
Our Realm. And whereas We affecting the relief of Our said subjects the
Cardmakers, and the better to repress and restrain the excessive Importation
of Playing-cards into this Our said Realm, from the parts beyond the Seas, by
Our Letters given under Our Privy Seal at Our Manor of Greenwich, the four
and twentieth day of June last before ^he date hereof, directed to Our right
trusty and right well-beloved cousin and Counselor Thomas Earl of Suffolk,
Lord ^igh Treasurer of England, Have ordained, appointed and commanded at the
humble suite of the said Cardmakers, and ^or other considerations Us especially
moving, That there shall be levied, received and taken, to the use of Us, Our

from any the parts beyond the Seas into Our Realm of England, Dominion of
Wales, or Port or Town of Berwicke, by any person or persons, Englishmen,
denizens or strangers, to the end to be uttered, sold or put to sale, as by the
same Our Letters more at large it does and may appear. NOW KNOW YE, That we
minding the reformation of the aforenamed frauds and abuses, and to the intent
that the said Cardmakers Our natural borne Subjects may again be more freely
set on work, and employed in the trade and course of life, wherein they have
been trained up, and exercised. And for the better effecting of all the
premises, according to the humble Petition of the same Our poor Subjects in
