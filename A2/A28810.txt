A TRUE DECLARATION OF THE Intolerable wrongs done to RICHARD BOOTHBY,
Merchant of India, by two lewd servants to the honorable East India Company,
Richard Wild, and George Page. As also a Remonstrance of the partial,
ungrateful and unjust proceeds of the India Court at home, against the said
RICHARD BOOTHBY. In vindication of his good name (never yet justly stained) yet
now of late for certain years had in unjust scandal and defamation, by
malignant adversaries, who are and will be ashamed to verify their malice and
wicked censure against him, in any judicious Court of Equity: With Petition to
his most gracious Majesty King Charles, and the most right Honorable high Court
of Parliament for justice and relief to him and his, thereby utterly ruined in
worldly estate, by such unsupportable wrongs and cruel oppressions.

He that justifies the wicked, and he that condemns the just, even they both
are abomination unto the Lord,

Prove. 17. 15. Dr Baily in his Practice of Piety. In all causes judge aright;
for thou shall be sure to find a righteous Judge, before whom thou shall
shortly appear to be judged thy self: at which time thou may leave to thy
friends this for thine Epitaph.

TO THE RIGHT HONOrable the Lords and Commons assembled in the most Right
Honorable high Court of Parliament.
The humble Petition of Richard Boothby, Merchant. Most humbly shows,

HIs insupportable wrongs sustained (as in this present declaration in print,
exhibited to every particular Member of both Houses of Parliament, and most
submissively beggeth your Hon: favors (even for the tender mercies of God in
Christ Jesus) to pity and compassionate the miserable and distressed estate of
your poor impotent Petitioner, and all his (a wife and five children) by
affording him justice in the causes mentioned in this present narration, and
such justice (and no other he beggeth for) as may stand with the glory of God,
the good construction of the wholesome laws of this Kingdom, and the honor of
his Majesty King Charles, and the right honorable high Court of Parliament,
which though he be daunted with exceeding great fears (as Hester) to present
his Petition in that most right honorable Court, not having your honors golden
Scepter of grace held out unto him, yet his cause being in great measure like
hers (necessitated to the preservation of her self and nation, as his for
himself and family) he is forced to put on her resolution, If I perish, I
perish. Fiat voluntas Dei. June 10. 1644.

To the right Honorable, (the Honorable) the right Worshipful, (the
Worshipful, etc.) the Generality of the honorable East India Corporation.
RIght Honorable, etc. Two things have coacted and impulsed me to trouble your
Honors, etc. with this rude Epistle: The one is an ardent desire I have not
only to express my endeered affection to the honorable Society, but also my
willingness (though uninvited, in coming to counsel before I am called,
presuming of your gracious pardon if not good acceptance) to manifest or make
known unto you what my weak capacity conceives behoovefull for the welfare and
indemnity of the honorable Company of India Merchants in their right worthy
famous action of Commerce. The other is for vindication of my good name, never
yet justly tainted) by declaration of the intolerable wrongs which I Richard
Boothby, an honest poor member of the India Company, and your trusty servant,
has undergone both in India, by lewd, malicious, tyrannical, fraudulent,
juggling fellow servants; and also at home, by partial, injust, ungrateful,
unconscionable, corrupt Governors, and timeserving Committees in the India
Courts.

For your encouragements in that worthy action of Commerce, be pleased to
conceive charitably and friendly of the opinion, or rather assured knowledge of
a weak unintelligent Merchant, that the trade to and from India, and from port
to port in the several places of India, and other Kingdoms near adjacent, is
the most hopeful, beneficial of any part of the world; wherein by Gods
blessing, a competency (if not a superfluity) in estate is to be attained unto
with small stock, in 4, 5, 6, or 7 years time; which 3 or 4 times so many
years spent in other Countries, will not so suddenly supply with far greater
stock. The danger of the trade by sea, especially in those oriental parts, is
small, taking the opportunity and season of the year in the time of the
favorable monsons, or trading winds, the seas so calm and pleasant, that from
India to Persia, Bantum, Mocco, Madagascar, Mauritius, and other parts, the
ships commonly tow their long Boats, Skiffes, and Barges at their Stern to and
again; and by a voyage in three, four, or five months time too and again,
there may be gained, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80. and 100. per cent. profit, and more in
several sorts of commodities, according to the judgment and discretion of the
intelligent Merchant, in making choice of his commodity, and attaining it at
the best hand.

Hereof I will not much insist, having more at large discoursed thereof in a
rude pamphlet tending to encouragements to plant in Madagascar (which perhaps
may hereafter come out in print) where I could wish my self and family
securely (with others my Countrymen) seated in that most famous, pleasant,
wholesome, fruitful Island, as I suppose, transcending all others in the world,
if my weak purse and decrepit unable body for travel, would permit.

The other cause moving me to this occasion for vindication of my good name, in
manifestation of my wrongs, will be superfluous to insist upon in this Epistle,
for that the present declaration thereof hereunto annexed, will more at large
demonstrate the same.

Be pleased, right honorable, etc. courteously to accept the admonishments and
advertisements of an unintelligent Merchant (especially in matters that are not
within his line, or beyond the reach of his apprehension) yet in some things I
may peradventure say more by industrious observation and affectionate duty to
your Honors Corporation, its welfare and indemnity, then others (it may be)
either can or will.

In the first pla^e it were good at your general Courts (especially at the
election of your Governor, Deputy, Committees and Officers,) not to be absent
to lend your votes in ^busing fitting persons thereunto, men fearing God, and
hating covetousness (for by your absence and small appearance of late at such
times, the time-serving Governor and Committees, are better fitted to band
together, to continue in their places, or to elect new, such men as they either
know or presume will be for their accommodation the one to the other, in their
own private ends.) And if at such election some pious Divine spend an hour, or
less, in godly exhortations in a Sermon, to persuade to upright dealing
between all parties, as well in the differences between the Court and their
servants, or their servants one against another, as for their fidelity and
industry in managing the main affairs, or joint stock of the Company. It may
not perhaps be accounted or found an irksome, needless, or impertinent matter
to spend an hours time in such businesses, nor yet a superfluous charge, to
gratify a worthy Minister for his pains therein: For surely, the partiality,
injustice, uncharitableness, and ingratitude of those Courts, have wrought
much wrong and oppression to their best deserving servants, and caused
connivance at their most wicked, lewd, fraudulent, and worst deserving
servants, being blinded with their heaps of ill-gotten goods, by bribery, and
bopes to match such ill-deserving men in marriage to their daughters.

In the next place I think it not amiss to put you in mind, that charge be
given to those Courts, to make choice of their India servants, men of good
repute and credit in life and conversation, as well as of men of ability and
understanding to manage their affairs, and that no lewd, debauched, illlivers,
prodigal unthrifty persons, profane swearers, drunkards, and lascivious
persons, of which sort too many have been entertained, by favor and friendship
in Court, even of their own sons, kindred or friends, and by letters from
great men to pleasure them, (sent out as the phrase has been, for sacrifice,
or by such voyages to reclaim them, which is rather the next way to thrust such
persons into the Devils mouth, and to make them ten times worse then ere they
were before) which turns to the dishonor of God, the prejudice of the
honorable Company, and their own souls hazard, countenanced by example of
superionrs there, given to all excess of riot, and delighting to make others
children of Belial as themselves.

Thirdly, it were better in my weak judgment, to make plain downright accord
and covenant with their servants concerning private trade, rather then by
indirect conniving thereat, to covenant with them for less salary, which they
regard not in any comparison to their benefit by private trading, (though they
enter into large bonds to the contrary, which they know the Court never has
put in suit, nor ever will, as not effectual by the laws of the Land) which
is as difficult a thing to reclaim in their servants, as for a hungered starved
Cook to dress curious dainty viands for a great Feast, and be bound under
great penalty, not so much as to lick his fingers. But other plain covenants
and agreements may be devised to the better contentment and accommodation of
their servants and themselves, (as my self has heretofore demonstrated my
opinion more at large in the particulars to the India Court, which were too
large to relate in an Epistle.

Fourthly, why should it not be as easy and facile a matter to them at home to
make choice of their President and Council in India, as to make choice of
succeeding Captains, Masters of Ships, and Commanders at Sea by occasion of
mortality: And in my opinion the same course they take in the one, may as well
be observed in the other; and not to leave the choice of succeeding places of
eminency in India, to their servants own choice, where greatness of power,
hopes of favor and private respects, will cause servants to vote one for
another, though to the great prejudice of their Honorable Imployers, and the
ruin of honest men in India, who are conscionable in their duties to God and
to their Masters, whereby much disaster has befallen in the Companies
affairs, by the juglings and defraudments of deceitful persons in chiefest
places of eminency, and intolerable wrongs done even to their equals, for not
running the same course, or not conniving thereat, as this plain Declaration
will in part manifest. And its worthy the consideration of the Honorable
Company, to endeavor its reformation. For a wicked President, and his packed
main part of Council, can easily in India make malicious show of great crimes
fained to be committed, against an honest man, and to arraigne him, condemn
him to prison, suspend the salary, and ship him home a delinquent, before ever
he make his purgation to the Court at home, and so he and all his are in
possibility to be ruined unjustly. For it is no small matter of moment,
considering the multitude of dangerous disasters that depend thereon, whereof
for fear of discouragement to any undertaker in those adventurous employments,
I forbear the relation, which I could manifest of dangerous consequence both
at Sea and Land, for a man to make a long dangerous voyage to India, and
without just cause to be dismissed from his fair fortunes to seek redress in
partial unjust India Courts at home, where corrupt Governors and Courts when
they have voted the innocence of the party abused, and promised restitution of
wrongs, shall yet unconscionahly for by respects, recall their former votes,
and plead in the defense of the malignant parties. It Is not for the
accommodation of the honorable action of commerce to question the Presidents
power and authority, but rather to defend it, (though never so wicked a
tyrant;) nor for the honor of India Courts to be curious Inquisitors into the
Presidents actions, (be they never so impious, fraudulent, or oppressfull.) And
so long as such corrupt Courts at home are not reformed, it were better for an
honest man so abused, to hang himself (were it not for the danger of his
soul) then to undergo such wicked censures at home. In those India elections
it is good to make choice of pious Ministers, both for residency in India, and
aboard your Shipping. The choice of lewd men of that worthy function, has done
much hurt among your servants by their evil example, surpassing others in
those lewd consuming sins of soul, body, and estate, Alea, Vina, Venus: Some
of which have dishonored God, their nation and profession in a high degree, and
made no conscience to leave their spurious bastards in India, to be bred up in
Paganism, and at ripe years to be had in esteem in regard of their
whiteness, by a lewd Christian bawd, to make a common harlot of.

Fifthly, it seems strange to me, that a government in India by a President and
Council, should be established by a private Commission never seen to any in my
time (or before or since) but to the President himself, who under color of
that power and authority, rules as a Tyrant, according to his own wicked
disposition, Hoc volo, hoc jubeo; which whosoever shall question, is in danger
ipso facto to be arraigned for his life as a trayter or mutiner: who having by
usurpation crept into the place of Presidency, makes choice of three more of
Council, whom he pleases, which he proudly calls ( His Council,) like
ambitious Cardinal Wolsey (Ego and Rex meus) And if but one of them stick
close to him, whom he will be sure shall be a son of Belial fit for his
purpose: then in regard of his double voycc, he carries all consultations or
acts of Court which way he pleases, against the other two, and they also must
in the end of necessity comply, or else their own ruin shall shortly be
effected. Therefore in my simple opinion, it were more just, that lesser power
were in the President, and more in the Council (as I hear it is since lately
somewhat amended in that point, upon my complaint and abuse done unto me by
such Wild government. And me thinks it were not amiss that the Presidents and
Councels Commission, were at least once a year read at a public Assembly,
both to Merchants and Seamen, that all men may know how to render due
obedience to superiors, nor the superiors to Lord it too much over their
inferiors. And also why should not hereto be added good Laws and Ordinances
for directions on both sides, how to behave themselves in their duties to God,
their loyalty to their Sovereign, the welfare of their honorable imployers,
and the peace, tranquillity, and love one toward another; which I leave to
your Honors and Worships considerations.

I may not let pass one thing, which I conceive has been a curse to your
worthy design, and caused no small disaster to betide to the Honorable action
of Commerce, and that is a crying sin of parents, wives, children and friends
of your deceased and dead servants in India, by abusive wrong done to the
estates of the defunct three sever all ways: The first is in regard of their
bonds and covenants formally yielded unto, which never any have kept, nor ever
any will observe: and because they will keep close their private trade with all
the secrecy they can, they never keep Merchant-like accounts for fear of being
seized upon by some malicious, tyrannous, or malevolent President, or others in
authority, if they chance to do or say any thing that displeases them, so that
in stead of formal fair accounts, they kept their reckonings in loose papers
in their pockets, or bid in some private place, which at the end of every
voyage out and home to any Port in India, they lacerate and dismember in
pieces, trusting in their Banjan Brokers to be masters of their Warehouses, or
keepers of their goods and moneys. And if any of these servants die, (being
loath to commit trust to their own contrymen,) the Banjan defrauds their
Executors of all or greatest part of their estates, and so perhaps if they
trust some supposed friend their Contrymen, they do the like; or else
wanting time in their extremity of sickness, cannot give their friend true
information: And if they do, peradventure the Banjan and the supposed friend
agree together and divide the estate into shares between them. The second is,
that if the President, or some authorized by him, find out any estate of the
deceased, the goods are sold at an outcry, and the moneys brought into the
Companies Cash, for the benefit of the Executors. But the abuse therein is
insupportable, as formerly in India Courts at home. For two or three, or more,
will covenant together to buy them at under-rates, either by selling them by
the lump in great parcels, that the meaner Merchant has not means to pay for
them; or if divided, the greater and more able persons, will threaten the
underlings to sit on their skirts, or to do them some mischief, if by bidding
a higher price then they, they seek to buy them out of their hands: And this I
have seen with my own eyes (with grief,) but being a prisoner, could not
prevent the mischief to the defunct, which otherwise I would have endeavored
to have remedied. The third abuse to the deceased servants estate, is acted by
the Court Committees at home, and that is by defrauding the Executors of the
deceased of the benefit of the exchange for their moneys brought into the Cash
in India, which in my time was double money at home: for if any man bought of
the deceaseds estate in India, and did not there make speedy payment, his
covenant was to pay double money out of the salary at home, or otherwise as
agreed upon: and my self have paid such exchange of double moneys abated out
of my salary at home by the India Court, even for things bought, charitably to
give away to poor men, having lost all their goods and necessaries in a ship
fiered by Portugals, which for want of money, being a prisoner, and all my
estate seized upon, I was contented to yield unto (as other men did,) rather
then not to express a charitable affection to the indigent, according to my
poor ability, or credit. Now the India Court think that they supererrogate in
their charity, to pay the Executors of the defunct the principal, brought to
their accounts in India, (though they make three, four or five for one or more
of their servants moneys;) and yet by that time the accounts are cleared, which
happily may be six or twelve months, or longer time after the deceased have
repaired from the remoter or furthest parts of the Kingdom, to seek after
their deceased estate, sometimes (nay I doubt often) they have been forced to
depart home, after great expense and charge, by waiting the Courts time to
clear the accounts, with little or nothing, perhaps not enough to bear their
charges down again. In some particulars of other men's, I could give bewailing
intelligence of these passages; but I will instance only in my own being
living: then if the abuse be so great to the living, much more may the
Executors of the deceased feel the burden of these intolerable defraudments.
My self being eminent in India, and one of Council, being maliciously
arraigned for a delinquent, (as the ensuing story will relate) had my goods
seized upon, and sold, volens nolens, before my face, at 40. per cent. l^sse of
the principal, revengefully acted on purpose to make me a Bankrupt; (which
maugre the Presidents Devilish malice, could not be effected) though he and
his lewd favorite, notwithstanding their massy estates of twenty or thirty
thousand pounds a man fraudulently gotten in India within six years time, or
less, after their return from England, with all the super abundant favor the
India Court could bestow upon them; yet were forced to take sanctuary in the
Kings Bench and Fleet; and there, but for the tenor of a Statute of Bankrupts
against them, would have defrauded their creditors also at home, (which brought
them perforce to an under composition.) Again, my estate being seized upon, as
before mentioned, among other goods I had two great and large fair Persia
Carpets, fit for the Footstool, or Chair of State of a Christian Prince,
which would have covered the pavement or floor of about twenty foot square, or
more, and cost me in Persia the first penny, about forty pounds. These it
seems the ambitious President took for his own use, to the honor of his
magnificencie, and never brought them, or their proceed, to the Companies
account. For which demanding restitution, he put me off to the India Court,
affirming that at his coming from India, be left them (for their use) in the
Custom house at Surrat, and the Court denies to give me any satisfaction for
them, alleging that they were never brought to their account, and therefore
not able to make them good, though the unjust Governor had voted before in
Court, in favor of the juggling President, their mere hireling juggling servant,
against their loyal brother servant, that it was not for the accommodation of
their action of commerce, to wave or question their Presidents power and
authority, but to support and maintain it; neithor for the honor of the India
Court to be curious inquisitors into their Presidents actions; which is so
horrible and detestable an ignominy to the honor of the India Society to
defend, that that Honorable action of Commerce, could not be supported, but by
fraud, oppression, tyranny, imprisonment, bonds, and the like, and murder too,
if occasion so fell out: And so far these Governors are from accusing
consciences in such practices, that they take it to be an honor for them so to
do. But I have not yet done, I must further instance in more particulars in my
own behalf. At my departure from India, (a prisoner) I left in the hands of a
succeeding President, a Trunk of rich apparel, good books, Divine and
History, and other necessaries, which at an easy rate I valued at fourscore
pound; and had I staid in India, would not have taken half as much more money
for them. And these goods it seems were sold at an outcry (according to my
former relation of such practices) for 32 l. and no account to be given to whom
they were sold, nor any particular of any thing how sold, but all in lump at 32
l. which money being brought into the Companies Cash, and three or four years
after coming to account with the Court, they were so far dishonest, as not
only to deny me the exchange for my money, but also to keep back the
principal, being part of 1200. l. they are yet indebted unto me. Yet once
more: My wife sent me out of England, a Token (to me of great esteem) viz. her
own and all her three childrens pictures in one fair Map, or Table, to the full
proportion of every one. That honest well reputed Gentleman of the India Court,
and my especial kind friend, Captain James Slade, took upon him to bring it
(by Gods blessing) in safety to my possession: But before his arrival, I was
shipped home unjustly (a malefactor.) At the arrival of the Fleet in India,
whereof Captain Slade was Admiral in the ship Discovery. Great enquiry was
made by the present President, for things of rarity, to be bought and bestowed
upon the Sultan, or Govervour of Surrat: but in all the Fleet, none was found
of greater esteem, then my wife and childrens pictures; which the President
having intelligence of, sent to Captain Slade, to bring the same aboard the
ship Charles, chief Admiral in the Port, to be viewed there by President and
Council. At which consultation it was decreed, that my pictures should be
bought at good valuable rate, and to have credit for the same in the Companies
books of accounts. And so the pictures were detained aboard the Charles, till
order could be taken for their safe transport to Surrat. But the next day the
ship Charles being fired by shooting of Guns at drunken healths (a detestable
abuse and damage to the honorable Company) the ship and all things within her,
were burnt, and my pictures consumed. At the India Court (upon intelligence and
certificate under Captain Slades hand, and his brothers, Mr. William Slade,
Purser of the ship, and also of Mr. Nathanael Mountney, second of Council to
the President) I demanded restitution for my wife and childrens pictures, and
tokens; but most dishonestly denied, saying, that in regard they were burnt,
they were not liable to make them good unto me. These abuses are, as I am able
to prove, to my damage 500. l. And if such persons expect honor for acting
and supporting fraud, robbery, envy, malice, and cruel oppression, to the
ruin of a whole Family, one of their own Corporation, and living, what can be
expected but far worse from them to the dead (mere hirelings, no way alied by
Corporation, Adventure, or otherwise among them.) But surely, if I be not
partial in my own cause, I conceive they merit such honor as Haman had for
intending the ruin of a whole Nation, yet strangers in blood and religion unto
him.

There be many other things besides these mentioned at present, that require
your Honors, etc. reformation (if you expect a blessing from God upon your
adventures, which may well be conceived that such abuses and crying sins have
hitherto brought a curse upon that so worthy honorable action of Commerce) and
upon examination will be brought to light; as this for one more; The India
President usurps the power to fine men at his pleasure for delinquency, as he
pleases maliciously to conceive against any: and those whom he envies and
malignes, shall have heavy fines set upon them, which he knows the Court at
home will not remit, having their estates in possession: for all is fish that
comes to their net, unless in favor to a Minion, or some chief in Court. And
this cost an eminent Merchant in India, and at present in London, 500. l.
though he brought certificates out of India to clear him from all aspersion
cast upon him, (and to try a suit in Law with them, is to no purpose, for they
boast they will be too mighty for any to withstand them, having a common rich
purse against a private poor one, to manage their unjust designs.) Likewise,
if the offender be his favorite, or has a good purse to bribe, his Fine shall
be made easy to prevent a heavier punishment at home, (as unconscionable to be
questioned or arriagned twice for one thing, censure being formerly past upon
him.) I could instance somewhat in this point in the case of life and death, but
I am more charitably minded then to cast aspersion upon any, having undergone
(at least) a formal trial for his life.

One thing more, right honorable, etc. be pleased to give me leave to admonish
you of, Your honorable action of Commerce is like in time to suffer much, if
you follow not the example of the Portugals, Dutch, and Danes, by strenthening
your selves by some accommodable plantation near India, both for a refuge for
your shipping, and strengthening thereof; and also to fetch off your servants
in India, upon wrong offered them by tyrannical heathenish Moors: A taste
whereof you have had heretofore by imprisoning your chief and all other
servants, and threatened with drubbing and chawbucking, and your Christian
adversaries in that action will (for want thereof) dominier too much over you:
And the best place for you to settle a plantation, is (in my conceit) at
Madagascar, where if you set not foot in speedily, others of our nation, who
(by report) have made entrance thereinto, may peradventure defeat you, and
wring your charter from you for your neglect to the good of this Republic.
This business I leave to your wiser considerations, and to such encouragements
in that business, as lately I have in my weak capacity, conceived behoovefull,
which may peradventure hereafter (if not with this) come out in print to the
public view.

Yet I may not omit to put you in mind, that you make better choice of your
Governors and Court Committees at home, and that (good part or greater at
least) out of men well qualified, and of good report, bred up in India, rather
then Shopkeepers, or ignorant Merchants, some of which were never further at
Sea, then aboard your brave ships in the Downs a feasting. For though some such
men may be virtuous and well qualified for their breeding, and by long
continuance in their places of Committee, have gotten good experience, yet they
have only the theorick, and are too short in the pracktick, and both are
necessary, as by enlargement I could give better testimony. I conceive some men
may object, I say thus much to insinuate my self, to get into place of
Committee; which I am so far from the thought or desire, that I should more
willingly accept of a poor pension from the Company, or to be an Alms-man in
their Hospital at Blackwall, which I am able to prove I have well deserved,
even for my good endeavors to that charitable work.

Thus, right Honorable, right Worshipful, and others, a faithful loving
member of your worthy Corporation, being ruined in estate, by partial,
uncharitable, unjust, corrupt Governors, and time-serving Committees in your
India Courts, and being at present, lame, inmpotent, diseased, and in a manner
bed-ridden, and already half in his grave, yet has indevoured, not without
great pain, to manifest his zealous affection to your Honors, etc. welfare and
indemnity, which he has been the rather induced unto, being deprived of all
means to do you service in India, as a servant or friendly accommodation upon
his own adventure (wherein his duty as a member of the Company, should not have
been wanting.

To which employment my affection has been so addicted, as I think never any
man's that was banished his native country, has been m^re desirous to return
thither again, then mine has to revisit India: But now having lost all my
fortunes, hopes and limbs, and ready for the grave, (when God shall be pleased
to fit me for my dissolution) I humbly entreat your Honors, etc. to accept of
my honest, loyal affectionate intents, (in this tedious Epistle, though I want
not matter to enlarge to a far greater volume,) in as good part as it is
presented unto you. And if it please your Honors, etc. out of your grace and
goodness, to take into consideration the distressed estate of your true,
loyal servant, so much abused, wronged, aad oppressed, abroad and at home, to
cause restitution for the same, from your Honors, etc. substitutes and
servants, the chief delinquents, wrongers and oppressors, or out of the
general stock, as to your Honors, etc. shall seem most agreeable to justice,
charity, and repute of the honorable India Corporation (which is the most
humble petition of your late industrious loyal Servant, I doubt not but
thereby you shall do a business pleasing to God, acceptable to the Honorable
high Court of Parliament, (to ease them in righting private men's wrongs, to the
better furtherance of the weighty affairs of the Republic, more considerable:)
For which your Honors, etc. most humble impotent Petitioner, and all his
distressed Family, shall ever pray for your Honors, etc. temporal and
eternal felicity.

Richard Boothby,

This Title should have been placed immediately after the names of the Referrees
in the second page following, but mistaken by the Printer.

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL AND WORSHIPFUL SIR Henry Row, Sir Job Harby, and Sir
George Clarke, Knights: Thomas Keightly, Daniel Harvey, and Robert Grimes,
Esquires, Referrees appointed by his Majesty King Charles, to end the
controversies between the India Court and Richard Boothby and his India
adversaries, servants to the Honorable East India Company, according to
Petition for his Majesty's grace and favor therein.

A true Declaration of the Wrongs done to RICHARD BOOTHBY Merchant in India.
THe unhappy project of Sir William Cockam Knight, about Anno 1615. to wring
the Charter of the most famous Right Worshipful Company of Merchants
Adventurers of England out of their power, to the advantage of him and his
Associates, brought much disaster to the Commonwealth, to that worthy Company,
and to my self in particular a member thereof also in high degree: (though in
the end returned to the said Companies credit, and his blame and discredit)
whereupon I Richard Boothby, a Member of that Company, was forced to search out
Trade in other Countries wherein I had no experience (to my great loss and
disadvantage) and among the diversity of many experiments, fell to make trial
of the East India Adventures, purchasing my freedom thereof at 50 l. And
adventuring 2400 l. in that Action of Commerce, which being unmerchantly
handled by injuditious partial Governors (aiming more at their own particulars
then the Vulgar Accommodation, brought great loss and damage to the Worthy
Adventurers, and to my self in particular, the occasion whereof drew me (being
unwilling to proceed further in my Vocation of an Adventurer thither, or to
other parts, for fear of sliding into the condition of a Banckerupt or
insolvent (which I did much abhor) to tender my service to the India Court
Committees to be employed in the Honorable Companies affairs into India where
I was accepted of, and entertained with the greatest applause and best
accommodations of any before me. At my arrival in India (being one of
Council) I endeavored to discharge a good conscience toward God, and the
duty of a loyal Subject to my Sovereign King Charles, and the trust committed
to me by the Honorable Company their Substitutes.

But ere I had been there many Months, I took good notice of the great
dishonor done to Gods glory by the lewd lives and conversations of all the
English in general, and the chief heads in particular; the dishonor also
therein to my gracious King and native Country, and the deep juglings and
impostures of the President Rich: Wild, and George Page of the Council: to the
defraudment of their Honorable Imployers, which first brought me in envy and
bad suspicion of a Spy, a Puritan, and Informer, (and so called) because I did
not run in the same excess of riot with them.

And by little and little drew me on (endeavoring to reform such abuses
according to Injunction given me at home by Court Committees) to be wickedly
maligned and abused with intolerable wrongs, injurious affronts, and cruel
oppressions; As being one of Council commanded to base inferior employments
almost scornful to an Apprentice, especially of three or four years standing
(the Banjans in India taking notice thereof to my condolement) also to attend
the Custom House affairs on the Sabbath days (offensive to my conscience, and
the more by observation that the Moors would not attend those affairs upon
their heathenish Idolaters Holy days, whilst the (virtuous or rather) wicked
President Rich. Wild, and his lewd Favorite George Page feasted, and drunk
themselves drunk with Dutch, French, Italians, Arminians, etc. And that by
reason I was an eyesore and offense unto them, distasting and yielding mild
reproof unto their Bachanalian Sabbath-breakings, and lewd discourse, and
boastings at such times of their licentious lives and conversations, little
inferior (as I conceive) to the Earl of Castle-havens. Then diverse plots were
machinated to expel me the factory of Surrat to some remote place for their
more freedom in evil.

And first, they plotted and concluded I should be sent Agent to the Court at
Agra (1000 miles off by land) but that plot would not fit, in regard the
Council had lately dissolved that employment as unnecessary and too chargeable.

Secondly, they plotted to send me to the most uncouth forlorn and contemptible
Factory in India ( Brodera) for which many young men had been suitors (fitter
for that employment) and they had promised that preferment. But thither (
volens, uolens) I must go, yet being of Council I excepted against that Act of
consultation, making short protest in writing in the book under the Act as
prejudicial to the Honorable Corporation, and injurious to my self, having
convenanted for my residence at Surrat, and no other; yet yielded and took that
charge upon me, though as my second told me before my departure thither, my
Adversaries had suborned him to lay traps to ensnare me, and to be very
circumspect to observe all my actions to get matter against me. But if he could
find none, to write to President and Council, that I was of such a quarrelsome
and contentious a disposition, that it was not possible for him or any to live
with me; for which they promised him the preferment into that place. But (he as
he said) being touched in conscience to see me so much abused, could not but
reveal it unto me upon my promise of secrecy.

And a day before my departure, George Page, notwithstanding his said wicked
plot, with my second to betray me, insinuated himself into sudden familiarity
with me, excusing himself for having an hand to put me out of the Factory at
Surrat to be sent to Brodera, laying all the malice on Richard Wild the
President; And to make me more blind then a Beetle, or sencelesly ignorant of
the plot, would needs bestow upon me a Machivile Brile or poisoned Piscash,
like the traitorous kiss of Judas to our Savior Christ, (which was a new
Velvet Belt with fair silver Buckles) I made fair show of complement with
him, and accepted of his Piscash or gift, rather then to show distaste, or to
give any notice that I had any intelligence of the plot against me, by
discovering the secret imparted unto me by my second to his detriment.
Moreover, the malicious Machivill President when I came to take my farewell of
him gave it me for a great charge, (for no other at that time was given me) in
the Honorable Companies affairs, nor other Instructions for my employment.
(Copies of former Accounts and passages (which by order from that Court at home
ought to be left in every Factory for direction to successors) nor any Moneys,
Bills, Bills of Exchange, or credit to manage those affairs (until a day or two
after my departure) to be careful, and carry a strict hand over William Price
my Second, to reclaim him from his lewd, uncivil, and rude behavior. Thus
they that lay snares to trap the innocent, in the end are themselves ensnared.
The Geese had need to be warned when the Fox preaches, And this text of
Scripture was far out of his remembrance, or would take no knowledge thereof:
Thou art inexcusable O man, whatsoever thou art that judge, for wherein thou
judge another thou condemnest thy self: for thou that judge do do the
same things. Romans 2.

Thirdly, being arrived there, they plotted how to ensnare me in their
Commissions, devising to send me two Commissions, the one as contrary to the
other as black to white; the one an express command of our Musters, the other
quite contrary of their own: to which of our Musters because I leaned in my
Responce, and declined from theirs (in words though not in deeds) they then
upbraided me with base reproachful letters, commanding me not to make reply to
their revilings, I knew no such power an Indian President had (his Commission
being never made known) to any though of Council, and my self one of Council
as deep in Commission as President himself (only in a double or casting voice)
deemed it as a great wrong to all the Companies servants in general, and a
great indignity to my self in particular, not to make responce thereunto which
I performed in my own Apology or defense, yet concluded Christianly, desiring
unity and peace, etc.

Fourthly, my reply seconded with a Journey made to visit Amadavad the greatest
City in India (two days journey off) wanting employment, until such time as I
could be fitted to observe their express Commission contrary to our Muster,
and returned within six days; little dreaming that a brother of the Company,
and one of Council in India, was in condition of a slave, or Schoolboy, that
might not take lawful recreation, or travel a little to better his
experience, without leave obtained from such Imperial Majesty, therefore these
acts were made mutinous, and I condemned by their censures in malicious
consultation, before I came to make answer to any objection against me; and
thereupon (about a months time after my first entrance into that service) was
commanded to return to Surrat, to undergo more revengefull condemnation; to
which I obeyed (though in a most irksome time of the year for travel, in
times of rain not usual for any to travel in.)

Fifthly, at my arrival at Surrat, I was presently put out of my chamber, and
thrust into the worst lodging in the house, adjoining to the Porters lodge,
commanded to take my diet at the second table, among Counting House Scrivans,
Pursers, Mates, and Cabbin-boyes taken ashore for inferior services, and they
commanded to take place at table above me, whose parents, or themselves, if I
had been ambitious or malicious, I would have Job says, With the dogs of my
flock, Job 30
scorned with Job, to have set with the Heardsmen of my flock, having at home
at that present, a family living in reputation, and having had men of better
quality then the best of them, I mean the chief, to wait at home upon my
Trencher, Knights, Gentlemen, and Citizens, some of the best quality in
England, and my self an Esquire by two offices to two several famous Kings,
King James and King Charles, under the Broad Seal of England. And the best of
them, even President himself, never of ability to keep house or servant, but
of lewd condition, base runnagates, bankrupts, or insolvents.

Sixthly, this did not yet suffice, but they proceeded to seize upon all my
estate, books, and papers, proclaiming me a bankrupt, forcing my Creditors for
debts not above a month old, to bring in my Bills to the President, and to take
new Bills of his in the Companies name, on purpose to discredit me, selling
such goods as I had upon my hands, at forty pounds in the hundred less then
they cost me, forcing me to pay other men's debts to a greater value then I had
subscribed for security with interest, thereby to make me insolvent; which
maugre their malice, they could not do; but I satisfied all men to the full,
with interest, to a pice, (or farthing) which they have not done since that
time, though of twenty or thirty thousand pounds estate fraudulently accrewed.

Seventhly, then having penned seven most malicious, childish, foolish Articles
against me, they proceeded to my arraignment before a Senate of Cabbin-boyes and
Scrivans, as before, patched up to make up a solemn judicious Parliament, most
despitefully forcing me to stand at the lower end of two long Tables joined
together, bare-headed, having my malicious adversaries to be my accusers, Jury,
and Judges; where all being moved, I demanded by what power and authority the
President so shamefully abused me: to which he made response, he had commission
strong enough to bear him out: the commission I required to see, or to hear
read; which he denied, saying, That yet never any saw it but the President
himself in present possession, nor any should. I again replied, That I did not
conceive that his Majesty of England would grant any Dormant Commission to
countenance tyranny and usurpation: And that my self being of Council, ought
to be made acquainted therewith, being as great in Commission as he, except in
a casting voice, and therefore again required him to produce his Commission,
not only to my satisfaction, but to all other his Majesty's subjects in those
parts: but he still continued ambitiously and tyrannically obstinate, until at
length John Skilebow, on of Council (whom the President kept under as a slave,
knowing how to bring him to his bow at any time with a bottle of Sack, for
which he would even sell himself as Esau his Birth right for a mess of
pottage, yet at that time was bold to second my just demand, alleging that he
conceived that not only the Council, but all others ought to be acquainted
with the Commission, which from himself also was kept in secret two years since
he had been in India, ordained by the Court at home for Second of Council to
Mr. Thomas Kerridge the former President, and to succeed him in place of
Presidency. But Wild having as it seems matter enough against Kirridge to
disgrace him at home, and of a haughty daring spirit, he durst do no other but
settle Wild in his usurped Presidency, and displace Skylebow contrary to the
Courts Ordinance, which in the end caused him to produce the Commission, giving
the Register order to read it, which was to this effect, authorizing President
and Council to call notorious offenders to account, and in case of Murder,
Buggery, or such heinous crimes to arraigne them for their lives; but with this
proviso, that his Majesty did conceive that men attaining to those places of
authority in India, might be ignorant of the just Laws of England, and
therefore cautiously advised them rather to incline to lenity and charity: for
if otherwise they did wrong or abuse his loving subjects, he would exact a
severe account of them, and punish them according to their desert. The
Commission being so pious and gracious, I willingly did submit to the
arraignment. The Articles propounded, I desired a Copy to give answer in
writing; which with much ado in the end I obtained, and gave such response
thereunto, as made nothing for their advantage. Yet not with that satisfied,
they devised nine more childish, foolish, and most malicious Articles against
me, and upon a second arraignment commanded me to take oath ( ex officio) to
answer to such Articles verbatim, or ex temtempore, as they should be
propounded against me, which I refused to do, but desired to have a copy, and
time to make reply; which would not be granted. Then to enforce me thereunto,
they threatened me with torture and death, to be hanged upon a Gallows of an
extraordinary height at the Sea port, before the Christian ships lying there at
anchor. Thus terrified with menaces, dreading their devilish, malicious,
revengefull spirits, and knowing my self innocent of any crime they might
justly charge me withal, I took the Oath: and the Articles being propounded,
were either Matchivily penned, to draw from me what I knew of their juglings
and impostures, the better by fraud to clear themselves therefrom, or
maliciously to draw strong accusations against my self, as which
notwithstanding were nothing to their purpose of defense, but more to their
condemnation; and though I entreated and charged the Register to pen my
response truly, yet he made answer with the Presidents approbation, that he
would therein fulfill my request, but follows the Presidents order and
command. By these last Articles, they wrung from me some accusation against
themselves, which did stumble them, (supposing my ignorance of their
impostures;) yet having now got the knowledge thereof, they dissolved that
Court, and fell to consult in their Cabinet-councell, how to clear themselves,
and to make me a malicious slanderer, which within or about fourteen days
after they effected, as they supposed, to have made their black deeds as
clear, or white, as snow, and their midnight juglings clear from aspersion,
as the Sun in his bright luster at noon day; and that by making two of their
Christian brethren, (the Companies servants) to forswear themselves
point blank against a known truth both to my self and others the Companies
servants, which thing I was much grieved at for the offense to God, and wrong
to their own consciences: yet I laughed in my sleeve (even in the midst of
affliction) to see how they were intrapped in their own snare, having
sufficient proofs against them to the contrary, which for fear of causing
mischief unto them (who were adjutors also in the juggling) and by themselves
revealed unto me, I did conceal to more sit opportunity, at which time they
were enforced by appearance of truth on my side, to confess their wicked
imposture and unparalleld juggling act of consultation to clear themselves from
all aspersion of such future act; and yet ere three days were expired (as I
take it) they committed the same again to the detriment of the honorable
Corporation and their own gain, many hundred if not thousand pounds, besides
the hazard of the Companies great estate, and the danger of their servants
lives. Now all things fitted in their conceits to the purpose, they thought it
due time to proceed in sentence against me. And first toexpresse their
malicious revenge in a high degree, they bestowed upon me odious titles of
ignominy, as Puritan, dissembling Hypocrite, brazen faced Knave, base Villain,
perjured Rogue and Rascal: and their most unjust, cruel, revengefull sentence
was, that I should be dismissed my imploymeut, my salary suspended, kept a close
prisoner in the English House, clapped in Irons, lodged in a dungeon, and fed
with the bread of affliction, and at the departure of the next Fleet for
England, shipped home a prisoner. All which and more was injuriously inflicted
upon me: I was that evening sent to my dungeon, and at the door a mighty pair
of Bilbowes set, ten or twelve foot long, to fasten me in the Iron Stocks; but
my Dungeon not being six foot square, would not admit their entrance: yet
terrified with thought of my misery approaching, I entreated the Steward of the
House, (being pensive of my wrongs, and appointed to fasten me in Irons) to
forbear until the next day, for that I intended to write a submissive letter
to a tyrant President, to ease me of that shame and torture; which he
charitably yielded unto: and for his neglect had my Bilbowes clapped upon his
heels. But after some hours of indurance, were by petition of friends
released, and the Purser of the house sent to fetter me in shackles; which was
performed, and a cruel Jailer (a son of Belial, John Willowby) set to watch
me, that no English, Christian, or Heathen, should come near me, or converse
with me; yet my two loving trusty Indian Peoons, or servants, would not forsake
me, though I had not a penny to pay them for their pains, or to provide bread
for my self; yet in the end ten pence English per day way allowed for all our
maintenance, with command not to pay above a days pension at a time, and that
neither, unless every day sued for. Thus a close prisoner I continued six
months, though after some reasonable time eased first of my Irons, and after
of my Dungeon, to somewhat a better lodging; and that out of an accusing and
condemning conscience of their own, setting my friendly Banjans to persuade me
to write him submissive Epistles, which should tend to reconciliation; which
three times at their persuasion I performed, and by the first I obtained a
releasment from Irons; by the second, a lodging somewhat better then my
Dungeon; and by the third, freedom of the walks in the house, and diet at the
second Table, as formerly related: By a fourth, which they pressed me unto,
though with much unwillingnesse in regard I had been three times deluded upon
their words, that a reconciliation should be, and I restored to former place,
or better, they protested by their Heathen gods, that he had faithfully
promised before, and now more assuredly in their conceit; and that if he did
not perform his promise unto them, he was a Devil and no man. These earnest
persuasions prevailed with me, and I indeed writ a fourth submissive Epistle,
and the effects that produced, was to be commanded aboard the ship Jonah a
prisoner in a meaner Cabin then Boatswaines Mates, to sail along with the
Fleet for Persia, and at their return to sail therein for England.

The Banjans admired at the wickedness of the man in the forepassed business
(and that which ensued) about a month before at the return of the ship Jonah
from Bantam, having in her great store of Cloves, which six months before were
a Drug of no esteem at Surrat; yet at the instant of her arrival, inhansed in
price to double money and more: My friendly Banjans, who ever gave me more
respect then I deserved, came to me (having then liberty of the House) to
express their loving and kind respects, and for proof thereof, because the
Wild President had forced them (as formerly related) to bring in my Bills, and
take new of him, which they disclaimed to be their act (so much as in thought)
but merely his Devilish malice and revenge, they tendered me a means how to
get many thousand pounds suddenly in a week or fortnights space, or a very
short time, which though at first I was somewhat jealous of, yet hearkened to
their propositions, which was to buy up presently all the Cloves in the ship
Jonah, at the price current then a ship-boord, and they would sell them again
for me at fifty or sixty, or more per cent. profit. At which their offer I was
the more jealous and danted, knowing my inability to compass the business
both in regard of ready moneys which must be paid for them, and also in regard
I was a prisoner, and could not stir abroad to effect their proposition, but to
both these impediments they applied remedies: first, for money they would supply
me therewith instantly; and for want of my liberty, they advised me to write to
Captain Richard Swanly, commander of the ship, to effect it for me,
proportioning him some share for his pains; which though my adversary George
Page, the Presidents lewd favorite were gone two or three hours before down to
the ship to effect that business for himself and President, which took me
somewhat off, yet they so earnestly did press me with recounting Geooge Pages
slow moving, usually drinking hard, or to be drunk at the halfe-way Tree (a
baiting place) and there to take a nap of an hour, two or three in sleep, that
my letters might come aboard before him: which counsel of theirs I followed,
and presently sent one of my trusty Peoons away with letters in speed to
Captain Swanly, discovering the fair offer of my friendly Banjans, and
allotting half for his share; which letters came aboard two hours before my
adversary George Page. But Captain Swanly danted with my sudden downful, since
his departure six months before, and terrified with threats of President to
displace him for that he had before taken part with other Sea Commanders in
consultation about their Commission, which were most strong and effectual, and
those Commanders gone for England, and not ready to back him again, he durst
not attempt the business, but let it fall to the benefit of his and my
adversaries, and our loss to many thousand pounds, which my friendly Banjans
were sorry for, and cursed his Devilish malicious projects against me, as yet
ensues.

The revengefull President finding that I had more credit, being a prisoner,
then himself with all the Companies credit pined upon his back, (for just at
this instant he having engaged himself for the Company with the usurers about
100000. l.) and the English ships not arriving so soon as was expected, his
Creditors made means to the Governor, that he should not stir out of the Town
until better satisfaction were given to discharge his credit in the Country;
and in that interim twice endeavoring to go aboard the ship Jonah, was
commanded to return, and not to stir aboard. And now having commanded me a
prisoner into Persia, in hope as expectation was, of a great Fleet of Portugals
to lay way and intercept us, he hoped I might either meet with a knock to take
away my life, or some other disaster might befall me, yet had another Devilish
project in the action, seeing my credit, as aforesaid, and therefore to prevent
me of all benefit or accommodation in the voyage, by procuring an Edict from
the Governor, (whose credit was repaired by the English Fleets arrival,
within three or four days after with sixty thousand pounds in gold and silver
to lessen the Companies debts) that no man should credit me upon forfeiture of
five hundred Rupies, nor no Broker procure me credit upon forfeiture of a
thousand Mamoodees. By which means my friendly Banjans, as also with fear of
drubbing from such Moorish tyrants, were taken off to my loss of some
thousands of pounds more; which many of the Companies servants of inferior rank
made to themselves in that voyage, some a thousand, some two thosand, some
three thousand or more advantage. And to add more malice and revenge, he
abused me in his letters to the Agent and Merchants in Persia, with most
egregious slanders of mutiny, contention, spy, and informer, etc. persuading
and commanding him not to let me come ashore, nor to be possessor of some small
means I had in the country left the last year, but to return it to him to
give satisfaction for my engagements to the Company, as he mendaciously
pretended. Thus we passed our voyage for Persia, my self receiving better
accommodation from Captain Swanly, then the Wild President expected, yet not
so good as the Captain promised, and had reason to perform; but that he was
overawed with my adversaries power, or doted on their great estates to his
gratification. At our arrival in Persia I kept my self aboard still a
prisoner, until from the Agent and Merchants there, I received kind letters of
invitation ashore, maugre the Presidents malicious slanderous letters, which
they regarded not, knowing and understanding better of themselves to some of
whom I was well known in England, and likewise from better report of Merchants
and Seamen that came in the ships. I courteously accepted their kind favors,
went ashore, had my accommodation for lodging second to none in the English
House, seated next the chief Agent at table, above all Sea Commanders, and
Merchants, the Admiral Capt. Weddall excepted, who sat uppermost of the one
side, and my self on the other, and the Agent at Boords end; they also
delivered me the proceed of my goods commanded to the contrary, sent me a brave
Persia Horse to ride about at my pleasure, with some Persia servants to attend
me, besides my own two Peoons, which would not forsake me until I went for
England. The Agent nor Captain Weddall (famous in that place for conquering
Ormus) never going to visit or feast with the Sultan of Gombroone, the Sultan
of Ormus, nor the Dutch, but desired my company along with them. But here,
though I have been prolix above my intent, yet not so much as my cause does
require. I cannot but condole the Honorable Companies loss as well as mine
own, for many years together by probability of many hundred thousands of
pounds, by the indiscretion of the Governor and Court at home, and the
Companies Agents in India, which in this years Fleet I will (as an eyewitness
instance in:) The Company had fonre ships of great burden, laden with Moors,
Persian and Arabian goods, and their servants priunt trade; the Dutch had four
or five great ships, and the Indians five or six India Junkes, all sailing
richly laden as for England in friendly manner together. And at their arrival
all of the goods were sold in three weeks time for ready money in good Royals
of eight, at forty, fifty, sixty, eighty, and an hundred per cent. profit and
more; and the India Company at home, had no goods at all, but moneys brought
out of England first to Surrat in India, and sent in spetie into Persia; which
money being invested at Surrat in goods, would have yielded them the same
spetie at Gombroone with the profit above mentioned, and from thence carried up
to Spahan to preserve the contract with the king of Persia; for silk would have
yielded them as much or more profit by all probability, or else those Merchants
would not have traveled fifteen hundred miles by land, to bring down ready
money to buy up all Indian commodities, which is worth the notice to be taken
of, and that Indian Government or Governors to be questioned and examined upon
the injudicious manner of managing that most famous action, or private
connivance for their own advantages. And so I leave that discourse, and return
again to my former.

In our voyage outward and homeward into India, many discourses past among us
at the Captains Mess, about my intolerable sufferings; whereat some
endeavored to blame me for not humbling my self both in word and deed, and
writing, to a tyrant for my own advantage, which they said they would have
done: To which I made reply, that I had done so much in that kind, and
prevailed nothing, that I was ashamed now of my own hand-writings in that
submissive manner, protesting never to do the like again, which they that knew
not of it before, condoled my infortunity under a tyrants power. Amongst these
discourses much question was made whether the President Richard Wild and his
favorite George Page, would take their voyage for England, or no, in the Fleet
returned from Persia; because a little before the ships arrival from England,
they gave it out that they would (being indeed danted with fear to be sent for
home for their misdemeanors, as indeed George Page was, but Richard Wild
confirmed for another year:) But at the ships going for Persia, they gave out
they would not; but I gave my verdict, as it proved, that they would, for that
I understood George Page would not go home without his Patron Richard Wild to
defend him, who also feared to let Page go before him, lest he for his own ends
might lay all his own crimes upon Wild; and Wild feared to be sent for the
next year, as he was. And therefore thought it more for his credit to go
before he was sent for: and at our arrival in India, all fell out as I had
conceived, and they ready prepared for the voyage within a month after. In our
voyage from Persia, I had framed a Protest (though ignorantly and unskilfully
penned as a thing never before acquainted with all) against the proud tyrannous
President and his lewd Counselors, for their dishonor to Gods glory, the King
and Nations repute, and the honorable Company their welfare and indemnity, and
my own insufferable wrongs, which I intended to have published presently upon
the ships arrival at Surrat. But being arrived, and before we came to anchor,
news was brought aboard of great alterations in the Factory: First, that my
malignant adversaries were prepared to take their passage for England; and
secondly, that it was determined that I should be left President, and Mr.
Skibbow to be put by that place, though in right it were his due. The first was
not strange unto me, because I did conceive their resolutions (though they made
show to the contrary) and that of purpose they had shipped me out of the way,
because I was an eyesore unto them, and they could not plot all their juggling
ends, because of my presence. The other business stumbled me, in regard that
diverse young men on shore having formerly during my imprisonment in the English
House, made their peace with me (in a fit of sickness in time of a Fever,
more likely to die then to live) excusing themselves for voting against me at
my* arraignments, pretending it was for fear of a tyrannous President to do
them a mischief, and not of any disaffection to me or my cause: and others
aboard ships desiring to be taken ashore, and preferred into service there: But
my answer to them was, That I saw no possibility of such effects, wishing them
to forbear, and to attend the issue; yet the end and purpose of this Imposture
I could not dive into: for within four or five days after our arrival,
certain propositions were made to me then and at other times by four several
men; the first by Thomas Turner, Purser of the ship Jonah; the second, by
Captain Swanly; the third, by the Secretary at Surrat; and the fourth by Padoe
Fuller Minister. These propositions tended all to one purpose, that there was a
fair way for me yet laid to make my self a fortune by staying in India, if I
would comply to the Presidents desire; and in so doing, I should succeed in
place of Presidency (old Skibbow being thought unfit in regard of his
continual drunkenness) I desired them to propound the means, and I would
endeavor to give good satisfaction: The reply of them all was this, That if I
would once more write a submissive letter to the President, acknowledging my
error, and entreating his favor, all should succeed to my hearts desire. I
gave them all thanks for their good will, yet I desired them to give me better
satisfaction what grounds they had of assurance, or possibility that in so
doing I should obtain my request; and whether the Propositions proceeded merely
from their own imaginations, or incitation of others. To which they all replied
severally (though with much seeming unwillingnesse to reveal it) that they
were put upon the business, some by George Page, and some by the President,
and some by both: Of which being now fully satisfied, I made them all alike one
answer, that I had heretofore written many such submissive Epistles at the
instance of my friendly Banjans, but was in them all deluded, and that I had
not only resolved in my self, but had vowed to some of them in our voyage to
Persia, that I nevet would write again any submissive letter, being much
ashamed to think of those formerly written. But if the President pleased to
confer with me either in public or private, I would strive to give him such
good satisfaction, as I hoped might stand with his liking and repute as well as
my own good. At which reply they seemed all to be sorry, and blamed me for
being obstinate to contemn so hopeful an opportunity to the good of me and
all mine: And so not complying with a tyrants desire, felt shortly after the
vials of their Devilish revenge; perhaps animated the more thereunto, by the
Protest I had formerly framed, and now at last published (as my conscience told
me was my duty to act, for the reasons above premised) yet to comply somewhat
fairly with him, and not to provoke him further, I sent up unto him from the
ships, such goods and moneys as I had brought from Persia, committed to my own
power by the Agent there, contrary to his Imperial command (knowing also that
it had been in vain to contest with him) and so by this means I was deprived of
all helps to furnish my self with private comfort all provisions for a full
years voyage. But praised be God therefore, though the chief of my fare in
that voyage, was the ordinary ships allowance of Beef and Pork of 3 years
powthering, and scraps of moldy Biscuit, too well replenished with Mites and
Maggots, and stinking water smelt before it came near a man's head; yet in that
long voyage I was not sick a day, nor ever refused one meals meat, though I
often wished to be set on the score (for moneys or means I had none) 5
shillings, or ten shillings a meal for such fresh provisions, Bread and Beer
as my servants enjoyed at home. And though I did comply so fairly with him to
my own misery, yet had this juggling President the conscience to defraud and
cheat me of part of those goods fitting for his ambitious magnificency, and
that was in two large Persia Carpets, usual in Persia and India with men of
quality to floor the rooms they lie or sit in; or the Princes of Christendom
in their Chairs of State; which Carpets cost me in Persia about 40 pound
English, and would have covered the floor in a room about eighteen or twenty
foot square: for excuse of his defraudment, he pleads that he left them in the
Custom house for the Companies use, and so puts me upon them for satisfaction:
and they forced me off to him, alleging they were never brought to their
account, and therefore they not liable (though they plead against me in his
defense) for the wrongs done unto me. It was not fit for them to wave or
question the Presidents power and authority, but rather to support and maintain
it. The time being now come to put to Sea for England, a day before he
delivered up his Commission to Mr. Skibbow, a warrant was directed by Skibbow,
as President, annexed with his hand, and other new Counselors, to the Admiral
of the Fleet, for my strict imprisonment at Sea, to be lodged in a very mean
Cabin, and to take my diet with the common men, and not to be permitted to go
ashore in any Country Island where we should arrive for refreshment, or
otherwise; nor in England until by express order from the Governors and
Committees of India Courts; which warrant was without any authentic authority
juglingly contrived to put off the shame from them: for Skibbow had no power to
grant such warrant, but by fear of compulsion before he was established by
Commission, and the other being in Commission, were ashamed of the act, as they
might also of all other revengefull acts. So I was now bound for England a
prisoner, to my adversaries great hopeful expectation that I should perish at
Sea for want of necessaries in so long a voyage, and so make an end of the
troubles they feared would happen unto them for their intolerable oppressions
toward me, (they having provided for themselves out of the abundance of their
ill gotten goods, twenty or thirty thousand pounds a man) by report three
hundred pound in excellent provisions of all sorts comfortable for necessity,
and superfluous to ryotous gluttony and ebriety. And now I may say farewell all
my fair hopeful Fortunes in India, second to none before me, and perhaps
transcendent to all that shall come after me, and the expectation of misery and
penury in so long, irksome, and dangerous a voyage, (but God be praised for the
prevention thereof, as formerly expressed.) At Sea the grief of my lodging
(straightened with room, and wet with rain, and nothing private neither day nor
night) I made moan to Captain Swanly, our Commander, putting him in mind of his
fair promises (notwithstanding his false warrant) and his small performances,
for better: whereat though at first he seemed to take in ill part by my
adversaries suggestions) yet in the end he better bethought himself then to
comply with tyranny against one whom he knew deserved good at his hands;
whereupon he removed me from thence, to be associate with his Mate Richard
Garlic, in the round house, as Mr. Gregory Clement, Merchant, was with him in
the great Cabin: wherein though my lodging were better, and more commendable,
yet the association with a drunken sot was as great a burden to me. But thus we
passed on to Mauritius, to spend some time there in refreshment: where I was
timorous to set foot on shore in regard of the mandate against me. But our
Captain in the end connived thereat also; and there the Admiral Captain
Weddall making a feast aboard his ship, invited all Merchants and Sea-officers
of note, my self only excepted: At which feast some well-willer to me
condoling my infortunity, alleging the feast was uncharitable and not
complete, for that I sat alone in my Cabin, wanting necessaries, which they
enjoyed to superfluous garmandizing: whereat my adversary, the late President,
began to excuse himself, and to lay all the fault upon his Minion, or
Favorite, George Page. George Page retorts it again upon him. And in fine,
with* multiplying of words and affronts one against the other (each threatening
to accuse the other of indirect dealing, juglings and defraudments of their
honorable Imployers) they fell together by they ears, and tumbled all their
delicates under foot, to the prey and great derision of the common men.

After four or five weeks spent at Mauritius, our Commanders resolved to visit
Madagascar, or St. Laurence, in hope to meet there with the English Fleet bound
that year for India, where our ViceAdmirall Captain Swanly, made a feast also,
as formerly; and the same accident, upon the same occasion of my absence,
wrought ths same effects as at Mauritius. Here having abode some short time,
with great pleasure and content, health, fertility and plenty of that place, we
met, according to our longing desire, the English Fleet, consisting of four
brave ships: That honest, judicious, generous Captain, John Morton, Commander
of the Mary, the Admiral of the Fleet, and in her that chief Commander of all
the English both at Sea and Land in the Oriental parts of the world, the
approved, beloved, judicious, generous, affable Merchant, formerly President in
India, the worshipful Thomas Rastell, and many other Merchants in the Fleet,
with commission to ship my adversaries, Richard Wild, and George Page by name,
and all other of Council (my self only excepted to succeed him in Presidency
in case of mortality home for England; which as it daunted my adversaries
(though lessened by expectation) so it much exhilerated my spirits in so sad a
condition, Mr. Rastell, Captain Morton, and all others, wondered to find me in
the Fleet, and understanding of my condition, a prisoner, much astonished them.

But having entered into examination of the cause, much condoled my
insupportable wrongs and sufferings, insomuch that it moved tears from that
kind natured Gentleman Mr. Rastell. Some few days being spent, a great feast
was ordained aboard the chief Admiral, the Mary, for the Commanders and
Merchants of both Fleets. And before that Feast, my malignant adversary,
Richard Wild, familiar with Mr. Rastell, at the entreaty of Sir Moris Abbot
himself made known unto me, made means to Mr. Rastell to make reconcilement
between us (if not punctual and perfect, yet at least formal for better
accommodation to all parties in the voyage, wishing he had given a thousand
pound he had never meddled with me. Mr. Rastell made me acquainted with his
desire, willing me to yield thereunto, which I did, provided that he did first
in person perform his part, as reason required, which at the feast he did,
drinking unto me a full cup of wine, acknowledging himself before all the
company to have done me wrong, and was sorry for it, but knew not now how to
help it. I accepted of his courtesy, and shortly after did as much to him; and
every day after our familiarity and outward friendship increased even to the
last day of our parting after at St. Helena our last port. Mr. Rastell after
this having well considered of the business, and first freed me from
imprisonment, offered me to return me again into India, to be second unto him
(for which courtesy I returned him many thanks) but I told him my mind, how
that I was resolved now to go for England, and purge my self from all crimes
that could be alleged againstme viva voce, and to lay such things to my
adversaries charge, as my duty and conscience bound me, hoping to return again
the next year with more comfort and greater credit: To which resolution he
seemed much aggrieved, vowing and protesting again with tears in his eyes,
that it was a great attractive to draw him again into India, confiding to find
me there an honest man, and of credit at home, to comfort and keep him company.
But seeing it lost labor, he demanded of me what courtesy I desired at his
hands, promising to perform it to the uttermost of his power. I then (first
giving him thanks that he had set me at liberty from imprisonment) entreating
him to give command for a good private Cabin for me, and such comfortable
refreshments of the company as the ship would afford, with the freedom or
command of Thomas Lea, a common man, and a good penman, to attend upon me, to
write such things as I conceived fit to express for fear of mortality in the
long voyage yet to come. All which he yield unto, and gave commandment to the
Admiral and Vice Admiral of our Fleet, for the performance, and to estate me
in the possession of the great Cabin solely to my lodging, as at my coming
out; which though it were irksome to Captain Swan^y at his going out, to yield
me that pre-eminence above him, yet in the end was yielded unto, only desiring
the enjoyment thereof for his reputation sake during a week or ten days longer
(the time intended for both Fleets stay together in the Harbor of Augustine
Bay in Madagascar.) But I knowing the ambitious spirits of Sea-commanders, lent
my opinion, that he being gone, his words and commands by word of mouth would
be accounted but wind, and therefore desired his warrant, or command under his
handwriting; to which he condescended, and went presently to his Closet to
frame the warrant for my accommodation in all things before mentioned, and in
especial for the great Cabin to my self, as at my coming out, adding, also
thereto, that no act of consultation in Fleet should pass during the voyage,
without my consent and approbation in chief. The English Fleet shortly after
departed for India, yet before their departure Mr. Rastell commanded the four
Sea-commanders in his Fleet each to send me aboard the ship Jonah, a Barico of
Sack about six or eight gallons a piece for my private expense and comfort in
the voyage. About six or eight days after their departure, I demanded Captain
Swanly for my accommodation in possession of the great Cabin, which he denied,
slighting Mr. Rastels command as before fore imagined; upon which some distaste
befell, and cross words found vent: And the Captain taking in ill part my
forcible demands, made complaint to the Admiral, Captain Weddall, who stuck
hard to his Vice Admiral, and in conclusion, called a consultation aboard the
Jonah, to question me about words that I had spoken, but misconstrued by C.
Swanly. At which consultation I made demand again to the Admiral to fulfill
Mr. Rastels command, as he promised faithfully to perform: But the same was
slighted by him, as before by the Vice Admiral. And then finding it fit time, I
took out of my pocket my Warrant, willing him to peruse that; which having
performed, their stomachs were abated, the Warrant being strengthened with
words of vehemence, and authority from his Majesty King Charles, substituting
him chief Commander of all the English both at Sea and Land in the Oriental
parts of the world. Then they both began to persuade and entreat me, to let the
Vice Admiral, and Mr. Greg. Clement, Cape Merchant, to enjoy the great Cabin
still, being in possession, and I should have the round house solely to my
self. To which I yielded for quietness and unity sake, and ever after lived
peaceably, contentedly, and friendly together, the Captain denying me nothing;
yea, tendering me more courtesy then I desired, or would accept of.

After three months or more abode at Madagascar, we set sail to visit Cape
Bona Esperanza; where arriving the Salvages brought us four Cowes, and some
other small refreshments, which they sold us for Iron hoopes, and pieces of
brass, and made show to bring us more speedily. But the next day two Dutch
shis coming out of Holland, laden with Soldiers for the Southern parts of
India, the Soldanians, or Upland men never came more at us; yet we had the
daily company of a few poor Sea borderers, that hung about us for relief,
such as we cast away, who feed also upon Whale, or other dead fish, lying long,
and stinking on shore* Having spent above three weeks time in expectation of
refreshment from the Natives, and seeing none came, we resolved to set sail to
Saint Helena in our way homeward: where arriving, and at our first landing, we
under-went much hazard by reason of the violence of surging waves near shore,
and in the landing we lost two Boats, and diverse men, yet some men got ashore,
not without great hazard, and diverse returned back to the ships, not daring to
adventure, as my two adversaries in chief.

Those of note that got first ashore, were Captain Weddall, Captain Swanly, Mr.
Greg. Clement, and my self: for my own part, I found great cause to give God
thanks for two great deliverances, the one in landing, the other in getting a
ship-boord again. The first that led the way, was Captain Weddall, who leaping
out of the Boat so soon as the rising waves brought the Boat to the height on
shore, and falling off again, by speedy haste, got on firm ground, and yet not
very dry: And after him followed Captain Swanly and Mr. Clement, in more
danger, the rage of the waters more and more increasing, and I my self very
timorous to adventure. But two lusty strong Sailers, (to whom, as to all the
ships company, I was much indebted for their loving respects, though I was not
able to requite their courtesies (especially in great dread by a leak ship, the
Sailers though they threatened to make the Captain and Merchants to take their
turns at the Pump, yet would free me, many offering to supply my turn at the
Pump as long as life or strength lasted in them) gave me great encouragement,
adventuring themselves into the sea some depth to catch me leaping out of the
Boat, and each taking me by the hand, we all run violently together to get out
of the fury of the returning waves, and so by Gods blessing, though washed up
above the middle, got safe on firm gronnd; where we presently saw spectacles of
great grief, two Boats with many men in them overturned with the violence of
the waves, and the men lost with the Boats, and two who striving as we had
done, to get ashore, were washed off into the Sea, and by Gods great mercy cast
ashore again by another great raging wave, and left upon the sands; which the
Mariners ashore perceiving, ran speedily unto them, catching them by the legs
ot arms, or any part of them, and so ere the surging flood returned, drew them
out of the force of the raging waves, where they lay as dead men; but it
pleased God that by the pains of the Sailers, and strong waters, that some had
about them, they in the end recovered: the one was a Salvadge, or native of
Madagascar, an ancient man, who with his son, were desirous to sail along to
visit England; and the other was a very honest man, of good worth and credit,
by name Mr. John Hammerton, yet living, and keeping a Cooks shop, and
victuallinghouse at Pye-Corner, near Smithfield. Here about forty or fifty
being gotten ashore, were put to our shifts for three days and three nights,
to get meat, for none could be landed for us from the ships, for which the
Sailers took mavelous great pains to catch lean Hogs, and Goats, with the
help of one or two Persia Greyhounds, brought whelps from thence, whereof one
was mine, did stand us in great stead; but the men wanting shoes, were so
galled with running upon rocks, that many were very lame. And so with such
poor provision, wanting bread (yet not fresh water) we spent that time, until
in the end news was brought us, that some more men were got ashore, and had
more safe landing, which we taking good notice of, made haste out of the
Island, to endeavor to get again on ship-boord. But coming to take Boat, we
found the danger as great, or greater, then in the landing; and the chief
means we had to get to our Boats, was by the help of a high steep rock, bending
hollow into the Sea, to get into the top, of which one at a time was to take
the opportunity of the fall of the Sea between the rock and the shore; and so
in that interim, to get upon the top of the rock, whither our foresaid
Captains, Mr. Clement and my self happily attained: but another young man, not
making so much haste or speed, was washed away ere he could attain the rock,
and never seen after: we sat a good while in great danger upon the rock, the
waves arising often to the very top) consulting how to get into the Boat. And
Mr. Elmer, the Master under Captain Weddall, advised the Captain to take the
opportunity of the Boats rising with the water, to leap into the Boat. But the
Captain held that way dangerous, for fear lest the Boat should hit against the
rock, and so split, and so cast away all the men in her also: and therefore he
stripping himself into his linen breeches, and getting hold of the end of a
long line from the Boat, made it fast under his arms, the men in the Boat
holding one end of the line, and we upon the rocks the other end, and ^o
leaping into the Sea, got safely into the Boat, whom the Master wisely advised
to be carried off into another Boat out from the raging of the waves, near
shore, whilst he endeavored to fetch off the rest. Which done, Captain Swanly
approved of the Masters way: and so at the rising of the Boat with the wave, to
the top of the rock, leapt into the Boat (prudently kept off from striking
against the rock) and so escaped into the other Boat. And Mr. Clement took the
next turn, and likewise got well off: my turn coming, the Master and Sailers
encouraged me to the same way, promising to stand ready to catch me with all
the help; so also I adventured, and by their great assistance, to whom I
acknowledge much thankfulness, not forgetting Gods great mercy, I also got
safe into the other Boat, and at last into the ship Jonah. But I was no sooner
off, but Mr. Clements Blackamore of India, having gotten upon the rock, was by
the violence of a great wave over-topping the rock, washed into the Sea; but he
skillful in swimming, was also by the industry of the Mariners, saved. And
thus, God be praised, we and many others got safe aboard again: but the next
day, or one or two days after, the raging of the waves, occasioned either by
wind or tide, or both, we had good passage to and again from ships to shore,
for a months time refreshing our selves in the uninhabited Island, with
Hogs, Goats, and Fish. The relation whereof I have been the more prolix,
willing to give admonition to others that shall come after, to be cautious if
they find their landing dangerous, in which Island I wish my Contrymen had a
plantation, and my self among them in so pleasant, healthful, fruitful, and
commodious a place for trading with all Nations at their return out of India,
and so invincible and impregnable, being once (though but easily fortified)
that one hundred men may easily oppose and defend themselves against one
hundred thousand, and a matter of no great charge, that I am persuaded some one
man's estate in England is able to perfect that business; to whose endeavors,
if at any time attempted, I wish all prosperous and happy success. So here,
after a merry Christmas kept, with such homely fare as the place would afford,
(it being our last place of Rendevous in this long voyage, we took our leave
one of another in both ships, until it should please God to send us safe
arrival at our desired port, our own happy native Country of England. Thus it
pleased God to send us all safe arrival together in one Fleet into England,
where finding my chief adversary Richard Wild (the usurped President) had
potent friends in Court, (the unjust Governor Sir Morris Abbot, Sir Henry
Garraway, as Mr. Rastell before had given me notice of) I yet presented my
self to the present Governor, Sir Morris Abbot in private, before I tendered my
presence in Court, submitting the redress of my wrongs in any reasonable
manner, at the feet of his pious devotion: But the best respects I could get
from him, was sharp checks before my cause was made known, with an admonition
to be cautious what accusations I laid against Richard Wild, for that (as he
told me) he was and would be his friend. Yet hoping of better welcome from the
Court-Committees, and tendering unto them a declaration of my wrongs; the Court
courteously condoled my sufferings, promised that real restitution should be
made by my adversaries, and that they would think upon it to give me a large
gratification for my good services, with tender of second employment into
India, upon better terms then before, if I would accept of it, desiring me
therewith to rest satisfied until time would better permit them to give me due
right for my injurious sufferings. Time spun out three months before this
business came to be decided* At which time my cause was turned topsie-turvy,
and that by report, (which until a year after I understood not) that Sir
Morris Abbot had received a gratification from my adversaries, of a Porters
burden of silver plate, as two witnesses yet living, offered me to verefie:
which is very probable, yet I had at that time, a better opinion of Sir Morris
Abbot, then to be bribed, though I knew my adversary was a right Matchivil in
such designs, having (by report) flung away at his departure out of India,
1500. l. in that kind, to get a good report of all of several conditions, as
English, Dutch, Moors, and Banjans, etc. the meanest of the Companies Scrivans
receiving bribing gratification of ten pound; and no small bribery given to Sea
Commanders and Officers, both to cloak his private trade, and extol his virtue
and magnificency; in all which notwithstanding he failed. At which time Sir
Morris Abbot past his vote, that it was not for the accommodation of the
honorable companies action of commerce, to wave or question the Presidents
power and authority, but rather to support and maintain it, which they would
do. Also, Sir Henry Garraway voted, that it was not for the honor of the East
India Court, to be curious inquisitors into their Presidents actions. The votes
of these potent persons in Court, stonied the indifferent and uncharitable part
of time-serving Committees, who were loath to cross them, (as some of Court in
private confessed unto me) lest they should cross them again in other matters
aimed at for their own ends, and for that my adversaries had accrewed great
estates of ill gotten goods, amounting to twenty or thirty thousand pounds a
man in five years, out of nothing, of which the King was defrauded of his due
customs, which he ought not lose, though I out of desire and hope of friendly
reconcilement, and to avoid the opprobrious imputation of a malicious Revenger,
purposely omitted timely information to possess my self of half their
estates, forfeited by the defraudments. Many Committees gaped after them to
match them, being Batchelors (though of foul infected bodies, or of one at
least) with their daughters in marriage. The Courts censure and decree, though
I petitioned to have it in writing, I was denied for seven months time, until
I had made them ashamed of so unjust an action: At which time it was penned
with all the Matchivill wit that such ungrateful and unjust malevolent persons
could devise, because I would not applaud their former open censures in my
audience; and therein not only deprived me of satisfaction for my wrongs of no
small import, but also robbed me of great part of my covenanted sallery, and
other just debts due unto me, to the value of one thousand pounds, besides the
loss of ten, twenty, or thirty thousand pounds, or more (unvaluable) by unjust
dismisment from my beneficial employment, because their wicked President, a
servant in no higher eminence then my self, except in a double voice, had
maliciously suspended it, which for masters to rectify servants abuses,
(though they could allege no cause to confirm the suspension) was to
contradict the laws of the Medes and Persians, never to be revoked. And for
the same cause, because I taxed their injurious censure, they again took from
me two hundred pound, confirmed before upon me by full decree of Court in
recompense of good service done them. Thus being much perplexed in mind, and
having some estate in their servants hands in India, which I had given order to
be paid into the Presidents hands, to clear accounts, which my revengefull
adversary had unjustly engaged me thereinto; which accounts were not cleared
until four or five years after, in regard those their servants, my factors,
finding me in disfavour with the Court at home, made use of my means, and at
length died before the accounts were cleared, to my great wrong and detriment:
I complied yet fairly with them in the mean time, petitioning them still (for
want of means to wage law with such potent adversaries, who boasted that they
would be too mighty for me) one, two, or three times a year, to reverse their
uncharitable censure*, and to pay me my due from themselves, and to cause
restitution from my adversaries, as they had formerly promised to me, and done
to a far inferior man then my self, wronged by a Sea Captain, as mighty in
Commission as their President, whom they forced to pay the Merchant (a
Runnegado Jesuit fled out of Spain, crept into the India ships, and made a
Cockswain, a Polipragmon, and busy fellow, by which means he attained to that
preferment) 200. l. for smaller wrongs done unto him; which they excused, they
had now no means of my adversaries in their possession, to force him thereunto,
though formerly they were possessed with great part of their estate, and having
fined Richard Wild at 2500 l. for misdemeanors (too little by 20000. l.) yet
by the Governor, and Sir Henry Garrawayes means, got it all remitted: So the
wicked were justified, and the innocent condemned, both which are an
abomination to the Lord. And in this interim being drawn or persuaded by diverse
in Committee, and some of their chief Officers, that if I would tender my
service again to the Court, it would be well accepted, and I recompensed to my
content in another kind. But having before made a private Protest against Sir
Morris Abbot for his unjust proceeds, I much doubted to obtain my suit: yet
importuned thereunto, I did at length tender my service by humble petition,
(not usual for men of my quality,) and thereupon, as a Committee himself told
me, the whole Court stood for me, applauding my honesty and ability to do them
service. But they all, or most part, having passed their votes for me, except
the Governor Sir Morris Abbot, who by his inveterate malice overturned all
among time-serving Committees, First confessing with them, that in his
conscience he took me to be an honest man, and for my ability he could not
except aginst it; yet if the Court would be advised by him, his opinion was, I
was not a fit man to serve them, expressing his reason, that I was a distracted
man. Indeed Solomon says, that oppression will make a wise man mad; but God be
praised for his abundant mercy, that has preserved me in my right senses,
notwithstanding the wicked endeavors of a bribed, oppressing, malicious
Governor. Behold the wisdom of the worldly wise in this matter, and in the
former: for my sallary and gratification, if I were a bad servant, how could I
deserve a large gratification for good service? And if I were a good servant,
why should I lose my covenanted sallary? But being a good servant, as approved,
and a gratification 200. l. given me, therefore by full vote of Court, as also
expressed in a Copy of Decree of the said Court, given me seven months after,
why was I then surreptuously robbed and dispoyled thereof? So also, if I were
an honest and able man to undergo the Companies employment, how was I
distracted? And if I were distracted, where was my honesty and ability?

Thus wisdom at such wisdom does but scoff,
When men do ill that good may come thereof.
Thus it is apparent, the slanders of a malicious corrupt insolvent Governor
(hateful at present to be acknowledged for good) who made no conscience of his
actions, even to defraud and cheat Widows and Orphans of their estates, as
some of my own near kindred have felt in great measure to their grief and
hinderance in preferment. The accounts at last, to my great loss, were cleared
at India, though not at home, and I again for quietness and necessities sake,
petitioned the Court for their favors, to grant me convenient passage in the
Companies ships, to seek my fortune again in another world, and in an old age
for valuable consideration, with promise to do the Company what accommodable
service lay in my power, though I did not eat their bread, nor drink their
water; but that also was denied me, for fear belike that I should descry some
of their juglings in private trade with servants, or should shame them in their
injudicious managing that famous action of commerce by my private poor stock in
a despicable way that they looked not after, nor regarded. And yet they granted
the same freely and gratis to aliens and stranges of other nations, Popish in
religion, and enemies to the honorable action of Commerce. And what was this
then but to take the childrens bread, and to cast it to Dogs, and to deny the
poor decrepit Lazarus the crumbs that fell from their superfluous Tables, or
with the envious Dog in the manger, neither to eat hay himself, nor suffer the
hungry Ox to eat it? And if this be justice, charity, and gratitude of the
India Court Committees, which they boast of, and would have all the world to
believe their abundant indulgence to deserving servants, let wise men judge:
for I am at a nonplus, and must needs conclude with the sentence of Scripture,
The mercies of the wicked are cruel.

Thus seeing my self so unconscionably handled, and disfranchised of all
freedom or comfort in that Company, of whom I had well deserved even by their
own approbation; denying me also, though dis-franchised, to repay me 50. pound,
paid almost thirty years before for that freedom, I was advised by my own
thoughts and friends counsel to petition to his Majesty for a reference of my
cause to indifferent men; which by his Majesty was most graciously granted me,
referring it to 3. good men on my side, and to as many on the Courts side, to
make conscionable end to my content, or to make report unto his Majesty. The
three good men for me were, the right worshipful Sir Henry Row, Knight, and the
worshipful George Clark, now Knight, and Rob. Grimes Esquire. And the Court
with much ado elected in the end, the right worshipful Sir Job Harvy, Knight,
and the worshipful Thomas Keightly, and Daniel Harpey, Esquires, all bred
Merchants on both sides. The affronts and contempts to his Majesty's command,
and to all the Referrees, were to large to recite: who having spent a whole
year and more upon many summons, never met a full Committee of their side,
above three times, and at those times nothing done but wrangling made by three
Committees out of Court, and three or four officers to oppose me alone before
the Referrees, and that because the Referrees would not account their orders of
Court penned in large volumes, to be as authentic Records, or as Acts of
Parliament. And so nothing at all being done, I entreated all the Referrees to
make report to his Majesty, which they all seemed willing to perform, but
condoling my unfortunate and hard measure, lent me their good counsel,
alleging it would not only be a chargeable and irksome business to me to go
in winter time to the King as far as Scotland, but also perhaps distastive to
his Majesty to be troubled in midst of his important affairs with his Army, in
or near the borders of Scotland, and to commence suit in Law, were to fling
away more money. For the Court being of more credit either at the Council
Table, or in any judicious Court in England, would be more potent against me,
and that out of a general stock, or purse, then I should be, though I had the
best of their estates. And withal told me, that the Court had made an offer to
them to give me two hundred marks (a poor sum in regard of my due debts and
wrongs) So that I would give the whole Court, and every particular man, a
general release, yet leaving me to take my course in law against my
revengefull India adversaries, provided that all the Referres should set to
their hands as witnesses to the release. To the which in the end, by their
persuasions, and my own extreme necessitated case to preserve my credit (yet
never justly stained, and to relieve my ruined family, consisting of my self,
wife, and five children, all young and unprovided for, I enforced, (as upon
oath I am ready to aver) yielded unto: which done, the Court yet again
considered with themselves, that all things was not agreeable to their second
thoughts, and therefore contrary to their propopositions to the Referrees,
would have releases granted to my India adversaries also, or else would pay me
no money: which though I was resolutely bent not to do, yet necessity having
no law, I was in the end compelled to perform, (being somewhat more persuaded
by the friendly information of Sir Henry Garraway, who though he confessed
himself to have opposed me formerly in Court, yet now he was my best friend
there, promising to do me any future courtesies that lay in his power; and
withal freely imparting unto me the Courts ace using consciences, that if I
did proceed in law against my India adversaries, that all the aspersion of
those foul proceeds, would reflect upon the Court; and therefore they would
make all sure. The Courts Attorney then framed a large authentic release, and
withal put in a Clause, that at the instance and request of the Referrees, the
Court had yielded to give me two hundred marks. Which release being brought to
Sir Henry Roue, (in his presence for me to set my hand and seal) to be a
witness, he right nobly, as became his virtue and goodness, subscribed thus,
or to this sense, I do testify as a witness to this release, the sealing and
delivery thereof: But that I had any hand to solicit the India Court in
Boothbyes behalf, I utterly deny. This done, the other Referrees denied to
subscribe in any other sense, which did so blurre the Governor and Court with
shame, that they caused their Attorney to draw a new release, leaving out
forenamed clause) and taking such other hands as he could get besides his own
for witness. All things now effected to their bad desires, I thought all
malice and revenge had been clean wiped out; and therefore renewed a former
petition for readmittance into the Companies service, or for passage in their
ships into India upon my own adventure, but could prevail nothing to the
charitable relief of me and mine. And not long after, that corrupt insolvent
Governor, Sir Morris Abbot, died; for whose soul, were it lawful and
effectual to pray, I would yet lend my earnest devotions to God for mercy in
his behalf. And a little before his death it pleased God to grant a Parliament
in England, and then it grieved me to heart to have given so effectual a
release; yet persuaded by learned counsel, that the Parliament in a just cause
would wave an enforced release, I framed a petition by advice of the said
learned counsel, to the Parliament, which was preferred by a friend to Mr.
Brown, Clerk to the House of Peers; in whose hands, if not cast aside, it yet
lies, in regard of an Ordinance of Parliament to defer private men's petitions
for a while, to give way to important affairs of State, as reason required.
And And so all hope of release that way, were all at a stand, I resolved to go
to Roterdum in Holland, to endeavor to get a passage in their Dutch ships into
India: And to that purpose about Michaelmas, 1640. I wrote to two of my ancient
loving friends, the Worshipful William Cranmer, Deputy Governor to the
Merchant Adventurers of England, and to Mr. John Strange a worthy Citizen of
London, both resident at Roterdam, to entreat their furtherance to assist me in
that voyage for convenient passage: and from both received right courteous
reply for their good assistance, and convenient entertainment during mine abode
there. But presently after it pleased God to hinder that intent, by imposing
upon me a long and tedious disease, a Flux, for three full years complete. And
during that time (though I were not able to stir much abroad, yet) I
bethought my self how to provoke the India Court to commence suit in Law
against me, hoping by that course to obtain favor to defend my cause in Forma
Pauperis (which I might rightly claim) and that was by publishing a Protest
against the Governor and whole Court, which having formerly acted in private
to themselves, for which they threatened me with severe punishment in the Court
of Honor, but recanted. I deemed that making it public, it would certainly
stir them up to that suit: So though unacquainted with the manner of such
proceeds, I rudely and ignorantly penned such a Protest as my weak judgment
did apprehend, which I caused to be fixed upon the gate of the East India
House, and upon Sir Morris Abbots gate, and upon four chief Pillars on the
Exchange. But they had not hung long, but were presently snatched off: and from
that day to this, I never felt the smart of their second more cruel oppressing
threats; so that no act that I could do, would provoke them to lay open their
own shameful proceeds, and my weak purse living upon a small rackt Country
Farm, chiefly supported by indulgent friends, would not afford means to right
my self: My sickness thus continuing three years, it pleased God (contrary to
all rules of Physic, and multitudes of medicines, following my own appetite
and fancy) to stop my Flux, though it had brought me low and weak in body; yet
finding my self able to creep a little abroad, (though with much pain, with
two short staves to lean upon, I took a Chamber in London for the Winter time,
for sundry reasons and occasions. And one day making shift with many restings,
to creep to the Exchange, I met there with my ancient acquaintance and friend
Mr. William Methold, lately returned from being President in India (a place
assigned for me, if malice had not prevented) and at present Deputy Governor
of the India Corporation; who by being in India, was better acquainted with my
wrongs, as his letters out of India, and his speeches since at home, condoling
my wrongs suffered under the tyranny of a President (a man of matchless
malice) do import, whose advice and counsel I entreated, seeing the old
Governor Sir Morris Abbot was dead, and Sir Henry Garraway turned out of that
place, and a new Governor Mr. William Cockhaine, and many new Committees
chosen, whether he did suppose, that if I renewed my former petitions for
passage into India, I should obtain my desire: His answer was, he deemed my
Petition would be granted; and that the voyage into those hot Countries would
in great probability speedily recover my limbs again; yet willed me to forbear
until he had felt and dived into the affection of the Governor. And whilst we
were thus in discourse, Mr. Governor came to him, and called him away from me
(upon some occasion of business:) So that conference breaking off, I repaired
within few days after, to his house, to know the issue; where he told me he
had conference with the Governor concerning my purpose, and found him an
indifferent man, and so willed me to proceed, promising his faithful
assistance. Accordingly I framed a Petition, and in regard of my weakness,
feed a Solicitor to exhibit the same, and to attend the Courts response; which
finding dilatory, I seconded the same with a submissive Epistle, entreating
reply to both; but though he attended about five months, every Court day, and
other days in the interims; yet could never get answer to either. What to
think of the Governor Cockhaine I know not in regard of his former voting in
Court, before he was Governor (in my cause) that I had undergone both in India
and at home, summum jus, which is a riddle to me (though at first I conceived
it to be spoken in my favor) because though urged both in private and public,
he never pleased to interpret his meaning, and I should be glad for the good
opinion that I ever had of him* that his good interpretation would clear him
from reproof; of which I much doubt; for being taken in my favor or disfavour
spoken, the sequel as I conceive and think, I shall be able to manifest, that
his sentence was near a kin to Pilats, or Balaams; yet I will use Balaams
prayer for him, That he may die the death of the righteous, and his end be like
his. And because there has been four Governors of the India Courts, since
these my troubles, whereof two, (Sir Morris Abbot, and Sir Henry Ga^raway) I
have manifested in this forementioned Treaty, their partiality, injustice, and
corruption; and at present Mr. William Cockhaines deep Machivill equivocation,
to shift or wind himself (Serpent-like) to either side which way soever for
his advantage. I conceive it requisite to say somewhat touching Sir Christopher
Cletherow, (almost forgotten) who though both in the judgment of the world,
and in my own charitable opinion of him, esteemed honest and virtuous: And
never that I could learn (by the best inquiry that I could make) that he ever
opened his mouth in Court against me, during the time of his Governors or
Deputy Governors place for many years, yet tacitous in defense of the cause
of innocence, is not to be excused: For he knew that I was privy to the
passages between him and his son in India; whose son at his departure from
India, left Commission with me, to take up and open his fathers letters:
whereby I could justly have charged him with such crime as the other corrupt
Governors unjustly charged upon me; which peradventure was the cause he never
opposed me: yet to do me justice (that pleased him not,) both because he would
not cross the former Governors actions, nor lose (by their means) the Courts
favors, so commodious unto him both by allowance of two hundred pounds per
annum, rent for part of his house to keep Courts in, and also five hundred
pounds per annum sallary, for his pains in place of Governor, to attend four,
five, or six hours in a week, upon those affairs, (a fair and large
recompense for a trivial pains or service. So that in this case I may well
compare him to Faelix, the Governor of Judea, who being to leave his
government to Portius Festus, and having Paul a prisoner, committed by the
Jews, and knowing in his conscience no cause in Paul worthy of death, or of
bonds, yet to curry favor, and to please the Jews, left Paul bound a
prisoner; and whether for this sin or others, it pleased God to cast judgments
upon him by the dismal untimely deaths of his two eldest sons, I leave it to
the opinion of others less partial, desiring not to be accounted uncharitably
censorious.

Thus with more perplexity then I conceived, or intended, I have according to
my weak capacity, set down truly, and as brief as I could, the sum of those
passages which I intended to have enlarged into every particular, to which end
I began the same the last Spring, as my weak body would permit me ability, (but
finding the same intermixed with several accidents in my voyage to and from
India, with desription of many Countries, wherein we had abode, I found it
would arise to too great a volume for my weak purse to publish in print, and
perhaps not acceptable though bestowed gratis, especially if thereto added the
particular Articles against me, and my Response thereunto; the sundry Protests
made in India, at St. Helena, and in England, for the unjust proceeds against
me, with Mr. Rastels Warrant for my release of imprisonment, etc. And the India
Courts malignant censure, seven months in composing, to fit the same to daub
over their seared accusing consciences. The defense for private trade for all
the Companies servants, with the Courts indirect juggling in the covenant and
accord with their servants, which they are forced to confess they must of
necessity connive at, or else shall have no servants to agitate their affairs:
And yet honest men, that either want means to bribe, or friends to stand by
them, shall not escape their severity. The great danger and mortality of his
Majesty's subjects in those adventurous employments, (the good deserving, great
indulgence and respect) the Variety of Presidents and Councels, etc. their
juglings and defraudments. The excessive lavish expense in housekeeping at
Surrat, and aboard their shipping. The advice given to reform the abuses of
lewd and tyrannical Governors. Increase of their trade to 40000 l. per annum
profit, or much more (...)tion of their defraudments and neglects past, and
like(...) sue to many hundred thousand pounds damage. (...) Courts contempt of
my fair proceedings (according to their own Ordinance and In^unction) for
raising benevolences to the furtherance of the Hospital at Black-wall, with
the forwardness of my loyal serviceable endeavors, (according to command)
which had it not been rejected, but seconded, would ere this dey, have brought
in money to have purchased many hundred pounds, if not thousands per annum, to
that charitable work. And lastly, expressed (which perhaps not unfit to be
taken notice thereof) of Gods judgments upon all those in India not one
exempted, that voted (though for fear by their own confessions) against me.
And also the judgments of God, or disgraces to them or their posterity, of all
in their India Courts known to have voted or banded themselves against me (one
only excepted, and yet living, which for reasons of State I omit to nominate)
with the credit and blessings of God on those (but three in the number of
thirteen or fourteen) which did their endeavors, as much as in them lay, or
they durst (for fear of a Tyrants mischief to themselves) to clear me from
crime or aspersion, all which now after fifteen years, are yet living, and in
reputation. And hearing the report of some ships of Mr. Curteens, that were
then laden with passengers for a plantation at Madagascar, and that Mr. Walter
Hamond (my acquaintance, an honest intelligent man) had written a book for
encouragement to that weighty design (though I had not seen that book) I
alt^red my design, and took upon me to write my opinion thereof, (affecting
rather a common good, then my own private and particular) which if not
authorized to the Press, I suppose will be in good time, which I desire and
hope, will find good acceptance, though we^kly yet truly performed.

Now a word or two touching my infortunity by the Governors of two Cockhaines
in several Companies: By the government of Sir William over the new Merchant
Adventurers, I received the original of my downfall by his evil project,
which though lasting not full two years, brought some hundred thousand pounds
damage to this Commonwealth, as may easily be manifested, and by the
hinderance of good under the government of Mr. William Cockhaine in the East
India Company, I received my final ruin and downfall: so that their names and
governments have been fatal, ominous and disastrous to me and all mine. That
Mr. Cockhaine has been a hinderance of good to this Commonwealth, I will only
instance in my own case; Had he been a welwiller to Justice or Charity, my true
intended loyal service might have done ere this day, much good to this
Kingdom, and the Honorable Corporation, as their own acknowledgements of India
Court, and gratification of good service manifested; yea, as some of the most
Judicious amongst them have acknowledged, that I did the Company better service
in one half year being in India free from fetters and imprisonment, then all
their servants did before in thirty years space. And that my zealous intent
was now, and upon my last and other Petitions, to do good, thus I manifest it.
I intended, though weak in body, and aged threescore years, to hazard my life
for my King and Countries good, and to have taken with me two sons, one of
two and twenty years of age, (fit for employment by my instructions) and the
other of twelve years of age, capable to be brought up in language, and other
endowments fit for a Merchant (or perhaps a Statesman in some mean degree, or
an Intelligencer, or an Interpreter of Persia, Iava, and other Languages by
long continuance intended,) I resolved also to enter into a Trade that the
Company rejects, and regards not, and to discover more then yet by any one
man has been done, or like to be in long time, I would not have transported
any gold or silver, as they as ill commonwealths men do, I would not have kept
any thing private to my self, that I should have discovered beneficial to a
general good, but have revealed it to the Honorable Company whereof I was a
member, though I received no accommodation of good, but evil by them. And I
intended to be a true assistant to my power (and credit, which I hope should
not have been inferior to any, as it was not at my former being there) for the
good of the Plantation at Madagascar, if it went on, to do them all diligent
and faithful service; and as God blessed me with means, by employing the
greatest part in that worthy right honorable action, something to the
gratification of friends for courtesies received, some comfort to the
preferment of a wife and three daughters left at home; and some to the comfort
of Gods poor elect in my own Country. If Mr. William Cackhaines refusal to
give response to my Petition, was not hinderer of these good designs,
indifferent men may censure. Then sure, as a learned Divine of our times, Mr.
Carrile, has put it out in Print, by order of Parliament, That the Projectors
of evil, and hinderers of good, are both conformable to the Devil, then is he
in danger of such censure. And the Heathen by the light of nature could say,
that Agentes and consentientes pari paena puniendi, and so deserves suitable
punishment. And in my weak judgment it were not amiss, if such good Law were
inacted in this Kingdom, as by report fat Mr. Symmonds, Merchant, being called
to Council Table, to know his opinion among others, touching Sir William
Cockhaines project, made reply (not spending his judgment) that the Law of the
Lacedaemonians was good, That every Projector of new business in a
Commonwealth, ought to present his project with a halter about his neck, that
if his project proved ill to the Commonwealth, he should suffer a due desert.

And thus I abruptly end this Remonstrance or Declaration of the intolerable
wrong done to me and mine, and perhaps in us, to the prejudice of this
Commonwealth; which my malignant adversaries, or partial time-serving injust
India Court-Committees, are and will be ashamed to verify in any judicious
Court of Justice against me; but being put to trial, or examination, will
either plead their ignorance, or deny they ever voted against me. But such men
ought to know, that he that sits an assistant in Court of Justice, and for
by respects pleads not in the defense of the innocent, supposing himself
clear of aspersion from God and Man, if he sit still, and say nothing either
in defense or offense to the innocent, let such men, I say, know (that if our
modern Divines preach not false Doctrine) that they, or he, whatsoever, (by his
tacitenesse, is as guilty as the unjust Judge that pronounces wicked Sentence
against him. Concerning which (I humbly desire virtuous, prudent, judicious
men, to consider the matters, and to give their righteous judgment.

Right Honorable,
I Have discourst to your just hearing ears,
My woeful plight, and doleful Tragedy,
With mournful Accents, Accents causing tears,
Sad tears attending matchless misery.
Your pitties ears therefore (just Lords) afford
To these most pensive and most just Complaints:
Let mercies eyes with pitties ears accord,
To cheer the spirit that with grieving faints:
In hope whereof my soul shall rest in peace,
Till you vouchsafe to send her full release.
PSALM. 86. 14, 15, 16, 17. O God, the proud are risen up against me, and the
congregations of naughty men, have sought after my soul, and have not set thee
before their eyes.

But thou (O Lord God) art full of compassion and mercy, long suffering, and
plenteous in goodness and truth.

O turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me: give thy strength unto thy
servant, and help the son of thy handmaid.

Show some good token upon me for good, that they which hate me may see it, and
be ashamed, because thou, Lord, have helped me, and comforted me.


FINIS.
