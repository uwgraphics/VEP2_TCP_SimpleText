are particularly concerned (from the very first beginning of these unhappy
Troubles to this day.

Zech. 8. 16. These are the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the
truth to his Neighbor: execute the Judgment of Truth and Peace in your Gates:

17 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his Neighbor, and
love no false Oath; for all these are things that I hate, says the Lord.



LONDON, Printed by R. Raworth, for R. Bestock, at the Kings head, in
Pauls-Church-yard, 1645.

To the Faithful Reader.
Christian Reader,
MAy it please thee, at this time, to receive a free and true Discourse of
sundry and main occurrences of businesses, here amongst us, tendered unto thee
by a real Friend, and faithful Servant of thine, in the Lord; who makes it a
good part of his earnest study, to enquire in all seriousness after the truth
of those things, which thus busy us all in these miserable days of ours,
every where; (what in thoughts, what in words, what in deeds) with the motives,
occasions, reasons, and ends thereof) and this forsooth not to content his vain
curiosity, and merely to feed his empty brains with notions; as many read
Books and bearken after news; but, for the good of the Public, unto the
Service whereof, he freely and cheerfully devotes his pains and labors; and so
with pleasure, he, in all freedom of heart, imparts unto others, of what he
jugeth to be true, and conducing to the good of Church and State, without
unjust partiality, or base siding with any faction, the great disease in these
our evil days, of foolish and weak men: And the principal occasion of those
our great and long sufferings, with the tedious delays, and many hindrances of
carrying on the public Work, by action in the Field, and Counsel at home, to
the benefit of Church and State. This he does, without regard to the persons
of any whosoever, having no intent to offend the least by cynicall mordacitie,
nor mind to curry favor with the greatest, by insinuating flattery, being (by
Gods great mercy toward him, unworthy worm) pretty free from the chief cause
of these distempers, ordinary to most men: For, on the one part, he knows no
man who has so far wronged him, in his own particular, as to move him unto
anger or wrath against the person of any; and he has ever thought it contrary
to good Christianity, and dissonant from moral honesty, to inveigh
scurrilously against men's persons, as Pamphleteers do now adays.

Wherefore, he speaks of the failings in diverse kinds and degrees, wherewith
he is highly offended, and much scandalized, of men of all ranks and conditions
in both Kingdoms, without designation of their persons by name: Yea, he is so
far from naming any man in particular, for his errors, that he makes mention
but of a very few by name, and those with eloge and praise, wishing from his
heart that he had just occasion to name all those to their advantage, at whose
faults he points at.

Further, he heartily blesses God, who in his Fatherly care toward him
hitherto, (and he hopes will do so to the end, being assured that he, who
gives the principal, will not deny the accessory, if he thinks it fit for his
own Glory and our good) has provided for him wherewith to sustain his nature,
without great excess or much want, and has schooled him both by precept and
practice, to live and be content of little, and so, not being so urged by a
near nipping necessity, or imaginary poverty, as to selt or betray the Truth
for a morsel of Bread, nor so led away with the exorbitant desire of
preferment or profit, as to cog in upon any terms by flattery, lying, and
faining with those, in whose hands, for the present, the disturbation of such
things is amongst us now adays; He dare be bold to speak home to the Point,
and tell downright the truth of things wherein the Church and State are so
much concerned, not fearing to be crossed in his private interest, and put back
from his hopes, by displeasing the gods.

Moreover, he prefers the possessing of himself with calm and freedom of
spirit, having his little viaticum, such as it is, simple and course, to the
glistering slavery, with toiling and moiling of ambitious and covetous ones; to
whatsoever hight with luster and fair show they attain unto, in the eyes of the
World, and opinion of men, knowing that it is dear bought, with loss of time,
and often of credit and conscience, and to be nothing but a mere shadow, which
in a moment vanishes.

To the performance of this useful and necessary Duty, he conceives himself
bound in conscience, before God and man, for these respects and reasons;

First, Every one of us all, in our several ranks and stations, ought, so far
as in us lies, advance the Glory of God, and hinder whatsoever is contrary to
it, or against it; for, he is the Lord our God: Then being bound to the hearty
Love of our Neighbor, we ought with earnestness procure his true good, and
hinder him from receiving evil, or committing sin whereby evil may come upon
him: This is inculcate in the Scripture over and over again; Yea, we are bidden
rebuke our Brother, or Neighbor, plainly, when he sins, in any kind:
otherwise we are said to be haters of him; namely, we are to hinder him from
walking about with lies among the people, and from conspireing with the wicked.
Read Levit. 19. 16, 17.

Next, The Church whereof we are Children, and the Country whereof we are
Members, requires and expects of us all, that with our whole power and
might, we procure, in all uprightness and singleness of heart, their true
good, and stop whatsoever appears to be against the same, either word or deed;
thoughts being only known to God. To this we are not only bound at once, by a
general tie; but we iterate and renew it from time to time, as we receive
benefits by them, or from them, according to the ordinary practice of us all.

Thirdly, Are we not all obliged by our late National Covenant, and sworn, to
advance the settling of the Church-Reformation, according to the Word of God,
and conform to the best Reformed Churches, and to the settling of a solid Peace
to the good of the People, by putting forward the Service, and opposing the
open and declared Enemy, with the crafty Malignants, of whatsoever kind,
secretly undermining us in the pursuance of this our good Cause, by cabales,
factions, lies, devises, and plots, and with whatsoever else the wicked heart
of man full of wyles for his own and his Neighbors ruin. All those ties and
bonds are shaken off and broken by the most part of us, either through
negligent laziness, and remiss slacknesse, not minding them, and not having
before our eyes as we ought the least part of our duty; or through base
connivence and treacherous compliance to the wicked courses of the Enemies
against the Cause, we say we maintain, I am sure at least we ought; or by open
and professed Apostasy, we have joined our hearts and affection with the
Common Enemy, who so actively by all means opposes this Cause of God, and
persecuteth his people for it.

This is done both in Scotland and England, not by a few, but by many; not by
little and small ones, but by the Chief and Leaders of the rest; not by
stopping things of humane infirmity and weakness, but with study and an high
hand.

Here we shall say a word or two of the carriage of those two Nations, in the
going on with the Work of the Lord, for the settling of the Church, and quiet of
his People. We shall begin at those of Scotland, who some few years ago were
lifted up with praises among men, for their faithful minding and following
earnestly this great Work of God, all by-ends laid aside, for which God blessed
them from Heaven, and made them be called happy among men; for they had their
hearts desire in the business, and their Enemies were subdued by them: But
now, leaving off their former integrity and sincerity to the Cause of God, and
their Love unto him, following the devices and desires of their own corrupt
hearts, in pride, coveteousnesse, and factions, and notwitstanding the earnest
and pressing admonitions, both in private and public, of the Prophets and
Ministers of God, they continue in their evil courses, preposterously minding
themselves, and their worldly foolish interest of ambition and avarice, more
then God, and the Cause of his Church and people. For this, God (as it were by
an essay to try them if they would, laying aside their lewd by ways, mind him
and his Service heartily and sincerly) sends amongst them an hand-full of
contemptible, profane, and wicked villains; whom, at first, they despise and
neglect; but, going on in their wonted ways, while the holy Name of God is
profaned by those Sons of Belial, a part of their Land is wasted, the poor
people spoiled and slain, with all other barbarous usage; and so these number
and power of the Slaves of Iniquity growing, they are plotting, caballing, and
devising how to supplant another, and increase their sever all faction, the
seed of dissension being sowed amongst them by the Enemy, to divide, and so
more easily compass his ends upon them, which they would not and could not
see, blinded with their corrupt passion. Then God, to admonish them anew,
suffers some of those, whom they had employed against the Sons of Rebellion, to
betray their trust, and omit diverse good occasions, in all appearance, to make
havoc of these villains, yea, some to run over unto them in the hour of fight:
and so, these Enemies of goodness, to advance their pernicious design, do
what they list.

Yet, all this will not die with those hardhearted and stubbling men, still
employing and busying their thoughts how to bear down one another; yea, some
there were amongst them, who were not sorry in their hearts, of the progress
that those despisable villains made in the Country against the Service of the
Common Cause, conceiving it did help to the setting up of their faction. But,
since the affronts and blows, they received at diverse times from those
contemptible fellows, did not move these ingrate Children, God sends a
Pestilence amongst them, which rages with such fury, that hardly the like has
been heard of in that Land; to try if at last they would leave their slacknes
and remissenes in pursuing the Service of the Cause of Gods Church and People,
their conniving and complying with his Enemies, yea, their helping those
villains with means and advice, in opposing the Cause of God and oppressing his
People. But, they remain obdured, like Children of disobedience, in their
perverse ways. So, at length, God in his wrath delivers them up to the hands
of their wicked Enemies, making them as far to be scorned and misprised, for
their not heartly minding him and his Service, as they had been before esteemed
and extolled, for their adhering to him, and doing his Service faithfully. Yea,
the Chief men of them, who had been cried up for Valor and Wisdom, are
constrained to fly away, and have their lives for a prey.

So God, who from the beginning of all those unhappy disturbances, till this
last time, had made Scotland a Mirror of his Mercy, in testimony of its
faithfulness, adhering unto him; makes it an example of his Justice for its
back sliding from him. And thus, Judgment begins at the House of God; now let
England look seriously to it; for the same very sins, which have been committed
in Scotland, and for which it now lies under the heavy rod of a chastising and
angry God; are now reigning in England, namely, ambition and avarice, with many
more, which have not been seen in Scotland; example, heresies, errors, and
Sects of all sorts, to the dishonor of God, and to the withdrawing of the
People from his Truth, are connived at and countenanced by those who are in
Authority.

Then, there be some of power and credit, who are so far from furthering the
Reformation of the Church (as they and we all are sworn to by the Covenant)
that they hinder the same, not only by secret undermining, and by plots; but
by a continued open profession against it.

Next, There be great oppressions, vexations, concussions, and injustices done
unto the People, by diverse in Authority; the cry of all which, is as loud if
not louder unto Heaven then the cry of the sins of Scotland. It may be that
God, as he has not be gun so soon to show his Mercy unto England as he did
unto Scotland, will not send his Judgment upon it so speedily; yet,
doubtless, without a serious Repentance and a true turning unto God, Judgment
will come, and the longer it is a coming, the heavier it will be.

It is not the good Cause of Church and State that will do Englands turn, more
then the Temple and the Law of old did save Judah from ruin; nor the same good
Cause has kept Scotland from punishment; the good Cause ill managed, by
negligence, ambition, avarice, faction, self-conceit, and other vices of that
kind, draws vengeance upon those who have the managing of it, and make the
Cause to be in derision. Never good Cause has been worse managed by the
ignorance of weak ones, and the malice of other wicked.

At last, God will maintain his Cause, (no thanks to thee) without thee, for he
needs not thy help to do it; but, since he has been pleased to make use of
thee in the Service of this his Cause, he expects faithfulness and zeal to it
from thee, free from worldly and humane interest: Otherwise vengeance is at
thy door; for God, as he will not, in his Worship and Cult, have linsey-wolsey
of men's inventions intermingled with his pure and sacred Ordinance, so he will
not, in managing the Service of his Cause and of his People, that men bring in
the mixture or addition of their own interest; for God will have our work
wholly for himself; and if we be faithful in it, he will not forget to give us
what we need to have for our selves; otherwise he will not only cast us off
and our work, but will curse both it and us.

Again I say, Let England take example at her Neighbor; yet I am sure God in
his Judgment will remember his Mercy unto Scotland, and for his own Name sake
will keep his promise unto his faithful ones, whereof he has a great number
of all ranks and conditions in that distressed Country, and will not suffer
this proud insulting Enemy to domineer thus ever his poor people, far less set
up again his abominations and profane his holy Name; but God will arise and
throw his Enemies to the dust, for it is against him they fight, and for his
sake they thus trouble, vex, and now oppress his People. And although that all
men, at this great last blow, were struken with astonishment, yet many take
courage to go on with the Service of the Cause of God, with their whole heart
and strength, acknowledging Gods Justice in this his thus chastising them, and
confessing heartily their sins by which they have so provoked God to anger, and
are truly sorry, not so much for their sufferings they now lie under, as for
their offending their good God, on whom they are resolved to rely, and in whom
they will constantly trust, and to whom they will more nearly adhere then ever;
let him deal with them as he pleases, they are the Servants, he is the Lord,
they are the Pot, he is the Porter, they are the Creatures, and he is the
Creator, whose will is always good, not only it self, but for us, if we be
obedient and faithful unto him. But, I will hold thee here no longer. So
recommending thee to God, I go to the Discourse it self.

A short and true Relation of diverse passages of things, wherein the Scots are
particularly concerned, from the first beginning of these troubles, to this day.
IT is not unknown to men of understanding; how that, many sinistrous reports,
one after another, raised of the Scots (for their faithfulness and constancy
to the Cause of Religion and Liberty, in these Dominons) by Malignants, that
is, by Atheists, Libertines, Papists, Prelatists, and Sectaries of all kinds,
officiating in their several ways for the Common Enemy, and spread abroad by
the contrivers thereof, with the help of their instruments, Agents, and
Favorers; then received by the simpler sort, not knowing the truth of things,
less the drift of the Malignants, in these calumnies; otherwise well-meaning
people, (for the truth is no sooner made known unto them, but they willingly
lay hold on it; and being admonished of the pernicious design of the
adversaries, they do abhor and detest both it and them:) has done, and yet
does great prejudice, according to the intent of the Enemy, unto the service
now in hand, of the Common Cause of Church and State, these two inseparable
twins, which both Kingdoms do now maintain, and intend to do unanimously with
heart and hand, as they stand bound and united to lay aside all other and
former ties, by the National Covenant, through the great Providence of God, in
mercy to both, so that they prove faithful and constant to this Cause of his
and of his people, according to the said Covenant, against all opposition
whatsoever, whether by declared and open war, or by clandestine and indirect
undermining.

Wherefore, after long forbearance with grief of mind, and compassion to see
faithful men and earnest in this Common Cause, so maliciously traduced, and,
in them, the good Cause so much wronged; as likewise, so many well-affected men
to the said Cause, so grossly abused by crafty lies, and impudent untruths: I
have thought fit, for the good and service of the Common Cause, to the
advancement whereof, every one is obliged to contribute according to what he
has, as he will answer one day to him, whose Cause first and principally it
is, to undeceive many wellminded men, and to right, in some measure, those
faithful men to the Cause, who are so wickedly slandred, in giving unto the
public this true and short Discourse; whereby the truth of diverse things will
be made more known, lies in a kind repressed, and the service of the Common
Cause somewhat furthered; at least it will not be so far kept back, as it has
hitherto been by these undermining courses.

And the rather do I undertake this task, that those in a manner are silent, by
whom most men do expect the clear truth of things of this kind not so
generally known, should be conveyed to all by a particular publication of them
in writing, to the end that this course of so maliciously lying against trusty
men may be stopped, and the well meaning men no longer thus abused. But these,
of whom men look for performance of this duty, going about the main work they
are come hither for in all earnestness, and singleness of heart, with care
and diligence, and not without a great deal of drudging to and from, as
faithful and trusty laborers, do take but little notice of this wicked
practice of their and the cause its Enemies, by lies, howsoever industriously
devised, and cunningly set forth, as altogether below them, chosing rather that
their own good carriage, with constant resolution, and faithful endeavors,
and that of their Countrymen engaged with them in the same business, although
in another way, in sincerity of heart, advancing the public work now in hand,
should speak for them both, then either a flourishing tongue, or a nimble pen.

Here, although I value much the goodness of these men to rely rather upon
their own and their Countreymens honesty and integrity, in and about the work,
then upon the setting forth of any Declaration, by writing of their own and
their friends faithful proceedings, and fair carrying on of things, in the
public service: Yet, in this I cannot esteem their prudency; for, albeit
native beauty ought not to be set forth by painting and patches, being complete
in it self; yet it must be kept free from spots and and dirt, and made seen
unto all, under a modest and comely dressing, by which means it is more
pleasing and better liked of every one.

And although where there is no fault, no Apology ought to be made, yet, to
make the truth openly known, (when it is desguised) for the information of
those who take things merely upon trust, and to stop the going on of wicked men
with lies, is not only an Act of Wisdom, but of Piety, yea, of Necessity, if
men will not abandon the interest of a good cause to the malice of the Enemies
thereof: and, as it is said by the wise man, Thou art not to answer a fool
according to his folly, that is, in exorbitancy, etc. lest in so doing thou
become like unto him; even so by the same wise man thou art ordained to answer
a fool as is fit and convenient, for the repressing of his folly, lest he think
himself wise, and so go on in his evil course, to the dishonor of God the
Father of truth, and to the prejudice of both Church and State, who are to be
directed by the truth. Surely, if ever at any time the lie and calumny of the
fool (for so I call the calumniator, how cunningly soever he lies) is to be
repressed with a fit answer, it is at this time, when there lies so much at
the stake in both Kingdoms, as Religion and Liberty, with whatsoever else is,
or ought to be dear unto men.

Now then, to answer unto the calumnies of those Malignants, and to make the
simple truth known to all, is absolutely necessary at this occasion, to the end
that not only the liar may find his craft to be folly, but also his wicked
intent to be disappointed, which is no less then a breach betwixt the two
Nations, and has been such from the beginning; and consequently the ruin of
both, now so united and joined in the common interest of Church and State, that
they must sink or swim together; for if they should once devide, as the one
doubtless will be presently undone; so the end of the other will not be far
off. Wherefore he that does any evil office, to raise or increase jealousy
betwixt them, under whatsoever pretext, is worse then any open Enemy, and what
he intends to the public, will come upon himself, that is, ruin, with
disgrace.

But, me thinks I hear you, whom I blame for silence in so necessary a case,
and so needful a time, say, We have not been wanting in this very thing you
find fault with: For we have constantly and diligently communicated all things
of any moment, freely and ingeniously, in all truth and simpleness of heart,
to some chief leading men, our particular good friends, upon whom we have
relied, from our first hither-coming, in all things concerning us and our
Contrymen, employed in the service, to the end that they should convey the
truth of business, as in discretion they thought fit, and did see cause, for
the public good, and for the right of us their friends, to the Houses, and
from thence to the public.

To this I answer, You have mistaken the right way, Sirs, for you should have
made your addresses to the whole Parliament, or at least to the Committee
appointed by the Parliament to hear you, consult with you, in a word, to deal
or treat with you of all things, wherein you and they are jointly concerned;
and not suffer your selves to be engrossed by some few, howsoever they be Prime
men: and what do you know, if by thus suffering your selves to be as it were
led by them, has not increased their credit? For men may say, that they have
reason to follow those, by whom you of so much reputation of wisdom and
resolution, are guided, etc. Further, should not you have thought, that
particular men, howsoever they serve the public, have ordinarily particular
ends of ambition and avarice, which the public cannot have? And although those
your friends be free of these distempers, yet you are not assured of their
constancy unto you; for many things fall out betwixt man and man, which makes
them not only fall from intimacy of one with another, but makes them adverse
and opposite one to another oftentimes. And, although your friends be free of
this infirmity; Are you wise men to rely upon others, for doing the things you
should do your selves without a Procure? He that trusts another to do a thing
fitting for himself to do, must expect to have the thing done, if at all done,
neither so timely, nor so well, at least not so soon, nor so to his mind, as is
it falls out often: of extraordinary occasions and occurrences, there is no
certain rule.

Next, I know, you will say, We have acquainted the Houses of Parliament to the
full with the truth of all things, by cut several papers given unto them at
diverse times, upon diverse occasions, and we have made known unto the Synod
what concerns Church businesses, and so we think we have done enough in this.

But give me leave, Sirs, under favor, herein also you are hugely mistaken;
you do well to communicate freely and carefully unto the Houses of Parliament
all things, and to acquaint them with your proceedings, wherein they have
common interest with you, for the public service of Church and State, in these
Dominions; I hope they do so with you, at least, they ought to do it, for the
common good of both; otherwise, the work wherein both Kingdoms are so engaged,
and you both are employed, will go but slowly and limpingly on: Yet this is not
enough; for, first, the main passages of public things done, and the chief
reasons of the doing thereof, are to be made known to the whole Church and
State, since the whole has the chief interest in things common to all:
although you are to communicate your counsels, deliberations, and conclusions
of things to be done, for fear of miscarriage, only to the Trustees of Church
and State, as your selves are: Yet I say again, what, is de facto concerning
all, must be made known to all; for the Trustees of the State and Church, are
not Lords of them, as Kings and Popes pretend to be; but servants, as they
avouch themselves, set on work by them, for the good of both, upon trust, which
if they betray, they are double Traitors: First, they falsify their truth to
the State and Church, whereof they are Members and Children, and unto whom they
owe all under God. Next, they betray the trust imposed upon them, for the good
and benefit of both Church and State. Yea, the Houses of Parliament themselves,
show you the way how to carry your selves in this very particular; for they,
not only for the satisfaction of the whole Kingdom, cause publish the things
done by those whom they, as Trustees, have employed to carry on the service of
the public in the Fields; but also, they publish unto the Kingdom Declarations
of their honest intentions, and fair proceedings, with Votes and Ordinances,
for the good of Church and State: And I am sure, the Trustees of your Nation
for your Church and State, have done so, from the beginning, in your particular
troubles; and that, not only to your own Country, but also to your neighbor,
which has done no harm, neither to the advancement of your affairs at home,
nor to your reputation abroad.

Although the Houses of Parliament rest satisfied in themselves of the honesty
of your proceedings: Yet this gives but small satisfaction unto the Kingdom.

Yea, when you send in your papers to the Houses, it may happen that diverse
Members are absent at the time, and so remain as ignorant of your affairs, as
before the in-giving of the papers; for the Houses are so taken up with other
thoughts and businesses, that they cannot acquaint the absents with your own
affairs; yea, some who are present in the Houses, at the reading of your
papers, are carried of their attention unto you, by diverse distractions, and so
receive but small knowledge by them: Far less can the Houses take leisure to
publish your affairs unto the world; yea, I know not if in rigor they are
tied to do it. Although I confess, it would be a good turn for the public,
and a brotherly office, if they would take the pains to do, or cause do it:
howsoever, I am sure, the Houses are not so obliged to this duty, as your
selves are; neither although they were, can they do it so fully as you, not
being so particularly acquainted with things.

In a word, in duty you ought to make known unto the public your own
proceedings, and these of your Contrymen, employed in the service of the
Common Cause; that it may be made manifest what good you have done alone,
either by counsel in the Houses, or by action in the Field; what you have been
assistants in, and what you ever have been willing to do, and are still minded
to do, providing you be not stopped; and if you have been stopped, let it be
declared where the fault lies, and not you bear the burden of other men's
mistakes and errors.

Next, is it not fit, that it be published what you have done for such vast
sums of money raised upon the public for your use, as is given out, and how
much you have received of it? that if you have received all, you may make known
what you have done for all; and if you have received more then your due, you
are in conscience and honor to do the public the service you are paid for
beforehand: as likewise, if you have not received all which is raised for you,
that it may be known how much of it is wanting, and enquiry may be made what is
become of the rest; and so, if you make it appear unto the world, that there is
much still due unto you of your pay, far above what you have received; then all
honest people, being truly informed of things, will approve your faithful and
fair carriage, acknowledge your love and kindness, thank God for your help and
assistance at such an exigence, and be heartily civil unto you, till God
enable them to recompense you for your faithful pains, according to your just
deserts and their earnest desires; and so things will redound to your credit
and advantage.

You may know and feel all this, what I have been saying unto you, to be true,
according to sense and reason, by one seule instance, to lay aside all others
at this time:

And it is this of the papers you gave into the Houses, about the latter end of
May last, upon occasion of high murmurings against you, in and about the
Houses, by information of Malignants, which gave abundant satisfaction to so
many of both Houses, as either heard it them read (as is well known) or read
them themselves with attention: But, others of the Houses, who are not
acquainted with your papers, partly not hearing them, although present when
perhaps they are delivered in, by reason of their other thoughts; partly being
absent, at that time, remained still ignorant of your affairs, and possessed
with calumnies against you: Far more the rest of the Kingdom.

After some days, one Copy of these your papers having fallen, by chance, in
the hands of a well-wisher to the Cause, and no enemy of yours, was published
under the name of the Scots Manifest, without your knowledge, which has done
more despite to the Enemies of the Truth, than any thing you have done this
long time, and more right unto you then you looked for, yea, nor your silence
deserved; yet not so much as is needful for you and your friends; for it did
stop the mouths of the wicked calumniators, and inform many well-meaning men:
and diverse Members of the Houses there were, who had not heard of such a thing,
before it was printed; to say nothing of the generality of the people, every
where. Yea, I am told, it went beyond Sea, and there stopped the mouths of
Malignants, and gained those who were indifferent, and confirmed your friends.

But what, you will say, Must the hid things or Mysteries of State be divulged?
No, I do not mean it, nor do I say it; For I leave the Mysteries of State to
the Mystes thereof; Only my simple meaning and honest desire is, that these
things which are not, and ought to be, made known to all, be not kept in a mist
by a mysterious prudency, but communicated to the public; such are the things
de facto, and of reason, wherein all are concerned: and these are the things I
spoke of.

Besides, you must think, there be many men not particularly employed in the
public Service, who have both hearts and brains, to serve the Common Cause;
but cannot do it, while all is thus kept in a cloud, as in the Romish Church,
where the Mystes think all men idiots but themselves, and keep from the people
the things of God.

Then you will say, to tell plainly and openly, The Truth, perhaps, will not be
pleasing to all, yea, perchance not to some of our Fellow Laborers. My advice
is not, that you say or write any thing, in intention to displease the least of
men, far less to displease these your Fellow Laborers: But let Truth be said
above all things, when the public requires it for its service; and we our
selves are bound upon our own credit to do it. Be angry who will; God keep me
from neglect and contempt, for lying or suppressing the Truth; I fear not anger
for any publishing of Truth: He that is not bold to publish the Truth, for
timorousness, belyeth his own knowledge, and I dare say, betrayeth the Truth.
You that are trusted with the carriage of things, in Truth, and for the Truth,
are not only bound to make known the truth of what you do and say, to the
world, as it has been said; but, further you are obliged in conscience, and
the public expects it of you, that you press home the Truth with vigor and
resolution, in all freedom, downright, in all places, and at all occasions,
where you meet for consultation, deliberation, debate, and conclusion of things
concerning Church or State, in Politic and Ecclesiastike Assemblies; and in so
doing, you will gain the price, having all honest men to stand to you; and will
put such a terror in Malignants, that their malice will be much abated.

Surely, I am persuaded, had you been stouter in the Synod, these strong
heads, and factious few ones, who hitherto have troubled the settling of
Church-affaires, and are likely to trouble the State, if it be not well looked
to and nearly, had long ere now been quashed; and so, if you had not been so
meal-mouthed with the sollicisme in reason, of the time and place, I humbly
conceive you had not met with so many rubs in your public meetings, nor had
your wholesome counsels found such opposition, nor your men of war been so kept
off Field action. All which has not only done prejudice to the public
Service; but has brought things to great hazard, yea, almost to the undoing of
all: But, God in his mercy has turned the balance, no thank to your
remissness, wherein God shows, although men will not do what they ought and
can do for his Service, upon I cannot tell what consideration, he will do the
work of men, by no men.

When I think on John Knox, and George Buchanan, how freely they spoke and
writ, at all times, and upon all occasions, when the Church and State were
concerned, without fear of any man or Assembly whatsoever; having nothing
before their eyes, but the glory of God, and the good of his people. They were
weak and infirm men, as we are all; but their stout zeal to the public was
admirable, and is ever to be remembered by us; not only to their praise, but
also to spur us up to imitate them in this heroike virtue. For me, I value the
zeal and stoutnesse of these two Champions of the Truth, more than all their
other virtues, howsoever eminent they were.

But, you will say, It is now another age, and consequently another way of
carriage of things is required. It is true, we live now in another age, which
is worse than that of these men: Wherefore, we must then strive with greater
zeal and virtue, to oppose the wickedness of this time; For although, by a
prudentiall preventing and declining, by clear-seeing men, many plots and
devises of the wicked, may be for a time shunned: Yet, there is no way to make
the wicked leave or weary of resisting and oppressing goodness, but by a
vigorous and stout opposing of them.

Besides, although the Cards be new we play with all; yet it is the same very
Game that our Fathers had in Scotland, and our Neighbors had lately, in our
days, in France; Where and when nothing did prevail, or do good unto the
Cause, but resolution and zeal in carrying on the things, not only against the
Common Enemy; but also, against the false Friends, and they that walked then
any other way, betrayed the Cause, and purchased unto themselves the title of
silly inconsiderable men, of whatsoever rank or degree they were.

To say nothing of the judgment of God that fell upon them, and to this day
hangs upon them and theirs. I shun examples in this case; for I love to reprove
faults, and spare men's persons.

Moreover, since the Malignants, every where, are so busy running to and fro,
like so many Bees, with great care and heat, and so bold, to forge and invent
lies, by word and writing, to abuse the World, and so wrong treacherously the
public Service:

Why should not then faithful men be diligent and stout, in all freedom, to
make known the truth of things, for the confirming of the well-affected, and
for stopping of the mouth of the wicked, and so consequently, for the better
carrying on of the work now in hand?

Now, being thus friendly and freely admonished by one who wishes well to the
Common Cause you now serve, with his whole heart, and unto your selves in
particular, in so far as you are faithful and earnest, zealous and stout in
this Cause of God and his people, laying aside all humane prudence, which is
not subservient to zeal and stoutnesse, as well as to faithfulness and
earnestness: I hope you will take care to mind this slip, by giving unto the
public a true and free relation of all things from time to time, as the
occasion shall require; and in your meetings, about Church and State, to be
stout and free, for the advancing of the public Service to the glory of God,
to the good of his people, and to the contentment and satisfaction of
well-affected men, in despite of malignancy.

In the interim, till you perform this duty, give me leave, in this place,
plainly and homely to put unto the view of the World, the relation of some
things of special note, hardly well known to many, at least taken notice of
but by a few, concerning the carriage of the Scots ever since the very first
beginning of these unhappy troubles to this day: the knowledge whereof, will do
good, I am sure, to the public Service, and will help to right, in some
measure, men both faithful and constant in the Work: Yea, the commemoration of
these things, although known, I am persuaded, will give content to all honest
and well-meaning men, unto whom the public good is dearer than the interest of
any particular man whatsoever, with whom they ought to go along no further than
the particular man goes on with the public of Church and State, laying aside
all other relation. As for other men, I value them no more than the open
declared enemies, who prefer the pleasure of one abused Prince, under pretext
of obligation they have to him, unto the good of Church and State.

And thus I begin. The Common Enemy having design to bring these Dominions
under spiritual and temporal slavery, all things disposed for his ends,
according to his mind; thinks fit for his purpose to begin this great work in
Scotland, promising unto himself to find least opposition there, for reasons
which hitherto, by Gods mercy, has deceived him.

The Scots being pressed to receive the corrupt Liturgy, (to say nothing in
this place, of what was before put upon them) fairly decline it, by iterate
supplications and humble remonstrances unto the King: But nothing will do the
turn, they must receive the Prelates Masterpiece, and Romes essay, the
Nove-Antic-Service-Book, either by fair play or foul.

The Scots on the other side, constant to their principles, refuse to receive
the Book; for which they are published by the Prelates and the Court, to be
refractaries and rude fellows, without God or Religion: Which gave occasion to
the Scots to make known, not only unto their own people, at home; but, to all
men abroad; namely, to their Brethren of England, by a public Declaration,
their condition, how they were wronged, the equity of their Cause, their
lawful proceedings, and their good intentions: by this means, their friends
good will is confirmed unto them, and their enemies design, in some measure,
is broken; who did intend, by lies, to steal from them the good affection of
their friends.

Next, The Scots being constrained to have recourse to the Sword, for their
just defense, all other means tried failing, were back-bitten as mutinous,
taking Arms for poverty, with intention to cast off the just Authority of their
Native and lawful Prince, and to invade England for the spoil thereof.

To these most pernicious calumnies, the Scots replyeth by another Declaration,
particularly addressed unto England; whereby, they made known the absolute
necessity of their taking up Arms, with their honest intentions therein: All
which, they made good thereafter, in due time, by real performance.

For, so soon as they had occasion to show their respect to the King, they did
it, with all readiness and submission; and when they might have undone the
Kings Army, and consequently invaded England, if they had pleased, and that
with small opposition, instead of doing wrong to any English, they supplied the
wants of those who were come against them, with Victuals, which then did abound
in the Scots Army, but was very short in the Kings; and having the flower of
the Kings Army in their power, I mean the party that went to Dunslaw; they
suffered it to return back in safety, and used it with all civility,
notwithstanding these chosen ones had come against promise, and without cause,
to destroy them, and to invade the Country.

Thereafter, the Peace being made, the Scots according to the agreement, went
quietly home, and laid down their Arms, as was promised.

Then the Plot the abused King and his good Counsel had at Berwick, to draw
the Chief men of Scotland to him, for to destroy them; and the breach of the
Parliament; the burning in London of the Articles of agreement made at the
borders, and many other like things, did not move the Scots, to recede in any
measure from their dutiful respects to the King, nor from their love to the
English Nation; neither the imprisonment of their Commissioners, against the
Law of Nations, and the safe conduct granted unto them upon public Faith; nor
the great Forces prepared against them, by Sea and by Land; nor the many lies
spread against them, through all England; nor the Prelatical excommunication so
canonically spewed out against them, in all the Churches and Chapels of
England: All these things, I say, did not make them give the least expression
of disrespect to the King, nor disaffection to the English.

Upon this, the Scots published a Declaration anew unto the World, whereby they
made known unto all, how hardly they were dealt with all; for, not only the
things stipulated with them, were not kept to them; but also, more and greater
wrongs than formerly, were done to them: Yea, a second expedition of War
undertaken to destroy them; and to fill up all, more lies of no less
importance, than the conquering of England, made and spread abroad of them, with
other thunderbolts of the Prelaticall censure, shot against them: Also, they
make known by this Declaration, their Christian resolution, and just
enterprise, with their good intentions in taking Arms again, for their own
defense, and the Cause which they maintain; And by it, assures their Brethren
of England, although they were resolved to come into their Country to seek out
their Enemies, who were there gathering against them; and not to suffer these
wicked ones to come unto them, and so make their own Country the Seat of the
unhappy War: Yet, they had not the least thought to do any hurt to any body in
England, except to their professed Enemies: So far were they from having the
least thought of making a conquest. And that, when they had brought their
Enemies to reason, they would go home in Peace.

All which, was thereafter performed by the Scots to the full: For, first,
being entered into England, and having rencountred one party of their Enemies,
and routed it; when it was in their power to pursue the Victory, they stayed at
New Castle till things were agreed upon, betwixt the King and them.

This incoming of the Scots, gave occasion and liberty to diverse of the Nobles
of England, (of whom, some since have betrayed the Cause of God, and of his
people; what by open Warfare, and what by clandestine undermining:) to desire,
of the King, a Parliament, for the good of the Kingdom. The King then durst not
refuse their demand, by reason of the Scots, more then the continuance of it,
which he granted likewise thereafter, for the same Cause.

Then the King, finding that the Parliament did not only cross, but quite
spoil his designs, be plots with his Army, which he had raised against the
Scots, to come and destroy the said Parliament, and to take the spoil of
London, for their reward. But the business being discovered, fails; besides,
they durst not undertake, howsoever they had promised, for fear of the Scots,
who then were so near.

The King continuing in his wonted courses, after a little pause, tryes the
Scots if they will do the deed; and offers unto them for recompense, not only
the spoil of London, but also the four Counties next adjacent unto their
Country, to be adjoined hereafter to it, with Jewels of great value in pawn
for performance, if only they would be engaged into the business.

All these great offers, could not make the Scots willing to give their consent
in any kind to this wickedness: For, they not only rejected the Kings
offers; but also, gives notice of the Plot, to the Parliament, and to the City
of London, that they might make their best use of it.

So, you may see, how that the Scots, under God, are the cause of the
Assembling of the Parliament, of the continuance of it, being assembled, and of
the preservation of it, from total destruction and ruin.

The King, seeing that he was stopped by the Scots, first, in their own
Country, next, in England, to carry on his great design, takes the Irish
Papists by the hand, rather then be always disappointed; and they willingly
undertake to levy Arms for his Service, that is, for the Romish Cause; the
Kings design being subservient to the Romish Cause; although he abused thinks
otherwise, and believes that Rome serves to his purpose. But, to begin the
Work, they must make sure all the Protestants; and, if they cannot otherwise,
by Murdering and Massacring them; for they knew them, according to the
Principles of Religion and State, to be forward, either for the Covenanters of
Scotland, or for the troublesome Parliament of England, if not for both. But
the Irish, neither would, nor durst enter to any open Action, so long as the
Scots Army, in England, was afoot; therefore by all means, it must be sent home
and cashiered: and to facilitate the business, the Court-Parasites,
Instruments of Iniquity, with their Emissaries, must raise and spread abroad,
jealousies of the Scots, among the people of the Country and City, namely in
and about the Houses of Parliament; who having not before their eyes, the real
Honesty and Integrity of the Scots, known by so many faithful and loyal
expressions; and not keeping in their mind the many good offices done to them
by the Scots; gives, in silliness of mind, ear and place to the crafty tales
and apprehensions, invented by the Agents of the Common Enemy, to bring them to
confusion and trouble.

So the Plot takes by the silly ones, and is set forward by the hid
Malignan's. Yea, in a word, it is managed with such address and success, that
the Scots must go home; and till they had done it, there could be no quiet, but
increase of jealousies.

The Scots, although they were not acquainted with the hight of mischief that
was intended against the Church and State in these Dominions, by the Common
Enemy, nor with the ways of it; yet, albeit they thought it very dangerous,
after so many attempts of evil doing by the Enemy to retire them from England,
not as yet well settled; and to cashiere their Army, remitting the event of
things to God, resolve to return home, and dismiss their Army, and so make
known unto all the World their Candor and Integrity, and to take away all
jealousies; both from the King and from England; which they do according to
promise, not failing in the least circumstance, yea, not of the day.

Well, the King having gained this point, to send home the Scots, and to make
them lay down their Arms, resolves to follow them into Scotland, and to try
once more to draw them to his design; no persuasion being able to stay or to
stop his voyage: he goes in haste from London, and overtaketh the Scots as
their were upon their removal from New Castle for Scotland: He vieweth their
Army by the way, and talks with the Prime Officers thereof: He gives Order
to some of the good Physicians about him, to feel the pulse of the Scots
softly, but they found the Scots pulse did not beat as they could have wished.
He goes on in his journey into Scotland, whither he is no sooner arrived, but
he puts another design afoot, premeditated with many more before: for, it is
the custom of the wise Court, to have, at one and the same time, diverse
undertakings in design, of which, it is a very hard matter, it one or other do
not take effect. Yea, they have found but too true, to our woeful experience,
that many have taken effect, and that not of the lesser ones, wherefore the
Court will never cease to devise and invent enterprises.

The Plot then set afoot by the K. in Scotland, was to make a considerable.
Party there for his ends: and to make the business more facile, he resolves
to make sure the Chief men of Scotland, who were likely either to stop the
design, or not further it. But, this Plot is also discovered, and so it
failed. The next recourse was to the Irish Papists, his good Friends, unto
whom, from Scotland, a Commission is dispatched, under the Great Seal (which
Seal was at that instant time, in the Kings own custody) of that Kingdom, to
hasten, according to former agreement, the raising of the Irish in Arms; who no
sooner receive this new Order, but they break out, and at the first beginning
of their Rebellion, declared that they had no ill will against any Scots in
Ireland, for they were afraid of the Scots going over to the help of their
Contrymen, and so they would be stopped to go on with their Work; but their
spleen was against these English Protestants, who were Friends to that wicked
Parliament in England, so untoward to the good King, and so adverse to their
Catholic Cause.

This Declaration of the Irish, did not (although in favor of their
Countrymen) hinder the Scots to offer their present Service, for the
repressing of the Rebellion before things grew worse; The King fairly refuses
the offer, and answering with verbal thanks, said that he neither could, nor
would do any thing in the business, without the advice and assistance of the
Parliament, now a foot in England; whereunto he was to repair in all haste. So
he leaves Scotland, saying that every day he stayed there, was the loss of a
County to him. He comes to London, a little before Christmas; the Rebellion
having begun in Ireland in October: But he goe's very seldom to the Parliament,
and when he goes thither, he says nothing concerning the Irish Rebellion,
till by importunity he was constrained to it; and then what he said, was
little, cold, and ambiguous. And when the Scots, by their Commissioners, who
had followed him from Scotland hither, did offer again a considerable help of
ten thousand men, things were so carried, both in the Counsel and in the
Parliament, by the corrupt and ignorant Party then, that the Scots were delayed
from day to day, by one shift or other, for a long space, before that
conditions could be agreed upon with them, for the sending of their help unto
Ireland. And it was a longer time after the agreement, before things could be
furnished unto them, for their Voyage.

By those means, the Rebels had ado with less opposition; and consequently,
with less difficulty carried on their barbarous Work of spoiling, burning, and
massacring innocent people of all rank and condition, without regard to sex or
age.

The Scots are no sooner gone to Ireland, but they assist their Friends with
such affection and success, that after some skirmishes and renconters with the
Rebels, the North Country of Ireland, whereunto their help was particularly
assigned, became pretty well cleared of the Rebels, although much wasted and
and spoiled by them.

In this course, has the Scots continued to this day, constantly opposing
these bloody wretches, notwithstanding the change that has fallen in the South
part of that Kingdom, by the treachery of those whom the Parliament employed
and trusted to. Then when the King made a Cessation with these barbarous
Cannibals, the Scots resolutely declared against it, and have manfully opposed
it to this day: Without which opposition of the Scots, it had been received
every where in Ireland, and the Rebels then, having nothing to do at home, had
come hither in Bands and Troops into this Island.

Thus did and still does the Scots pursue their Point, notwithstanding all the
hardship they have suffered, and yet suffer in the Service, partly by reason of
the great troubles here of the Parliament, not being able to supply their
Friends, as they would, and as they need; partly by the negligence and
unfaithfulness of those, who have been employed by the Parliament, and
entrusted to have a care of supplying this need; which has been so great, that
the Scots Army in Ireland, had absolutely starved for cold and hunger, if they
had not been helped from Scotland, in a high measure.

To return unto England: The misled King having left the Parliament,
accompanied, or at least followed by numbers of men of diverse degrees, Traitors
to God and to their Country; namely by those double Traitors, who were Members
of the Houses of Parliament: for, they not only have been dishonest and
unfaithful to the Church and State, whereof they are born Members and
Children; but, they have betrayed the trust wherewith they were trusted in
both. By the assistance of which, he sets his design on foot, to make open War
against the Parliament, (although under a hid notion) to destroy it; all other
Devices and Plots, contrived by him and his, having failed as we have seen.

Upon this, the Scots, in their respect to the King, love unto their Brethren
in England, and above all, in their affection to the Cause of the Church of
God, send Commissioners unto the King, and from him to the Parliament, as the
occasion should serve. They found the King at York, where he was pulling his
Sword out of its sheath, with all his might, and shaping it in all haste, which
God in his Jugements has suffered him to thrust in the bowels of so many
thousands of his people, here, so unnaturally and barbarously; not only afar
off, by not stopping it, by connivence or by Commission to his Agents and
Instruments, as in Ireland and Scotland; but being present in Person, and
taking pleasure in doing of it in his own sight, and seeing of it done.

In this place I do affirm, that there has been more Christian Blood shed in
these latter years, under the end of K. James and K. Charles Raigns, by their
Commissions, Approbations, connivences, and not-forbidding, what at home, and
what abroad, all which upon the matter they might have stopped, if it had been
their pleasure, then were in the time of the ten Roman Persecutions. God turn
the Kings heart toward him first, otherwise he will never turn it toward his
people.

The Scots, as we were saying, send to him, to desire him to leave off the
design of embroiling himself and the people in a Civil War, in this Kingdom
of England; withal, to offer him their dutiful Service of Mediation and
Intercession, for the taking away of all mistakes, and smoothing of things in a
fair way, betwixt him and the Parliament. The misled King resolved to go on in
evil courses, not only neglects the respective and hearty offer of the Scots;
but sends them home, not suffering them to come unto the Parliament, according
to their order and desire, which was to try all fair means for the hindering
of a War in England, and to stop the Massacres in Ireland.

The King having thus dismissed the Scots, goe's to his Work, which, having
overcome some rubs at the first, he carries on apace; for having gathered
together considerable Forces at Shrewsbury, from thence with his Army he
marches toward London, notwithstanding the Parliaments-Army lay, as it were,
in his way, who met with him at Edgehill, and (contrary to his expectation)
fights with him. He, after the Battle, having recollected the remnant of his
men, although he had had the worse, continues his design for London, and drew
very near unto it; but being, by strong hand, constrained to retire, he goes
to Oxford, where he has kept his Court constantly ever since till this day.

The Scots seeing the commotions increasing in England, and considering the
chief Instruments of those evils, could not in conscience and honesty, sit
quiet any longer, and neither say nor do, while the State and Church of their
Brethren in England, were thus in so great troubles; send first a Commissioner
from their Church unto the Parliament, to desire them, that as God, in his good
Providence, had furnished them just occasion to cast out the Prelates from among
them, not only as unusefull Members of their Assembly; but also, as Enemies to
all their just proceedings for the good of Church and State; so they would be
pleased to thrust out these Tyrants and belly-gods from the Church, as main
Instruments of all the disturbances, troubles, and miseries which are come, and
of more, in all appearance, yet coming, if God in his mercy prevent them not.

The Commissioner, after some debate, having obtained his demand, returns
homeward, and taking his way by the Court, then about Shrewsbury, made known to
the King how he had sped in his errand, wherewith he had acquainted him before,
as he was going to the Parliam. And he desires the King to give his consent
unto the casting of the Prelates out of the Church, as he had done to the
putting them out of the Assembly of Parliament. To which the King did reply
little or nothing; but he told the Commissioner, that he, and they who sent
him, were hugely mistaken, if they did think that the Houses of Parliament does
intend any settled Reformation, namely, as in Scotland; for, said, he, you see
how they do not repress the Schisms and Sects of all kinds, which abound in
and about London; yea, these evils are countenanced by some underhand. Would
to God that the Commissioner had had as just reason then, to answer unto the
King, that he had been misinformed, and that an untruth had been told him
concerning Sectaries, as he has been mistaken in the intention of both Houses
of Parliament, for the setleing Religion, according to the best way, as it
expressed in the National Covenant.

Then, after that things, by degrees, had come to a great hight betwixt King
and Parliament, much blood being shed, not only in skirmishes and rencounters,
but also in pitched Battle, to wit, at Edge hill. The Scots not being able to
forbear any further, to try once more by fair means, if it were possible, to
stop the course of those miseries, too far already gone on, send word to the
King, then at Oxford, and to the Parliament, of their good intentions; and
demand a pass and safe conduct from both, for Commissioners from them, to go
unto both, and return home, as also to go to and fro betwixt them as cause
should require. Of the Parliament, they had easily what they demanded, with
thanks for their good will: But the King, not liking their offer, was loath to
grant a pass; yet being put to it, he could not fairly deny, and so at length,
after some reluctance, he sends a pass as was desired, and safe conduct to the
Scots; which being received, they send their Commissioners straight to the
King, unto whom they remonstrate home how that he had, by bad Counsel, cast
himself in a Labyrinth of Evil, and the people of his Dominions; which,
doubtless, would bring both him and them to utter ruin, if not timely stopped
in Gods Mercy, by his Wisdom and good Counsel.

The Commissioners, instead of any positive answer, receive nothing but doubs,
ambiguities, delays, and shifts, whereof nothing could be made, but that the
misled King was resolved to his own and his peoples ruin.

After a time, the Scots Commissioners told the King, that, according to their
Order and Instructions, they intended to go unto the Parliament; which they
hoped he would think well of, and approve. But the King, notwithstanding the
pass and safe conduct he had granted them to that purpose, would not suffer
them to go unto the Parliament; yea, they were not permitted to speak with the
Commissioners from the Parliament, who were then sent thither to the Court to
treat when they were there. Such was the adversenesse of the Court to Peace,
notwithstanding all the Kings Protestations.

Further, the Scots Commissioners were so hardly used by the Court, namely, by
the Prelaticall crew, that they could not in safety go openly and freely abroad.

This is not all. At that time the Rulers of the Court send abroad their
Agents, to tell every where, namely, in and about London, what indignity the
Scots did offer, first unto the King, then unto the Parliament, and to the
whole English Nation, by taking upon them (being but Subjects) to examine the
disterences betwixt the King and Parliament, to compose them, and to make a
Peace; it being more honorable both for the King, and Parliament, and the
whole Nation, to be beholden for this unto a Neighbour-State or Prince, then
unto the Kings own Subjects, not so good as others in many respects.

As this Discourse was invented, and spewed up and down by Malignants, so it
was received by the simpler sort, not knowing the interest of States, less,
wherein the true Honor of Princes, States, and Nations consists: Yet, they
might have considered, that it is better to take up things quietly at home,
then to trouble the Neighbors with our affairs.

The Scots Commissioners, after some Months abode at Court, seeing they could
do no good with the abused King, desire him to dismiss them, which he did put
off from day to day, till at last he was written to by the State of Scotland,
that if he sent not home in safety the Commissioners betwixt such and such a
day, they would hold it as an open breach of the Peace, and that they would
provide for businesses accordingly.

Upon this the Commissioners, laden with fair, but conditional promises from
the King (who yet would not anger them) of Love and Care of that his Native
Kingdom, so that they would be quiet, (for he could not stop his mouth to say
unto them, that if they would not stir, he could easily compass his ends in
England) take their leave at Court, and go home. At their arrival, they find a
number, in the South-West of their Country, of Papists and other Malignants,
men of broken for tunes, risen to disturb the Peace of the Kingdom, by Order
from the King, notwithstanding his fair words; which commotion was presently
quashed, through Gods Mercy, by the diligence and forwardness of the good
Gentry and Nobility in those parts, who did rise like one man against these
Sons of Belial.

As the Scots Commissioners retired home, the Houses of Parliament of England
were made acquainted how that their good intentions were frustrated, themselves
hardly used for a long time, but at last, with difficulty had gotten home.

Now, the State of Scotland seeing the Common Enemy come to the hight, that
nothing will satisfy him, but total subversion of Church and State in these
Dominions; only they, perhaps, might be kept for the last, although in
intention they had been the first; jugeth it not enough, for their interest in
the Common Cause, to keep an Army in Ireland; but also to be upon their guard
at home, that they might stop any enterprise the Common Enemy should undertake
against them to have any progress in their Country, if they did not
altogether prevent it: and to help their Brethren in England with their Sword,
since all other means so often tried, were disappointed by the malice of the
Enemies. And so much the rather were they moved to this, that the Enemy was
prevailing almost without let, for by that time he was Master not only of the
Field, but also of all the strong hold in the North, except Hull alone, with a
numbrous and victorious Army of Horse and Foot, domineering and spoiling every
where: likewise the West being almost altogether gone by the loss of Excester,
the defeat given to the Parliaments Forces at the Vyses, and the base
surrendering of Bristol, Banbury, etc. the Enemy did think to carry all before
him, ready to enter into the Associated Counties, yea, to come to the Gates of
London; which they had done in all appearance, without the let of that Noble
and never enough praised exploit of the Earl of Essex, of relieving of
Gloucester, almost at the last extremity, although valiantly desended by that
brave Governor Massey, in despite of the proud Enemy; and thereafter in
beating of him at Newbery.

While the Parliament was thus low, many faintharted, yea Members of the two
Houses, ran away to the Enemy, and others did withdraw, studying, to their
eternal shame, to make their Peace more plausibly with the Enemy, and not to
run over to him at discretion as others had done.

But when things are thus almost in despair, then it is thought fit time to
have recourse to the Scots, and to call them for help: The Parliament, to try
if they could do the business themselves, without troubling the Scots, was
wisdom: for what need you call for aid, and trouble your Neighbors, when you
can do the business alone? but not to call for help till things be too low, it
is very dangerous, say those who dive more deeply in affairs of this nature.
But, the reason why the Scots were so long a calling in for help, was, not that
the English were not willing to trouble their Brethren the Scots, for, why
should they think of troubling the Scots, since their Fathers had been so ready
to help Scotland, in its distress then? Generous hearts will as freely receive
a courtesy as they do one, otherwise they were proud, and self-conceited:
But, the true cause, (say they who know the mysteries of the time) first was,
that the Sectaries, prevailing with the Rulers of affairs, did so keep them
from meddling with the Scots, whom they knew to be no less adversaries to
Schisms and Sects, then to Popery and Prelacy: Next, there were some who yet
kept still a bit of a Bishop in their Belly, although by both Houses declared
to be not only unusefull in Church and State, but also enemies to both.

Howsoever, these considerations must be laid aside for a time, and in such
extremity the Scots must be called to help; yea, some of those who are said to
be the greatest sticklers for Sectaries, must at last be employed in their
calling in; which was long of coming, after it was resolved upon, by the shifts
of the Enemies of Church and State.

The Scots, notwithstanding all that had been signified unto them, concerning
the favoring of Sectaries by the Parliament, and of their retaining somewhat
of the old leaven of Prelacy; seeing that their help was altogether needful to
save the Church and State of England from ruin; heartily received the call,
being already resolved beforehand upon the Point, and undertaketh, with a
Christian and manly resolution, to engage themselves in a seen danger, and to
undergo the hazard (but, for Christ and his people no hazard is to be regarded)
to help their afflicted Brethren: Yet, with this precaution, that the
Parliament should sincerly join with them in the settling of the Church, as they
were heartily willing to assist them against the Common Enemy.

This condition was granted unto the Scots by the Commissioners from the
Parliament of England; and to this end, it was agreed upon, at the desire of
the Scots, that there should be one Covenant and League made betwixt both
Kingdoms, and sworn to, for the settling of the Church according to the Word of
God, and conform to the best Reformed Churches, and by name, to the Church of
Scotland; with the just Liberty of the people, and against all opposition
whatsoever. But, because the English Commissioners would not take upon them to
draw up and to make the Covenant there in Scotland, they desired that there
might be Commissioners sent from Scotland unto the Parliament of England, for
the drawing up of the said Covenant, and so was done; for the Scots
Commissioners assisting, the Covenant, after diverse debates, was made, and
thereafter subsigned, sworn first by the Houses, Synod, and the Scots
Commissioners, and then by the people, and sent unto Scotland, where it was
received, subsigned, and sworn by the convention of States, and then by the
people: with all, in testimony of their true meaning, the Houses of Parliament
desires the Commissioners of Scotland to assist in the Synod, in their
deliberations and conclusions concerning the Church.

The Covenant is no sooner taken, but the King leaves off to accuse the
Parliament of continuing Schisms and Sects, and thereafter tells us, that he
will have care of tender consciences, and this to make faction and division, as
we have seen since.

While things were thus managing at London, about the Covenant, the English
Commissioners in Scotland, are agreed with the Scots, concerning the Army they
were to send into England: the Articles of agreement being drawn up, and
consented to by both parties; Commissions were given for twenty thousand men;
who with all the haste possible, were gathered together, and then immediately
set forth: so in January they march, when it was both great frost and snow, and
entering into England, with small opposition come as far in as Tyne: the
Country, much burdened before, was either all wasted and utterly spoiled by
the Enemy, hearing the Scots coming with a great number of men, and great
power; so they could likely find nothing in that Country, but what by strength
of Arm they could pull out of the hands of the Enemy. Thus did the Scots fight
for a while with their Enemies, to wit, with a multitude of men well armed,
with evil weather, in the most intemperate time of the year, and with want of
Victuals, which was the worst of all: and truly, it had gone hard with them,
if it had not been for the provisions sent to them from home, which came but by
difficile and uncertain carriage by Sea, by reason of the storms which fell out
then: Yet, these resolute men were still gaining ground upon the Enemy, in
number of men as great as they, at least, and far exceeding them in Horse, till
at last they passed the River Tyne, having so wearied and harrassed the Enemy
with continual skirmishs and onsets, obliging him to lie without, and keep so
strait and constant guard and watch, that in the end he was constrained to
retire, and give way to the constant for wardnesse of the Scots; diverse of his
men leaving him for weariness and want, others falling sick, and numbers being
killed at diverse rencounters; at one namely there was eight hundred of them
slain at Bauden.

For all this, while the Scots were thus fighting with these three Enemies
abovenamed, for the Common Cause expressed in the Covenant, some men at
London, and that not of the meaner sort, did not stick to whisper in the ear
one to another, that the Scots did not carry themselves neither as military
men, nor as men of courage: this was the less regarded, that it was made by
those, who, against their will, did give way to their calling in.

The Scots did so take up the Enemy in the North, about New Castle and Duresme,
that Sir Thomas Fairfax, assisted by Sir John Meldrum, took the Field again,
(having for a long time been confined to Hull,) and tries Fortune: he begins at
Selby, which he manfully assaults, and happily takes.

Then those who had not been well pleased at the coming in of the Scots, did
begin to say, Now since Selby was taken in, the Scots might retire, they could
do the work without them; but this discourse did not take by many.

The Enemy hearing the news of this brave exploit, fearing for York, least Sir
Thomas should carry it, run as fast as they could toward that City.

The Scots, as soon as they hear of the Enemies removal, go after him on his
heels, taking some of his men and bagage, and follow him unto the Gates of
York. Upon this, My Lord Fairfax and Sir Thomas join with the Scots; who send
to the Earl of Manchester for his help, to besiege York, the Town being of such
circuit, that the Scots alone, having left of their men in Sunderland and other
places taken by them from the Enemy, near New Castle, were not able to compass
it with such circumlineation as was needful, and keep the Fields, so full of
adversaries; yea, not with the help that My Lord Fairfax brought unto them.
Manchester joins with the Scots: There were some here that were against
Manchesters going Northward to the Scots, not caring how much work the Scots
had, and how little success.

A little hereafter, to be short, while the Forces of Manchester and Fairfax,
joined with the Scots, are about the siege of York unanimously; there is one
who goe's from hence to sow some dissension betwixt the Generals, Lesley,
Fairfax, and Manchester; which design is disappointed by Gods Mercy: then,
there is another set a foot by others, to wit, by the Sectaries, which,
although it did not rise to a breach, yet it did come to a distaste and
dislike; for the Sectaries under Manchester his command, seeing that the way of
the Scots was set absolutely against their intentions, concerning the
Church-businesses, as mainly did appear by the pressing of Church Government by
the Scots in the Synod, and their oppositions of Sects, think themselves, that
since they were come to some strength, they must not rely so much upon the
Scots, now being able to stand upon their legs with their own Force, and do
somewhat to eclipse the Scots whom they had so far extolled formerly, which,
while they were weak, and in dislike with the people, for the miscarriage of
things, (say those who pretend to know the main passages of businesses;) now at
the siege of York they begin to show themselves, who had been under a cloud,
and by some notable action, think to make the world take notice of them: so a
party of them, without order of their General, enter in the Town of York,
thinking to carry all before them: but, not acquainting their friends of their
design, they could not be seconded, and so were repulsed with great lose, and
became wiser thereafter then to undertake any thing more in this kind; wherein
they did show, that when they did think it time for them to do, they would
depend upon no order; and so, neglecting Military Discipline, bring all to
confusion. This fault was excused for once by ignorance.

After some months siege, the united Forces before York hearing of Prince
Rupert his coming toward them, send a party of both Nations into the Town of
Manchester to secure the place, and to busy the Enemy in his way toward them,
till they had advanced their work at York: The Enemy taking no notice of that
place, and passing through with his daily increasing Army, goes on as he was
approaching, the united Forces send Scouts to know his march and his strength;
upon whose relation, they leave the siege, and go to meet and fight him,
thinking if they had dispatched his Forces, they would have less add in the
work they had stook so long to: Upon misinformation, they take the wrong way to
meet the Enemy; so he had, upon this mistake, free access to the Town.

The united Forces, seeing their mischance, turn their course to stop the
Enemies further coming Southward; he, puffed up with the success of gaining
free access to the Town, resolves to follow the united Forces, and fight them,
promising unto himself, that his good Fortune would continue; and if he had
given a blow to their Forces, he would easily put an end to the design in
hand; for the Scots being once routed, the main let and hinderance to the
proceedings of the Court, would much diminush the Reputation of the Parliaments
party.

On the other side, the united Forces perceiving the Enemies mind, turn head
toward him, fight with him with Gods blessing, and rout him; but, not without
loss; for, notwithstanding all the care taken by the old and experimented
Chief Commanders, first to put all in as good order as time and place could
permit, and to keep things in order in time of Battle; the new raised Horses of
Yorkshire, neglecting the command and example of their Noble and Gallant
Leader, who in this occasion, as in all other, carried himself valorously; fall
in disorder themselves, and turning toward these of their own side that were
to second them, put many in such confusion, that they would take no notice of
any Commander or Leader; yea, they carry some away with them by violence.

In this Battle, diverse gallant men of both Nations had an honorable share of
the Victory: but, none I hear of, without disparagement to any, did appear so
much in action that day with gallantry, as David Lesley.

Here, the Sectaries, to indear themselves to the people, attribute unto
themselves the honor of the day, and stick not to call their Champion The
Savor of the three Kingdoms, when God knows, he that they extol so much, did
not appear at all in the heat of the business; having received at the first a
little scar, kept off, till the worst was past.

After the Victory, and the Town of York taken in, the Generals write to the
Houses of Parliament to give thanks to God; and, in token of their
thankfulness to setle the business of the Church, and try once more if it
were possible to reconcile differences with the King, in a peaceable way.

Things being settled at York, by common consent, the Scots go to New Castle, to
besiege it, as the fittest service they could do for the public then, near the
place they join with the Earl Calender his Forces, who had come from Scotland
to repress the raging Enemy about New Castle, while Lesley was at York with
his Army* the Scots drawing near New Castle, Calender and David Lesley, with
six men more, went to view the place, from which there issued two Troops of
Horse, which the eight men routed, having charged twice through them.

The Scots for a long time endeavored to take in the Town by fair means, but
at last, through the obstinacy of those who were within, they were constrained
to storm it, and so carried it.

Those very men, who at the Battle near York were put in disorder and fled
with others, gave the assault, and took New Castle.

Thus, the Scots being Masters of the Town, wrong no man, woman, nor child,
takes a mediocre composition for the spoil; in a word, they carry themselves
with such moderation, that the Enemies who had been in Arms against them, were
constrained to speak well of them.

Few days after the taking of New Castle, the Castle of Tinmouth is taken by
the Scots. The Winter by this time beginning, after so hard employment of the
last Winter, and so toyling a Somerwork, as the siege of York and the Battle,
besides diverse skirmishes and rencounters with the Enemy, then the long siege
of New Castle, and at last the storming of it; they resolve to put their men in
Garrisons.

During the siege of New Castle, many calumnies was raised against the Scots,
and spewed abroad by Malignants, and received here by the simpler sort. As the
taking of New Castle, was the most important piece of service of that kind,
that could be done to the Kingdom of England, namely to the City of London; so
it did rejoice all honest men: but, on the other side, the Malignants of all
kinds were sorry at the doing of it; but more sorry, that it was done by
those, who are so constantly opposite to their courses.

The Scots are not sooner peaceable Masters of New Castle, but the trade is
renewed again betwixt it and London, to the comfort of the poor of London, who
were starving for want of fire, and to the benefit of the richer sort. The
Coals above and under ground, were rated and disposed on in equity, to the
best use of the public, not wronging the particular, according to the advice
and by the Order of the Committee of both Kingdoms, then residing in the North,
as the Commissioners appointed by the Parliament can be witnesses; to whose
consciences I appeal, if all this be not true. And the English prifoners,
taken by the Scots, have been disposed on according to the will of the Houses
of Parliament, as soon as it was possible to be done by Military Order.

Now the Scots, after the taking of New Castle, although they were free of the
open opposition of the Common Enemy for a time, yet they were molested, vexed,
crossed, and traduced by the Malignants, Agents to the Enemy, in the Northern
parts, besides those in and about London.

Here you must know, that those of the Northern Countries of England, have been
constantly given to superstition, as men neglected in their instruction, or of
purpose detained in ignorance by the Prelates, fore-castingby that means to make
them the furer for their design: And so, the King himself, at two several
times, did find them ready for his design: The Earl of New Castle thereafter,
did find them likewise ready to follow him: So, what by breeding, and what by
latter years custom, they are for the most part in that Country Malignants.
Next, the heavy pressures of Soldiers for so many years, with the barrenness
of the soil (the Seots now coming upon them) made them clamotous, things not
going according to their mind; For, first, not liking the Cause; next, being
already so spent, they were very sensible of the least thing could be demanded
of them; joint the malice of some of the chief men in the Country, made the
people murmr at first, them rise up in Arms; but, blessed be God, the
insurrection was soon calmed.

Further, those who are employed by the Parliament to manage the affairs of
these Countries, have put all the power in the hands of these who are wicked
Malignants, being either professed Recusants, Sectaries of diverse sorts, or at
the best Prelatiques, sticking to the old Service Book; yea, some of those who
have been in actual Rebellion against the State under the Earl of New Castle,
who are of the Committees of these Countries, now having the power in their
hands, spoil the Country, and oppress good men, laying the blame of all upon
the Scots, as has been of late represented unto the House of Commons, by men
without exception, deputed hither from these Countries, in the name of many
good men, to acquaint the Houses with the state of businesses there.

The Malignants of the North Countries carry their businesses so, that they
find Favorers and Agents to excuse them, and to further their evil courses.
Let this, what I say here, be thoroughly sifted out, and it will be found too
true, to the prejudice of the good Cause. God help us, and amend us; for, what
can we expect, when liars and other wicked men find this favor and patronage?

The Winter declining, the Scots dispose themselves for the Field-Service, so
soon as the provisions demanded, in a very moderate proportion, could be had
from hence; which went but late to them, by reason there was a time spent for
obtaining the Ordinance from the Parliament; next, a time for making ready;
thirdly, a time of sending of things. In the interim the Scots, although busied
in keeping the illaffected of the Country in obedience to the State, sends
parties now and then, upon occasion, as the public Service required, for
example, to Sir William Brer^ton, and to Scarbor ough, etc. at last, the
Rendivous is assigned to the Army the 15 of April: to this effect, they
require the Committee of that Country to provide draughts against the day
aforesaid; but, they could not have any in readiness till the first day of
May, at what time they marched to Rippon, with intention to come straight
Southward, according to the direction of the Committee of both Kingdoms, if
they could have some few days provision (upon all hazards) and draughts. But,
notwithstanding all their care and pains, they could obtain nothing but delays
and incertainties, with promises only of provision from night to night.

If the Scots had had their reasonable demands for provisions and draughts,
they had been near the Enemy before he had done the evil he did at Leicester
and elsewhere.

While the Scots were at Rippon, it was resolved that David Lesley should go
into Lancaster-shire with a party, and he was to have a thousand Yorkshire
Horses to assist; but, what performance there was of this, God knows, for he
had not the third of armed men, although a thousand was promised.

By this time, the Scots are advertised that the Enemy was with a flying Army
to pass through Lancaster-shire to Carlisle, and from thence into Scotland:
upon which advice, resolution is taken, by the consent of the Committee, that
the Scots should go into Lancaster-shire, and stop the Enemies passage
Northward. After a serious enquiry made, the only way for them to go, is by
all means through Westmer land: From Rippon, notwithstanding the roughness and
difficulties of the Country, in four days they are upon the borders of
Lancaster-shire with their whole Army; whither being arrived, they have
intelligence of the Enemies turning back again Southward; immediately they
desire some small provisions for their Soldiers, and draughts, at the
Committee of Westmerland and Cumberland: but they found them very slow and
unwilling. Likewise, the Scots being so near, they desired that their Forces
before Carlisle should be supplied so far with Victuals, as to keep them from
starving; wherein they were the more earnest, that they saw how slackly those
who were with their Forces, followed the business: Doubtless, if they had
left then Carlisle, the Enemy had been supplied, and had kept it to this day;
which in all appearance was the desire of these Committees.

After the Scots had ordained things the best they could concerning Carlisle,
they march Southward in all haste beyond ordinary; for, some days they
marched above twenty miles: but after, they were constrained to stay in some
places, one, two, and three days, for draughts.

While the Scots were struggling with these difficulties, news are sent to the
Parliament that the Scots were gone, no body knew where, and that they spoiled
all the Country: and this was not done by open and declared Enemies, but by
those whom the Parliament trust in these Countries with the managing of
affairs; yea, by some who formerly did profess hearty Friendship unto the
Scots: but the wheel of their own interest turning about, not only have they
delinquished the Scots; but also, have declared themselves opposite unto them,
and this without any cause: so far prevails private interest with men, who
seems to be best.

Then, great murmures rise, that the Scots would abandon their Brethren at such
a necessary time, leaveing all the burden of the War unto the Forces of the
Parliament in the South.

Thus were the Scots innocently traduced by Malignants.

Upon this, the Scots Commissioners here, take, occasion to sent a Gentleman
to the Army, to know the truth and verity of things; and within a day or two
thereafter, seeing the sinistrous reports increaseing, sent two of their own
number to be satisfied of all things more fully, and hasten their coming South.

In the mean time, the Houses of Parliament press to know what was become of
the Scots, and why they had gone this unexpected way, and why, after so many
and earnest calls, they did not march Southward, the good of the public
Service so requiring.

Whereupon, the Scots Commissioners gave in two papers to the Houses,
containing a plain and full relation of the naked truth and reason of things
desired; the ignorance of which had, by the shifts of Malignants officiating
for the Common Enemy, occasioned a great murmr against the Scots up and down.

These papers gave such satisfaction to all those who heard them read, and gave
attention to them, that nothing was to be replied to the least circumstance
mentioned in them; yea, not by those who had been most enclining to give credit
to sinistrous repors. Yet these papers were so little divulged, that diverse of
the House of Commons, who either had been absent when they were given in, or
not attentive when they were read, did not know of any such thing.

Next, although the papers had given full content to the Houses, yet the
slanders of Malignants not only continued, but increased daily more and more
against the Scots.

After some few days, there falls a Copy of these papers into the hands of
one, which being showed by him to some well-affected men, and lovers of the
Common Cause, were thought sit by all means, for the public good, to be
published. As this was adoing, some Malignants get notice of it, and strive to
stop it, by dealing with him who had the chief care of the business; but in
vain, for he was resolved to go on with his design: so, he gives the papers
to the Press, which the Printer intitles The Scots Manifest: This being
published, opened the eyes of many men, to see the truth of things which
formerly had been kept in a cloud.

The publishing of this Manifest, did much vex the Malignants; but, they then
were more grieved to see it so well received, and the truth therein contained,
so greedily laid hold on by the people, whom they hitherto had so grossly abused
by their malicious lies.

Upon this, these lye-inventers bethink themselves of another shift, to cozen
the World in this same business, and they go this way to work; seeing they
could not hinder the printing of the Manifest, they resolve to know whether, or
no, the thing had been done by Order from the Commissioners, who being enquired
if they had caused print the Manifest, they answered no; and so it was, for
without their knowledge the thing was done; because that those who had a care
of the printing of it, knew very well that the Commissioners, going on in their
ordinary course, upon I know what prudentiall scrupulosity, do make known
nothing of that they acquaint the Houses with, fearing to offend, howsoever
needful to be opened for the public Service, and their own credit; but, if
there be any thing to be said against them, although without ground, they must
hear of it on the deaf-side of their ear, and it must be in every bodies mouth.
Then the forgers and publishers of lies gave out, that the Manifest was a false
and supposed thing, since the Commissioners did not own it; when as they only
did say, that they had no hand in the printing of it, although they ayouch the
thing to be in it self most true.

Thus in this place I have set down a full relation of the publishing of the
Manifest, whereof I touched somewhat before, upon another occasion, to make
more known unto the World, with what cunning and crafty malice the Malignants
of all kinds do oppose the truth upon all occasions, and how they study to
hide it from those whom it does concern, to the end they may feed them with
lies more easily, the truth being kept from them.

After that the Commissioners had sent, as we have said, to the Army two
several dispatches, the House of Commons think it fit likewise to send some of
their number to the Scottish Army, to see how things went in the said Army, and
to hasten it Southward; who met the Army about Rippon, and come along with it
no Nattingham, where those Gentlemen leave the Army, and come back to the
Houses, whom they acquainted with the truth of all things, as namely, of the
good condition of the Army, consisting in a fair number of brave Commanders and
lusty Soldiers, of their ability and readiness to do Service. Which relation,
as it did content and please honest men, so it did gal and vex the Malignants
of all kinds. But with what difficulties of want of provisions and of carriage
the Army had to struggle with in this march, and has had formerly, yea, has
to this day, for any thing I know, except things be mended of late, as now I
hope they are, or at least will be shortly, is beyond expression, partly
through the neglect of some, partly through the malice of others, (and that not
of the meaner sort) who make their study, not only to furnish no encouragement
to these who are come for their help; but also, give them all the distaste they
can, to make them weary of the Service, yea, to make them do things by the Law
of necessity to keep themselves from starving, which otherwise they would not,
and so make them odious to those for whose good they are come into this
Country. If this were done by an open Enemy, yea, by those who declare
themselves to be indifferent, it were to be in some kind digested; but, it is
done by those who would make men believe, that they are not only most addicted
to the good Cause; but also, that they are advancers of the Service, whereas
they make only the Cause serve for a cloak to their ambition and avarice, in
their heart caring for nothing, howsoever they make a show otherwise, but to
compass their own ends, whereunto a show of affection to the good Cause does
contribute, namely, where they have any credit.

But, to leave off complaining of those who are neither faithful nor honest to
the Cause, in thus useing the Scots, I (going on in my Discourse) will say a
word or two, in this place, to the clearing of three things, whereof the first
is concerning the moneys received by the Scots for their pay, since their first
undertaking either in Ireland or in England unto this day.

The next is, how and what provisions they have had for their going on with the
Service, either here or in Ireland. The third is, of the disorders committed by
the Scots in their Armies, either in England or in Ireland.

First, I assure you, in the name of the Scots, that their earnest desire is,
that all these things in particular be exactly tried by the Law of Arms, and in
equity judged, where the failings are, and by whom and how, to the end that
every one may have his due of praise or of shame, of thanks or of blame, of
recompense or of punishment, of remembrance or of oblivion, according as the
cause shall require: and the sooner this be done, the better it will, for the
Service of the public, and the encouragement of honesty, and the repressing of
wickedness.

In the mean time I will tell you in general, that what money is received by
the Scots, is far short of what they ought to have, and that they could wish
their Armies in England (to say nothing of their Forces in Ireland) had as much
money for six weeks, as the other Forces, employed in the Service with them,
have in two weeks; and this without jealousy, or envy that others are look^d
and cared for; yet there is no reason why they should be neglected, since they
are constantly following the public Service with activity and faithfulness.
There is a great stir of sending money to them, and far greater of raising it
for them, although they receive but a very small proportion, in regard either
of what is allowed for them, and less of what is due unto them, and least of
all, what is said to be levied for them; Wherefore, I say again, they are most
desirous of fair reckonings among Friends; let the payment come when it may,
the most pressing necessity being supplied.

Next, For provisions, besides the smalnesse of them, they come so slowly, I
must say again, that when they are upon their march, they are constrained to
stay three days in one place against their will, for one days provision, and
draughts can hardly be had for their march: as it has been in their march, so
it is in their abode, witness their being ten days before Hereford, not
seeing bread but one day, all the rest liying upon Beans, green Corn, and
Fruits. In these they are so crossed, that it seems to be done expressly, for
the disenabling them, so far as may be, to do the public Service answerable to
their own desire and readiness, and to the expectation of the Kingdom.

As for the disorders said to be done in the Army, as it is acknowledged that
they are not Angels of Light, without feeding, being but poor infirm men, they
cannot but fall and do amiss, in many and many a thing; so they are not
Cameleons to live upon the air, but are of such constitutions, that they must
have more solid food of necessity for their subsistence, which now and then
they cannot come by so orderly as should be. Yet I dare be bold to say, that
the Scots Army is as well regulated, as most Armies are, without vanity be it
said; and that exorbitancy or scandal is no sooner known, but it is censured
and punished according to its degree, by Ecclesiastical and Military Law; and
that no complaint is made, but it is heard and answered, according to equity
and reason: Yea, Proclamations are made to incite every one that has any
complaint, to repair unto the Prime-Officers, or Counsel of War: Yet let the
Leaders do what they can, some slips will fall out among the Soldiers that are
not allowable; and indeed the Commanders cannot be altogether so exact as
otherways they would be with the Soldiers, since the pay is so slow, and so
little of it at a time, and provisions so scarce and so hardly had; for when
the belly is thus extremely pinched, it were hard measure to beat the back.

When the Scots Army came to Nottingham, the General sent a Letter subscribed
by himself, and two more, unto the Committee of both Kingdoms, whereby, in few
words, he tells how that the Scots employed in this Service of the Common Cause,
have had, and have to this day, very harsh usage and hard measure in diverse
fashions, even from these who not only by the Common Interest of both Nations,
are bound to be then Friends and Brethren; but also, from these who formerly
made a particular show of Friendship unto them: Yet, notwithstanding all this,
he declares how that with hearty earnestness, they are in readiness to go on
faithfully and resolutely with the Work: But, judging that a view of the Letter
it self, would give satisfaction to many, I have thought fit to set down here a
true Copy of it, furnished unto me by a Friend.

A Letter of the Scots General at Nottingham to the Committees of both
Kingdoms.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
THe continuance of a firm Union and good correspondance betwixt the Kingdoms,
is so much in our thoughts and wishes, as that without it, we can expect no
better then the weakening, yea, the undoing of this Common Cause, and the
strengthening of the Common Enemies; and, although there be neither few nor
small occasions and discouragements from the misrepresentation of our Actions,
and misapprehension of our intentions, from the cooling, if not changing, of
that affection formerly expressed, both toward our selves, and toward diverse
of our Contrymen, who have deserved well for their abilities and
faithfulness in the public; and from the usage and entertainment of this
Army, which is neither to that which other Armies in this Kingdom do receive,
nor according to the Treaty between the Kingdoms, nor at all certain, such as
can avoid the hatred and discontent of the people, whose affections and good
will we desire to carry along with us; yet, notwithstanding all these, and the
like discouragements, our Actions have been, are, and shall be real
testimonies of our constant resolution to pursue actively the ends expressed in
the Covenant, and to adventure our selves, and whatsoever is dearest to us, in
this Cause; and that, as we had great reason to march into Westmerland, in
regard of the Intelligence both then and since confirmed to us, so we have been
as ready and willing to come Southward, as we were desired by the honorable
Houses of Parliament and by your Lordships: and we have marched with more
speed, and less interruption, then is usual in such cases; yea, our march had
been more speedy, if we had not been stayed in some places, for want of
draughts and provisions; and now we are, with the assistance of God Almighty,
to undertake any Action which may be fittest for the Cause and safety of both
Kingdoms. But, if (which God forbid) for want of the conjunction and assistance
promised, or for want of necessary provisions, the public work be retarded, or
disappointed, we shall be blameless. And therefore we do recommand to your
Lordships most serious deliberation, that some more effectual and speedy
course may be taken for necessary provisions to this Army, that both Officers
and Soldiers may have in all orderly and constant way, not only a part of
their pay in Victuals, but, a part in money, for their other necessary uses:
and in case of our conjunction with any other Forces of this Kingdom, that then
the provisions of this Army be no worse then of those other Forces: which
things as they are just in themselves, so they are the rather desired, that
this Army be not burdensome, nor hateful to the Counties where we come, and
that we may not be redacted to the unhappy necessity of not punishments wrongs
and disorders strictly, which as we have not only forbidden by the strictest
Edicts, but have exemplarly and severely punished, so shall we ever be ready
upon complaint and proof of the fact, either to punish the same by death, or
other condign punishment, according to the quality of the offense.

We further entreat and expect, that this War might be managed according to the
Treaty by the Committees of both Kingdoms upon the place; and for that end,
that a Quorum of the Commissioners from the honorable Houses of Parliament,
may be constantly with this Army; and that your Lordships may entertain
charitable thoughts of our proceedings, confident that according to the
knowledge which God has given us in the matters of our profession, we shall
improve all opportunities to the best advantage.

We shall not need to put your Lordships in remembrance how necessary it is,
that before the Armies of either or of both Kingdoms undertake the besieging of
any Town, they first endeavor a total dissipation of all the Forces which the
Enemy has in the Fields; and so much the rather, because, by the blessing of
God, the dissipation shall be more easy, if the Armies of both Kingdoms be
continually aiding and assisting each one to other, and that each act their
part and attend the Enemies motions.

What we have written to your Lordships, we desire it may be made known to both
Houses of Parliament, and City of London. And above all, that your Lordships
would with all earnestness press the expediting of the Reformation of
Religion, and uniformity in Church Government, together with the speedy
prosecuting and ending of this War, that we may return home with the comfort of
Religion, and Peace settled, the fruits of our endeavors, much wished and
longed for, by

HAMILTON.


WE have heard how the Parliament of England sent Commissioners into Scotland,
to call in the Scots unto its help, and to capitulate with them concerning
their in-coming: We have heard also, how that Commissioners were sent from
Scotland hither, to be at the drawing up of the Covenant betwixt the two
Nations; who ever since have constantly assisted the Synod in the discussion of
Church-affaires, more according to agreement betwixt the Nations: thereafter,
there was other Commissioners sent hither to share with the Parliament in the
managing of State-businesses of Peace and War, wherein now both Kingdoms are
jointly engaged. To this effect, the Houses of Parliament chooses a certain
number of Lords and Commons, to treat of all things concerning Peace and War
jointly with the Scots, and so together they make up the Committee of both
Kingdoms, wherein the Scots have a negative voice; and nothing is done, or at
least ought to be done, without their knowledge and consent, concerning Peace
or War, directly or indirectly, all play under board, and clandestine dealing,
being forbidden to both equally, upon the reason of the common interest of both.

Those who had been adverse unto the in-coming of the Scots to help the Parl.
were much against the setting up of this Committee; but at last, after some
debate, the thing is done in spite of opposition: So the Committee is set afoot
for a certain time of some few Months, by Ordinance of both Houses. The time
prefixed for the sitting of the Committee is no sooner expired, but those same
men, with the aid of others, whom they had stirred up to that purpose, cast in
difficulties, and will by no means give consent for the continuance of this
Committee: so for some days it is broken up; then earnest work there was to
get it restablished again; but all to small purpose, till in the end, there is
found one Clause in the Ordinance for the setting it up at first, which did
serve for the restablishing of it, maugre those who did oppose it. Since that
time, it has continued constantly to this day, although not without vexation
to some, namely, because the Committee could not sit without the Scots being
present.

Now the Scots called and joined with the English to manage the affairs of the
public Service, for the Common Cause of Church and State; at first, they did
think that they were to have nothing, or at least, little ado, but to put
forward the public Service with earnestness and vigor, against the Common
Enemy, without any let here by any of their own party; and so, they resolve
with themselves to be very modest and tender, with all wariness in their
proceedings with their Brethren of England, who had called them hither upon
such assurance, and were so kind unto them in their expressions, yea, so
careful of them, that they would have them to lodge nearer for their own
convenience, and that of their Friends going to visit them; and so the Scots
remove from the City, where they had lodged in former time, and are placed in
Worcester-house, where now they lodge.

Those who pretend to know more of the Mysteries of the World then other men,
tell us, that the removing of the Scots from the City to Worcester-house, was
not so much the convenience of the Scots, or of their Friends, which was
intended, although so given out, as their weaning from their old Friends in the
City, who formerly had been so useful and so respective to them, by a cunning
forcasting of some men, to wear them out of acquaintance and intimacie with the
City, being afraid not to carry on things so easily, according to their intent,
if the Scots were constantly intime and familiar with the City.

Whatever the end of removing the Scots from the City was, it is fallen out so,
that the Scots being at such a distance, have not been able to cherish and
nourish their former intimacie and old Friendship with the City, as they are
bound in gratitude carefully to do, and as the public Service requires, joint
with their own advantage.

Thereafter, the Scots find a harder task then they had promised unto
themselves in the beginning; for, besides the great and main work against the
Common Enemy, they find some few men, here in the party whereunto they are
joined for the Service of the Common Cause of Religion and Liberty in all the
three Kingdoms, who do not only show them but small favor; but also, as far
as can be without open breach, cross and oppose them, and, in them, the
public Service: First, those who from the beginning did not approve of their
in-coming, for fear they should eclipse their luster, and diminish their power,
was cold and adverse to them.

Next, some others of those who had most bestirred themselves, and most
appeared in the calling in of the Scots to help, having done the work of their
in-bringing, lay down a new ground for the reparing the breach of their own
credit, which by the miscarriage of things, namely in the West, as we have said
before, had been much diminushed, and by degrees make up their credit upon the
decline of the others; whereunto their earnestness for the Scots did much
serve, and the Scots intimacy with them, for many gave willingly way unto them,
when they did see them so intime with the Scots, whom they knew to have no
by-ends; and those men, on the other side, did endear themselves unto the Scots
by sundry good offices for a time, which they did unto them in things
concerning their Forces in England and Ireland, employed in the Common Service;
and by their constant and frequent courting of the Scots, they did so take them
up, that they alone, almost, were admitted to any privacy: then some did laugh
in their sleeve, to see a few, not so considerable before, bear such a sway and
the Scots, led thus by the nose; and others did complain, saying, Why should
this be? It was expected, the Scots Commissioners should have been open and
free to all honest men, namely to those of worth; yea, they ought to have been
so for the good of the public Service, and for their own credit, not captiving
themselves as it were to some few ones. Further, it was said, that they should
have pressed home businesses more stoutly and more freely then they did, as
they had done in former times in their own particular affairs, when they had
not so many professed and powerful Friends, letting nothing pass of that was,
clearly for the good of the public.

By this complying complaisance, the Scots Commissioners have given such
advantage to those who for a time courted them most for their own ends, as it
seems; for, if it had been altogether for the public, the Scots remaining
constant to their point and principles, although with less vigor, I confess,
then I could wish, those men had not changed, for ends, which when they had
obtained, one after another, did withdraw from the Scots, and in a short time
point blank oppose them, by whose help, they chiefly had raised their hight of
reputation and opinion among men.

The first and main occasion of mistake betwixt those men and the Scots, was
the Church Government. When the Scots did engage themselves in this Common
businesses, they did stipulate with the English Commissioners, then in
Scotland, that they should go heartily and freely along with them, in settling
the Government and Discipline of the Church, as it was thereafter sworn to by
both Kingdoms, in the National Covenant. And when the Scots Commissioners came
hither, and entered into the Synod, they found it had sat long, and advanced but
small businesses; as for the Government, they had not touched it at all, which
in all appearance was kept off by a slight of Prelatists and Sectaries, to stop
the settling of the Church according to the best way, expressed thereafter in
the Covenant.

The Scots seeing the loss of time, and the evils which were likely to follow,
if there were no set Government in the Church; presently moves the Synod to
fall to the Discipline and Government; which they do, and therein a great deal
of pains is taken in setting out the Truth, and refuting the errors of
ignorants, and oppositions of headstrong wilful men, who prefer the setting
up of their own Chymerick fancies, and Utopian dreams, to the Peace of the
Church; wherefore I may justly say, whatsoever gifts or endowments they have,
whether of preaching or of praying, of languages, or sciences, since they want
charity, they have nothing; for, if they had the least grain of charity, they
would not thus disturb the Church.

I add, He that sacrifices the Peace of the Church to the Idol of his own
Imagination, is as he who causes his children pass through the fire to Moloch.

After much struggling, things being brought near a conclusion, some of those
upon whose Friendship the Scots had till then so much relied, did declare
themselves to be altogether adverse to the Government the Scots were so
desirous of: whereat, the Scots were much astonished: First, because the
assurances given by those men unto them, in the beginning of their engagement,
for furthering the Church Government intended; next, by reason of the Covenant,
whereby the Scots conceive us all to be bound unto the government of the Church
according the Word of God, and the best Reformed Church abroad, and namely to
the government of the Church of Scotland.

Ever since that day to this day, those men having withdrawn their temporary
affection from the Scots, have opposed their counsels, and crossed their
proceedings, in every thing wherein they are concerned, as far as in them
lies: And this they do not only themselves, but, draw others for humane
respects, to side with them in so doing. Yea, some there be of this
fantastical opinion in this Kingdom, who stick not to say, that they will
rather choose to join with Popery, Prelacy, and with whatsoever blasphemy, or
heresy, then to submit to the government of the Church by Presbytery: such is
the phrenesie of those mad men.

As those men we spoke of a little above, were, in what they could, against the
in-bringing of the Scots, and thereafter did oppose the setting afoot and the
continuance of the Committee of both Kingdoms; so those second men, of late,
have grumbled, yea to some of them words have escaped, that it was a trouble
for the Committee to have the Scots adjoints: Yea, it seems there was a design
to do business without the Scots, and that of great moment, wherein the both
Nations are concerned, as may appear, namely, by naming and assembling of a
sub-Committee without knowledge of the Scots: Wherewith the Scots acquainted
the Houses by their papers, given in by them about the middle of May last.
Further, the secret intelligence for the surprising and taking of Oxford, (at
aneasie place) then unfurnished with provisions, given by one Patric Naper, to
a Sub-Committee of three, whereof, there was one of them a Scot, is neglected:
notwithstanding the Scots did press it much, that the thing should be tried;
they could not prevail: The excuse was, that till the Army, then a moulding,
was in a perfect frame, they would undertake nothing. More, the Enemy is
acquainted with the secret advice of the enterprise, and that particularly, who
before had not taken notice of the weakness of the place named by the advice;
which the Enemy finding to be true, repaires and strengthens.

All this then, is known to be true by intercepted Letters, which have not been
communicated to the Scots Commissioners, notwithstanding the Common Interest. I
am much mistaken, if it was the Scot who discovered the advice to the Enemy: Be
it who will, let him lay his hand to his heart, and giving glory to God,
confess his own wickedness; for at last, it will be discovered to his shame,
I am persuaded.

When the Army was molded, according to the mind of some few men, then Oxford
must be besieged, and the Enemy suffered to run up and down, increase his
Forces, and spoil the Country, yea, to bring all to a great hazard. Yet the
new Army must lie before Oxford, wherein there was not the men by third part
requisite to such a Siege; far less to take in the Town: Yea, those men who
were there, were not furnished with materials for the the Siege. But, many
think there was no intention to take the Town by open Siege, by those who were
contrivers of the design, since they neglect to try if it could be done by
surprise and secret enterprise: All this while, the chief Commander was most
ready to act his part faithfully and gallantly, as he has done happily since.

From this Siege, the Scots not only do openly dissent, but also, did protest
against it: Yet, when the thing was cried out upon, not only at home, but
abroad, by Forrainers, who said, That the Enemy was devouring the Flesh, while
the Parliaments Forces were gnawing the Bone; and they did not stick to say,
that fair dealing was not every where. More, the party of Horses which were
ordained to follow the Enemy, was recalled back, against the advice of the
Scots; who having acquainted the Houses of Parliament with those passages,
should have made known to the whole World, that after their own constant
integrity, and simple sincerity, more and more made known to all, in these
things, and the faults of others sifted out, and they not bearing the blame of
other men's errors, the Service of the public might go the better on.

Further, it was given out, that the Scots notcoming Southward, was the
occasion of all these disorders committed by the Enemy.

But, let reason judge, whether or not, it was easier for an Army, provided
with all things for the Field and marching, within very few miles of the Enemy,
to follow him, disturb him, and stop him from increasing his Forces, and doing
Evil, then to an Army above two hundred miles distant, who notwithstanding
their willingness and readiness to march, according to their calling
Southward, could get neither draughts, nor absolutely necessary provisions for
a march, in such a proportion as was thought very reasonable.

The truth of this may appear, what troubles General Lesley found at Rippon,
to get provisions and draughts, and how he went to York to that effect, but to
very small purpose.

Let things be tried, and no longer thus carried in hugger-mugger, to the
prejudice of the public Service.

We have heard, how that, and upon what occasion, some of those, who had been
so intimate with the Scots Commissioners, leave them, neglect them, and oppose
them in their proceedings, so far as they can in a smooth-way above board, to
say nothing of what is done underhand.

So in this place, you shall take notice, how that, on the other side, there be
diverse of those, who formerly had cared so little for the Scots, that they
neither favored their in-coming, nor thereafter had assisted them so
willingly, in their honest and faithful endeavor for the advancement of the
public Service; now, at last, bethinking themselves of their own error, and
how that, without reason, they had been jealous of the Scots, they begin to go
along with them more freely and earnestly in the public Work, then they had
done heretofore; which the Scots, minding mainly the furthering of the Service
of the Common Cause, take kindly at their hands, and welcome the expressions of
their good affection to the Service, with respective civilitie; wishing from
their heart, that those who are now withdrawn from them, would return unto
their wonted correspondence, in sincere and brotherly unanimity, for carrying
on the heavy and redious Work, now lying upon them all.

Upon this, there is great murmuring against the Scots, that they had quite
left off honest and well-affected men, and taken semi-Malignants by the hand,
who not only had been slack and backward in the pursuance of the public
Service; but, adverse unto themselves in particular. To all this, the Scots do
declare truly, that as when they came hither at first, they took no interest
in any man more then they judged him, in all appearance, to interest himself
heartily, without by-ends, in the Common Cause; and, as yet, they do the same,
resolved to continue so unto the end, constant to their first principles: and,
if any men have withdrawn themselves from them, not willing to go constantly
along with them in this necessary course, they are sorry for those, of whose
constancy they were in a kind assured: and they declare to the World, that they
neither gave, nor intend to give any just distaste in their particular to any:
But, if men will snuff, because they are not humeured in all things, who can
help it? The Scots did think, at their coming in, to have nothing a do with
children and women, who must be humeured; but, with set and staid rational
men, without any by-respects, or private Fancies, wholly constants to the Cause
both of Church and State, as we are all sworn by the Solemn Oath of the
National Covenant: As for those, who having cast off their former mistakes,
now go along with them more earnestly then formerly in the businesses, they
cannot but welcome them, as all those, who put to their helping-hand heartily
in the least kind to the great Work of God, and of his people; howsoever their
carriage have been toward their persons, for the public (they having no
spleen nor grudge at any) forget whatsoever has been amiss toward them,
praying God to forgive, that his Work may be carried on more cheerfully and
unanimously, and they are likewise disposed and inclined toward those (who
have left them off) to go along with them, so freely and so brotherly as at the
first; and they will embrace them cheerfully, in carrying on the businesses of
Church and State with them. This they declare not to captive men by cunning
insinuation, as factious ones do; but to invite all men fairly to go on with
the Work of Church and State, according to the Covenant, as they hope a
blessing from Heaven, if they be zealous and faithful, without equivocation;
and may expect judgment, if they either faint or be not sincere. Of this
enough for this time.

Yet, there is one thing I cannot pass, and it is this: There be hardly any
divisions among these of this side, of which the blame is not laid upon the
Scots; as if they had not had their jealousies one of another, and grudges one
against another, by reason of particular interest and private opinion, before
the Scots did join with them; when it is well known, that the Scots assistance,
faithful in the Counsel, and active in the Field, is not only useful and
necessary for the opposing and repressing of the Common Enemy; but also, for
keeping together those, who otherwise in a likelihood, would fall asunder, and
so the public Service suffer, at which the Enemy aims.

Then I add, that the Enemy, howsoever low he seems to be at this instant,
desires to have no better Game, then that the Scots would retire and withdraw
their helping hand from the Service; for he that of nothing made a party so
great as to carry all before it, till he was repressed by the Scots, would
raise up his party again. But, in despite of the devil, and all opposition,
whether clandestin or open; the Scots will stand firm and faithful, for the
carrying on of the Work of God, and of his people.

After a certain time, the States of both Kingdoms, resolved to try yet again
if they could reclaim and recall, upon any reasonable terms, the abused and
misled Prince, from his evil courses of undoing the^ people and himself, cause
draw up certain Propositions by Common Counsel of both Nations, which they
send by Commissioners of both States, to the King; in whom they find nothing
but shifts and delays: So they return without effectuating any thing.

A while thereafter, the unfortunate Prince intending to make the simpler sort
believe, that he was defirous, at last, of a real agreement, sends hither
Commissioners (of whose honest meaning, the people did least doubt; but in the
end, they were found to be cajeolors) to draw things toward a Treaty, unto
which the Scots declared themselves to be inclined, (the main businesses of
Church and State being secured) as willing to try all means possible, upon all
occasion, to take up the differences in a fair way, to save further effusion of
Christian and Brothers blood, and further ruin of those Countries.

For this, the Scots are cried out upon, as evil men, (by inconsiderate
persons, set on by Malignants) notwithstanding the Treaty goe's on, but to
small purpose; the Kings Commissioners feeling the pulse of the Parliaments
Commissioners, did promise unto themselves, upon what ground they know best, or
at least should know, that they could carry all things to their mind, if it
were not for the rude and stiff-necked Scots, who were so firm to their
principles, and resolved rather to follow on the Work with honor and
conscience, although with hazard and danger, then to yield to a base agreement,
to the prejudice of Church and State.

Upon this, the Court-Commissioners cry out against the Scots, as the only
hinderers of their ends, and the stoppers of their designs, first at home in
their own Country, next here, both in the Fields and in the Counsel.

By this, you may see, if there were no other instance, with whom and against
whom the Scots have ado: what was the carriage of the Scots Commissioners, in
the Treaty of both Church and States affairs; let both parties freely tell, if
they did find in the least point of honesty, faithfulness, resolution,
prudence, knowledge, or respect amissing in them.

But, the Treaty ends, without any conclusion for good, nothing being intended
by the Court in it, but to gain time, and more and more to abuse the people,
and so make the best advantage of businesses.

Things having been carried in the Field, almost ever since the beginning of
these Wars, namely the last Summer, not so well as they might have been, for
the advancement of the public Service, by the fault of some of those who were
employed in the said Service; whether it was want of skill, want of care, or
want of sincerity and uprightness, in pursuance of the business, I will not
in this place enquire, less will I resolve; but, a fault there was, and that a
great one, and much amiss.

Wherefore, the Parliament, upon just reason, having tried diverse times to
amend the errors of the Armies, and correct what was wrong in them in a fair
and smooth way, but all to small purpose; takes resolution to reform wholly the
Armies, and cast them in a new mould.

Whereof the Scots Commissioners heairng, for their interest in the Common
Cause, think fit for them to remember the Parliament of two things principally
upon the point; whereof the first was, That in the new mould wherein the Armies
were to be cast, care should be taken to make choice of men of experience and
ability, so far as was possible, to do the better the duties of the Service;
for although now and then men ignorant of what they undertake, may do perchance
a thing well; yet it stands that it should be so, not with reason, which must
rule all actions.

The next was, that diligent care should be taken, for admitting none to
employment in the Armies, but such as were trusty and faithful to the Cause
now in hand, as it is expressed in the National Covenant: wherefore, it was
desired, that every one employed, in testimony of his honesty and faithfulness
to the Cause, should take the Covenant publicly.

The Scots took occasion to give these advices to the Parliament, upon
information given them, first, that diverse new men, and of little or no
experience, were preferred by indirect means, and were to be employed in places
of command, for by ends: then, that there were diverse likewise named for
preferment and employment, who not only were suspect to be enclining to
Schisms and Sects; but also, professed Enemies to what is expressed in the
National Covenant concerning the Church, and consequently, to the Common Cause
we are all sworn to.

These advices of the Scots, although they were not so much regarded as was
needful, yet they did produce this effect, that diverse men of known worth and
experience, were named to be kept in the new mould, although many were put out,
and new men unknown for Military virtue put in their places.

Next, after a great debate in the Houses, it is ordained that all the
Commanders should take the Covenant, under pain of cashiering, betwixt such and
such a day: But how this Order is observed, I know not, I doubt it is not so
well as it should be: As for the common Soldiers, it was not to be pressed
upon them, which makes men admire, not well knowing the reason of things, how
that the prisoners Soldiers taken of the Enemy should have the Oath tendered
unto them, in token of their embracing the Parliaments party and cause, and
these Soldiers of the Parliaments own side, are not to be tied to the Oath of
the National Covenant: Further, all suspected men brought before the
Committees, namely of examination, have the Oath put to them, which if they
refuse, they are censed Malignants; yet the Parliaments Soldiers are to be
free from the Oath, if they please. Yea, many were astonished to hear that it
was debated in the Houses, whether those of the Armies should be put to the
Oath of the Solemn League, or no, whereunto the Houses themselves are sworn to,
and for the maintenance of which, we all now stand, or at least we ought to
stand, being sworn to it.

The reason why some men are backward to take the Oath, is that they are
adverse to the Government of the Church by Presbytery, which the Parliament is
now a settling, although the business do not go on so quickly as by many is
wished, by reason of so many rubs cast in by several sorts of men, partly
through ignorance, partly in opposition to the thing, for reasons far others
then those they hitherto have given out, howsoever specious. At this occasion,
it was spoken publicly by one who is a prime man among those who are adverse
from the Government abovenamed of the Church, that, although in his judgment,
he did not approve Presbyteriall. government in the Church, yet he, at all
times, would submit to whatsoever Church Government the Parliament should
settle, either by passive or active obedience.

To this is answered; Whosoever says that he will obey an Order or Law by
passive obedience, is already actively in disobedience. Further, to call
obedience passive, is as great an absurdity, as to call black white: for
obedience is nothing at all but the act of obeying, and to call an act passive,
is absurd, action and passion being more different then black and white, for
they are Toto genere, distant; and black and white are under Unum genus, not
only Summum of quality, but also subaltern of color.

Further, all virtue consists in action; so obedience being a virtue, cannot be
said to be passive, that is, in passion. Wherefore, he who first did invent the
expression of passive obedience, did not weigh what he said, no more then those
who since, not considering the exact distinction of things, have taken it up at
the second hand, and have made so general use of it. He who thinks that, by
his passion, he gives obedience unto the Law, is mightily mistaken; for,
suffering, or passion, is laid upon a man for his not obeying, and to make him
obey. Example: A man for debt is put in prison; the emprisonment which the
debtor suffers is not obedience to the Law, but one means employed to bring him
unto the obedience thereof, that is, unto the paying of the debt. I know,
Divines speak much of the passive obedience of Christ; but this is of another
condition, and so it belongs to another place. Besides, he who offers unto the
Houses his passive obedience, endeavors what he can, and pleads earnestly to
be free from it, as we have seen published by writing. Then also, it was said
publicly by one, that the main quarrel the Parliament stood for at first, and
thereafter did take up Arms for, was not for Religion (which is as much to say,
the main different betwixt the Parliament and the corrupt Court-Papists,
Prelatists, Atheists, and diverse other instruments of iniquity, who having
sworn inimity to the Truth, opposes it with all their cunning and power) not
the Reformation of the Church; but, the freedom and Liberty of the Subject.

Which saying is injurious, in my mind; for, to aver or publish, that the
Parliament did not from the^ beginning intend a true Reformation of Religion,
is a great wrong done to the Wisdom of the Parliament; for how can the
Parliament be said or thought to be wise in God, without it has his fear
before its eyes? and how can the Parliament be said to have the fear of God
before its eyes, if it has not care of the establishing the Truth of Religion,
and to repress the errors? I cannot conceive; for without the true Worship of
God, there can be no true fear of him: then it is most false; for, from the
first beginning, did not the Parliament express, that it namely intended a
true Reformation, by diverse instances, although now and then it has been at a
stand how to go through with it, by reason of the lets that the Enemies of the
Truth have cast in, and cast still in to this day, by open opposition, and
clandestine undermining? witness the pulling down of the high
Commission-Court, the courbing of the Prelates tyranny, the making silenced
Ministers freely preach; and so soon is the occasion offers it self, is it not
embraced, to throw the Prelates out of the Church as Enemies to the Truth of
God? Then the calling of the Synod: which things, with diverse more, the
Parliament had never done, if it had not intended mainly the Reformation of the
Church and of Religion.

I must confess, the businesses in the Synod did go on but very remisly,
before the Scots joining, by the National Covenant, with the Parliament, who
has since pressed it somewhat more home; and yet it goes on but very slowly,
not so much by the open opposition of the professed Enemy, as by the crafty
infinuations of some fantastical and factious men, who having endeared
themselves by some expression of good offices to the people, have buzzed the
Parliament in the ear, they must not anger them for fear of losing so many good
Friends, who give themselves out to be in great number, although if things were
tried, it should be found that their number is far short of what is said of it,
and their affection to the public less; for, I shall never believe, that
those who are for confusion in the Church, are for the settled ordering of the
State.

Further, if the Parliament did not make Religion at first its main quarrel it
stood for, and took Arms for, I pray you then, when did the Parliament begin to
make the Reformation of the Church its main quarrel, at the joining of the
Scots by the National Covenant, perhaps you will say? If so be, when England
has a settled Reformation of the Church, according to the Word of God, the
practice of the first ages, and of the best Reformed Church now adays, it may
thank their poor Friends distressed at this time for their sake.

I am assured, he that says that the Parliament did not intend mainly
Reformation from the beginning, cares but little for it himself. Next, he
makes the main quarrel of the Parliament to be the freedom and Liberty of the
Subject: If under the notion of freedom and Liberty, were understood first a
free and libr^ profession of the Truth in a settled Reformed Church, as
aforesaid, it were well; and in the second place, the honest freedom and just
Liberty in external things; Such is the freedom that the truly reformed
Churches abroad, have constantly sought for to this day, who when they obtain
the first, they stand not so much upon the second. But, let us see a little
what can be the meaning of the freedom and Liberty of the Subject, without
Religion: Is it to be free from the vexation of Monopolies, Projects,
Ship-moneys, etc. and of some exorbitant courses of Judicatory, as of that of
the Star Chamber?

If in those alone, and no other things, better and more, I beseech you, what
benefit has the Subject by the freedom from the Court of the Star Chamber? The
people say, The Committees of one City or County, does more wrong in one year
to the City or County, then the Starchamber-Court did to the whole Kingdom in
seven years, if all things be well considered; for it did reach but one man
here and there; but the Committees reach almost every man. It is true, the
wounds of the Star Chamber were very sore and deep, but they were not so
frequent, and now then they were mollified by some moderation; which diverse
Committees will not admit.

As for the freedom from Ship Money, Monopolies, Projects, etc. Vox populi,
says, there be more in taxes and contributions laid upon the people in one
year, now adays, then for many years in Ship Money, etc. Yea, which is the
worst, this burden must continue, God knows how long, besides the way of
levying it by the inferior Officers, if the taxes are most grievous; and the
best affected men, for the most part, are most laden; such is the cry and
complaint of the people through the City and County.

So, if the Subject had not the gain of a Reformed settled Church and Religion,
he were in a worse case then formerly. Next, there is found but very little
more just and honest Liberty for the Subject, then before; only the Sectaries
take greater license then they were wont to do, and fantastical men, to vent
their idle imaginations, and to abuse the simpler ones; as likewise scurrilous
fellows take upon them to say and write what they list against men.

All this is a mere licentiousness and libertinage tending to the trouble of
the people, and not to their good, so far is it from the Liberty of honest and
discret men, who desires and ought to live, within the borns of good and
wholesome constitutions both of Church and State.

What is said here of taxes, is not to blame them, for it is known there must be
tribute levied for the supporting of the burdens of the Commonwealth, namely,
in time of War, for its good and benefit.

At the beginning of these Wars here in England, betwixt the King and
Parliament, both parties did draw unto them so many of the Scots Officers as
they could conveniently; neither of them having in their own opinion such
Commanders, or, at least, in such number as to make their Armies complete to
their mind, of their own men.

So the Scots were employed in chief and prime places of command, on both
sides: hence diverse men indifferent, not as yet engaged by affection to either
party, conceiving that neither party could have known how to manage, or go on
with the War, without the Scots Commanders, wished them many miles beyond S^n.

To the King went and took Service of him, not only diverse who had been
Malignants from the first beginning; but also, some superficial Covenanters,
who not diving in businesses, did make small scrupule to serve the King in this
War, it not being against the Letter of their Covenant, as they conceived: for,
the King protesting from day to day, that he would stand firm to the true
Religion, and maintain it, his intention in taking up Arms, being only to
repress some factinus persons who had affronted him: and the Parliament not
then making it so clear to every one, by their expressions, that the main
quarrel the adversary had, was the subversion of Religion, made some not to
discern things so clearly as otherwise they had done, if things had been more
plainly set down.

To the Service of Parliament, come diverse in good affection, being persuaded
that the quarrel of England, was one and the same with that in Scotland,
howsoever by the cunning of the adversary disguised, and although not then so
cleared by the Parliament as was need.

The Enemy seeing that sundry Scots Officers and Commanders were undertaking
Service under the Parliament, by his Emissaries up and down, does what he can
to draw them on his side, or at least, to make them keep off from serving the
Parliament. In this, he did prevail with some, who will have their just reward
in due time.

Then, after the War began, and some Fieldactions being done, the Enemy
perceiving how that diverse Scots Officers had carried themselves gallantly, in
the Service of the Parliament, returns again to his former courses, and deals
by his Instruments and Agents here, to corrupt and debauche those men of
Command, upon whom the eyes of many were; the Agents of the Enemy go craftily
to work, to compass their ends upon those men; for, first, by cunning
insinuations, they enter in privacy with them; Next, they make them fair
promises, with specious words of the Kings good intentions toward the public
good of both Church and State, and of the esteem he had of their worth and
deserts: Then those good Agents for the Enemy, underhand cause give distaste
to the Scots Officers, by neglecting of them, and otherwise, yea, by some
Boutefeux there were of them quarelled in Westminster Hall, with reproach that
they took the Meat out of the English months, who could manage and pursue the
War as well, atleast, as they.

If this quarrel had not been timely taken up, by the Wisdom of the Parliament,
it had grown to a great hight, according to the design and desire of the Enemy.

This crafty dealing of the adversary, by his Agents, did prevail so far, that
some of the Scots Officers, not so touched with the interest of the good Cause,
as they ought to have been, nor as they outwardly professed, left off the
Service of the Parliament for a time, upon I know not what foolish excuse; and
thereafter, upon a change, fell to the Work again. Next, there were others so
far persuaded, as to lay down their Commissions, and go to the Enemy and serve
him for a while; and thereafter leaving him, returned hither again.

The Scots Officers with the Enemy, were in high esteem, and in good respect
among those they did serve, till the State of Scotland joined with the
Parliament of England, in action for the Common Cause; from thence, by little
and little, the Scots, with the Enemy, became so to be neglected and ill
thought of, that there were many of them constrained to go away, and others
have been taken and killed by this side, so that, for the present, there be
very few, at least of any note, with the Enemy.

On this side likewise, the Scots Officers, notwithstanding the State of
Scotland was now interessed and joined with the Parliament, by degrees came to
be littler regarded, neglected, and diverse of them laid aside, after that
sundry of them had lost their lives, fighting valiantly for the Cause, others
had loosed their blood, and others suffered imprisonment, at last; the Moulders
of the new Model cashier at one dash above two hundred of them, brave fellows,
who constantly had carried themselves with honesty, and gallantry, without
giving them any satisfaction, or at least, very little, for what is justly due
unto them, and had cost some of them very dear: The reason given out against
them, was, That it was to be feared they would not be so earnest and so
forward, as was required, in this new frame.

Then, those cashiered Scots Commanders having danced attendance a long time,
to small purpose, in pursuance of their just demands, constant to their
grounds, although they were thus harshly used, they would not abandon the
Service of the Common Cause: so, they resolve to go to the Forces of their
Contrymen, and serve with them in the same Cause; and sends some of them,
accompanied with a number of good fellows before, toward the Scots Army, till
the rest were ready.

Those Scots who went away first toward their Contrymen, being upon their
journey, they chanced to be at and near Leicester, when the Enemy made his
approches to that place. The Scots, in mere kindness and love to those who
were engaged with them in the Common Cause, without any Commission from the
Parliament, or from the Scots General, stay and help their Friends: and how
manfully their carriage was, in the assistance of their Brethren, is so known,
that it will never be forgotten, when there is any mention of
Leicester-businesse. In general, I will say this of them; That, if they had
been seconded, the Town of Leicester had not been taken by the Enemy; but,
having expected assistance from those whom they came to help, after diverse had
prodagalized their blood, and that some were killed, with the loss of their
Liberty and of all they had, they were constrained to yield to force, not
without being admired by the vainquors for their valor. Thereafter, those that
were taken prisoners, finding their opportunity, lays hold on it at the first,
and they carry the business so, that they not only gain their own freedom,
but make themselves Masters of those in whose hands they were.

If those things had been done by some other men, all the Pamphlets about the
City of London, should have been full of them.

In this business, albeit the Scots did express their kindness really to
their Friends, and made known their valor to all; Yet, here, I must tell you,
they did not show their prudence; for, if the Enemy had known them to have no
Commission, (as they had none) by Law of Arms, he had given them no quarter.

On the one side, the ignorance of the Enemy did hinder him to deal with the
Scots, being in his power, according to the rigor of the Law of Arms; On the
other side, their valor and kindness, did prevail little for thanks or
recompense, from those, for whose Service they had undergone such hazard.

When the Framers of the new Model cashiered the Scots Officers we have been
speaking of, they named four General Officers of the Scots to be kept in the
new Army; which some did for the good opinion they had of the worth and
usefulness of those men, for the Service: Others did it, lest the people
should enquire, why all the Scots, at one time; should be thus put out of
Service, whose faithfulness and forwardness was known, being free of the
guilt of the late miscarriage of things in the Fields.

Those few Officers, although they were named to be kept in the new Model;
they did conceive, that they had tacitcly their Quienis est, first, by
cashiering their Contrymen, who were known to be well deserving and
faithful men unto the Covenant, (which is the Rule of that we fight for) and
by naming them to inferior employments in this new Model, to what they had
come to be prefered to by their own virtue. Next, by bringing in new men, not
acquainted with War, in equal command with them, and under them, and some of
these professed not to favor the Covenant, unto which the Scots were resolved
to stick to: So they thought sit to take the course of their other
Contrymen, and to lay down their Commissions, for fear of further
inconvenience, namely, if any mischance should fall out, apprehending the blame
should be cast upon them; and then, they could not expect true fellowship not
obeying to Orders in the Service, of those men, who had another-mind then
theirs, which is expressed in the Covenant.

The disobedience thereafter of some, in the new Model, to the express
Ordinances of Parliament, made this apprehension good.

Upon this, there is a great cry given out against those few Scots, who had
abandonned the Service at such a time of need; but never a word how that two
hundred Scots had been put of the Service.

Here, it may be asked, Whether those few Scots were more in the wrong to the
public Service, by laying down their Commissions, serving still the same
Cause, with those who are constant to their principles with them; then those
who put off the Service, at one time, two hundred valiant and well deserving
men.

I could have wished, for my part, that those few men had laid aside all
consideration and apprehension, howsoever just, and continued in the Model,
leaving the event of things to God.

Now, it is said, that God has blessed the honesty and piety of some men
extraordinarily, in the new Army, so that great things are done by it.

I acknowledge with a thankful heart to God, that he, in his Mercy, has done
great things of late by that Army; but, no thank to the honesty and piety of
some men; for, I do not find piety more really in them, to speak with modesty,
then in other men: Howsoever their external profession is, let their carriage
toward God and Man speak for them, and not profession only; for, profession
oftentimes is a clock of knavery and faction.

Then, howsoever God, in his good Providence, does great things by weak and
inconsiderable men; yet, I am certain, it is the surest way to employ men of
skill and of experience, in any work we are going about; and surely, we cannot
look for a good success of any business whatsoever, when we neglect to employ
those whom God has fitted with ability for the work, if we can have such.

I know, God is above all rule; but this is the ordinary course, both with God
and among men; the examples are so clear in all businesses among the Sons of
men, that it is idle to allege any; only I shall say, that there is more of
this choice of fit men to be remarked in the War, then in any other thing among
men, as it has been observed of old, by judicious men: Yet God, in War, more
then in any thing else, shows his overruling power, and that he is above the
ordinary course of things. But, to put God to show here his overruling hand,
in a extraordinary way, without need, is a kind of tempting of him; for, since
he has, in his wise Dispensation, ordained an ordinary course for doing of
businesses, to be used by men fitted by him for the work, he promised tacitly
his blessing thereunto, providing always that we rely more upon him, then the
second causes.

More, in all this success there was never more seen of God, and less of men;
and those men who would make men believe, that their honesty and piety shines
above others, have but small share in action, for any thing I can yet hear.

A word more: It was not without a mystery, that so many gallant Officers of
both Nations, were cashiered under pretext of want of piety and honesty, being
free of any guilt of the former miscarriages; and yet the ordinary Soldiers
kept still in the Service, whose piety is known to be less, as men of little
and small breeding, and so, of less knowledge of God and of themselves, and
consequently, not so given to the practice of goodness, and so abstract from
evil; having but small light, they cannot do so well as others, who have better
breeding then they; and, upon mistake, they may more easily be brought over to
do what is amiss, for themselves and for others, yea, for the public Service
of Church and State, and so become a prey to abusers and deceivers.

Moreover, there is a great stir about Carlisle, now in the hands of the Scots,
for the Service of the Parliament. For the better understanding of things, we
shall take them at a further rise.

So long as these two Kingdoms were under two several Princes, Carlisle and
Berwick were two Garison-Towns upon the Frontiers; but so soon as these
Kingdoms did come unto one Princes hands, those places were ordered to be
forsaken, and their fortifications rased, and to be no more a partition wall;
which was done accordingly, and so they remained for many years, till of late,
that is, till the beginning of the first troubles of the Scots with the abused
King, who caused then repair those places in some kind, and put Garrisons in
them.

Thereafter, at the first pacification upon the Frontiers, betwixt the King and
the Scots, those places were to be relinquished, as they had been formerly.

By the Articles of agreement, at the second pacification, the same was
confirmed, and that by the Authority of this same Parliament, now sitting,
gathered together, continued and preserved by the help and aid of the Scots.

The King, beginning his barbarous War against the Parliament, makes Carlisle
sure, which by degrees insensibly he furnishes with a strong Garrison and
Munition accordingly, as a place fit for his purpose, for vexing of the Scots,
upon occasion, whom he did foresee would not side with him in this wicked
design, if they were not opposite unto him; and for receiving his Irish
Rebels, to do mischief to both Kingdoms as they pleased, if they were not
stopped. And so, since then, he has kept it, till within these few days; and
it has served for a seat and a passage for troubling both Kingdoms.

The Houses of Parliament, on the other side, a little latter, possess
themselves of Berwick, which the King did not regard so much, as not so
considerable for his purpose, and also, it was too much in the eyes of men to
be seized upon, by him, at the first beginning.

When the Scots come into England, at this time, to help their Brethren, who
had been so kind unto them in their troubles, and whose Fathers had assisted
their Fathers, in the Cause of Reformation and Liberty; by agreement betwixt
the Parliament and them, they had Berwick delivered up unto them, for
facilitating their entry, and advancing the Service they engaged themselves
in: and if Carlisle had been in the power of the Parliament then, it had been
delivered unto the Scots, without any more ado, as freely as Berwick was for
the very same reason. Yea, more, if it had been required then, it had been
promised unto the Scots: I do not mean of necessity; but of mere consideration
to the public Cause.

Now, the Northern Country of England, through Gods Mercy, being pretty well
cleared, by the help of the Scots, of the open professed and declared Common
Enemy; it is thought fit, first to block up, and then to besiege Carlisle: The
Scots undertake the business, and to this purpose, sent of their Army thither
a party of both Horse and Foot, under the command of a General Officer, and he
has some Forces of the Country to assist and help him, in the performance of
the Service; which the Scots did not so hardly press as to storm the Town, for
sparing of blood, which they are loath to shed, if the business can be carried
on otherwise, (witness New Castle, where they shunned to shed blood, and
being constrained to it, they did shed as little as ever has been seen upon
such an occasion) so they resolve to take the Town by want of necessary
provisions.

Those of the Country, who were joint with the Scots in the Service, were so
far from helping them, that, by the treachery of their Leaders, they did what
they could not only to hinder the business; but also, to wrong the Scots in
what was in their power; for, when they were ordered to keep their own quarters
strictly, and suffer nothing to go unto the Enemy; and if he fallied out of the
Town, to fall upon him: they were so far from performing their Order, that when
it was in their power to hurt the Enemy, they shot powder without bullets at
him, and privately, they suffered provision to be carried unto him through
their quarters; yea, by secret combination, they agreed with the Enemy, that if
he would fallie out, and fall upon the Scots, quarters, they should yield no
help unto them, although they were joint with them in the Service.

Which proceedings of the North Contrymen, by the knavery of their
Commanders, whereof the chief lately had been in open Rebellion against the
Parliament, under the Earl of New Castle; being made known unto the Scots, they
had a nearer eye to their actions, and oblige them thereafter to play fairer
play: Those false and deceitful Leaders, seeing themselves disappointed of
their former intents by the care of the Scots, go another way to work; and
perceiving by the vigilance of the Scots, that the Town, receiving no help from
without, must render it self; underhand, and not acquainting the Scots, enter
in a private Treaty with the Enemy, and offer him great conditions.

This being also discovered by the Scots, caused them summon the Town, and
offer to it reasonable conditions, which the Enemy did accept, although they
were not so advantagous for him, in all points, as those offered by the others.

The reason why the Enemy did accept the Scots conditions, and not the others,
was, first, He could not trust to any condition from those who were so wicked,
that they were not trusty to the party they professed themselves to be of, and
to their associates.

Next, The Enemy seeing the chief man, among those double ones, to be but an
inferior Officer, and one who never had seen greater War then the plundering
and spoiling of his own Country, under the Earl of New castle, with whom he
had been a Lievtenant-Colonel at the most, and now at this time prefered, for
some ends, to be a Colonel. Then, there was no Committee there who could
authorize him to capitulate, or make good his capitulation, where the Scots
were; for, by agreement betwixt the Scots and the Parliament, things of
consequence in the War, wherein the Scots had a hand, were to be ordered by the
Committee of both Kingdoms upon the place, or with the Scots Army, and that not
being, (as there was none then) by the Scots General his Order; and so he
ordained, according to the first agreement, Lieutenant General David Lesley to
take in the Town, upon such conditions as he should think fit for the good of
the public Service, and put a Garrison in it.

Those who came out of the Town, were conducted unto Worcester, who were but
six score when they arrived thither, the rest being fallen away in their march,
either upon consideration of the public, or of their own private interest.

Thus Carlisle is put in obedience of the Parliament, for the public Service,
according to the first agreement: And if the Scots had not followed the
business, in all appearance, it either had still remained in the hands of open
Enemies, or, at least, had fallen in the hands of those Malignants, who neither
have respect to the credit of the Parliament, nor regard to the good of the
people; for they dishonor the one, and waste the other.

All the while that the Siege was before Carlisle, there was not only a
neglect, but such a malice against the Scots, who were at it, that they had
starved for want, if the Scots Army had not sent a good part of the moneys that
they had for their marching and taking the Field. Thus is the public served by
the Countrey-Committees, abusing the Authority they have from the Parliament.

After all this, the Scots are cried out upon by Malignants; yea, they write to
the Houses against them, as Enemies to the public good, to the Parliament, and
to the people of England, notwithstanding that since the very first beginning
of those troubles they have carried themselves faithfully, honestly, and kindly
toward England, in despite of all Enemies, and particularly toward the
Parliament, who were the cause of assembling it, continuing it, and preserving
it, first, from the great Plot made against, next, by actively upholding it
when it was very low, as it was at their in-coming.

The reason why the Scots have put a Garrison of their own men in Carlisle, for a
time, is from the constitution of the present affairs in both Kingdoms; for,
having found such knavery and wicked dealing, by the chief men in the Northern
Countries, they did not conceive it fit, for the public Service, to put the
place in the hands of those, who already possessed with power (by the
unfaithful Commissioners, trusted by the Parliament with the ordering of
things in those places) do nothing but oppose the design of the Parliament
expressed in the Covenant, and oppress the people, as is made known unto the
Parliament by the Commissioners from those Countries, (men of credit and worth,
who have done and suffered much for the Cause against the Common Enemy) sent
hither from many good people, to complain against those wicked ones, Enemies to
God and to his people: And when it shall be thought fit for the Common good of
both Nations, now so united, it will with all cheerfulness be left by the
Scots; And to this, the State of Scotland will willingly engage it self, by all
the assurances can be require in reason.

The Common Enemy, since he could not keep out Carlisle in open War, against the
Parliament, does his next best to have it in the Malignants, his Friends,
hands, that at least indirectly, he may do his work; and since he failed of
both those, he striveth by his Emissaries and Agents to make it an Apple of
discord betwixt the two united Nations: but, this will fail him also, how
cunningly soever he goe's about this design; for, the Wisdom of both States is
such, that the mistake will be taken away shortly, and that the State of
England will see clearly, the Scots, in possessing themselves of Carlisle, and
excluding those wicked ones abovementioned, have not only done a good piece
of Service to the public and the Common Cause of both Kingdoms; but also, in
particular, to the well-affected people in those parts, who are under the heavy
pressure of those wicked ones, and had been far more, if they had more power,
whereunto the possession of Carlisle were such an addition, that it would make
them double Tyrants and Brigants.

As the Common Enemy, not only by open War by Land; but also, by false
undermining by his Agents and Instruments, who partly are absolutely addicted
to his wicked design, partly by interest of preferment and benefit, although
they care but little for his ends in the Field, or in the Counsel, in the City
or in the Country; do what they can, with all care and forecasting, to stop
the public Service by many and many ways; this is known too well to be so
little regarded: Even so, by Sea, he steereth the same course; for, not only
by open War he does oppose the public Work, now in hand, in taking and
destroying all that he can; but likewise, he uses indirect means by the help
of his Instruments, for the hinderance of the Service of the Common Cause, now
in hand.

Hence it is that the Parliaments Ships, not so vigorously opposing the Enemy,
and not giving timely assistance to their Friends, interessed in the Cause; so
many of the Enemy his Ships, without resistance, go up and down so freely, and
that there are so many Ships, Barks, etc. both English and Scots, taken by the
Enemies.

Further, the Coasts of Scotland are not so carefully guarded and kept, as they
were promised to be, by agreement; which has given and gives still a great
advantage to the Enemy, and has done a great hurt to the Friends who are
employed in the Cause against the Enemy, and, in them, to the Service of the
Cause.

These things have given occasion of complaints to many men, bemoaning their
own condition, and how that the good of the people and the Service of the
Common Cause, are no more and better looked to; yea, some in grief of heart,
after their great sufferings, hardly taken notice of by those of whom they
expect some redress, say that not only there is a great neglect, but, in
appearance, there is some secret connivence, by those who should follow this
Service. But to another business:

It is known to every one, almost, how that for many and many days and
meetings, there has been a great deal ado in the Synod, with some few factious
and fantastical headstrong ones (men without love to the Peace of the Church
of God) for the Government of the Church by Parochial Presbyteries, subaltern
to Classical, and Classical subaltern to Synodicall; which all being, after
so many debates with Patience, Goodness, and Charity toward those men,
demonstrated evidently to be according to the Word of God, wherein it is
grounded, conform to the practice of the Church planted and governed by the
Apostles and their successors, for above two hundred years after Christ; and
conform likewise, to the best Reformed Churches now adays.

But, at length, the thing is concluded upon by the Synod, and approved by the
Houses of Parliament, maugre all opposition made by the disturbers of the Peace
of the Church, in the Synod, and of the sticklers for them any where else. Yet,
those restresse spirits will not be quiet; for, they give out, that they will
perform at last the thing they have been so much urged to, and for so long a
time; to wit, they will give unto the Public, the Model of Government they
would be at, and to which they will stand to: But, those who have a shrewd
guess at those men, and at their ways, assure us, that, as they will not tell
what they absolutely and positively profess, nor what they would be at; they
will never give a set Model of Government unto the Public, whereunto they
mind to stand:

For, whatsoever they do in opposition of the Government above named, they
cannot agree among themselves unto any one thing, for, so many heads so many
ways dissonant one from another, according to the nature of untruth and
error, which is uncertain, and not constant to it self. Yea, there be some who
say, That those men will not settle upon any thing at all, except it be upon
continuing in phrenaticall Fancies; and those of the most exacter sort amongst
them, are named Seekers, not of God, or his Truth, and of Peace; but of
themselves and of novelties, at the best; which ever has, and will be
troublesome to the Peace of the Church.

Truly, as those factious ones, by rejecting all dependancy, and
subalternation of inferior Presbytereis to superior, in Church Government, have
acquired unto themselves the Name of Independents; so, if you cast your eyes
upon the courses of those men's seeking of preferment and benefit, they may
justly all be called Seekers: For, there was never a generation, among men, so
nimble and so active about preferment and benefit, as those men are. The
Jesuits are far short of them, howsoever cried up through the world for this;
for, they run up and down with care and cunning to lay hold on power and
moneys, wherein they have come to good speed by their crafty insinuations, and
the silliness of other men: Diverse of all ranks, not excepting the higher
amongst men, seeing their ways advantageous, side and cog in with them, for
profit and employment. They, on the other side, receive none in their Society
but those of means and gifts; poor people and simple are profane in their
account: They work hugely with rich men's wives, widows, and daughters; and
stirring fellows, in any kind are good for them: And to carry on their
business more smoothly, they plead for charity, that there may be a charitable
interpretation of their carriage and proceeding, when God knows, they are
destitute of all charity, first toward the Church, in general, whose peace
they disturb in a high measure, and toward particular men, for they oppress
and afflict every honest man they can reach, in hatred to faithfulness unto
the good of the Church and State, if all were well known and considered; for
those who strive so much for confusion in the Church, aim all Anarchie in the
State, doubtless. It is true, there be diverse simple well meaning men that are
ensnared in the opinion of those men, of Church Government; but, good people,
who are not of the Cabale, nor of the secret faction; who, I doubt, upon fuller
information, will leave the error, and follow the Truth. So there be many
honest and well meaning people, who adhere and follow the Jesuits, who are not
acquainted with the mysteries of their iniquity.

Then, with a great deal of deceit, they cry out igainst the rigidnesse of
Presbyteriall-government, as aforesaid, to make the people believe that it will
tie them to such a strictness and rigidity, or austerity, that all Christian
Liberty will be taken away from them. Wherein they do lie most abominably
against the practice of all the Reformed Churches where this Government has
place, namely in Scotland and France, where if there be any thing amiss of
this kind, it is toward lenity rather then austerity.

Yet, those fellows give out, that they are more holy then other men, and of a
stricter life, and will not admit to their Society any who will not bind
himself to the strictness they profess externally; but, their carriage, being
near looked to, will be found as far distant from what they profess, as the
Capuchins hypocrisy is from true piety.

The business is no sooner ended concerning the Church Government, maugre
Independents, but there arise other difficulties and rubs in the way, to hinder
the settling of Government: Such obstacles are cast in by the Enemy, to stop the
building of the Temple:

First, Some will not allow it to be of divine right, notwithstanding it is
demonstrated to have its ground in the Scripture, so clearly that it cannot be
denied, and practiced by the Apostles and their successors.

Then, There is a great stir concerning the power of the Presbytery, to admit
and keep off people from the Table of the Lord; and to receive men unto the
Communion of the Church, or to seclude them from it: Which power some will have
to be only in the Civil Magistrate: Wherein there is a great mistake. From
the beginning of the World to the giving of the Law, both functions of the
spiritual Ministry concerning God and Religion, and of the civil Ministry
concerning the external Society of men, being in one man, to wit, in the
Father, and the eldest Son in the Fathers room; things were not so clearly
distinct: But then, at the giving of the Law, God in his appointed time, and in
his wise dispensation, ordained the functions of his spiritual Ministry of
Church, and of the civil Ministry of State, to be in distinct persons; so the
power belonging severally to each Ministry was to be exercised distinctly by
those who were set aside severally, for the several Ministeries: And that the
one Minister had power over the things concerning his Ministry, as the other
over his, it is clear by Scripture.

Thus, things did continue from Moses to Christ, although now and then not
without some alteration or change, by reason of the revolutions of affairs, in
the State of Israel and of Judah.

In the Christian Church, the distinct Ministeries being in distinct persons,
the power belonging to the several Ministeries, must be in distinct persons,
according to their Ministeries; and although the civil Magistrate, or Minister
of State, is not to exercise the spiritual Ministry, nor what belongs to
it; yet he is obliged to oversee the Minister of spiritual things, to do his
duty faithfully and diligently. Of those, much has been said and written in
former times, and of late, by men of the clearest judgment, and of most
understanding in things of this nature. Besides, the fear of men, that the
spiritual Scepter and rod of Christ should be prejudiciable to their wordly
authority, the frequent encroaching of the Ministers of the Church upon the
civil Minister, to wave what is done elsewhere, and has been in former times
here in those Islands, not only of old, but in those latter years,
Churches-Ministers, ambition, and avarice, having cast us in all those
troubles; does furnish just occasion of weariness to the civil Magistrate, to
keep the Ministry and power of Church men within the precinct of the Church;
but it must not be so as to make them like the trencher-Chaplain, to say a
short grace and no more.

As the Church Ministers are not to meddle with civil affairs, so the civil
Ministers ought not to meddle with things merely spiritual; such are the
censures of the Church, which is commonly called the power of the keys.

Further, as Prelates with their Emissaries, have put Christ out of his Throne
in a kind, making themselves Lords and Masters of his Flok and Heritage; so on
the other side, those who take away the due power of the keys from the
Ministers of Christ in his Church, does him a great deal of wrong in his
spiritual Kingdom. Therefore, let us look to it, lest when we have pulled down
one tyranny Antichristian out of the Church, we do not leave it to confusion
and Anarchie, and so to be inslaved to the phancie and to the humor of weak
men. But of this, let it suffice in this place.

Moreover, as the Scots did constantly in all their own troubles ever from the
beginning to this day, lay hold upon all the occasions they could meet withal,
to try if it were possible by fair means to redeem the misled King from his
evil ways, and to calm all things with the least noise or stir that could be;
so it has been their constant course here, both before and since their
conjunction in action with the English in this Common Cause, to try by fair
means, if the King could be prevailed with, for his own good and that of the
people; and now at this time, after so many advantages obtained of late upon
the adverse party, they have thought it fit to desire the Parliament to send to
the King, to try him yet again, if at last he will condescend to what is
fitting in reason and conscience for the settling of Church and State, as it
has been proposed unto him, with a ripe deliberation, after a serious debate,
and laying aside all evil Counsel, where with he has been so long misled,
come home to the Parliament, the great Counsel of the Land.

This advice of the Scots, as it is liked by the wiser and better sort of men,
who have mainly the public Service before their eyes; so, by the hotter kind
of people, who breath nothing but violence and extremity, it is cried out upon
as prejudiciable unto the Common Cause, and will give an advantage to the
Enemies, since the King is not to be reclaimed by fair means, and will never
yield to reason but upon mere necessity.

It is but too true, I am assured, and I must confess there be but very small
hopes of doing any good with the King, or gaining any good upon him in that
way; for, besides that nothing has been gained by all the former Messages sent
to him, or by Treaties with him, the violation of the Peace made twice with the
Scots, the many Plots both in Scotland and in England to undo all, the bloody
businesses in Ireland, the last intercepted Letters, wherein he expresses his
mind, and the intelligence we have from all places abroad, tells us
sufficiently that he will continue still in this persecuting way of Church and
State, so long as he can hold out. The reason of this his perseverance in those
courses, is clear to any rational man, and it is this: There is a great
design now afoot in these Dominions, which is to bring all to spiritual and
temporal slavery and thraldom more then it was in the blindest times; which
will be kept up with all might and slight, so long as is possible; and the
abused King, who is the chief Agent in this business, will be kept to it and
not suffered to give over the work, but go no so long as they who set him about
it, can furnish him with any encouragement, by hopes, counsel, and
intelligence, moneys, arms, or by any other assistances whatsoever, to keep
life in the business.

Now, if you will ask who be those who have set this great design afoot, and
have engaged the King in it, I will tell you, Rome, France, and Spain: The
Pope, to have all under him, at least, as formerly: The Spaniard and French,
first, both in respect of the Holy Father, as Christian and Catholic Sons;
then, each of the two has his own private interest besides: The Spaniard, by
the means, hopes for a number of good Friends here, (the work succeeding) by
reason of the common Catholicity, and to have Ireland absolutely at his
devotion, to side with him upon such occasion as he shall require; for it is
every where remarked, that the Popish of those Dominions have a double dose of
Catholicon in their bellies, and to be Spanish, and as they are addicted to the
tyranny of Rome over the inward man, also they are affected to the tyranny of
Spain over the outward man; so ingrate are they toward God, and so unnatural
toward their own Country.

The French has his particular interest in the work; for, since he could by no
means get the King to side with him in opposing the Austrian, and to help his
nearest Allies and Confederates against his and their Enemies; in spleen and
revenge, has put many Irons in the fire to give work at home, to undo himself
and his people.

Next, The French, by the putting the King to work at home, and by keeping him
to it, goe's on with his own work against the Austrian, namely in Flanders,
wherein these Dominions have the most interest to look to, by reason of the
neernesse and the narrow Seas.

Then, the French has a further drift, who when he has any leisure from his
Wars with the Austrian, either by an accommodation, or by an absolute Victory,
he may send hither a party to make the Hola, with a vengeance, little to the
content of either Prince or people; yea, to seek by a strong hand that which
the Norman offered to the then French King, and he refused.

These are the shares and parts that Rome, Spain, and France take in our
troubles, howsoever they give out otherwise, for prove of this, to lay aside
many things which might be here alleged:

First, for Rome, I pray you put before your eyes the constant and near
commerce the corrupt Court and the wicked Clergy have had with Rome, and have
to this day, with the Letters betwixt the King and the Pope, and the sending
Agents hence to Rome, and from thence hither, and a Nuntio into Ireland, who is
now so far as the nearer coasts of France, in his way for Ireland.

Next, for Spain and its adherents in the Catholic Cause, to say nothing of
what is past in the kindling of the fire among us, by several underblowings: I
pray you to consider the Residents now of Castille, Portugal, of Venice,
Florence, Lorraine, etc. what their carriage is, how inclined to the Court, and
how adverse to the Parliament.

As for France, The late Factotum of that Court, did acknowledge it to be one
of his Master-peeces, to have kindled the fire in all those Dominions, first in
Scotland, next in Ireland, and last, a little before his death, in England;
whereabout he had above a dozen of Agents at one time, acting their several
parts in this act here with us. Those who have succeeded in his place, carry on
things his way very near, namely, in what concerns us, as may appear by the
sending into Scotland, to hinder the Scots joining with the Parliament, and by
the continual supplies which are sent from France to the Enemies in England,
Scotland, and Ireland, and the Residents of France their expressions in favor
of the Enemies.

All this is done really, albeit not avouched by public Authority.

Notwithstanding that both Spanish and French give out they will keep fair with
the States of both Kingdoms, and indeed the commerce in some kind is
continued; but, they receive in their Sea-Towns Pirates with the spoils they
take from both Nations, who are now consederate in this Common Cause.

Then some others, who, at first, although they had not perhaps put their hands
to cast us in those troubles; yet, seeing us enclining thereunto, have put them
forward, and have given help to our miseries. Such are some of Holland, who,
against the principles and grounds of their own State, have by their late
Ambassador, declared themselves to be enslaved to our corrupt Court, for their
own private interests, and for that of him who namely set them awork.

When I spoke of Holland, Spain, France, yea, of Rome it self, I do not mean
the common people; but of those who have chief hand in affairs and in
Government: for, God knows, the people of those Countries are as innocent of
any evil office done unto us now, as our people were free from doing harm to
the Protestants of France and Germany.

The King of Danemark would fain have had his hand in the business; but he
has found other things to do.

Yet, after all this, since we constantly pray for our King both in public and
in private, if it were Gods will, to reclaim him unto himself; and then that we
might have godly, sober, and quiet life under him; I see no reason why we
should not try upon all occasion to regain him, leaving the event and success
to God, as the favorable hearing of our prayers for the King, to God his
sacred will; which not being declared unto us upon the point, we demand it upon
the condition of his good will and pleasure, and not absolutely as the
salvation of our souls, concerning which he has manifested his will, in his
word, unto us.

Now in this place, and at this time, I know it will be expected to have
somewhat said of the present condition of Scotland: So, to discharge this duty
in some measure, I give you this Discourse in few words, and as near the truth
as I can, being at such a distance not having so full intelligence; which I
pray you to take thus.

The Common Enemy seeing himself disappointed of effectuating, to his mind, his
wicked design by his enterprises of War, and his failing Plots in Scotland;
then the Scots refusing in England to serve him in this design, as thereafter
their helping the Protestants in Ireland, and last of all, their aiding England
when they were very low, against his bloody Agents; finds if it had not been
for the Scots, he had not had such rubs and obstacles, and so had gone more
freely on with his work: Wherefore, since the Scots were the only, in a kind,
hinderers of his compassing of his design, he thinks how to be revenged of
them, and to make them leave off this active opposing of him and his design.
After many things proposed and tried to small purpose, at last it is resolved
by the Court to send home the Malignant Lords, to see what they can do; whom,
according to orders, go home, submit to the State, and take the Covenant.
Diverse other Malignants who had been lurking in and about the Country, do the
same, and so they make all their peace. More, there were other double minded
Lords, who hitherto had carried themselves so warily, albeit they were known to
be disaffected, yet the Laws of the Land could not lay hold on them, receiving
a favorable interpretation by the help of their kindred, Friends and Allies.

At this time, a good part of the best affected men were employed abroad,
either in England or in Ireland, what in action in the Field, and what in
Counsel; and the military men, who had been most stirring in their own last
troubles, were employed in either of these two places, and some were gone to
France to serve that King in his Wars.

The Country being thus emptied of men of Counsel and of business, as also
of men of War; the Agents for the Common Enemy bethink themselves that they
have fair occasion to do somewhat for the design they in their heart affect
and follow: but to go more smoothly to work, they must be employed in the
service of the Country, which being emptied (as is said) of honest and able
men, did admit them, and was in a manner of necessity constrained to make use
of them in the Counsel of State, and in diverse others Assemblies, and in all
Committees almost.

This point being gained, resolution is taken to make a party of some stirring
men to go into Scotland, and the West Islands are designed to be the only fit
place, the chance being tried so often before to no purpose, because they were
negligently kept; the Lords and chief men of those parts being in England, with
diverse of the prime men of the Country: they pitch upon an Alexander Macdoneld
nicnamed Kilkitterch, that is to say, Little thief, an Epithet fit for a man
who lives on spoil and prey. This man as an outlaw had left Scotland, and gone
over to Ireland, where he joined with the Rebels, and fought for them against
the Protestants for a time; and after some dislike he leaves them, and joins
with the Scots, and brings some few hundereds of such men as himself with
him. The General receives him, and he serves the Scots against the Rebels for
a while: he tells the General that he had a great mind to have pardon for his
former errors, and make his peace with his native Country: the General
undertakes it, but finds not the thing so easy to be done, and so soon, as he
expected, by reason (as is given out) of the naughtiness of the man; others
say more; truly there was a particular spleen that stopped it. At this,
Macdoneld frets, and goe's back again to the Irish Rebels, who received him
kindly, partly by reason of his activity, partly in regard of his new kindred
with the Earl of Antrim. To be short, resolution being taken to send over into
Scotland, and that into the Isles, choice is made of him, who having chosen
out, from among the Rebels, some few hundreds of desperate fellows what native
Irish, what Scots habituated in Ireland, what Islanders and highlanders of his
own humor and Friends, goe's for Scotland, and lands in the West among the
Isles and hills, where he finds but little, if any opposition. At his thus
arrival without any rub, diverse of his old acquaintance and outlawes with him,
repair unto him; so he increases his number: at the first, the business was
laughed at: But, seeing the number did increase by those men, it is thought fit
to look after them. He that had most interest, was in England for the time, who
upon the news, goe's home, and takes Commission, with diverse other Noble
Gentlemen, to pursue the Enemy; but the pursuit was with such slacknesse, that
the Enemy gains daily ground, and his number increases.

By this time, Montrosse who had secret correspondence with Macdoneld, upon
advice, goe's privately from the North of England, where he had bestirred
himself as in the South of Scotland, but he had been repulsed by the English
and Scots forces in those parts, with few men incognito, and joins with
Macdonald.

The two being joined, Montrosse declares himself General of the party, and
shows his Commission, with many fair pretenses to stand for the Covenant, and
to continue the Government of the Church as it is now settled, and also, to ease
the people of the burdens laid upon them by some factious men: This he
promises, assisted with Papists, Atheists, forsworn men, and outlaws; which he
performs much at the rate of him who set him a work, spoiling, burning, and
slaying men, women, and children; in a word, using all kind of barbarous
dealing where he could be Master; yea, diverse were not spared upon their beds.

Then, those Nobles and Gentlemen who had Commission from the States of
Scotland, go against the despicable Enemy, and the first rencounter was about
the bridge of Jerne, where some betraying the Commission they had, run to the
Enemy, others astonished fled away, and others sell their lives at the dearest
rate they were able to do: so with a few, he had the better of a great number.
The Enemy had another rencount a while thereafter, by the same way, and with
the like success: After which his courage and number increased so, that the
people began to apprehend and fear him.

Upon this, the States send more men to help, and think fit to employ an old
Officer to command in Chief against those Rebels, who seeing this preparation
made against them, retire to the hills, and seeing the Army of the Country
could not stay altogether in one place, but must be divided into diverse
squadrons, the Enemy, from the hills, upon intelligence given him by Malignants
of the Country in the Army, falls now and then upon Gentlemen's houses,
Villages, and Towns, which he spoils and makes a prey of, and sometimes falls
upon one quarter or other of the States Forces, where, although he found even
honest men that fought most valiantly against him, and killed many of his men,
yet, by the treason of some Commanders or others, for the most part, he has
come off with advantage; and now within these few days, he has had the
greatest with a handful of men. He never, to this day, could make up at one
time three thousand men, when the Countries forces were together near twice,
thrice, yea four times his number.

Although God be the Lord of Hosts, and it is he that gives wisdom and
resolution for Victories; yet since men have a hand in this business, we
cannot but enquire if the men employed in the work have done their part
according to their trust and abilities wherewith God has enabled them.

I know, that it is ordinary with people, (who rise little higher then to men)
when there is any good success obtained by any, to adore him, and when things
go amiss to lay the fault upon man, yea, perhaps, upon the same man whom they
had a little before adored.

Yet here, although I cannot say positively, there has been a continued
treachery in the carriage of things, by diverse of the Officers, namely, by him
that did command in Chief; there be shrewd presumptions to guess that there is
a great deal of knavery; as,

First, The great complaints of the honest and true Commanders, who, being
nearest, could see best, and judge best of fair play or foul.

Next, The posture of the Country, when this party entered into the Land.

Then, The correspondence the Enemy has with some of high note and employment
in the Country, with the favor and connivence of others.

Further, By the open treason of those who have run unto him, although employed
against the Enemy; yea, there be who have run unto him in the Field, when they
should have fought against him.

More, The assurance that the Malignants had of Victory long before it came, at
home, in the Country, here in England, and beyond Sea.

To this exigence, with the now unsuffering barbarous Enemy and of false
brethren, have honest men brought themselves to; and the poor Country, who had
carried on their own business with such resolution and wisdom, and had kept
under them the sons of Belial and children of falsehood and lies, that they
durst not grumble, but submit quietly, for their kindness to their Neighbors,
among whom they have dispersed themselves for their Service, and for overplus,
they are paid with ingratitude, neglects, yea calumnies and affronts for their
pains, by many of these people, for whom they have drawn all this upon them,
and for whom daily they hazard and lose their lives, when they might all this
while have sat at home quietly: but, they hope that the same God, who set them
first about his Work, for all this, will enable them in mercy to be steadfast to
his Cause, for which they now so much suffer; will, at last, free them from
trouble, and end the business to his own glory and the good of his people, in
despite of all malignancy and opposition whatsoever; for, when God has
chastised his own for a time, he will throw the scourge in the fire, and show
them his great power in redeeming them from the hand of the wicked, upon whom
the tempest of the Lord goe's forth, and the whole wind that hangs over shall
light upon their heads; yea, the fierce wrath of the Lord shall not return
until he have done and performed the intent of his heart upon his Enemies: and
the Lord will say unto Israel, Thou People, who have escaped the Sword, have
found Grace in the Wilderness, and I will go before thee to cause thee to
rest, for I have loved thee with an everlasting Love; wherefore, with Mercy
have I drawn thee, and I will make a new Covenant with thee, thou have broken
the old which I made with thee when I brought thee out of Egypt; and this shall
be the new Covenant I will make with thee, I will put my Law in thine inward
parts, and write it in thine heart, and thou shall be my People, and I will be
thy God. Let us therefore wait upon the Lord with patience, who will not fail
in his promise, if we return unto him with true repentance for our sins, and
with a serious resolution to stick constantly close unto him, with our whole
heart.

There has been of late a great blustering of some secret underhand dealings
with the Common Enemy, by some few men, without the knowledge of the public;
of which I have thought fit to say these few words; and to understand the thing
more at length, we shall call to mind bow that the King, this last Winter,
sends hither his cajeoling Commissioners, who, according to their Order, did
cajeole the Scots and the Independents; but, how far they prevailed then with
the Independents by their cajeolerie, I cannot tell: but, I am sure, they did
not gain of the Scots the least point of any thing, yea, not of any expression
or thought of business, which could be in any kind interpreted to have an ill
meaning in it against the Churches and States advantage, in the three Kingdoms;
as the Scots have made appear in their constant fair carriage, in all business
of Church and State, maugre envy, namely in the last Treaty, where they did
show really what honesty and faithfulness they had in their heart, as I have
said before.

The Treaty being ended without any agreement, the Court, after a time, sends
one hither; for, although he gives out that he stole away, yet he came with the
knowledge of the Court; and things being tried really, it may happily be found
that he came hither by Order express, with instructions; who is a great
cajeolor to use the Courts own words, that is, in plain language, a mere
cheater, who has vowed to cozen, by his lies: This cajeolure, as the former
two, endeavors, first, to cajeole the Scots; but, finding he had a cold coal
to blow, he leaves off the design with them, and makes his addresses unto the
Independents; but how he has sped with them, it is not as yet fully known,
things not being manifested; but some fidling businesses there have been
betwixt him and them, whether or no, by the whole Cabale, or by some few of the
prime of the faction, it is uncertain.

First, That there was some under-hand-dealing by them, the intercepted Letters
of Digby unto Leg, give a shrewd proof of it.

Next, The Papers found since in the cajeolors friends closet, under the
cajeolors own hand.

When these things are tried to the full, we hope the light of all will appear,
which all honest men wish it may be done exactly and speedily: And till then,
men's minds will not be satisfied, and they will hardly refrain to speak of
these things, howsoever it be taken; for they conceive not only by the
opennesse of the time they are free from the thraldom of the corrupt Court; but
also, since they have interest in the business, and have hazarded all what
they have or had for the public Service, they may express their thoughts
freely of occurrences, so it be with discretion, sparing men's persons, till
things be cleared: And sincerely I think, no innocent man can be angry at this;
if any in conscience finds himself guilty in any kind, that he will do well to
suffer it patiently, for fear he suffer more, if things go exactly on to a
trial.

The light that happily may be found out of this, will not be and cannot be by
a mathematical or metaphysicall demonstration, yet by so certain proofs as
the nature of the thing can suffer or require; for, businesses of this nature
take probable Arguments for demonstration, as we are taught by the Doctors of
of the Politics.

I know some have suffered for their free expression of these things, yet, I am
confident, it had been greater wisdom (under favor) to let go free speeches,
rather then to examine them too nearly, namely, when they proceed, without
malice or scurrility, from honest men, who in their zeal, perhaps, now and
then, may exceed the exact terms of moderation; and this I am persuaded, has
been the constant practice of wise men, grounded upon this: if the discourse be
groundless, it falls of it self. If there be any ground by stirring and ripping
up speeches, things will appear openly, which otherwise in a short time, would
have been buried in oblivion.

I forbear instances as in all my discourse, keeping my self to generals,
although I could have furnished diverse examples upon every point I have
touched; for, albeit it be said, He that speaks in general of all and to all,
speak of none and to none, yet every one may make use of what is said in
general, and apply it unto himself, for the good of the public and of
himself; which I wish every one that reads this discourse, may do in all
singleness of heart, as it is set forth by him in sincerity, who has no other
end in it, besides the glory of God, the good of Church and State, and the true
advantage of every honest man, without any wrong-meaning, but an earnest desire
that every one who is right and honest in this Cause, without by-respects, may
continue so till the end; and that those who have gone a wrong way may return
into the true, to the glory of God, the advancement of his Cause and of his
people, with their own praise and benefit.

Before I conclude, I will say this in truth, There was never a People in any
age, who, by Gods blessing, did carry on the work of Reformation with more
wisdom, and resolution, and success, then the Scots did in their own Country,
and no more compassionate of their Neighbors in distress, nor more forward to
help them by action and counsel, and to carry on the work of Reformation
amongst them, then the Scots have been and are to this hour: So, there was
never a People so harshly used in diverse kinds, by some of those for whose
good they have been and are so earnest: If this coarse usage went no further
then their own persons, means, and reputation, they could pass it with
silence, and not so much as think of it, laying it aside in Christian charity
and brotherly love, although they suffer much in all these by it, since they
have joined with their Neighbors to help them: But, since, by the neglecting,
opposing, and in a word ill-dealing with the Scots, the Service and work they
are about is wronged, stopped, and delayed, which is mainly and namely to help
the setting forward the Reformation of the Church of God, as it is expressed in
the National Covenant; they cannot but take it heavily to heart for the Name
of Gods sake. Surely those factions ones, who have used, and, at this time, use
thus their Brethren, who have ventured, yea, lost themselves in a manner, with
all what is dear unto men, for their sake, and to do them 2 double good, that
is, to help them out of trouble, and to settle 3 true and through Reformation
amongst them; have much to answer, not only for their malice, unthankfulness,
and ingratitude to those who have spent themselves for them; but also, for
their stopping and hindering, so far as in them lies, the good work of God,
and by that means give occasion of the continuance of these miseries wherein we
are all now involved, and almost overwhelmed. God forgive these men, and turn
them truly unto him, if it be his will; otherwise let them have no power to
hinder his good Cause.

And thus, good Reader, I have thought fit to give a little touch of diverse
main passages of these our troublesome businesses, leaving a fuller Discourse
of things to another time and another place.

FINIS.
