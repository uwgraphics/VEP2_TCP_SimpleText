By the Kings Majesty's Surueyor of coals to be shipped at Newcastle upon

THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, affecting nothing more then the good of his
losting Subjects in general, and having been very credibly informed of the
great abuses and wrongs daily committed in mingling amongst coals, commonly
called Newcastle coals, much black Earth, Dirt, Slate, and other bad stuff
not fit to burn or serve for firing, and so do bring and utter the same into
this Realm, and thereby for the most part do make good coals vnmerchantable,
to the great hurt and prejudice of the buyers thereof, which are very many: whom
for the preservation of woods, many Noblemen, Knights and Gentry of this
Realm (besides others of his Majesty's Subjects) do burn of the same coals.

Has been graciously pleased by his Highness Letters Patents, under his
Majesty's great Seal of England, bearing date the six and twenty day of
February, in the thirteenth year of his Majesty's reign of England, France
and Ireland, and of Scotland the nine and fortieth, to prohibit and suppress
such wrongs and abuses, as aforesaid: And to appoint a Surueyor of the said
coals, who, or his Deputy or Deputies are to be attending and attendant in
and about the searching, viewing, seeing and surueying of the said coals; And
are appointed to inform and complain against such as shall offend in such
mingling as aforesaid; And to have a Seal of office under which to certify
what coals, and of what sort of goodness of coals, any Master, Owner or
Shipper, do or shall take in, freight or lade into their ships or boats at
the places abouesayd, to be brought to the City of London, or otherwise to be
spent within this Realm of England, To the end that the buyers of the said
coals may the better know or be informed of the goodness or badnesse of them.

And also, if any person or persons, shall at any time or times hereafter have
any cause or causes of complaint against any Master, Owner, Shipper, or others,
for selling unto them such vnmerchantable coals, as aforesaid: Let him or them
repair unto Andrew Boyde Esquier, his Majesty's Surueyor in that behalf
appointed, or unto his Deputy or Deputies, and there in writing leave his or
their cause or causes of complaint touching the premises, and speedy
Information, according to the provision of the said Letters Patents, shall be
made and given against such as do or shall offend against the same Letters
Patents: As his Majesty's most gracious pleasure is therein signified.
