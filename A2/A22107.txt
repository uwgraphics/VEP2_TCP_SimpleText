By the King. A Proclamation prohibiting the Merchant Adventurers Charter from
henceforth to be put in practice or execution, either within the Kingdom, or
beyond the Seas.
AS there is no great action, which tends to the advancement of a public
good, but it requires certain degrees of timely proceeding, and nevertheless
meets with diverse impediments; some by accident, and some by practice: So is
there nothing that does more adorn the true Majesty and greatness of
Sovereign Princes, then to be constant in their wel-grounded Resolutions, and
by their policy and lawful power, to scatter and beat down all difficulties,
and undue oppositions, until they have conducted their Actions to a good and
happy end: We therefore, having propounded unto Our selves; as a principal
work of Our times, to ordeine and provide, that the great commodity of
Broad-cloth, being one of the principal Dowries of Our Kingdom, may receive
the due Manufactures of Dying and Dressing within the Realm; did to that end
publish Our Royal Proclamation, dated the three and twentieth day of July
last, prohibiting and ordeyning, That no Broad-cloth, of what sort soever, made
here within this Our Kingdom of England, should be Exported Vndied and
Undressed, after the second day of November next ensuing the date of Our said
Proclamation: Which time was given, as well for the Merchant Adventurers, to
vent their Whites, which might be upon their hands, as for the preparing of
diverse things, necessary to the settling of the new Trade of Died and dressed
Clothes. And We did further by Our said Proclamation promise in the Word of a
King to all Our loving Subjects, that should undertake to Export the said
Broad-clothes in their true Manufactures, that neither the Charter of the
Merchant Adventurers, nor any other Licenses or Dispensations by Non obstantes,
contrary to Our Laws, heretofore granted by Us, or any Our Predecessors,
should be any manner of prejudice, impeachment, disturbance, or interruption to
such, as should after the time aforesaid vent the said Clothes Died and
Dressed, according to Our said Royal Ordinance and constitution; but should be
from the said second day of November, declared to be annihilated, and made void
to all intents and purposes. At which time of the publishing of Our said
Proclamation, We did expect that the said Charter of the Merchant Adventurers
should, before the said second day of November, have been in due form of Law
surrendered: But after, finding the said Company of Merchant Adventurers to make
difficulty concerning the Surrender of their Patent; We have been enforced
through their wilfulness and inconformitie, as well to order a Legal course to
be taken for the overthrow of their said Patent: as also to license diverse of
Our loving Subjects, that have very worthily, and with great alacrity,
undertaken to set up and manage the said Trade of Dyed and Dressed Clothes, to
export also Whites in the mean while, until such time as the said Patent of
the Merchant Adventurers shall be by judgment euicted, and some respite of
time afterward, lest there might have ensued some stand of the vent of Cloth
before the new Trade were settled: But for as much as the course of a judicial
proceeding, though in a Case never so clear and plain, must have due forms
and times observed according to the rules of Law, and for that time in this
case is exceeding precious, and that it is not possible for the new intended
Company, to go on with that confidence and encouragement, that in so great a
business were fit, as long as the Charter of the Merchant-Aduenturers is put
in ure, and practice:

Therefore to remove and discharge all discouragements and impediments: We do
by these presents prohibit, forbid, constitute and ordeine, That from
henceforth the Charter of the said Merchant adventurers, and all powers,
Lycences, authorities, privileges, forms of government contained in the
same, or otherwise all vsages, holding of Courts, meetings, assemblies, and all
other proceedings, by color or virtue thereof, together with all the
dependances, be not from henceforth put in any manner of practice or
execution, either in the parts beyond the Seas, or here within Our Kingdom.
And to that end, We do not only notify and publish this Our Royal
prohibition and ordinance, as well to all Forreiners, as to all Our loving
Subjects, to whom it may appertain: But do furthermore straightly and expressly
charge and command, as well the Governor, Deputy, or Deputies, and Assistants
of the said Company of the Merchant Adventurers, as the whole body of them,
and also every of them in particular, and all their Factors, Servants and
Ministers, as well beyond the Seas, as on this side, within Our Kingdom and
Dominions; That from this time forwards, they do in no wise presume, directly
or indirectly, to do, perform, or execute any Trade, Traffic, or
Marchandizing, into, or from any the Countries, or places where the said
Merchant Adventurers, are, or have been privileged, or any point or thing
whatsoever, by virtue or color of their said Charter, or by virtue of any
former treaty or treaties, betwixt any Our noble Progenitors, or Predecessors,
and any Prince or Potentate, City or politic Government, or former vsages,
upon pain of Our High indignation, imprisonment, and other punishment, which
by Our Laws or Prerogative Royal, may be inflicted upon them: Letting them
know, that We shall proceed against every such offender, as a contemner of Our
Royal Commandment, and a disturber of so excellent a work, wherein We have
so far declared Our selves for the Universal Weal, and comfort of Our
people.

Provided nevertheless, that where Our Treasurer of England has directed his
Letters to the Officers of Our Custom House, and Ports, giving liberty of
importation, only until the last of this present Month of December: That
these presents shall not any way countermaund the said limitation of time so
prefixed, and no longer: But that the said Merchant-Aduenturers, may during
that time importe accordingly; any thing before in these presents, to the
contrary notwithstanding.

Given at Our Court at Newmarket the second day of December, in the twelfth
year of Our Reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the eight
and fourtieth.
God save the King.

Majesty. ANNO DOM. 1614.
