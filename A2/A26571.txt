A STRANGE PROPHECY PRESENTED To the Kings most Excellent Majesty, BY A
Woman-Quaker (all in white) called Ahivah. WITH Her Petition and Proposals for
the Saints Liberties, TO Our Gracious Lord and Sovereign King CHARLES; AND A
Declaration of the Quakers, touching His Royal Majesty's Reign within these His
Realms and Dominions.

London, Printed for Aaron Banaster, 1660.

The Quakers Message and Propositions, to Our Gracious Lord and Sovereign King
CHARLES; Presented on Tuesday last, etc.
ON the 8th of this instant, came a person to White Hall arrayed in white
garments, desiring to speak with his Majesty, for that she had a Work of great
importance to communicate: Upon which, his Majesty having notice thereof, she
had admittance to his Royal Presence; where she delivered this following Paper
to his Sacred Majesty.

KING,
I Was your Messenger impostened in Gods will concerning your return to this
place so soon again: I was laid harbourless that same year that I saw the
Vision of your return to England again, I do defire some liberty for my own
practice of my own Household Ordinances, as I was chosen Messenger of your
return again, and saw it Justice that you should have this Land again, so you
do not oppress the weak Spirit of Gods Majesty in his Saints, but let them have
recourse in whatsoever fashion God shall be pleased to raise himself in his
Ministers; So I my self shall stand a mother in Gods house in these cases: I
shall also entreat some liberty concerning my labor on your Sabbath. I do
utterly defy all Jewish Forms of Religion, or keeping any one day above
another; for in so doing you keep out the profession of Christ's natures
practice: May not such be left damned Souls, as the Jewish People was? which
was always requiring a Savior, and yet at last themselves left Vagabonds for
want of the true Spirit to serve them with Wisdom, and the supply of Gods will
in his Christ which God had sent to be their Teacher and Savior, both in his
Son and Apostles: So you will be left in the same fashion, as your standing
is now in these Nations, being divided in service, and all confusion, which
will breed Us a speedy destruction, except you will adhere to let the Saints
make themselves a body in Christ's fashion; and you your self must stand
Protector of these occasions: So your Country will be blessed with this
presence, more then any parts of the Dominions of the World besides you: So the
Saints will have their Prerogatives, and your Souls will have salvation by
their presence, and your blessings will abound more then other Nations, as you
shall consent to these Propositions: So I rest, Christ's Minister in this
present hour,

AMEN.

I shall also entreat, that whenever God shall be pleased to manifest any of
his fore-speaking words, and they be brought forth to cry it in the open
street, or any place of City or Country, that you will grant some protection
by Constables, or some other means, that they be not abused in such conditions,
as I my self have been; as being cast into Bedlam, for a mad-body, for
prophesying the return of your Majesty some years since to your Native
Kingdom. And if my Father, God Almighty, had not made a way in my self to get
me out of their hands I had bin destroyed for a mad body: For these conditions
of God's action are strange to your worlds understanding, in the time of God's
action in Us. So I rest,

Your Minister, if you please to accept of my Office in Christ's Name, AHIVAH.


A Petitioner for the Saints Liberties.

The Quakers Declaration t^uching his Majesty's coming into power again etc.
GReat is the hand of the Lord, (O King) in thy coming so far into Power again;
and consider the cause of it (in the fear of the Lord) and thou will find, that
it is, because they unto whom God gave such power over thee, were not faithful
unto God, but grieved the Spirit of the Lord with their hypocrisy from day to
day, talking for Liberty, but behold they brought forth oppression, and so
became worser then those that went before them, who did not profess so much for
liberty in their words, but performed better things in their actions. Therefore
let no man deceive thee, by persuading thee that these things are thus brought
to pass, because the Kingdom was thy own proper right, and because it was
withheld from thee contrary to all right, or, because those called Royalists
are much more righteous than those, who are now fallen under thee; For I
plainly declare unto thee, that this Kingdom, and all the Kingdoms of the
Earth, are properly the Lords, and that he may, and does give them unto
whomsoever he pleases; and whenever he pleases, he may take them away
again, and give them unto others. As to thy Government, I do declare in the
truth and presence of the Lord, many thousands being of the same mind with me
that it is not for the name, that may be put upon a Government, that we either
stand for or against; but it is a righteous Government (according to the higher
power, which is according to that of God in every man's conscience) which we
stand for, and earnestly desire after, both in things appertaining to God and
Man; And we, for our selves desire no greater liberty; either in things
religious, or in things civil betwixt man and man, than we desire all others
might enjoy; and if such a Government as this be set up, we shall willingly
submit unto Righteousness from the Supreme Governor, as our duty; and yield
all due lawful obedience unto him and his Commands, by laboring in the power
of the Lord, to bring down and to keep under the evil lust in people, which is
the cause of all Wars and Rebellions, and transgression: And as much as in us
lies, we shall endeavor to live peaceably with all men, and persuade others
unto the same; and so, by a godly conversation, we shall be patterns unto
others, and this will be an adorning of good Government and good Governors,
and a help unto them, and this we resolve in the strength of the Lord to do.

FINIS.
