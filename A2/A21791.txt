royal blazon or coat of arms
By the Queen.
FOrasmuch as upon the lamentable complaint made unto the Queens most
excellent Majesty, by sundry her loving subjects the Clothiers of diverse
parts of the Realm, and of a multitude of other people mayntayned in their
handlabours by them, it appears that partly through the great death of
Sheep, which of late years has happened in sundry parts of this Realm,
and partly through the greedines of sundry evil disposed people, by buying and
selling of wool within the realm, thereby seeking more their unlawful gain,
then the due observing of the laws of the Realm provided in that behalf, or
regarding the penalties incident to the same, and in some part also through the
great abuse of some which have obtained (upon reasonable considerations)
license to bye and sell wool within this Realm, to a certain not
unreasonable quantity, but yet through their insatiable greedines and abuse
thereof, by substituting of a multitude of deputes, who have not only misused
their deputations, by engrossing and buying up of greater quantities of wool,
then was agreeable to her Majesty's good and gracious meaning, at the time of
the granting of the said licenses, and so have passed the bonds of their
licenses by buying yearly greater quantity of wool, then they ought to do, so
that upon these great abuses the honest Clothiers can buy little or none, but
such as is very course, or else at such excessive prices, as they cannot make
their principal thereof again: whereby her Majesty understands that without
carnest reformation of the said great abuses of buying and selling of wool
within the Realm, and also some restraint of the said licenses for some
reasonable time, there shall follow great want to the Clothiers to continue
their trade, for mayntenance as well of themselves, as of great multitude of
poor people living only under them to the decay of diverse good Towns which
are chiefly maintained by the Clothiers. Therefore by the advice of her
Counsel, her Majesty straightly charge and commands, that from and after
the publication of this present Proclamation, no person (other then such as by
the Laws of this Realm or otherwise are specially appointed, and permitted to
buy wool to be transported over the Seas shall hereafter use any such trade of
buying and selling of wool, neither yet any person by color of any license
shall directly or indirectly do the same, until her Majesty shall upon
further consideration notify her pleasure to the contrary as touching buying
and selling of wool within this Realm, by force of any lience upon pain of
her Majesty's displeasure and imprisonment during her pleasure. And for the
better execution hereof, her Highness by ye advise aforesaid, straightly
charge and commands all and singular Justices of peace, Majors, Sherifes
and Baylifes, not only to see this proclamation truly executed, but also it
any person be justly accused before him or them, for contemning or breaking
this Proclamation, or any part thereof, they shall commit such person to ward,
there to remain without bail or mainprise, till her Majesty's pleasure be
further known.

Given at her Majesty's Palace of Westminster, the xxx. day of April, in the
one and twentieth year of her Hignes most prosperous Reign.
Imprinted in London at Bacon house by Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty.
