A Proclamation for His Majesty's better Service, either at Sea, or Land.
WHereas of late diverse persons fit for employment in Our Service, either by
Sea or Land, have withdrawn themselves from the same, to the discouragement of
others who are forward therein, and to the great prejudice of those public
acts for which they were designed, and to the dishonor of this Nation, (in
former ages both honorable and glorious;) For the preventing therefore of so
great inconvenience, or the due punishment of the offenders, if it cannot
otherwise be prevented, We do hereby straightly charge and command, that no
Seaman, or other fit for such employment, either by Sea or land, do at any
time hereafter, purposely, or willingly withdraw, or absent himself at such
times, when We have or shall have occasion to impressed men for any services of
that nature, upon pain of Our heavy displeasure, and of such severe
punishment, as by Law can or may be inflicted upon them, and if any person
shall hereafter be imprested for Our Service, and having received Pressed money,
shall afterward run away, or withdraw himself from the same, We hereby
publish and declare, that such offenders shall hereafter expect the severity of
the Law (which is the pains of death) to be inflicted upon them for the same.
And to the end that such as are or shall be imprested for Our Service, and in
Our Pay, may be assured of all just and honorable usage and entertainment, and
that none be unduly enticed out of Our Service (which is for the public
service and defense of the whole Kingdom) by any others for prinate Voyages,
or other employments, We do further straightly charge and command, that no
Captain, Master of a Ship, or other person whatsoever, do at any time
hereafter presume to receive into Pay or Service, any man formerly imprested
into Our Service, and that no Captain, Master of Ships, or other Officer
whatsoever, do hereafter keep back, or withhold pay, or other allowance,
which shall be due to any man being in Our Service, and under Our pay, upon
pain of Our high displeasure, and of the most severe punishment, which by Law,
or in Justice, can any ways be inflicted upon such as shall dare to do
contrary to this our Royal commandment. And We do further straightly charge and
command, upon pain of Our high displeasure that all Majors, Sheriffs,
Justices of Peace, Constables, Headboroughs, and all other Our officers and
ministers, do from time to time use all diligence to apprehend all such
Mariners, Seamen, Soldiers, and others, now, or at any time hereafter, being
in our pay, or imprested for Our Service, which shall leave Our service, or
wander from the places where they are or shall be appointed to serve or abide,
without special license in that behalf given, by such as have, or shall have
authority and power to grant such Licenses, and them and every of them so being
apprehended to send or bring back to the Fleet or Army, or place of
Rendeuous, where such persons ought to have been abiding, or otherwise to
commit them to the Common Jail of the County where they shall be taken, or
nearest unto which they shall then be, to the end that every such offender may
be proceeded against, according to the law, for such their offenses and
misdemeanors.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, the seventeenth day of June, in the fourth
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by BONHAM NORTON and JOHN BILL, Printers to the Kings most
Excellent MAJESTY. M.DC.XXVIII.
