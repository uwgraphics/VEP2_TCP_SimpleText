A Proclamation against unjust pretenses for coloring of French goods, taken
by way of Reprize.
WHereas We have been enforced, for diverse weighty and important reasons, to
take the Ships and goods of the French King and his Subjects, either by Our
own Ships, or by the Ships of Our Subjects, authorized by Letters of Marque;
and whereas We have given authority to diverse persons of quality, by
commission under the Seal of Our Court of Admiralty, to make sale of the goods
and Merchandises, which have been, or shall be so taken to our use, for Our
best profit, wherein notwithstanding, Our purpose is, and We have so expressed
and declared Our meaning to be, that all just proceedings shall be held, that
under color of the goods of the French King, or his Subjects, the Goods,
Merchandises, or Ships of Our own Subjects, or of any of Our Friends or Allies,
should not be sold or disposed of, or if they be Bona peritura, either in
their nature, or values, and so are fittest to be presently put to sale, yet
the proceed thereof shall be justly accounted for, and restored to the true
owners thereof, when their Rights shall appear upon due examination in Our
Court of Admiraltie; Forasmuch as it falls out very often, that sometimes Our
own Subjects, and sometimes strangers, are contented for the hope of gain, or
for other sinister respects, to make pretenses and claims to those Goods, or
part thereof, to the great wrong of Us and Our Subjects, who have taken and
brought in the same, and to the defrauding and deluding of Justice; We, by the
advice of Our Privy Counsel, have thought fit to give a general admonition
and warning, to all persons of what degree or quality soever, whom it may
concern, that they, nor any of them, do from henceforth dare adventure to
raise, or to maintain, or defend such unjust claims or pretenses hereafter:
And therefore We do hereby publish and declare Our Royal pleasure to be,
and do hereby will and command, that no person whatsoever presume hereafter to
offend herein.

And We do hereby further publish and declare Our will and Command to be, that
if any of Our own Subjects, or any other, being, or residing within any of Our
own Dominions shall hereafter offend in any point, against the true intention
of this our Proclamation, every such offender shall incur Our heavy
indignation, and that Our Attorney general now, and for the time being, shall
proceed against them in Our high Court of Star Chamber, as persons offending
against public Justice, and contemners of this Our Proclamation and Royal
pleasure; and if any attestations shall be brought from any State, City,
Town, or Person in foreign parts, to color any such Goods unduly, and the
same shall in due course of Justice be discovered and proved, We are resolved
so far to undervalue the reputation of that State, City, Town, and Person,
that neither We Our selves, nor Our Courts of Justice, shall at any time after
give any credit to the testimony or attestation of those, who have once
endeavored in that manner to defraud or abuse Us or Our people.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, the five and twentieth day of June, in the
third year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.

Excellent Majesty. MDC.XXVII.
