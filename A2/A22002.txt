By the King.
FOrasmuch as it has pleased GOD of his exceeding goodness, to stay his heavy
hand wherewith the last year he punished our City of LONDON by the infection
of the Plague, We have just cause given us both to be thankful to his
Divine Majesty for his goodness, and to be as provident as a careful Prince
can be, to take away occasion of reviving the same. Wherefore, for that there
is at hand a notable Fair at Bristoll, commonly called S. James Fair,
whereunto there is great resort, especially from our City of LONDON, and the
Sickness reigning now in the said City of Bristoll, and places there-abouts:
We have thought good by open declaration of our pleasure, to admonish and
require all our loving Subjects of our said City of LONDON, to forbear to
resort at this time to the said Fair, upon pain of such punishment, as for a
contempt so much concerning the universal safety of our people of our said
City, they shall be adjudged to deserve, which We shall have so much the more
cause severely to inflict, because our return to our said City of LONDON is
like to be very soon for our abode there, about great and weighty causes,
from which by reviving of the Sickness in that place (which GOD forbid) we
might be put off, to the great hinderance of our affairs.

Given at our Palace of Westminster the eight day of July, in the second year
of our reign of England, France and Jreland, and of Scotland the seven and
thirtieth.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.
