By the King.
JAMES, by the grace of God, king of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,
defender of the Faith, etc.
To al men to whom these Our present Letters shall come, Greeting.
The recitail of the late Queens Letters Patents by her granted to Sir George
Delues and William Fitz-william.
Whereas our late Sister of famous Memory, Elizabeth late Queen of England, by
her Letters Patents, bearing date at Westminster the xiii. day of July, in the
xxxvi. year of her Reign: Reciting thereby, that whereas it had been always
of ancient time, and so from time to time thought and found very profitable for
the common wealth of this Realm, That all manner woollen cloth made within
this same Realm to be sold, should be searched, measured and sealed by the
Alnagers of her Progenitors, and of her Highness being Officers to that purpose,
appointed to the intent, as well that no person should be deceived, by buying
deceitful woollen cloth unduly made, As also that by reason of the true
making of the said woollen Cloth, the making thereof might be continued: And
the people of this Realm thereby the better set on work. Thought fit and
reasonable that a reasonable fee should be paid to the Alnager for his pains.
And that it had likewise been thought and found very reasonable and
necessary, that a reasonable fee should be paid unto the said Alnager, for
his pains in that behalf: And that a Subsidy should be paid for the said
Clothes, unto her said Progenitors, and her Highness. And to that end, that
diverse Acts of Parliaments and Ordinances, had been made in the time of her
Progenitors, and were then in force. And that for as much as then of late
years, diverse sorts of woollen Clothes, and other commodities commonly called
double, middle and single Bays, Rash, or Stammell of Florence sort, Serge of
Frence sort, Says of Flaunders sort, Narrow worsteeds, Grograynes, Mockadoes
of every sorts, Plumets, Freezadoes, Carrel, Fustian of Naples, Blankets,
called Spannish Rugges, Knithose of worsted yarne, and of all sorts of new
Draperies, and other new Stuffes, and commodities, then made of wool only, or
most part of wool, had been chiefly devised, and made within her Realm of
England by Strangers, and Aliens borne, that resorted into this Realm. That
all new sorts of Draperies by Statutes ought to be searched, weighed and sealed
and charged with a Subsidy in such sort as other woollen clothes.
And that then of later time, the making was used in diverse places within this
Realm, as well by the said strangers, as by her Subjects, which new sorts of
Draperies, and woollen commoditities with all other like that should be
thereafter invented, or devised to be made wholly, or most part of wool within
this Realm, ought by the Statutes, Laws and Ordinances of this Realm, and by
the true meaning and equity of the same, to be searched and measured or
weighed, and sealed, and to be charged with a Subsidy, to be paid to her
Majesty, her heirs and successors in such sort, as other woollen clothes
before that time sold or made within this Realm of England: had been and
ought to be. And that no Officer or Officers were especially appointed, either
to the searching, measuring, weighing and sealing of the said new Draperies, or
to the collection of the said Subsidy, until that then of late years. her
trusty servants, Sir George Delues, Knight, and William Fitz william, two
other Majesty's Gentlemen Pentioners, had been thereunto appointed, by her
several Leases, which then were expired and determined: By reason whereof, not
only the said newly devised Clothes, and woollen commodities had wanted, and
might again want the due allowance that ought to have been, and was by the
sealing thereof, to the danger of the buyers of the same. But also that her
said late Majesty had likewise wanted and might again want the Subsidy of the
same to her great loss. Her Majesty's pleasure that all the new sorts of
Draperies and Clothes should at all times be surueyed, measured, weighed,
tried and sealed, etc.
Wherefore minding and intending redress and remedy to be had in that
behalf, her Majesty then thought good, and her will and pleasure had been
signified by her former Letters Patents, and then was that all the said new
sorts of Draperies, and Clothes above particularly specified and expressed,
and every of them made, and to be made, within this her Realm of England, and
all other sorts of woollen Clothes, new Draperies, made and to be made within
this said Realm, of wool, or the most part of wool, which in the time of her
Reign, or late before had not been vsusually made within this said Realm of
England, or for the which the said Alnagers had not commonly used before that
time, to make any search, measure, weighing, marking or sealing, or to take the
said Subsidy, should at all times from thencefoorth be surueyed, measured,
weighed, tried and sealed by such person and persons, as by the Lord Treasurer
of England for the time being, should be from time to time appointed. That the
subsidy should be levied and paid for the same from thencefoorth.
And that the said Subsidy should be levied and paid for the same, from
thencefoorth. And that for as much, as her said trusty servants Sir George
Delues, and William Fitz-william, and either of them Alnager and Alnagers of
the said new Draperies, and Collectors of the said Subsidy of the same, for
and during the space of xxi. years, to commence and begin at the Feast of
the Nativity of S. John Baptist then last past before the date of the same
Letters Patents by themselves their Deputies and Assigns. The Queens Majesty's
authority to her Alnagers to weigh, measure, try, search and seal or mark
all the new sorts of draperies.
And her said Majesty did thereby, for her, her heirs, and Successors, give
and grant unto the said Sir George Delues and William Fitz-william, their
Executors, Administrators, and Assigns, and every of them, full power and
authority to weigh, measure, try, search and seal, or mark, all and
singular the said double, middle, and single Bays, Rash, or Stammell of
Florence sort, Serge of the French sort Says of the Flanders sort, Narrow
Worsteeds, Grograynes, Mockadoes of every sort, Plummets, Freezadoes, Carrell,
Fustians, called Fustians of Naples, Blankets, called Spanish Rugges,
Knit-hose, and all and every other new sorts of Draperies or Clothes, and other
Stuffes made or to be made only, or most part of wool within this Realm of
England, which in the time of her Reign or late before, had not been usually
made within this said Realm of England, or for, or of the which the said
Alnagers for the time being, had not commonly before that time used, to make
any search, measure, weighing, marking, or sealing, or to take the said
Subsidies. To have and to hold during the space of 21. years.
To have and to hold to them the same from the feast of the Nativity of Saint
John Baptist then last past, for and during the space of one and twenty years,
from thence next ensuing, with authority and full power to seal and mark
such of the said Draperies and stuffes as were and should be lawfully and
truly made, And with such seal and seals or other mark, as by her High
Treasurer of England for the time being, should be delivered and appointed to
them for the purpose.

Her Majesty willed they should be reputed, taken and called Alnagers of the new
draperies, etc.
And whereas also, her said Majesty, by her said Letters Patents, did for her,
her Heirs and Successors, will and grant that during the said Term of one
and twenty years, they should be reputed, taken and called Alnagers,
Sealers, Searchers and Viewers of the new Draperies, and woollen commodities
made, and to be made within this said realm, and the Collectors of the
Subsidies and duties thereof. Her Majesty's command that at the new draperies
which were put to sale, should be measured, tried, searched and weighed, and
such as were found good and marchantable should be sealed
And whereas also her Highness did further of her certain knowledge and mere
motion grant will and command, That every of the said Frezadoes, double,
middle, and single Baies, Rash, or Stamel of Florence sort, Serdge of the
French sort, Worsteds, Grograines, Mockadoes, of every sort, Plumet, Carrels,
Fustians, called Fustian of Naples, Buffins, Blankets called Spanish Rugges,
knit hose of Worsted yarne, Iarsey yarne or other woollen, made and to be
made, within this said Realm to be put to sale, and all other of the said
Draperies, and stuffes, made and to be made within the same Realm of England,
being all, or the most part of Wool as aforesaid, to be put to sale, should be
measured, searched, weighed, and tried, by the said Sir George Delues, and
William Fitz william and their Executors Deputies and Assigns, or by some or
one of them, (during the said space of twenty and one years,) before the same
should be put to sale, And that all such of the same as should be found to be
good Lawful and Marchantable ware should be sealed or marked by them their
Deputies, Factors or Assigns, by a Seal or mark to them to be appointed by
the said high Treasurer of England as aforesaid. All such draperies and stuffes
being found to be defective or deceiptfully made or wrought, should be cut and
lagged to the intent no persons should be deceived thereby.
And that such of the same Draperies and stuffes, as should be found by them
their Deputies and Ministers, Factors or Assigns or any of them, to be
defective or deceitfully made or brought should be cut and Iagged at both the
ends, thereby to note the same defect and default without any seal, or other
mark to be put to the same, to the intent that no person or persons should be
deceived thereby. And whereas also her Majesty, by her said Letters Patents,
Recyting further that forasmuch as no certain rate or sum of money was
before the said grant then tofore made to the said Sir George Delues and
William Fitz-william as aforesaid taken, or paid to her said Majesty, or
certainly set down for the measuring, searching, trying and Subsidies of the
said Draperies and other stuffes as aforesaid: the Contents whereof were
diverse, did signify her will and pleasure, to be as by her said former
graunts her said Majesty had before signified, viz. That where, by her laws
and Statutes there had been and then was allowed due and paid for the said
Subsidy to her said Majesty for every broad Clothe, which by the Statute of
this Realm ought to weigh threescore and four pounds, the sum of 4 d. in
money for every broad cloth which by Statute ought to weigh 64 pound weight,
and 2. d. for every half cloth.
four pence in money, for every half of such Cloth two pence in money which
amounts to one farthing for every four pound weight of the same Cloth. For
measuring, searching, and sealing of every whole cloth, ob and for every half
cloth a farthing.
And for the measuring, searching and sealing of every whole Cloth, one half
penny to the Alnager for his fee, and for every half Cloth one farthing. That
therefore the Rates and sums of money as well for the Subsidy, as for the
Alnage of the said new Draperies, and other new woollen commodities particularly
and otherwise specified, or contained in a Schedule unto the said Letters
Patents annexed, should be paid allowed and levied from thencefoorth, of and
for every of the said new Draperies which was found to agree or not much to
differ in proportion, from the Rates and Duties, set paid and allowed
then-tofore for broad woollen Clothes. And that if any person or persons of
what estate or degree soever he or they should be, did sell or put to sale, or
cause to be sold or put to sale, or should fraught or imbarque or cause to be
shipped, fraughted, or imbarqued any of the new said Draperies, or woollen
Commodities, or such stuffes as is aforesaid in the said Letters Patents
authorized to be searched, to the intent to Transport the same to be put to
sale before the same should be searched, measured, weighed, and sealed by her
Majesty's said Officers, or their Assigns as aforesaid, And the fees and
Subsidies aforesaid therefore paid or agreed for, That then and so often, as
he, she, or they so putting to sale, shipping, lading, fraughting or
imbarquing the same should To forfeyt xx.s. for uttering or putting to sale,
shipping, lading, or fraughting every piece before it were first searched,
measured and sealed.
forfeit and pay for every piece thereof so put to sale or offered to be put
to sale, shipped, fraughted or imbarqued, twenty shillings of lawful money of
England. And where also her said late Majesty by her said Letters Patents of
her further especial grace, mere motion and certain knowledge did demise and
grant to farm, to the said Sir George Delues, and William Fitz-william their
Executors and Assigns, the Subsidies, sums and duties limited by the said
Letters Pattents to be paid of or for all and every the said new Draperies and
other woollen Commodities aforesaid, And all and every the forfeytures before
said, as to her Majesty, her Heirs and Successors, should grow answerable or
due: To have and to hold the said Subsidy, sums, duties and forfeytures to
the said Sir George Delues, and William Fitz-william their Executors,
Administrators and Assigns, from the feast of the Nativity of Saint John
Baptist, then last past before the date of the said Letters Patents unto the
end and term of one and twenty years, from thence, next ensuing, and fully to
be Complete and ended, etc.

The woolles of the Realm from time to time converted not only into stuffes,
draperies and commodities: but also into diverse other new sorts of stuffes, not
made within this Realm at the time of her Majesty's grant to Sir George
Delues, and William Fitz-william, to the great loss of his Majesty's Customs
and Subsidies in former times paid for the woolles of this Land transported,
etc.
And whereas we perceiving the Woolles of this Realm to be from time to time
converted not only into the Stuffes, Draperies, and Commodities above
mentioned, but also into diverse other new sorts of Stuffes, Draperies and
Commodities not made within this Realm, at the time of the making of the said
several Leases or grants to the said Sir George Delues, and William
Fitz-william, to Our great loss in the Customs and Subsidies, in former times
paid to diverse of Our Progenitors, for the Woolles of this Land transported
into the parts beyond the Seas, and that the same new inventions are likely
more and more to increase: And perceiving also that diverse Clothiers heretofore
using to make broad Clothes, have changed their Loomes, and spinnings to the
making of the same new inventions, And that it is to be presumed that others
will do the like: The game and return of such new Draperies and late invented
stuffes, and Commodities, made of Wool, or part of Wool comparing weight to
weight being far greater and quicker, and the trade thereof exercised with
less stock and charge then is requisite to the making of broad Clothes, which
would turn greatly to Our loss, if as well a Subsidy should not be paid and
answered unto Us for the said new Inventions as for broad Clothes. We well
approving our said Sisters care and provision that proportionable sums should
be paid for the Subsidy and Alnage of the said new and later Inventions,
according to the rate of the Subsidy and Alnage paid for broad Cloth: are
fully minded and purposed, And do by these presents appoint, That as by the
Laws and Statutes of this Realm, there has been and now is allowed due and
paid to Us for the Subsidy of every broad Cloth made to be sold, which by the
Statutes of this Realm ought to weigh threescore and four pounds, The sum
of four pence in money, And for every half of such Cloth two pence in money
which amounts to one farthing for every four pound weight of the same
Clothe. And for the measuring, searching, and sealing of every whole broad
Clothe made to be sold which by the Statutes of this Realm ought to contain
in length four and twenty yards, one half penny to the Alnager for his Fee,
and for every half of such Cloth one farthing, so from henceforth for every
threescore and four pound weight of the said 4. d. for every 64. pound weight
