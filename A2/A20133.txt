Cant. 1.
To the tune of Flying Fame.
WHen as King Henry ruled this land,
the second of that name,
(Besides the Queen) he dearly loved
a fair and princely Dame:
Most pearelesse was her beauty found,
Her favor and her face:
A sweeter creature in this world,
did never Prince embrace.
Her crisped Locks, like threedes of Gold,
appeared to each man's sight:
Her comely Eyes like orient Pearls,
did cast a heavenly light:
The Blood within her crystal Cheeks,
did such a color drive,
As though the Lilly and the Rose,
for maistership did strive.
Yea Rosamond, fair Rosamond,
her name was called so.
To whom Dame Elinor our Queen,
was known a cruel foe:
The King therefore for her defense,
against the furious Queen,
At Woodstocke builded such a Bower,
the like was never seen.
Most curiously that Bower was buylt,
of Stone and Timber strong:
A hundred and fifty Doors,
did to that Bower belong:
And they so cunningly contrived
with turnning round about,
That none but with a Clew of Thread,
could enter in or out.
And for his Love and Ladies sake
that was so fair and Bright,
The keeping of this Bower he gave
unto a valiant Knight.
But fortune that does often frown,
where she before did smile,
The Kings delight, the Ladies joy.
full soon she did beguile.
For why, the Kings ungracious son,
whom he did high advance,
Against his Father raised wars,
within the Realm of France:
But yet before our comely King
the English land forsook,
Of Rosamond his Lady fair,
his fare well thus he took.
My Rosamond, my only Rose,
that pleases best mine eye:
The fairest Rose in all the world,
to feed my fantacie:
The Flower of my affected heart,
whose sweetness does excel
My royal Rose a hundred times,
I bid thee now farewell.
For I must leave my fairest Flower,
my sweetest Rose a space,
And cross the Seas to famous France,
proud Rebels to abase:
But yet my Rose be sure thou shall
my coming shortly see.
And in my heart while hence I am,
I Will bear my Rose with me.
When Rosamond, that Lady bright,
did hear the King say so,
The sorrow of her grieved heart,
her outward looks did show
And from her clear and crystal eyes,
the tears gusht out apace,
Which like the silver pearled dew,
ran down her comely face.
Her lips like to a Corrall red,
did wax both wan and pale,
And for the sorrow she conceived
her vital spirits did fail,
And falling down all in a sound,
before King Henry's face,
Full often between his princely arms,
her corpse he did embrace.
And twenty times with waterie eyes,
he kissed her tender cheek,
Until she had received again
her senses mild and meek.
Why grieves my Rose my sweetest Rose?
(the King did ever say)
Because (quoth she) to bloody wars
my Lord must part away.
But since your Grace in foreign coasts,
among your foes unkind,
Must go to hazard life and limme,
why should I stay behind?
Nay rather let me like a Page
your Shield and Target bear,
That on my breast that blow may light,
which should annoy you there.
O let me in your royal Tent,
prepare your Bed at night,
And with sweet Bathes refresh your Grace,
at your return from fight,
So I your presence may enjoy,
no toil I must refuse:
But wanting you my life is death,
which does true love abuse.
Content thy self, my dearest friend,
thy rest at home shall be:
In Englands sweet and pleasant soil,
for travail fits not thee.
Fair Ladies brook not bloody Wars,
sweet Peace their pleasures breed,
The nourisher of hearts content,
which Fancy first does feed.
My Rose shall rest in Woodstocke Bower,
with Musickes sweet delight,
While I among the piercing Pikes,
against my foes do fight,
My Rose in Robes and Pearl of Gold,
with Diamonds richly dight,
Shall dance the Galiards of my love,
while I my foes do smite.
And you sir Thomas whom I trust,
to bear my Loves defense,
Be careful of my gallant Rose,
when I am parted hence:
The Flowers of my affected heart,
whose sweetness does excel,
My royal Rose a hundred times,
I bid thee now farewell.
And at their parting well they might,
in heart be grieved sore,
After that day fair Rosamond
the King did see no more:
For when his Grace did pass the seas
and into France was gone,
Queen Elinor with envious heart,
to Woodstocke came anon.
And forth she called this trusty Knight,
which kept the curious Bower,
Who with his Clew of twined Thread,
came from that famous Flower.
And when that they had wounded him,
the Queen his Thread did get,
And went where Lady Rosamond
was like an Angel set.
But when the Queen with steadfast eye,
beheld her heavenly face,
She was amazed in her mind,
at her exceeding grace.
Cast off from thee thy Robes (she said)
that rich and costly be,
And drink thou up this deadly draught
which I have brought for thee,
But presently upon her knees,
sweet Rosamond did fall,
And pardon of the Queen she craved,
for her offenses all.
Take pity on my youthful years,
(fair Rosamond did cry)
And let me not with Poison strong,
enforced be to dye.
I will renounce this sinful life,
And in a Cloister bide:
Or else be banished, if you please,
to range the world so wide,
And for the fault which I have done,
though I was forced thereto:
Preserve my life and punnish me,
as you think good to do.
And with these words her lilly hands,
she wrongful often there:
And down along her lovely cheeks,
proceeded many a tear.
But nothing could this furious Queen,
therewith apeased be.
The cup of deadly Poison filled,
as she sat on her knee.
She gave the comely Dame to drink,
who took it in her hand
And from her bended knee arose,
and on her feet did stand:
And casting up her eyes to heaven,
she did for mercy call,
And drinking up the Poison then,
her life she lost withal.
And when that Death through every lim,
had done his greatest spite.
Her chiefest foes did plain confess,
she was a glorious wight,
Her body then they did intombe,
when life was fled away,
At Godstow, near Oxford town,
as may be seen this day.
FINIS.
The valiant courage and policy of the Kentishmen with long tails, whereby
they kept their ancient Laws and Customs which William the Conqueror sought
to take from them. Cant. 2.
To the tune of Rogero.
WHhen as the Duke of Normandy,
with glistring Spear and Shield,
Had entered into fair England,
and told his foes in field:
On Christmas day, in soleme sort,
then was he crowned here,
By Albert Archbishop of York,
with many a noble Peer,
Which being done he changed quite,
the custom of the land.
And punished such as daily sought,
his Statutes to withstand:
And many Cities he subdude:
fair London with the rest:
And Kent did still withstand his force,
which did his Laws detest.
To Dover then he took his way,
the Castle down to fling,
Which Aruiragus builded there,
the noble Britain King:
Which when the brave Archbishop bold,
of Canterbury, knew,
The Abbot of S. Austins eke,
with all their gallant crew.
They set themselves in Armor bright,
these mischiefs to prevent
With all the Yeomen brave and bold,
that were in fruitful Kent.
At Canterbury they did meet,
upon a certain day,
With Sword and Spear, with Bill and Bow
and stopped the Conquerors way.
Let us not live like Bond men poor,
to Frenchmen in their pride:
But keep our ancient liberty,
what chance so ere betide:
And rather die in bloody field,
in manlike courage pressed,
Then to endure the servile yoke,
which we so much detest.
Thus did the Kentish Commons cry,
unto their Leaders still:
And so marched forth in warlike sort,
and stood at Swanscombe hill.
Where in the Woods they hid themselves,
under the shady green:
Thereby to get them vantage good,
of all their foes unseen.
And for the Conquerors coming there,
they privily laid wait
And thereby suddenly appald
his lofty high conceit:
For when they spyed his approach,
in place as they did stand,
Then marched they to hemme him in,
each one a Bough in hand,
So that unto the Conquerours sight,
amazed as he stood.
They seemed to be a walking Grove,
or else a moving Wood.
The shape of men he could not see,
the Boughs did hide them so:
And now his heart with fear did quake,
to see a Forest go.
Before, behind, and on each side,
as he did cast his eye:
He spide these Woods with sober pace,
approach to him full nigh.
But when the Kentishmen had thus
enclosed the Conqueror round,
Most suddenly they drew their swords,
and threw their Boughs to grownd.
Their Banners they displaide in spite,
their Trumpets sound a charge:
Their rattling Drums strike up Alarume,
their troops stretch out at large
The Conqueror with all his train,
were hereat sore a gast:
And most in peril, when he thought
all peril had been past.
Unto the Kentishmen he sent,
the cause to understand.
For what intent, and for what cause,
they took this War in hand?
To whom they made this short reply,
for liberty we fight:
And to enjoy K. Edwards Laws,
the which we hold our right.
Then said the dreadful Conqueror,
you shall have what you will:
Your ancient Customs and your Laws,
so that you will be still:
And each thing else that you will crave,
with reason at my hand:
So you will but acknowledge me,
chief King of fair England.
The Kentishmen agreed hereon,
and laid their Arms aside:
And by this means, King Edwards Laws,
in Kent, does still abide:
And in no place in England else,
those Customs do remain,
Which they by manly policy,
did of Duke William gain.
FINIS.
How King Henry the first, had his Children drowned in the Sea, as they came
out of France. Cant. 3.
To the tune of the Ladies daughter.
AFter our royal King,
had foyld his Foes in France,
And spent the pleasant Spring,
his Honor to advance:
Into fair England he returned,
with fame and victory:
What time the subjects of this Land,
received him joyfully.
But at his home return,
his children left he still
In France, for to soiorne,
to purchase learned skill.
Duke William his brother dear,
Lord Richard was his name,
Which was the Earl of Chester then,
who thirsted after fame.
The Kings fair Daughter eke,
the Lady Mary bright.
With diverse noble Peers:
and many a hardy Knight.
All those were left together there,
in pleasure and delight,
When that our King to England came,
after the bloody fight.
But when fair Flora had,
drawn forth her treasure dry,
That Winter cold and sad,
with hoarie head drew ny:
Those Princes all with one consent,
prepared all things meet,
To pass the seas for fair England,
whose sight to them was sweet.
To England let us hie,
thus every one did say,
For Christmas draws me,
no longer let us stay:
But spend the merry Christmas time,
within our Fathers Court:
Where Lady Pleasure does attend,
with many a Princely sport.
To Sea those Princes went,
fullfilled with mirth and joy:
But this their merriment,
did turn to dear annoy:
The Sailors and the Shipmen all,
through foul excess of Wine,
Were so disguis'de that at the Sea,
they showed themselves like Swine.
The Stern no man could guide,
the Master sleepeng lay:
The Sailors all beside,
went reeling every way:
So that the Ship at random rode,
upon the foaming Flood:
Whereby in peril of their lives,
the Princes always stood.
Which made distilling tears
from their fair eyes to fall:
Their hearts were filled with tears,
no help they had at all:
They wish themselves upon the land
a thousand times, and more:
And at the last they came in sight
of Englands pleasant shore.
Then every one began,
to turn their sighs to smiles:
Their colors pale and wan,
a cheerful look exiles:
The Princly Lords most lovingly,
their Ladies did embrace:
For now in England shall we be,
(quoth they) in little space.
Take comfort now, they said,
behold the Land at last;
Then be no more dismayde,
the worst is gone and past.
But while they did this joyful hope,
with comfort entertain,
The goodly Ship upon a Rock,
on sunder burst in twain.
With that a grievous shreeke
among them there was made,
And every one did seek
on something to be stayde:
But all in vain such help they sought,
the Ship so soon did sink,
That in the Sea they were constrained,
to take their latest drink.
There might you see the Lords,
and Ladies, for to lie,
Amidst the salt Sea foame,
with many a grievous cry:
Still laboring for their lives defense,
with stretched arms abroad
And lifting up their little hands
for help with one accord.
But as good Fortune would,
the svveet young Duke did get.
Into the Cocke-boate then,
where safely he did sit:
But when he heard his Sister cry,
the Kings fair Daughter dear,
He turned his Boat to take her in,
whose death did draw so near,
But while he strove to take,
his sweet young Sister in,
The rest such shift did make,
in sea as they did swim,
That to the Boat a number got,
so many, as at last,
The Boat and all that were therein,
were drowned and ouercast.
Of Lords and Gentlemen,
the Ladies fair offace:
Not one escaped then?
which was a heavy case.
Threescore and ten, were drowned in all
and none escaped death,
But one poor Butcher, which had swome
himself quite out of breath.
This was most heavy news,
unto our comely King;
Who did all Mirth refuse,
this word when they did bring:
For by this means no Child he had,
his Kingdom to succeed*
Whereby his sisters Son was King,
as you shall plainly read.
The Duchess of Suffolkes calamity. Cant. 4.
To the tune of Queen Dido.
WHen God had taken (for our sin)
that prudent Prince King Edward away
Then bloody Bonner did begin
his raging malice to be wray:
All those that did the Gospel profess,
He persecuted more or less.
Thus when the Lord on us did lower,
many in Prison did he throw,
Tormenting them in Lolards Tower,
whereby they might the truth forgo.
Then Granmer, Ridley, and the rest,
Were burnt in fire, that Christ professed.
Smithfield was then with Fagots filled,
and many places more beside.
At Couentrie was Sanders killed,
at Gloucester eke good Hooper did:
And to escape this bloody day,
Beyond-seas many fled away.
Among the rest that sought relief,
and for their Faith in danger stood,
Lady Elizabeth was chief,
King Henry's daughter of Royal blood
Which the Tower prisoner did lie,
Looking each day when she should die.
The Duchess of Suffolk seeing this,
(whose life likewise the Tyrant sought,
Who in the hope of heavenly bliss,
which in Gods word her comfort wrought,
For fear of death, was feign to fly,
And leave her House most secretly.
That for the love of Christ alone,
her Lands and Goods she left behind:
Seeking still for precious Stone,
the Word of truth, so rare to find:
She with her Nurse, her Husband, and Child,
In poor array their sightes beguild.
Thus through London they past along,
each one did pass a several street.
Thus all unknown, escaped wrong,
at Billings gate they all did meet:
Like pleople poor in Grave send Barge,
They simply went with all their charge.
And all along from Grauesend town,
with easy iournies on foot they went,
Unto the Seacoast they came down,
to pass the Seas was their intent:
And God provided so that day,
That they took Ship and sayld away.
And with a prosperous gale of wind,
in Flaunders safe they did ariue:
This was to their great ease of mind,
which from their hearts much woe did drive:
And so (with thanks to God on hie)
They took their way to Germany.
Thus as they traueild thus disguisde,
upon the high way suddenly,
By cruel Thieves they were surprisde,
assaulting their poor company:
And all their Treasure and their store,
They took away, and beat them sore.
The Nursse in midst of their fight,
laid down the child upon the ground,
And ran away out of their sight,
and never after that was found.
Then did the Duchess make great moan
With her good Husband all alone.
The Thieves had there their horses killed,
and all their money quite had took:
The pretty Babie almost spild,
was by their Nurse likewise forsook:
And they far from their friends did stand,
All succourlesse in a strange Land.
The Skies likewise began to schoule,
it hayld and raind in pitteous sort?
The way was long, and wondrous foul
then may I now full well report.
Their grief and sorrow was not small,
When this unhappy chance did fall.
Sometime the Duchess bore the child,
as wet as ever she could be:
And when the Lady kind and mild
was weary, then the Child bore he:
And thus they one another eased,
And with their fortunes were well pleased.
And after many weary steps,
all wet-shod both in dirt and mire,
After much grief, their hearts yet leapes,
for labor does some rest require:
A Town before them they did see.
But lodged therein they could not be.
From house to house they both did go,
seeking where they that night might lie.
But want of Money was their woe,
and still the Babe with cold did cry,
With cap and knee they courtsie make,
But none on them would pity take,
Lo here a Princess of great blood
did pray a Peasant for relief,
With tears bedeawed as she stood,
yet few or none regards her grief
Her speech they could not understand,
But gave her a penny in her hand,
When all in vain the pains was spent,
and that they could not house-rome get,
Into a Church Porch then they went,
to stand out of the rain and wet.
Then said the Duchess to her dear,
Oh that we had some fire here.
Then did her Husband so provide,
that fire and coals he got with speed:
She sat down by the fires side,
to dress her Daughter that had need:
And while she dressed it in her lap,
Her Husband made the Infant Pap.
A non the Sexton thither came,
and finding them there by the fire,
The drunken Knave all void of shame,
to drive them out was his desire:
And spurning forth this noble Dame,
Her Husbands wrath it did inflame.
And all in fury as he stood,
he wrong the Keys out of his hand,
And stroke him so, that all of blood
his head ran down where he did stand:
Therefore the Sexton presently,
For help and aid aloude did cry.
Then came the Officers in haste,
and took the Duchess and her Child,
And with her Husband thus they past,
like Lambs beset with Tigers wild:
And to the Governor were they brought,
who understood them not in ought.
Then Master Bartue brave and bold,
in Latin made a gallant speech,
Which all their misery did unfold,
and their high favor did beseech:
With that a Doctor sitting by,
Did know the Duchess presently.
And thereupon arising straight,
with mind abashed at this sight,
Unto them all that there did weight,
he thus brake forth in words aright
Behold within your sight (quoth he)
A Princess of most high degree.
With that, the Governor and the rest,
were all amazed the same to hear:
And welcomed their new-come Gueste,
with reverence great, and princely cheer:
And afterward conveyed they were
Unto their friend, Prince Cassemeer.
A Son she had in Germany,
Peregrine Bartue called by name:
Surnamed the good Lord Willughbie,
of courage great and worthy fame:
Her Daughter young, which with her went,
Was afterward Countess of Kent.
For when Queen Mary was deceast,
the Duchess home returned again:
Who was of sorrow quite releast
by Queen Elizabeth's happy reign
For whose life and prosperity:
We may praise God continually.
FINIS.
How King Henry the second crowning his Son King of England in his own life
time, and was by him most grievously vexed with wars. Cant 5.
To the tune of Wigmores Galliard.
YOu Parents whose affection fond,
unto your Children does appear:
Mark well the story now in hand,
wherein you shall great matters hear,
And learn by this which shall be told,
to hold your Children still in awe,
Least otherwise they prove too bold,
and set not by your state a straw.
King Henry, second of that name,
for very love that he did bear
Unto his Son, whose courteous fame
did through the Land his credit rear:
Did call the Prince upon a day,
unto the Court in royal sort:
Attyred in most rich array,
and there he made him Princely sport,
And afterward he took in hand,
for fear he should deceived be,
To crown him King of fair England,
while life possessed his Majesty.
What time, the King in humble sort,
like to a subject waighted then
Upon his Son, and by report
swore unto him, his noblemen.
And by this means in England now
two Kings at once together live:
But Lordly rule will not allow
in partnership their days to drive.
The Son therefore ambitiously.
does seek to pull his Father down,
By bloody war and subtlety,
to take from him his Princely Crown.
Since I am King (thus did he say)
why should I not both rule and reign.
My heart disdaines for to obey,
yea all or nothing, will I gain.
Hereon he rayseth Armies great,
and draws a number to his part:
His Fathers force down right to beat,
and with his Spear to pierce his heart
In seven set Battles did he fight
against his loving Father dear:
To overthrow him in despite
to win himself a Kingdom clear:
But naught at all could he prevail,
his Armies always had the worst:
Such grief did then his heart assail,
he thought himself of God accursed.
And therefore falling wondrous sick,
he humbly to his Father sent:
The worm of Conscience did him prick,
and his vile deeds he did lament:
Requiring that his noble Grace,
would now forgive all that was past:
And come to him, in heavy case,
being at point to breath his last:
When this word came unto our King,
the news did make him wondrous woe
And unto him he sent his Ring,
where he in parson would not go.
Commend me to my Son, he said,
so sick in bed as he does lie:
And tell him, I am well appaide,
to hear he does for mercy cry.
The Lord forgive his foul offense,
and I forgive them all, quoth he,
His evil, with good, I Will recompense,
bear him this message now from me
When that the Prince did see the Ring
he kissed it in joyful wise,
And for his faults his hands did wring
while bitter tears gusht from his eyes
And to his Lords that stood him nie,
with feeble voice then did he call,
Desiring them immediately
to strip him from his garments all:
Take off from me these Robes so rich,
and lap me in a cloth of Hair:
Quoth he, my grievous sins are such,
Hell fires flame. I greatly fear.
A Hempton Halter then he took,
about his neck he put the same:
And with a grievous pittious look,
this speech unto them he did frame,
You reverend Bishops more and less,
pray for my Soul to God on hie:
For like a Thief (I do confess)
I have deserved for to die.
And therefore by this Halter here,
I yield my self unto you all:
A wretch unworthy to appear
before my God Celestial:
Wherefore within your Hempton Bed,
all strewn with ashes as it is,
Let me be laid when I am dead,
and draw me there unto by this.
Yea by this Halter strong and tough,
dragge forth my carkas to the same:
Yet is that Couche not bad enough
for my vile body wrapped in shame:
And when you see me lie along,
be powdered in ashes there,
Say there is he that did such wrong
unto his Father every where.
And with that word, he breathed his last
wherefore according to his mind,
They drew him by the neck full fast,
unto the place by him assigned:
And afterward in solemn sort,
at Roan in France buried was he,
Where many Princes did resort,
to his most Royal obsequie.
FINIS.
The imprisonment of Queen Elinor, wife to King Henry the second, by whose
means the King Sons so unnaturally rebelled against their Father, and of her
lamentation, being xvi. years in Prison, whom her Son Richard when he came
to be King, released: and how at her deliverance, she caused many Prisoners to
be set at liberty. Cant. 6.
To the tune of Come live with me, etc.
THrice woe is me unhappy Queen,
thus to offend my princely Lord:
My foul offense to plain is seen,
and of good People most abhord:
I do confess my fault it was,
These bloody Wars came thus to pass.
My jealous mind has wrought my woe,
let all good Ladies shun mistrust:
My envy wrought my overthrow,
and by my malice most unjust,
My Sons did seek their Fathers life,
By bloody Wars and cruel strife.
What more unkindness could be shown,
to any Prince of high renown,
Then by his Queen and love alone,
to stand in danger of his Crown:
For this offense most worthily,
In doleful Prison do I lie.
But that which most torments my mind,
and makes my grievous heart complain
Is for to think that most unkind,
I brought my self in such disdain,
That now the King cannot abide
I should be lodged by his side.
In doleful Prison I am cast,
debard of Princely company:
The Kings good will quite have I lost,
and purchased naught but imfamie:
And never must I see him more,
Whose absence grieves my heart full sore.
Full fifteen Winters have I been,
imprisoned in the Dungion deep,
Whereby my joys are wasted clean,
where my poor eyes have learned to weep,
And never since I could attain,
His Kingly love to me again.
Too much in deed (I must confess)
I did abuse his royal Grace,
And by my great malitiousnesse,
his wrong I wrought in euey place:
And thus his love I turned to hate,
Which I repent, but all too late.
Sweet Rosamond that was so fair,
out of her curious Bower I brought,
A poisoned Cup I gave her there,
whereby her death was quickly wrought,
The which I did with all despite,
Because she was the Kings delight,
Thus often did the Queen lament
and she in prison long did lie,
Her former deeds she did repent,
with many a watery weeping eye:
But at the last this news was spread,
the King was on a sudden dead.
But when she heard this tydinges told,
most bitterly she mourned then:
Her woeful heart she did unfold,
in sight of many Noble men.
And her son Richard being King,
from doleful Prison did her bring.
Who set her for to rule the Land,
while to Jerusalem he went:
And while she had this charge in hand,
her care was great in government:
And many a Prisoner then in hold,
she set at large from yrons cold.
The lamentable death of king John, how he was poisoned in the Abbey of
Swinested, by a Friar. Cant. 7.
To the tune of Fortune.
A Treacherous deed foorth-with I shall you tell,
Which on King John on a sudden fell:
To Lincolnshire proceeding on his way,
At Swinsted Abbey one whole night he lay.
There did the King appose his welcome good,
But much deceit lies under an Abbots Hood.
There did the King himself in safety think,
But there the King received his latest drink.
Great cheer they made unto his royal Grace,
While he remaind a guest within that place:
But while they smilde and laughed in his sight,
They wrought great treason shadowed with delight
A flat fact Monk comes with a glosing tale,
To give the King a Cup of spiced Ale
A deadlier drought was never offered man:
Yet this false Monk unto the King began.
Which when the King (without mistrust) did see,
He took the Cup of him most courageously:
But while he held the poisoned cupe in hand,
Our Noble King amazed much did stand.
For casting down by chance his Princely eyes,
On precious Jewels which he had full nigh:
He saw the culloure of each Precious stone,
Most strangely turn, and alter one by one.
Their orient brightness, to a pale dead hue,
Were changed quite, the cause no person knew:
And such a sweat did over spread them all,
And stood like dew which on fair flowers fall.
And hereby was their precious natures tried,
For Pretious-stones foul poison cannot bide,
But through our King beheld their color pale,
Mistrusted not the poison in the Ale.
For why, the Monk the taste before him took,
(Nor knew the King how ill he did it brook)
And therefore he a hearty draught did take,
Which of his life a quick dispatch did make.
The Infectious drink fumde up into his head,
And throught the Veins in the heart it spread:
Distempering the pure unspotted brain,
That does in man his memory maintain.
Then felt the King an extreme grief to grow,
Through all his intrails, being infected so:
Whereby he knew through anguish which he felt
The Monk with him most traitorously had dealt.
The groans he gave did make all men to wonder'
He cast as if his heart would burst in sunder:
And still he called, while he thereon did think,
For the false Monk which brought ye deadly drink.
And then his Lords went searching round about.
In every place to find the Traitor out:
At length they found him dead as any stone,
Within a corner lying all alone.
For having tasted of that poisoned Cup,
Whereof our King the residue drunk up:
The envious Monk himself to death did bring,
That he thereby might kill our royal King,
But when the King with (wonder) heard them tell,
The Monks body did with poison swell:
Why then my Lords, full quickly now (quoth he)
A breatlesse King you shall among you see.
Behold he said, My Veins in pieces crack:
A grievous torment feel I in my back:
And by this poison deadly and accursed,
I feel my heart stringes ready for to burst.
With that his eyes did turn within his head:
A pale dead color through his face did spread:
And lying gasping with a cold faint breath,
The royal King was overcome by death.
His mournful Lords which stood about him then,
With all their force and troops of warlike men,
To Worcester the Corpse they did convey:
With drum and trumpet marching all the way.
And in the fair Cathedral Chuch I find,
They buried him according to their mind:
Most pompeously best fitting for a King,
Who were applauded greatly for this thing.
The cruel imprisonment of King Edward the second, at the Castle of Barkeley
the 22. of September. 1327. Cant. 8.
To the tune of, Labandela shot.
WHen Isabell fair Englands Queen
in woeful wars had victorious been:
Our comely King, her husband dear,
subdued by strength as did appear,
By her was sent to prison strong,
for having done his crountry wrong,
In Barkeley Castle cast was he,
denied of Royal dignity:
Where he was kept in woeful wise,
his Queen did him so much despise.
There did he live in woeful state,
such is a Woman's deadly hate;
when fickle fancy follows change,
and lustful thoughts delight to range,
Lord Mortimer was so in mind,
the Kings sweet love was left behind:
And none was known a greater foe,
unto King Edward in his woe,
Then Isabell his crowned Queen,
as by the sequel shall be seen.
While he in Prison poorly lay,
a Parliament was held straight way:
What time his foes apeace did bring
bills of complaint against the King,
So that the Nobles of the Land,
when they the matter throughtly scand,
Pronounced them these speeches plain,
he was unworthy for to reign,
Therefore they made a flat decree
he should forthwith desposed be.
And his Son Edward young of years
was judged by the noble Peers
Most meet to wear the Princely Crown,
his Father being thus pulled down.
Which words when as the Queen did hear,
(dissemblingly, as did appear)
She wept, she waild, and wrong her hands,
before the Lords whereas she stands,
Which when the Prince her Son did see,
he spoke these words most courteously.
My sweet Queen Mother weep not so,
think not your Son will seek your woe:
Though English Lords choose me their King,
my own dear Father yet living:
Think not thereto I will consent,
except my father be content,
And with good will his Crown resign
and grant it freely to be mine:
Wherefore Queen mother think no ill
in me, or them, for their good will.
Then diverse Lords without delay,
went to the King whereas he lay,
Declaring how the matter stood,
and how the Peers did think it good
To choose his Son, their King to be,
if that he would thereto agree:
For to resign the Princely Crown,
and all the title of renown:
If otherwise, they told him plain,
a stranger should the same attain.
This doleful tidinges (most unkind)
did sore afflict King Edward's mind,
But when he savv no remedy,
he did unto their vvilles agree:
And bitterly he did lament,
saying the Lord this Plague has sent,
For his offense and vanity,
which he would suffer patiently:
Beseeching all the Lords, at last.
for to forgive him all was past,
When thus he was deprived quite,
of that which was his lawful right
In Prison was he kept full close,
without all pity or remorce:
And those that showed him favor still,
were taken from him with ill will
Which when the Earl of Kent did hear,
who was in blood to him full near,
He did entreat most earnestly
for his release and liberty.
His words did much the Queen displease,
who said he lived too much at ease,
Unto the Bishop she did go,
of Hereford, his deadly foe,
And cruel Letters made him write
unto his Keepers with despite,
You are to kind to him quoth she.
hence forth more straighter look you be:
And in their wrighting subtly,
they sent them word that he should die.
The Lord Matreuers all dismayed,
unto sir Thomas Gurney said,
The Queen is much displeased quoth he,
for Edwards too much liberty:
And by her Letters does bewray,
that soon hest all be made away.
It Is best (Sir Thomas then replide)
the Queens wish should not be denide:
whereby we shall have her good will,
and keep our selves in credit still.
How the King was poisoned, and yet he escaped: and afterward how when they
saw thereby he was not dispatched of life they locked him in a most noisome
filthy place, that with the stincke thereof he might be choked: and when that
prevailed not, how they thrust a hot burning Spitte into his Fundament till
they had burnt his Bowels within his Body, whereof he dyed. Cant. 9.
To the tune of, How can the Tree.
THe Kings cursed Keepers aiming at reward,
hoping for favor of the furiours Queen,
On wretched Edward had they no regard.
far from their hearts was mercy moved cleene,
Wherefore they mingle Poison with his meat,
which made the man most fearful for to eat.
For by the state he often times suspected,
the venom couched in a dainty dish:
Yet his fair Body was full sore infected,
so ill they spiced both his Flesh and Fish,
But his strong nature all their craft beguiles,
the Poison breaking forth in Blaines and Biles.
An ugly scabbe ore-spreads his lilly skin,
foul Botches break upon his manly face,
Thus sore without, and sorrowful within,
the dispis'd man does live in woeful case,
Like to a Lazer did he then abide,
that shows his sores a long the high ways side.
But when this practice proou'd not to their mind
and that they saw he lived in their despite:
An other damnd, device then did they find,
by stinking savors for to choke him quite:
In an odd corner did they lock him fast,
hard by the which, their Carrion they did cast.
The stinck whereof might be compared wel-nie,
to that foul Lake where cursed Sodom stood,
That poisoned Birds which over it did fly,
even by the savor of that filthy mudde:
Even so the smell of that corrupted Den,
was able for to choke ten thousand men.
But all in vain, it would not do (God wot)
his good complexion still drove out the same:
Like to the boiling of a seething Pot,
that castes the scamme into the fiery flame,
Thus still he lived, and living still they sought,
his death, whose downfall was already wrought.
Lothing his life, at last his Keepers came,
into his Chamber in the dead of night,
And without noise, they entered soon the same,
with weapons drawn, and torches burning bright,
Where the poor prisoner fast a sleep in bed,
lay on his belly, nothing vnder's head.
The which advantage, when the murderers saw,
a heavy Table on him they did throw,
Wherewith awakt his breath he scant could draw
with weight thereof they kept him under so,
And turning up the clothes above his hips,
to hold his legs a couple quickly skips.
Then came the Murderers one a horn had got,
which far into his fundament down he thrust,
An other with a Spit all burning hot,
the same quite through the horn he strongly pusht
Among his intrailes in most cruel wise,
forcing hereby most lamentable cries.
And while within his body they did keep,
the burning spit still rovvling up and down,
Most mournful the murdered man did weep.
whose vvailefull noise vvakt many in the town
Who gessing by his cries, his death drevv near,
took great compassion on the noble peer.
And at which bitter screeke which did make,
they praid to God for to receive his soul:
His ghastly groans inforst their hearts to ache,
yet none durst go cause the Bell to towle.
Ha me poor man, alack, alack he cried,
and long it was before the time he dyed.
Strong was his heart, and long it was God knows,
ere it would stoop unto the stroke of Death:
First was it wounded with a thousand woes,
before he did resign his vital breath:
And being murdered thus as you do hear,
no outward hurt upon him did appear.
This cruel murder being brought to pass
the Lord Matreuers to the court did hie:
To show the Queen her will performed was.
great recompense he thought to get thereby,
But when the Queen the sequel understands,
disembling she weeps and wrings her hands.
Accursed traitor, have thou slain (quoth she)
my noble wedded Lord in such a sort,
Shame and confusion ever light on thee,
oh how I grieve to here this vile report:
Hence cursed catiue from my sight (she said)
that has of mea woeful widow made.
Then all a basht, Matreuers goes his way,
the saddest man that ever life did bear:
And to Sir Thomas Gurney did bewray,
What bitter speech the Queen did give him there
Then did the Queen outlaw them both together,
and banished them fair Englands bounds for ever.
Thus the dissembling Queen did seek to hide,
the heinous act by her own means effected:
The knowledge of the deed she still denide,
that she of murder might not be suspected:
But yet for all the subtilty she wrought.
the truth unto the world was after brought.
FINIS.
The doleful lamentation of the Lord Matreuers, and Sir Thomas Gurney, being
banished the realm. Cant 9.
To the tune of Light of love.
ALas that ever that day we did see,
that false smiling fortune so ficke should be,
Our miseries are many, our woes without end:
to purchase us favor we both did offend:
Our deeds have deserved both sorrow and shame,
but woe worth the persons procured the same,
Alack, and alack, with grief may we cry,
that ever we forced King Edward to dye.
The Bishop of Hereford, ill may he fare,
he wrote us a letter rare
To Kill princely Edward: fear not it is good,
thus much by his letter we then understood,
But cursed be the time that we took it in hand,
to follow such council and wicked command,
Alack and alack, with grief we may cry,
that ever we forced King Edward to dye,
Forgive us sweet Savior tha^ damnable deed,
which causes with sorrow our hearts for to bleed
And take compassion upon our distress,
put far from thy presence our great wickedness
With tears all bedewed for mercy we cry,
and do not the penitent mercy deny.
Alack, and alack, with grief we may say,
that ever we made King Edward away.
For this have we lost our goods and our land,
our Castles and Towers so stately that stand:
Our Ladies and babies are turned out of door,
like comfortless caitiues both naked and poor,
Both friendlesse and fatherless do they complain,
for gone are their comforts that should them maintain
Alack, and alack and alas may we cry,
that ever we forced King Edward to dye.
and while they go wringing their hands up and down:
in seeking for succor from town to town
All wrapped in wretchedness do we remain,
tormented, perplexed in dolor and pain*
Despised, disdained and banished quite,
the coaste of our country so sweet to our sight,
Alack, and alack alas may we cry,
that ever we forced King Edward to die.
the^ farevvell fair England wherein we were borne
our friends and our kindred will hold us in scorn,
Our honors and dignities quite have we lost,
both profit and pleasuere, our fortune has crossed,
Our parkes and our chases our mansions so fair
our Iems and our Ievxels most precious and rare,
Alack, and alack, and alas may we cry,
that ever we forced King Edward to die.
Then farevvell dear Ladies and most loving vviues
might we mend your miseries with loss of our lives
Then our silly children which begs at your hand
in grief and callamities long should not stand:
Nor yet in their Country despised should be,
that lately was honored of every degree,
Alack, and alack, and alas we may cry.
that ever we forced King Edward to die.
In Countries unknown we range too and fro,
cloying men's ears with report of our vvoe*
Our food is vvild berries, green banks are our beds,
the Trees serve for houses to cover our heads,
Brown bread to our taste is dainty and svveete,
our Drink is cold water took up at our feet:
Alack, and alack, and alas we may cry.
that ever we forced King Edward to die.
Thus having long vvandred in hunger and cold,
despising lives safety most desperate and bold:
Sir T. Gurney tovvard England does go,
for love of his Lady distressed with vvoe,
Saying how happy and blessed were I,
to see my sweet Children and wife ere I die:
Alack, and alack and alas we may cry,
that ever we forced King Edward to die.
But three years after his woeful exile,
behold how false fortune his thoughts does beguile
Coming toward England, was took by the way
and least that he should the chief murderers bewray
Commandment was sent by one called Lea.
he should be beheaded forthwith on the Sea,
Alack, and alack, and alas did he cry,
that ever we forced King Edward to die,
Thus was Sir Thomas dispatched of life,
in coming to visit his sorrowful wife:
Who was cut off from his wished desire,
which he in his heart so much did require:
And never his Lady again did he see,
nor his poor children in their misery,
Alack, and alack, and alas did he cry,
that ever we forced King Edward to dye.
The Lord Matreuers (the Story does tell)
in Germany after long time did he dvvell,
In secret manner for fear to be seen,
by any persons that favored the Queen:
And there at last in great misery,
he ended his life most penitently,
Alack, and alack, and alas did he say,
that ever we made King Edward away.

The second part of Strange Histories, or Songs and Sonnets.
A new Song of King Eegar of England, how he was deprived of a Lady which he
Loved by a Knight of his Court. Cant 10.
To be sung in the old ancient sort: or else to the tune of Labandalashot.
WHen as King Edgar did govern this land,
a down, down, down, down down,
And in the strength of his years did stand,
call him a down a.
Much praise was spread of a gallant Dame,
which did through England carry fame,
And she is a Lady of high degree,
the Earl of Deuonshires daughter was she.
The King which lately had buried the Queen,
and that long time had a widdower been,
Hearing the praise of that gallant maid,
upon her beauty his love he laid,
And in his sighs he would often say,
I will go send for that Lady gay,
Yea I will send for that Lady bright,
which is my treasure and hearts delight.
Whose beauty like Phoebus beams
does glister through all christian realms
Then to himself he would reply,
and say how fond a Prince am I,
To cast my love so base and low:
and on a Girl I do not know:
King Edgar will his fancy frame,
to love some princely pearelesse dame.
The Daughter of some royal King.
that may a worthy Dowry bring:
Whose matchless beauty brought in place*
may Estrelds color quite disgrace.
But senseless man what do I mean,
unto a broken Reed to lean,
And what fond fury does me move,
thus to abase my dearest love.
Whose visage graced with heavenly hue,
does Helens honor quite subdue:
The glory of her beauties pride,
sweet Estrelds favor does deride,
Then pardon my unseemly speech,
dear love and Lady I beseech.
And I my thoughts henceforth will frame*
to spread the honor of thy name.
Then unto him he called a Knight,
which was most trusty in his sight:
And unto him thus did he say,
to Earl Orgarus go thy way:
And ask for Estrild comely dame
whose beauty runs so far by fame:
And if thou find her comely grace,
as fame has spread in every place.
Then tell her father she shall be,
my crowned Queen if she agree:
The Knight in message did proceed,
and into Devonshire went with speed,
But when he saw the Lady bright,
he was so ravished at her sight:
That nothing could his passions move,
except he might obtain her love.
And day and night while he there staid,
he courted still that gallant maid,
And in his suite did show his skill,
that at the length won her good will,
Forgetting quite the duty tho,
which he unto the King did owe:
Then coming home unto his grace,
he told him with dissembling face,
That these reporters were too blame,
that so aduanst the maidens name:
For I assure your Grace quoth he,
she is as other women be,
Her beauty of such great report,
no better then the common sort.
And far unmeet in euerything,
to match with such a noble King.
But though her face be nothing fair,
yet since she is her fathers heir,
Perhaps some Lord of high degree,
would very glad her husband be:
And if your Grace would give consent:
I could my self be well content,
The Damsel for my wife to take,
for her great land and livings sake,
The King whom thus he did deceive,
incontinent did give him leave:
For in that point he did not stand,
for why he had no need of land.
Then being glad he went his way,
and wedded straight that Lady gay:
The fairest creature bearing life,
had this same Knight unto his wife.
And by that match of high degree,
an Earl soon after that was he:
Ere they long time had married been:
others that had her beauty seen:
Her praise was spread both far and near
the King thereof again did hear:
Who then in heart did plainly prove,
he was betrayed of his love.
Though therewith he was vexed sore,
yet seemd he not to grieve therefore:
But kept his countenance good and kind,
as though he bare no grudge in mind.
But on a day it came to pass,
when as the King full merry was:
To Ethelwood in sport he said,
I muse what cheer there should be made
If to thy house I should resort
a night or two for Princely sport:
Hereat the Earl showed countenance glad
though in his heart he was full sad,
And said your Grace should welcome be,
if so your grace would honor me.
When as the day appointed was,
before the King did thither pass.
The Earl beforehand did prepare*
the Kings coming to declare:
And with a countenance passing grim,
he called his Lady unto him.
Saying with sad and heavy cheer,
I pray you when the King comes here,
Sweet Lady if you tender me,
let your attire but homely be.
And wash not thou thy Angels face,
but do they beauty quite disgrace,
And to my gesture so apply,
that may seem loathsome in his eye,
For if the King should here behold,
thy glorious beauty so extold:
Then should my life soon shortened be,
for my desert and treachery.
When to thy father first I came,
though I did not declare the same,
Yet was put in trust to bring
thee joyful tidings from the King.
Who for thy glorious beauty seen,
did think of thee to make his Queen,
But when I had thy beauty found,
thy beauty gave me such a wound.
No rest or comfort could I take,
till your sweet love my grief did slake:
And thus though duty charged me,
most faithful to our Lord to be,
Yet love upon the other side,
bad for my self I should provide:
Then to my suit and service shown,
at length I won thee for my own.
And for your love in wedlock spent,
your choice I need no whit repent,
And since my grief I have expressed,
sweet Lady grant me my request:
Good words she gave with smiling cheer,
musing at that, that she did hear:
And casting many things in mind.
great fault therewith she seemed to find.
And in her self she thought it shame,
to make that foul which God did frame:
Most costly robes full rich therefore,
in brauest sort that day she wore.
And did all things that ere she might,
to set her beauty forth to sight
And her best skill in every thing,
she showed to entertain the King.
Whereby the King so snared was,
that reason quite from him did pass:
His heart by her was set on fire,
he had to her a great desire,
And for the looks he gave her then,
for every one she sent him ten.
Whereby the King perceived plain,
his love and looks were not in vain.
Upon a time it chanced so,
the King he would a hunting go,
And into Horse-wood he did ride,
the Earl of Horse-wood by his side.
And there the story tells plain,
that with a shaft the Earl was slain.
And when that he had lost his life.
the King soon after took his wife.
And married her all shame to shun,
by whom he did beget a son:
Thus he which did the King deceive,
did by desert his death receive.
Then to conclude and make an end,
be true and faithful to your friend.
FINIS.
Of Edward the third and the fair Countes of Salisburie, setting forth her
constancy and endless glory. Cant..11
WHen King Edward the third did live,
that valiant King:
David of Scotland to rebel,
did then begin.
The town of Barwicke suddenly
from us he won:
And burnt Newcastle to the ground,
thus strife begun.
To Rookes borrow castle marched he then,
And by the force of warlike men,
besiedged therein a gallant fair Lady,
While that her husband was in France,
His countries honor to advance,
the noble and famous Earl of Salisburie.
Brave Sir William Montague,
rode then in post,
Who declared unto the King,
the Scotchmans host,
Who like a Lion in a rage,
did straight prepare.
For to deliver that fair Lady
from woeful care.
But when the Scotchmen did hear say,
Edward our king was come that day.
they raised their siedge and ran away with speed,
So that when he did thither come,
With warlike trumpets fife and drume,
none but a gallant Lady did him grreete,
Which when he did with greedy eyes,
behold and see:
Her peareles beauty straight inthral'd,
his Majesty.
And ever the longer that he looked.
the more he might,
For in her only beauty was,
his hearts delight,
And humbly then upon her knee,
She thankt his royal Majesty:
that thus had driven danger from the gate,
Lady (quoth he) stand up in peace,
Although my war does now increase,
Lord keep quoth she all hurt from your annoy.
Now is the King full sad in soul,
and wot you why,
All for the love of the fair countess,
of Salisburie.
She little knowing his cause of grief,
does come to see:
Wherefore his highness sat alone,
so heavily.
I have been wronged fair dame quoth he,
Since I came hither unto thee,
now God forbid my Sovereign she said,
If I were worthy for to know,
The cause and ground of this your woe,
it should be helped, if it do lie in me.
Swear to perform thy words to me,
thou Lady gay,
To thee the sorrow of my heart*
I will be wray
I swear by all the Saints in heaven,
I will quoth she:
And let my Lord have no mistrust,
at all in me.
Then take thy self aside he said,
And say thy beauty has betrayed,
and wounded a king with thy bright shining eye,
If thou do then some mercy show,
Thou shall expel a princes woe,
so shall I live or else in sorrow die.
You have your wish my Sovereign Lord,
effectually:
Take all the love that I may give,
your Majesty,
But in thy beauty all my joys,
have their abode:
Take then my beauty from my face,
my gracious Lord.
Did thou not swear to grant unto my will?
All that I may I will fulfill.
then for my love let thy true love be seen
My Lord your speech I might reprove,
You can not give to me your love
for that alone belongs unto your Queen
But I suppose your grace did this,
only to try,
Whether a wanton tale might tempt,
dame Salisbury,
Not from your self therefore my liege,
my steps do stray:
But from your tempting wanton tale,
I go my way.
O turn again thou Lady bright,
Come unto me my hearts delight,
gone is the comfort of my pensive heart,
Here comes the Earl of Warwick he,
The father of this fair Lady,
my mind to him I mean for to impart.
Why is my Lord and sovereign King,
so grieved in mind:
Because that I have lost the thing,
I cannot find:
What thing is that my gracious Lord,
which you have lost?
It is my heart which is near dead,
twixt fire and frost,
Cursed be that frost, and fire too,
Which causes thus your highness woe,
O Warwick thou do wrong me wondrous sore,
It is thy Daughter Noble Earl,
That heavens bright lamp that peereles pearl,
which kills my heart, yet do I her adore.
If that be all my gracious king,
that works your grief,
I will persuade that scornful dame,
to yield relief.
Never shall she my daughter be,
if she refuse,
The love and favor of a King,
may her excuse,
Thus wily Warwick went his way.
And quite contrary he did say,
when as he did the beauteous Countess meet,
Well met daughter dear quoth he:
A message I must do to thee:
our Royal king most kindly does thee greet.
The king will die least thou to him,
do grant thy love.
To love the king my husbands love,
I should remove
It is true chastity to love,
My daughter dear,
But not true love so charitably,
for to appear,
His greatness may bear out the shame,
But his Kingdom cannot buy out the blame,
he craves thy love that may bereave thy life,
It is my duty to urge thee this
But not my honesty to yield I wis,
I mean to die a true unspotted wife.
Now have thou spoke my daughter dear,
as I would have:
Chastity bears a golden name,
unto her grave.
And when unto thy wedded Lord.
thou prove untrue.
Then let my bitter curses still,
thy soul pursue.
Then with a smilling cheer go thou,
As right and reason does allow.
yet show the king thou bear no strumpets mind
I go dear father with a trice,
And by a sleight of fine devise,
I Will cause the King confess that I am kind.
Here comes the Lady of my life,
the King did say:
My father bids me sovereign Lord,
your will obey
And I consent if you will grant*
one boon to me.
I grant it thee my Lady fair,
what ere it be:
My husband is a live you know,
First let me kill him ere I go,
and at your command I will ever be,
Thy husband now in France does rest,
No no, he lies within my breast,
and being so nigh he will my falsehood see
With that she started from the king,
and took her knife,
And desperately she sought to rid,
her self of life:
The king vpstarted from his chair,
her hand to stay:
O noble king you have broke your word,
with me this day:
Thou shall not do this deed quoth he,
Then will I never lie with thee:
no live thou still and let me bear the blame.
Live thou in honor and high estate,
With thy true Lord and wedded mate,
I never will attempt this suite again.
The winning of the I Will of Man, by the Noble Earl of Salisburie. Cant 12.
To the tune of the Kings going to the Parliament.
THe Noble Earl of Salisbury,
With many a hardy knight,
Most valiauntly prepared himself,
against the Scots to fight.
With his Spear and his shield.
making his proud foes for to yield,
Fiercely on them all he ran,
to drive them from the I Will of man
Drumes stricking on a row,
Trumpets sounding as they go,
tan ta ra ra ra tan.
Their silken Ensigns in the field,
most gloriously were spread
The Horsemen on their prauncing Steedes
struck many a Scotch-man dead,
The Browne-bils on their Corstlets ring,
the bowmen with the Gray-goose whing
The lusty Lances the pierceing Spear,
the soft flesh of their foes do tear,
Drumes stricking on a row.
Trumpets sounding as they go,
tan ta ra ra ra tan.
The Battle was so fierce and hot,
the Scots for fear did fly,
And many a famous knight and Squire,
in goerie blood did lie.
Some thinking to escape away,
did drown themselves within the sea,
Some with many a bloody wound,
lay gasping on the clayie ground:
Drumes stricking on a row,
Trumpets sounding as they go,
tan ta ra ra ra tan.
Thus after may a brave exployt,
that day performd and done,
The noble Earl of Salisburie,
the I Will of Man had won,
Returning then most gallantly,
with honor fame, and victory,
Like a Conqueror of fame,

Knight of that princely garter blew,

Which brave King Edward did devise
and with his person royally
Knights of the Garter are they called;
and eke at Winsor so instald,
With princely royalty,
great fame and dignity,
this knighthood still is held.

Cant. 13. Of Venus and Adonis.
To the tune of Crimson velvet.
VEnus fair did ride,
Silver Doves they drew her
By the pleasant Lawndes,
ere the Sun did rise.
Vestaes beauty rich,
opened wide to view her:
Philomel records
pleasant harmony:
Every Bird of spring,
Chearefully did sing:
Papos Goddess they salute.
Her loves Queen so fair,
Had of mirth no care,
for her son had made her mute:
In her breast so tender,
He a shaft did render,
when her eyes beheld a boy:
Adonis was he named,
By his mother shamed,
yet is he now Venus joy,
Him alone she meets.
ready pre^^ for hunting:
Him she kindly greetes,
and his journey stays:
Him she seeks to kiss,
no devices wanting:
Him her eyes still wooed,
him her tongue still prays:
He with blushing red,
Hangs down his head,
not a kiss can he afford:
His face he turned away,
Silence said her nay*
still she wooed him for a word,
Speak (she said) thou fairest,
Beauty, thou impayrest,
see me, I am pale and wan*
Lovers all adore me,
I for love implore thee:
crystal tears with that down ran.
Him herewith she forced,
for to sit down by her;
She his neck embraced,
gazing in his face:
He like one transformed,
stirred no look to eye her:
Every Herb did woe him,
growing in that place.
Each Bird with ditty,
Prayed him for pity,
in behalf of Beauties Queen,
Waters gentle murmr
Craved him to love his;
yet no liking could be seen.
Boy (she said) look on me,
Still I gaze upon thee,
speak I pray thee, my delight,
Coldly he replied
And in brief denied,
to bestow on her a sight.
I am now to young,
to be won by Beauty:
Tender are my years,
I am yet a bud.
Fair thou art (she said)
then it is thy duty,
Were thou but a bloome,
to effect my good:
Every beauteous flower,
Boasts in my power
Birds and beasts my laws effect.
Mirrha thy fair Mother,
Most of any other,
did my lovely hests respect.
Be with me delighted,
Thou shall be requited,
every Nymph on thee shall tend:
All the Gods shall love thee,
Man shall not reprove thee,
Jove himself shall be thy friend.
Wend then from me, Venus,
I am not disposed;
Thou wringest me too hard,
pray thee let me go:
Fie, what a pain it is,
thus to be enclosed:
If love begin with labor,
it will end with woe,
Kiss me, I will leave,
Here a kiss receive,
A short kiss I do it find.
Will thou leave me so?
Yet shall thou not go,
breath once more thy balmy wind,
It smells of the Mirth-tree,
That to the world did bring thee,
never was Perfume more sweet,
When she had thus spoken,
She gave him a token,
and their naked bosoms meet
Now (said he lets go:
Hark the Hounds are crying,
Grisly Bore is up,
Huntsman follow fast,
At the name of Bore,
Venus seemed dying:
Deadly color pale,
Roses over cast,
Speak (said she) no more*
Of following the Bore,
thou art unfit for such a chase:
Course the fearful Hare,
Venison do not spare,
if thou will yield to Venus Grace,
Shun the Bore I pray thee.
Else I still will stay thee
herein he vowed, to please her mind,
Then her arms enlarged,
Loath she him discharged,
forth she went as swift as wind.
Thetis Phoebus Steedes,
in the West retained;
Hunting sport was past:
she her Love did seek.
Sight of him to soon,
gentle Queen she gained:
On the ground he lay,
blood had left each cheek.
For an orped Swine,
Smit him in the groyne,
deadly wound his death did bring,
Which when Venus found,
She fell in a sound,
and awakt her hands did wring.
Nimphs and Satyrs skipping,
Came together tripping,
Echo every cry expressed:
Venus by her power,
Turned him to a flower,
which she wears in her crest.
The Rebellion of Wat Tyler and Jack Straw: with others against K. Richard the
second. Cant 13.
To the tune of the Miller would a woing ride.
WAt Tyler is from darford began,
and with him many a proper man,
And he a Captain is become,
marching in field with Phife and Drum,
Jack Straw, an other in like case,
from Essex flocks a mighty pace,
Hob Carter with his strangling train,
Jack Shepara comes with him amain
So does Tom Miller in like sort,
as if he meant to take some Fort:
With Bows and Bills with Spear and Shield
on Blacke-heath have they pitched their Field
An hundred thousand in all
whose forch is accounted small:
And for King Richard did they send:
much evil to him they did intend
For the tax the which our king
upon his Commons then did bring:
And now because his royal Grace
denied to come within their Chase,
They spoiled South warke round about
and took the Marshalls Prisoners out
All those that in the Kings bench lay,
at liberty they set that day.
And they marched with one consent,
through London with a lewd intent,
And for to fire their lewd desire,
they set the Sauoy all on fire,
And for the hate that they did bear
unto the duke of Lancastere.
Therefore his house they burned quite:
throuh envy malice and despite
Then to the Temple did they turn:
the Lawyeres Books they did burn:
And spoyld their Lodgings one by one
and all they could lay hand upon
Then unto Smithfield did they hie,
to Saint Jones Place that stands thereby,
And set the same on fire flat.
which burned seven days after that*
Unto the Tower of London then,
fast trooped these rebelious men,
And having entered soon the sams,
with hidious cries and mickle shame,
The grave Lord Chauncelor thence they took,
amazed with fearful pitious look,
The Lord high Treasurer likewise they,
took from that place that present day:
And with their hooping loud and shrill
struck off their heads on Towerhill.
Into the City came they then,
like rude disordered frantic men.
They robbed the Churches every where.
and put the Priests in deadly fear.
Into the Counters then they get,
where men in prison lay for debt:
They broke the doors and let them out
and threw the Counter Books about.
Tearing and spoiling them each one,
and Records all they light upon
The doors of Newgate broke they down,
that Prisoners ran about the town:
Forcing all the Smiths they meet,
to knock the Irons from their feet,
And then like Villains void of awe,
following Wat Tylor and Jack Straw.
And though this outrage was not small,
the King gave pardon to them all,
So they would part home quietly:
but they his pardon did defy
And being all in Smithfield then.
even threescore thousand fighting men
Which there Wat Tyler then did bring,
of purpose for to meet our King.
And therewithal his royal Grace,
sent Sir John Newton to that place,
Unto Wat Tyler willing him,
to come and speak with our young King
But the proud Rebel in despite,
did pick a quarrel with the Knight.
The Mayor of London being by.
when he beheld this vilainie,
Unto Wat Tyler rode he then,
being in midst of all his men:
Saying Traitor yield it is best,
in the Kings name I thee arrest,
And there with to his Dagger start,
and thrust the Rebel to the heart:
Who falling dead unto the ground,
the same did all the Host confound:
And down they threw their weapons all:
and humbly they for pardon call:
Thus did that proud Rebellion cease,
and after followed a joyful peace.

Cant 14. A Lovers wonder.
I Muse how I can live and lack my heart:
Without my heart yet do I live, and love:
Loving the wound that procures my smart
And hartlesse live in hopes forlorn be hoof,
And on this hope, my hapless fancy feeds,
And with this wound my hartlesse body bleedeth.
I muse how I can see and yet am blind:
Blinded I am, yet see, and sigh to see,
I sigh to see my Mistres so unkind,
And see no means my sighing sore to free,
Unkindly blindness thus does aye dismay me,
Since that untimely sight did first betray me.
But when my sight shall see two hearts in one.
Both link in love, to live in others breast.
Then shall no wound procure my sighs of moan,
But hearts return procure my happy rest:
No blindness; sore, or sigh; no wound shall grieve me,
But hope, and life, and love relieve me.

Cant 15. The Lover by gifts thinks to conquer Chastity, And with his gifts
sends these verses to his Lady.
WHat face so fair, that is not cracked with gold?
What wit so worth, but has in gold his wonder
What learning, but with golden lines does hold;
What state so high, but gold will bring it under?
What thought so sweet, but gold does bitter season
And what rule better, then a golden reason?
The ground is fat, that yeeldes a golden fruit:
The study high, that fits the golden state:
The labor sweet, that gets the golden suit:
The love reckoning rich, that scorns the golden rate
The love is sure, that golden hope does hold,
And rich again, that serves the God of Gold.

A new Dialogue between Troylus and Cressida. Cant 16.
To the tune of, Lacaranto.
Troylus THere is no pleasure void of pain,
fair Lady now I see:
Fell Fortune does my state disdain,
the frowning fates agree,
To banish my pleasure and that without measure, away
That woe is me, that ever I see,
This doleful dismal day.

Cressida What is the cause my Troylus true,
of this thy inward smart?
What motions do thy mind molest
what pains do pearce thy heart?
Then show I request thee, what grief does molest thee so near:
I am thy joy, thou prince of Troy,
Thy love and Lady dear.

Troylus The Greeks ^ue sent Embassads*
by means of father thine:
To crave a pledge for prisoners,
in most unhappy time,
And as they demanded counsel has granted even so:
O grief to hear, my Lady dear,
For Authenor must go.

Cressida Although the same accorded be,
yet banished care away,
For what the King commands we see,
the subjects must obey.
Then let it not grieve thee, but rather relieve thee from pain:
Since that I may in half a day,
Come unto Troy again.

Troylus The nearer that thou shall remain,
the more twill breed my spite
When I shall see an other obtain,
the thing that is my right.
The Greeks will flatter, and tell thee much matter. and say:
The town of troy they will destroy,
Ere they depart away.

Cressida. You know the talk does daily run,
as likely it will be.
While truce is held the Greeks will come,
with Troyans to agree:
And they with Queen Hellen will quickly be winding away
Then presently my father and I.
Will come to our friends in Troy,

Troylus. Now since thy father Calcas has,
so foolishly lost his name:
He dares no more approach the walls,
of Troy for very shame,
But he will think rather King Priam my father indeed
Should him reward without regard,
And give him a traitors meede.

Cressida. In vain these words we do but waste,
since so it is decreed:
That Anthenor must here be plaste,
and I for him proceed:
What would you desire, your father a liar to be;
Then show your mind what way could you find
To hinder the Greeks of me.

Troylus. Alas my love Cressida clear.
you know you have my heart
And if thou fauourest me my dear,
then let us both depart:
In secret manner away we must wander, from Troy:
For fathers lie, I pass not a fly,
So I may have my joy.

Cressida. Now God forbid my only Lord,
thou should us so defame:
In such a sort to blemish and blot,
our honor and our good name,
The world will heareafter, declare Calcas daughter, untrue
And they will say you ran away,
For fear of the Grecian crew,

Troylus. What need you pass for peoples report,
or ought that they can say:
So I may pass the time in sport,
with thee my Lady gay.
If Greeks should attain thee; they soon would constrain thee to yield:
And Calcas he would sooner agree,
For fear of their force in field.

Cressida. Nay rather mark my Troylus true.
what means I mind to frame:
How I may keep my promise due,
and guard us both from blame.
With Grecians together, I mean to ride thither but you:
Ere five days twain shall see me again,
As I am a Lady true.

Troylus. Alas my Love and Diamond dear,
what ways could you devise:
To blind their sights that be so clear,
and wits that are so wise,
If ten days they keep you, they will shame to seek you be sure:
Then Troylus I in dolor must dye,
Past hope of any recure.

Cressida. He is not worthy for to have,
a Lady to his love:
That for her sake will not vouchsafe,
some bitter pain to prove.
If ten days absenting you cannot be willing to take:
Then would you sure, small pains endure,
for your false Ladies sake.

Troylus. For ten days space to loose thy sight,
would grieve my heartfull sore,
Yet for thy sake my Lady bright,
I would bide ten times more.
But thus much I fear me, the Greek will deceive thee, alone:
Then Troylus he forgotten shall be,
As one that had never been borne.

Cressida. It hen perceive thy Lady and love,
thou doostfull sore mistrust:
What do you think the Greeks could move,
to make me prove unjust?
Nay then I desire the Gods with wild fire, and flame:
Consume me may without delay,
Or put me to greater shame.

Troylus. I do not think my jewel of joy,
thou would be found untrue:
But at thy parting out of Troy,
to give thee warning due,
Remember thy promise, thy faith and assurance, to me:
And thou shall see, that I will be,
As trusty a Knight to thee.

Cressida. The Sun shall want his burning arms,
the Moon shall loose her light:
And Simois with her silver streams,
that runs through Troy so bight
Shall backward be turning, where first it was springing again.
Ere I to thee unfaithful will be,
Or fail of my promise so plain.
Another.
And thus at last they parted both,
unto their grief and pain,
But Cressida she brake her oath,
she never came again,
But as she deserved, so God he rewarded her pride:
For she full poor, from door to door,
A loathsome Leper died.
When Troylus did perceive and see,
his Lady was untrue:
And that she false rendered had,
to diomed his due.
With heart distressed, himself he addressed to fight:
Through her disdain there was he slain,
By fierce Achilles might.

Cant 17. The Gentle woman's reply.
BVshes have tops, but the Cedar higher,
A hair casts shadow less then Pharoes tower:
The sparks have heat but greater heat the fire:
A Be can sting, not like the Scorpions power:
Seas have maine course, and floods have little springs foords,
Rough are deep Seas, when smooth run shallow
The lack makes noise before the Dial moves,
The firmest Faith is still confirmed with words,
The Turtles mourn in losing of their Loves,
If hearts have ears and eyes then tongue to speak,
They Will hear, and see, and say before they break.

Cant 18. The Lovers thanks to his beloved, sent and enclosed in a Cockle
shell.
Sweet love, the sweet despoyles of sweetest hand
Fair hand the fairest pledge of faithful heart
True heart, whose truth yields the truest band,
Chief band (I say) that binds my chiefest part:
My chiefest part wherein does chiefly stand,
Those secret joys which heaven to me impartes,
Unite in one my state thus still to save,
You have my thanks, let me your comfort have.

Valewing the worth,
Of my peerless praise*
From her gallant Coach,

Sweetly to Paradise,
Flowers fair of hue, pleasant as they grew,
did she gather speedily:
Roses white and red, which the spring had spread,
on the branches frank and free,
Garlands thereof making,
Gilliflowers taking,
to adorn my Lovers head,
Strewing herbs most dainty,
Brought she also plenty,
wherewithal the streets she spread.
Well I may rejoice,
and triumph in pleasure,
Lifting up my voice,
to the lofty skies:
Juno has ordaind,

My desire is gaind,

Be not coy and nice, if that you be wise,
mischief follows fond disdain,
Try and prove your favors;

Such as do deceive you.

men they are not any way.
A Lover bewailing the absence of his Love Cant 20.
To the tune of Where is the life that late.
YOu loving worms that linked be,
in Cupids clogging chain,
Behold I poor and silly man,
lie languishing in pain
Come help with doleful tunes*
to wail my woeful state,
And blame me not since worthily,
I curse my cruel Fate,
Ah woe is me what hap,
what hateful hap have I,
Since I am severed thus from her,
that loves me tenderly.
Dame fortune brought me to a stand,
where I espied a Dame:
That does deserve to be beloved,

Whom when at first I saw,
so well she pleased mine eye*

with her to live and dye,
And then the blinded boy,
so graced me with his glee:
That with a dart he wounded her,
and forced her yield to me.

gave way to our repuest.
And we enjoyed but ah not long,
the thing which we likt best:

God knows the grief my soul susteines,
for her that is my dear:
For since I saw my sweeting last,
I think it twenty year,
When I should walk abroad,
to spend the lightsome day,
Huge heaps of care molest my mind,
for her that is away.
When darkesome night draws on,
to bed with tears I go,
And If I chance to sleep a while,
it doubleth then my woe.
Or when I walk I do perceive,
my choice to be away:
Remembering often in folded arms,
how we full sweetly lay,
Then rush forth sighing sobbes,

I toss and turn and tumble then,
and madmen like I fare,
No world, nor wordly things,
my sorrows can appease:
Until mine eyes shed streams of tears,
and then I find some ease.
Then rose I up as one forlorn,
and leave my restles bed:
A thousand fits of fancies then,
torment my troubled head.
Each morning do I pray,
the Gods upon my knee,
That I may never sheep again
if fates would so decree:
Then put I on my clothes,
as one bereft of joy,
And curse and ban most bitterly,
the means of mine annoy.

Which was sometime my most delight,
then gin my senses fail.
When I should eat or drink.

The meat received will not digest,
but turns back again.
Then think I in my mind,
all hope of help is past.
And often I say unto my self,
would God this were my last.
You youthful lads that know not yet,
the force of Cupids dart;
Beware and wise, retire in time,
for fear of further harm,
Consider well the end,
before you ought begin:
And then you may your selves assure,
to find no lack therein,
Before you snared be,
to fly you may be bold.
But sure resistance will not serve,
when once you are in hold.
The valiant soldier when he does,
address him to the field:
Does rather wish with fame to dye,
then either fly or yield,
Even so my faithful heart,
does sickness so detest.
Live or dye I will not change,
while breath is in my breast.
If I were sure to be
of Gods and men accursed,
Yet I will never change my choice,
let fortune do her worst.

A Speech between certain Ladies being Shepherds on Salisburie plain.
TRuly (said the Ladies) this was a most hardy and courageous Mayor, that durst
in the midst of so mighty a multitude of his enemies, arest so impudent and
bold a Traitor, and kill him in the face of all his friends: which was a deed
worthy to be had in everlasting memory, and highly to be rewarded Nor did his
Majesty forget said the Lady Oxenbridge to dignifie that brave man for his
hardy deed for in remembrance of that admired exployt his Majesty made him
knight and 5. Aldermen more of the city: ordaining also that in remembrance of
Sir William Walworthes deed against Wat Tyler, that all the Mayors that are to
succeed in his place should be knighted: and further he granted that there
should be a Dagger added to the Arms of the city of London in the right
quarter of the shield, for an augmentation of the Arms.

You have told us (q. the Ladies) the end of Wat Tyler. But I pray you what
became of Jack Straw and the rest of that rebellious route? I will show you
(quoth she) Jack Straw with the rest of that rude rabble, being in the end
apprehended (as Rebels never flourish long) was at the last brought to be
executed at London, where he confessed that their intent (was if they could
have brought their most vilde purpose to pass) to have murdered the King and
his nobles, and to have destroyed (so near as they could) all the Gentility of
the land, having especially vowed the death of all the Bishops Abbots, and
Monks: then to have enriched themselves: they determined to set London on
fire, and to have taken spoil of that honorable city, but the gallows
standing betwixt them and home, they were there trust up before they could
effect any thing. And such ends (said the Ladies) send all Rebels, and
especially the desperate Traitor, which at this present vexed the whole state.

With that word one of their servants came running, saying, Madam, the Rebels
are now marched out of Wiltshire and Hampshire, making hasty steps toward
London, therefore now you need not fear to come home, and commit the flocks
to their former keepers. The Ladies being joyful thereof appointed shortly
after a banquet to be prepared, where they all met together again: by which
time the Kings power (having incountred the Rebels on Blackeheath) overthrew
their power, where the Lord Awdly was taken and committed to Newgate from
thence he was drawn to the tower hill in a Coat of his own Arms painted
upon a paper, reuersed and all to torn, and there was he beheaded the 24. of
Inn, and shortly after Thomas Flamocke and Michael Joseph the Blackesmith were
drawn hanged and qurtered after the manner of Traitors. But when the husbands
to these fair Ladies came home and heard how their wives had dealt to save
themselves in this dangerous time they could not choose but heartily laugh at the
matter, saying that such shepherds never kept sheep upon Salisbury plain
before.
