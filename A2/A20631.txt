LONDON, Printed for THOMAS JONES. 1624.

TO THE MOST EXCELlent Prince, Prince CHARLES.
Most Excellent Prince,
I Have had three Births; One, Natural, when I came into the World; One
Supernatural, when I entered into the Ministry; and now, a preter-naturall
Birth, in returning to Life, from this Sickness. In my second Birth, your
Highness Royal Father vouchsafed me his Hand, no^ only to sustain me^ in
it, but to lead me to it. In this last Birth, I my self am borne a Father:
This Child of mine, this Book, comes into the world, from me, and with me.
And therefore, I presume (as I did the Father to the Father) to present the
Son to the Son; This Image of my Humiliation, to the lively Image of his
Majesty, your Highness. It might be enough, that God has seen my Devotions:
But Examples of Good Kings are Commandments; And Ezechiah writ the
Meditations of his Sickness, after his Sickness. Besides, as I have lived to
see, (not as a Witness only, but as a Partaker) the happinesses of a part of
your Royal Fathers time, so shall I live, (in my way) to see the happpinesses
of the times of you^ Highness too, if this Child of mine, inanimated by your
gracious Acceptance, may so long preserve alive the Memory of

Your Highness Humblest and Deuo^edst JOHN DONE.

DEVOTIONS.
1. Insultus Morbi primus; The first alteration, The first grudging of the
sickness.
1. MEDITATION.
VAriable, and therefore miserable condition of Man; this minute I was well, and
am ill, this minute. I am surpised with a sudden change, and alteration to
worse, and can impute it to no cause, nor call it by any name. We study Health,
and we deliberate upon our meats, and drink, and Air, and exercises, and we
hew, and we polish every stone, that goes to that building; and so our Health
is a long and a regular work; But in a minute a Canon batters all, overthrows
all, demolishes all; a Sickness vnpreuented for all our diligence, unsuspected
for all our curiosi^ie; nay, undeserved, if we consider only disorder, summons
us, seizes us, possesses us, destroys us in an instant. O miserable condition
of Man, which was not imprinted by God; who as he is immortal himself, had
put a coal, a beam of Immortality into us, which we might have blown into a
flame, but blew it ou^, by our first sin; we beggard our selves by harkening
after false riches, and infatuated our selves by harkening after false
knowledge. So that now, we do not only die, but die upon the Rack, die by the
torment of sickness; nor that only, but are pre-afflicted, super-afflicted
with these ielousies and suspicions, and apprehensions of Sickness, before we
can call it a sickness; we are not sure we are ill; one hand asks the other by
the pulse, and our eye asks our own urine, how we do. O multiplied misery we
die, and cannot enjoy death, because we die in this torment of sickness; we are
tormented with sickness, and cannot stay till the torment come, but
pre-apprehe^sions and presages, prophecy those torments, which induce that
death before either come^ and our dissolution is conceived in these first
changes, quickened in the sickness it self, and borne in death, which be^res
date from these first changes. Is this the honor which Man has by being a
little world, That he has these earthquakes in him self, sudden shakings;
these lightnings, sudden flashes; these thunders, sudden noises; these
E^clypses, sudden offuscations, and darknings of his senses; these blazing
stars sudden fiery exhalations; these rivers of blood, sudden red waters? Is
he a world to himself only therefore, that he ha^h enough in himself, not
only to destroy, and execute himself, but to presage that execution upon
himself; to as^ist the sickness, to antidate the sickness, to make the sickness
the more irremediable, by sad apprehensions, and as if he would make a fire
the more vehement, by sprinkling water upon the coals, so to wrap a hot fever
in cold Melancholy, least the fever alone should not destroy fast enough,
without this contribution, nor perfect the work (which is destruction) except we
joined an artificial sickness, of our own melancholy, to our natural, our
unnatural fever. O perplexed discomposition, O ridling distemper, O miserable
condition of Man.

1. EXPOSTVLATION.
IF I were but mere dust and ashes, I might speak unto the Lord, for the
Lords hand made me of this dust, and the Lords hand shall recollect these
ashes; the Lords hand was the wheel, upon which this vessel of ^lay was
framed, and the Lords hand is the Vrne, in which these ashes shall be
preserved. I am the dust, and the ashes of the Temple of the H. Ghost; and what
Marble is so precious? But I am more then dust and ashes; I am my best part, I
am my soul. And being so, the breath of God, I may breath back these pious
expostulations to my God. My God, my God, why is not my soul, as fensible as
my body? Why has not my soul these apprehensions, these presages, these
changes, those antidates, those iealousies, those suspicions of a sinne^ as
well as my body of a sickness? why is there not always a pulse in my Soul, to
beat at the approach of a tentation to sin? why are there not always waters
in mine eyes, to testify my spiritual sickness? I stand in the way of
tentations, (naturally, necessarily, all men do so: for there is a Snake in
every path, tentations in every vocation) but I go, I run, I fly into the
ways of te^tation, which I might shun; nay, I break into houses, where the
plague is; I press into places of tentation, and tempt the devil himself,
and solicit and importune them, who had rather be left vnsolicited by me. I
fall sick of Sin, and am bedded and bedrid, buried and putrified in the
practice of Sin, and all this while have no presage, no pulse, no sense of my
sickness; O height, O depth of misery, where the first Symptom of the
sickness is Hell, and where I never fee the fever of lust, of envy, of ambition,
by any other light, then the darkness and horror of Hell it selfe^ and where
the first Messenger that speaks to me does not say^ Thou may die, no, nor
Thou must die, but Thou art dead: and where the first notice, that my Soul
has of her sickness, is irrecouerablenes, irremediablenes: but, O my God, Job
did not charge thee foolishly, in his temporal afflictions, nor may I in my
spiritual. Thou have imprinted a pulse in our Soul, but we do not examine it;
a voice in our conscience, but we do not hearken unto it. We talk it out, we
jest it out, we drink it out, we sleep it out; and when we wake, we do not
say with Jacob, Genesis 28.16.
Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not: but though we might know
it, we do not, we will not. But will God pretend to make a Watch, and leave out
the spring? to make so many various wheels in the faculties of the Soul, and
in the organs of the body, and leave out Grace, that should move them? or will
God make a spring, and not wind it up? Infuse his first grace, and not second
it with more, without which, we can no more use his first grace, when we have
it, then we could dispose our selves by Nature, to have it? But alas, that is
not our case; we are all prodigal sons, and not disinherited; we have
received our portion, and misspent it, not bin denied it. We are Gods tenants
here, and yet here, he, our Landlord pays us Rents; not yearly, nor
quarterly, but hourly, and quarterly; Every minute he renewes his mercy, but
we will not understand, Mat. 13^ 16.
least that we should be converted, and he should heal us.

1. PRAYER.
O Eternal, and most gracious God, who considered in thy self, art a Circle,
first and last, and altogether; but considered in thy working upon us, art a
direct line, and leadest us from our beginning, through all our ways, to our
end, enable me by thy grace, to look forward to mine end, and to look
backward to, to the considerations of thy mercies afforded me from the
beginning; that so by that practice of considering thy mercy, in my beginning
in this world, when thou pla^tedst me in the Christian Church, and thy mercy in
the beginning in the other world, when thou writest me in the Book of life, in
my Election, I may come to a holy consideration of thy mercy, in the beginning
of all my actions here^ That in all the begin^nings, in all the accesses and
approches of spiri^tuall sicknesses of Sin, may hear and hearke^ to that
voice, 2 Reg. 4.40.
O thou Man of God, there is death in the pot, and so refrain from that, which
I was so hungerly, so greedily flying to. Prou. 13.17.
A faithful Am^bassador is health, says thy wise servant Solomon^ Thy voice
received, in the beginning of a sickness, of a sin, is true health. If I can
see that light betimes, and hear that voice early, Then shall my light break
forth as the morning, Esa. 58.8
and my health shall spriug forth speedily. Deliver me therefore, O my God,
from these vain imaginations; that it is an ouercurious thing, a dangerous
thing, to come to that tenderness, that rawnesse, that scrupulousness, to
fear every concupiscence, every offer of Sin, that this suspicious, and
jealous diligence will turn to an inordinate deiection of spirit, and a
diffidence in thy care and providence; bu^ keep me still established, both in a
constant assurance, that thou will speak to me at the beginning of every such
sickness, at the approach of every such Sin; and that, if I take knowledge of
that voice then, an^ fly to thee, thou will preserve me from falling, or
raise me again when by natural infirmitie^ I am fallen: do^ this, O Lord, for
his sake who knows our natural infirmities, for he had them; and knows the
weight of our sins, for he paid a dear price for them, thy Son, our
Savior, Chr: Jesus, Amen.

2. Actio Laesa. The strength, and the function of the Senses, and other
faculties change and fail.
2. MEDITATION.
THe Heavens are not the less constant, because they move continually, because
they move continually one and the same way. The Earth is not the more constant,
because it lies still continually, because continually it changes, and melts in all the parts thereof. Man, who is the noblest part of the Earth, melts so away,
as if he were a statue, not of Earth, but of Snow. We see his own Envy melts
him, he grows lean with that; he will say, another beauty melts him; but
he feels that a Fever does not melt him like snow, but power him out like lead,
like iron, like brass melted in a furnace: It does not only melt him, but
Calcine him, reduce him to Atoms, and to ashes; not to water, but to lime. And
how quickly? Sooner then thou can receive an answer, sooner then thou can
conceive the question; Earth is the center of my body, Heaven is the center of
my Soul; these two are the natural place of these two; but tho^ go not to
these two, i^ an equal place: My b^^dy falls down without pushing, my Soul
do^^ not go up without pu^ling: Ascension is m^ Souls pace and measur^ but
precipitation my b^dies: And, even Angell^ whose home is Heaven and who are
winge^ too, yet had a Ladder (...) go to Heaven, by step^ The Sun who goes
(...) many miles in a minu^^ The Stars of the Fi^^mament, which go so very
many more, go not so fast, as my body to the earth. In the same instant that I
feel the first attempt of the disease, I feel the victory; In the twinkling
of an eye, I can scarce see; instantly the taste is insipid, and fatuous;
instantly the appetite is dull and desirelesse^ instantly the knees are sinking
and strengthlesse; and in an instant, sleep, which is the picture, the copy of
death, is taken away, that the Original, Death it self may succeed, and that
so I might have death to the life. It was part of Adams punishment, In the
sweat of thy brows thou shall eat thy bread^ it is multiplied to me, I have
earned bread in the sweat of my brows, in the labor of my calling, and I have
it^ and I sweat again, and again, from the brow^ to the sole of the foot^ but
I eat no bread, I taste no sustenance: Miserable distribution of Mankind, where
one half lackes meat, and the other stomach.

2. EXPOSTVLATION.
David professes himself a dead dog, 1 Samuel 24 15.
to his king Saul, and so does Mephibosheth to his king David: 2 Samuel 9.8.
and yet David speaks to Saul, and Mephibosheth to David. No man is so little,
in respect of the greatest man, as the greatest in respect of God; for here, in
that, we have not so much as a measure to try it by; proportion is no measure
for infinity. He that has no more of this world but a grave, he that has
his grave but lent him, til a better man, or another man, must be buried in
the same grave, he that has no grave, but a dunghill, he that has no more
earth, but that which he carries, but that which he is, he that has not that
earth, which he is, but even in that, is another slave, has as much
proportion to God, as if all David's Worthies, and all the worlds Monarchs, and
all imaginations Giants were kneaded and incorporated into one, and as though
that one were the suruiuor of all the sons of men, to whom God had given the
world. And therefore how little soever I be, as God calls things that are not,
as though they were, I, who am as though I were not, may call upon God, and
say, My God, my God, why comes thine anger so fast upon me? Why do thou melt
me, scatter me, power me like water upon the ground so instantly? Thou staidst
for the first world, in Noah's time, 120 years; thou staidst for a rebellious
generation in the wilderness 40 years, will thou stay no minute for me? Will thou make thy Process, and thy Decree, thy Citation, and thy Judgment but one
act? Thy Summons, thy Battle, thy Victory, thy Triumph, all but one act; and
lead me captive, nay deliver me captive to death, as soon as thou declarest me
to be enemy, and so cut me off even with the drawing of thy sword out of the
scabberd, and for that question, How long was he sick? leave no other answer,
but that the hand of death pressed upon him from the first minute? My God, my
God, thou wast not wont to come in whirlwinds, but in soft and gentle air. Thy
first breath breathed a Soul into me, and shall thy breath blow it out? Thy
breath in the Congregation, thy Word in the Church, breathes communion, and
consolation here, and consummation heereaf^er; shall thy breath in this Chamber
breathe dissolution, and destruction, divorce, and separation? Surely it is not
thou; it is not thy hand. The devouring sword, the consuming fire, the winds
from the wilderness, the diseases of the body, all that afflicted Job, were from
the hand of Satan; it is not thou. It is thou; Thou my God, who have led me so
continually with thy hand, from the hand of my Nurce, as that I know, thou will
not correct me, but with thine own hand. My parents would not give me over to
a Servants correction, nor my God, to Satan's. 2 Samuel 24.14.
I am fallen into the hands of God with David, and with David I see that his
Mercies are great. For by that mercy, I consider in my present state, not the
haste, and the dispatch of the disease, in dissoluing this body^ so much, as
the much more have, and dispatch, which my God shall use, in recollecting^ and
reuniting this dust again at the Resurrection. Then I shall hear his Angels
proclaim the Surgite M^rtui^ Rise ye dead. Though I be dead I shall hear the
voice the spunding of the voice, and the working of the voice shall be all one;
and all shall rise there in a less Minute, then any one dies here.

2. Prayer.
O Most gracious God, who pursuest and perfitest thine own purposes, and do
not only remember me by the first accesses of this sickness, that I must die,
but inform me by this further proceeding therein, that I may die now, who have
not only waked me with the first, but called me up, by casting me further down,
and clothd me with thy self, by stripping me of my self, and by dulling my
bodily senses, to the meats, and eases of this world, have whet, and sharpened
my spiritual senses, to the apprehension of thee, by what steps and degrees
soever it shall please thee to go, in the dissolution of this body, hasten O
Lord that pace, and multiply O my God those degrees, in the exaltation of my
Soul, toward thee now, and to thee then. My taste is not gone away, but gone up
to sit at David's table, To taste, Psa. 34.8
and see, that the Lord is good: My stomach is not gone, but gone up, so far
upwards toward the Supper of the Lamb, with thy Saints in heaven, as to the
Table, to the Communion of thy Saints here in earth: my knees are weak but
weak therefore that I should easily fall to, and fix my self long upon my
devotions to thee. Prou. 14.30.
A sound heart is the life of the flesh; and a heart visited by thee, and
directed to thee, by that visitation is a sound heart. There is no soundness in
my flesh, Psa. 38.3
because of thin^ anger. Interpret thin^ own work, and call this sickness,
correction and not anger, and there is soundnes in my flesh^ There is no rest
in my bones, Ibid.
because of my sin; transfer^e my sins, with which thou ar^ so displeased,
upon him, with whom thou art so well pleased, Christ Jesus, and there will be
rest in my bones: And, O my God, who made thy self a Light in a Bush, in the
midst of these brambles, and thorns of a sharp sickness, appear unto me
so, that I may see thee, and know thee to be my God, applying thy self to me,
even in these sharp, and thorny passages. Do this, O Lord, for his sake, who
was not the less, the King o^ Heaven, for thy suffering him to be crowned with
thorns, in this world.

3. Decubitus sequitur tandem. The Patient takes his bed.
2. MEDITATION.
We attribute bu^ one privilege, and advantage to Man's body, above other
moving creatures, that he is not as others, groueling^ but of an erect, of an
upright form, naturally built, and disposed to the contemplation of Heaven.
Indeed it is a thankful form, and recompenses that soul, which gives it,
with carrying that soul so many foot higher, toward heaven. Other creatures
look to the earth; and even that is no unfit object, no unfit contemplation for
Man; for thither he must come; but because, Man is not to stay there, as other
creatures are, Man in his natural form, is carried to the contemplation of
tha^ place, which is his hom^ Heaven. This is Man prerogative; but wha^ state
has he in this di^^nitie? A fever ca^ filli^ him down, a fever ca^ depose
him; a fever ca^ bring that head, which yesterday carried a crou^ of gold, five
foot to^wards a crown of glory as low as his own foo^ to day. When God cam^ to
breath into Man the breath of life, he foun^ him flat upon the grou^^ when he
comes to withdraw that breath from him again, he prepares him to it, by
laying him flat upon his bed. Scarce any prison so close, that affords not the
prisoner two, or ^hree steps. The Anchorites that barqu'd themselves up in
hollow trees, and immured themselves in hollow walls; That perverse man, that
barrell'd himself in a Tubb, all could stand, or sit, and enjoy some change of
pasture. A sick bed, is a grave, an^ all that the patient saie^ there, is but
a varying o^ his own Epitaph. Eue^ry nights bed is a Typ^ of the grave: At
nigh^ we tell our servants a^ what hour we will rise; here we cannot tel^
our selves, at what day what week, what mo^neth. Here the head lie^ as low as
the foot; the Head of the people, a^lowe as they, whom those feet trod upon
And that hand tha^ signed Pardons, is to^ weak to beg his own, if he
might have it for lifting up that hand: Strange fetters to the feet, strange
Manacles to the hands, when the feet, and hands are bound so much the
faster, by how much the coards are slacker; So much the less able to do their
Offices, by how much more the Sinnewes and Ligaments are the looser. In the
Grave I may speak thorough the stones, in the voice of my friends, an^ in the
accents of thos^ words, which their love may afford my me^mory; Here I am min^
own Ghost, and rathe^ affright my beholders then instruct them; the^ conceive
the worst o^ me now, and yet fea^^ worse; they give me for dead now, and yet
won^der how I do, when they wake a^ midnight and ask how I do, ^^^morrow.
Miserable and, (though common to all) in human postu^ where I must practice ^y
lying in the grave, by ^ying still, and not practice my Resurrection, by ^ising
any more.

3. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, and my Jesus, my Lord, and my Christ, my Strength, and my Salvation, I
hear thee, and I hearken to thee, when thou rebukest thy Disciples, for
rebuking them, who brought ^hildren to thee; Mat. 19.13.
Suffer little children to come t^ me, say thou. Is ther^ a verier child
then I a^ now? I cannot say wit^ thy servant Jeremy, Lord I am a child, and
cann^ speak; but, O Lord, I a^ a sucking child, an^ cannot eat, a creepin^
child, and cannot go^^ how shall I come t^ thee? Whither shall (...) come to
thee? To thi^ bed? I have this weak and childish froward^nes too, I cannot sit
vp^ and yet am loath to go t^ bed; shall I find thee (...) bed? Oh, have I
always done so? The bed is not ordinarily thy Scene, thy Climate: Lord, do
tho^ not accuse me, do thou not reproach to me, my former sins, when thou
layest me upon this bed? Is not this to hang a man at his own door, to lay
him sick in his own bed of wantonness? When thou chidest us by thy Prophet
for lying in beds of Iuory, Amos 6 4.
is not thine anger vented; not till thou changest our bedds of Iuory, into
bebs of Ebony David swears unto thee, Psalm. 132 3.
that he will not go^ up into his bed, till he ha^ built thee a House. To go^
up into the bed, denote^ strength, and promi^e^ ease; But when tho^ say,
Apoc. 2.22.
That thou will ca^ Iesubel into a bed, tho^ make thine own com^ment upon
that, Tho^ call the bed Tribul^^tion, great Tribulation^ How shall they come
t^ thee, whom thou ha^^ nailed to their bed^ Thou art in the Congr^^gation,
Mat. 8.6
and I in a solitude: when the Centurions servant lay sick at home, his Master
was feign to come to Christ; ^he sick man could not. Their friend lay sick of
the Palsy, 8.4.
and the four charitable men were feign to bring him to Christ; he could not
come. 8.14.
Peter's wives mother lay sick of a fever, and Christ came to her; she could
not come to him. My friends may carry me home to thee, in their prayers in
the Congregation; Thou must com^ home to me in the visi^tation of thy Spirit,
an^ in the seal of thy Sacra^ment: But when I a^ cast into this bed, m^
slack sinews are yro^ fetters, and those thi^ sheets, iron doors upon me;
Psa. 26.8.
And, Lord, I have lo^ued the habitation of the house, and the place when thine
honor dwells: lie here, 84.4.
and say, Bless are they; that dwell in the house; but I cannot say I will
come into thy house I may say, 5.8.
In thy fea^ will I worship toward thy ^oly Temple, but I cannot ^ay in thy
holy Temple^: 69.10.
And, Lord, the zeal of thy House, eats me up, as fast as my fever; It is not
a Recusancie, for I would come, but it is an Excommunication, I must not. But
Lord, thou art Lord of Hosts, and love Action; Why call thou me from my
calling? In the^ grave no man shall praise thee; In the door of the grave,
this sick bed, no Man shall hear me praise thee: Thou have not opned my lips
that my mouth might show thee thy praise, bu^ that my mouth might show forth
thy praise But thine Apostles fear^ takes hold of me, th^^ when I have
preached to ^^thers, 1 Cor. 9.27.
I my self should be cast-way; and therefo^^ am I cast down, that might not
be cast awa^^ Thou could take m^ by the head, 2. Reg. 2.11.
as tho^ did Abacuc, and carr^^ me so; By a Chariot, (...) thou did Eliah,
and ca^^rie me so; but thou ca^^riest me thine own private way, the way by
which thou carryedst thy Son, who first lay upon the earth, and praid, and
then had his Exaltation, as himself calls his Crucifying, and first descended
into hell, and then had his Ascension. There is another Station (indeed neither
are stations but prostrations) lower then this bed; To morrow I may be laid one
Story lower, upon the Floor, the face of the earth, and next day another
Story, in the grave, the womb of the Earth: As yet God suspends me between
Heaven and Earth, as a Meteor; and I am not in Heaven, because an earthly body
clogges me, and I am not in the Earth, because a heavenly Soul sustaines mee^
And it is thine own Law, Exodus 21 18.
O God, that if a man be smitten so by ano^ther, as that he keep hi^ bed,
though he dye not, he that hurt him, must take care of his healing, and
recompense him. The hand strikes me into this bed; and therefore if I rise
again, thou will be my recompense, all the days of my life, in making the
memory of this sickness beneficial to me, and if my body fall yet lower, thou will take my soul out of this bath, and present it to thy Father, washed
again, and again, and again, in thine own tears, in thine own sweat, in
thine own blood.

3. PRAYER.
O Most mighty an^ most merciful God who though thou hau^ taken me off of my
feet have not taken me off o^ my foundation, which is thy self, who thoug^
thou have removed m^ from that upright form, in which I could stand and see
thy throne, the Heavens, yet have not removed from me tha^ light, by which I
can li^^ and see thy self, who though thou have weakened my bodily knees, that
they cannot bow to thee, have yet left me the knees of my heart, which are
bowed unto thee evermore; As thou have made this bed, thine Altar, make me thy
Sacrifice; and as thou make thy Son Christ Jesus the Priest, so make me his
Deacon, to minister to him in a chereful surrender of my body, and soul to thy
pleasure, by his hands. I come unto thee, O God, my God, I come unto thee, so
as I can come, I come to thee, by embracing thy coming to me) I come in the
confidence, and in the application of thy servant David's promise, Psa. 41.3
That thou will make all my bed in my sickness; All my bed; That which way
soever I turn, I may turn to thee; And as I feel thy hand upon all my body,
so I may find it upon all my bed, and see all my corrections, and all my
refreshings to flow from one, and ^he same, and all from thy hand. As (...)
have made these feather^^ ^hornes, in the sharpnes of this sickness, so, Lord,
make these thorns, feathers, again, feathers of thy Do^e, in the peace of
Conscience, and in a holy recourse to thine Arc, to the Instruments of true
comfort, in thy Institutions, and in the Ordinances of thy Church. Forget my
bed, O Lord, as it has been a bed of sloth, and worse then sloth, Take me
not, O Lord, at this advantage, to te^^rifie my soul, with say^ing, now I have
me thee there, where tho^ have so often depart from me; but hauin^ burnt up
that bed, b^ these vehement heat and washed that bed i^ these abundant sweat^
make my bed again, Lord, and enable me a^^cording to thy co^^mand, Psalm. 4.4.
to commune wi^^ mine own heart upon (...) bed, and be still. To pr^^uide a
bed for all m^ former sins, whilst I lie upon this bed, and a grave for my
sins, before I come to my grave; and when I have deposed them in the wounds of
thy Son, to rest in that assurance, that my Conscience is discharged from
further anxietie, and my soul from farther danger, and my Memory from further
calumny. Do this, O Lord, for his sake, who did, and suffered so much, that
thou might, as well in thy Justice, as in thy Mercy, do it for me, thy
Son our Savior, Christ Iesus^

4. MEDITATION.
IT is too little to cal^ Man a little World^ Except God, Man is diminutiue to
nothing Man consistes of more pieces, more parts, the^ ^he world; then the
world does, nay then the world is. And if those pieces were extended, and
stretched out in Man, as they are in the world, Man would be the Giant, and
the world the Dwarf, the world but the Map, and the man the World. If all the
Veins in our bodies, were extented to Rivers, and all the Sinews, to veins
of Mines, and all the Muscles, that lie upon one another, to Hills, and all
the Bones to Quarries of stones, and all the ^^ther pieces, to the pr^^portion
of those which correspond to them i^ the world, the air wou^^ be too little for
this Or^^ of Man to move in, t^^ firmament would b^ but enough for this sta^^
for, as the whole wor^^ has nothing, to which something in man do^^ not
answer, so ha^^ man many pieces, (...) which the whole wor^^ ha^h no
representatio^ Enlarge this Meditation upon this great worl^ Man, so far, as
to consider the immensitie of ^he creatures this world produces; our creatures
are our thoughts; creatures that are borne Giants: that reach from East to
West, from earth to Heaven, that do not only bestride all the Sea, and Land,
but span the Sunn and Firmament at once; My thoughts reach all, comprehend all.
Inexplicable mystery; I their Creator am in a close prison, in a sick bed, any
where, and any one of my Creatures, m^ thoughts, is with t^^ Sun, and beyond
t^^ Sun, ouertakes t^^ Sun, and ouergoes t^^ Sun in one pace, o^ step,
every wher^^ And then as the oth^^ world produces Serpen^ and Vipers, malignan^
and venomous creature^ and Worms, and Cate^^pillars, that endeauo^^ to devour
that worl^ which produces the^ and Monsters compile^ and complicated of d^^uers
parents, and kinds, (...) this world, our selves, produces all these in us,
(...) producing diseases, and ^^cknesses, of all those ^orts; venomous, and
infectious diseases, feeding and consuming diseases, and manifold, and
enta^gled diseases, made up of many several ones. And can the other world name
so many venomous, so many consuming, so many monstro^s crea^ures, as we can
diseases, of all these kinds? O miserable abundance, O ^eggarly riches^ how
much do we lack (...) having remedies for eu^^rie disease, when as y^^ we
have not names f^^ them? But we hau^ Hercules against the^ Giants, these
Monster^ that is, the Phisician; (...) musters up all the for^^ of the other
world, ^ succor this; all Natu^^ to relieve Man. We ha^^ the Phisician, but we
(...) not the Phisician. He we shrink in our p^^^portion, sink in our
d^^^^nitie, in respect of ve^^ mean creatures, w^^^ ^re Phisicians to
them^elues. The Heart that is ^ursued and wounded, they say, knows an Herb,
which being ea^en, throws off the arrow: A strange kind of vomit. The dog that
pursues it, though he be subject to sickness, even prouerbially, knows his
grass that recouers him. And it may be true, that the Drugger is as near to
Man, as to other creatures, it may be that obuious and present Simples, easy
to be had, would cure him; b^^ the Apothecary is not (...) near him, nor the
P^^^sician so near him, (...) they two are to oth^^ creatures; Man has n^^
that innate instinct, to a^^ply those natural me^^^cines to his present
da^^ger, as those inferio^^ creatures have; he is n^^ his own Apothecary, h^^
own Phisician, as th^^ are. Call back therefo^^ thy Meditations agai^^^ and
bring it down^^ what is become of ma^^ great extent and propo^^^tion, when
himself shrinkes himself, and consumes himself to ^ handful of dust; what is
become of his soaring thoughts, his compassing thoughts, when himself brings
himself to the ignoranc^, ^o the thoughtlesness^ of the Grave? His diseases
are his own, but the Phisician is not; he has them at home, but ^ee must
send for the Phisician.

4. EXPOSTVLATION^
I Have not the right^ousnesse of Job, Job 13.3.
but have the desire of (...) I would speak to the ^ mighty^ and I would
reas^^ with God. My God, (...) God, how soon wou^^dest thou have me go^^ to
the Phisician, and ho^^ far would thou ha^^ me go with the Phisi^^^an? I
know thou h^^ made the Matter, a^^ the Man, and the (...) and I go not from
th^^ when I go to the Phisician. Thou did not make clothes before there was a
shame of the nakedness of the body; but thou did make Physic before there was
any grudging of any sickness; for thou did imprint a medicinal virtue in many
Simples, even from the beginning; did thou mean that we should be sick,
when thou did so? when thou made them? No more then thou did mean, that
we should sin, when thou made us: tho^ fore-sawest both, bu^ causedst
neither. Tho^ Lord, Ez^c. 47.12.
promisest hee^ trees, whose fruit shall b^^ for meat, and their lea^^ for
Medicine. It is the voice of thy Son, W^^ thou be made whole That draws from
th^^ patient a confession tha^ he was ill, Ioh. 5.6
and could not make himself w^^ And it is thine own^ voice, Is there no
Phisi^cian? Ier. 8.22
That inclines us disposes us to accep^ thine Ordinance. An^ ^t is the voice of
the Wise man, both for the matter, physic it self, The Lord has created
Medicines out of the Earth, Ecclus. 38.4
and he that is wise, shall not abhor them, And for the Art, and the
Person, The Phisician cutteth off a long disease. In all these voices, thou
sendest us to those helps, which thou have afforded us in that. But wilt not
thou auowe that voice too, Ecclus. 38.15.
He that has sinned against his Maker, let him fall into the hands of the
Phisician; an^ wilt not thou affoor^ me an understanding o^ those words? Tho^
who sendest us for ^ blessing to the Phisic^^an, do not make it ^ curse to
us, to go, when thou sendest. Is not the curse rather in this, th^^ only he
falls into the hands of the Phisician that casts himself who^ly, entirely upon
the Phi^sician, confides in him relies upon him, attend all from him, and
neg^lects that spiritual phi^icke; which thou also have instituted in thy
Church^ so to fall into the ^ands of the Phisician; is a sin, and a
punishment of ^ormer sins; so, as Asa^fell, who in his disease, sought not to
the Lord, 1. Chro. 16.12.
but^ ^o the Phisician. Reveal therefore to me thy me^hod, O Lord, and see,
whether I have followed it; that thou may have glory, if I have, and I
pardon, if I have not, and help that I may. Thy Method is, Ecclus ^8.9
In time of thy sickness, be not negligent^ Wherein will thou have my
diligence expressed? Pray unto the Lord, and he will mak^ thee whole. O Lord,
^ do; I pray, and pray thy Servant Dauid^ prayer, Ps. 6.2:
Have mercy vp^on me, O Lord, for I a^ weak; Heal me, O Lord, for my bones
ar^ vexed: I know, that even my weakness is a reason, a mot^ue, to induce
thy mercy, and my sickness an occasion of thy sending health When art thou so
ready, when is it so seasonable to thee, to commiserate, as in misery? But is
Prayer for health in season, as soon as I am sick? Thy Method goes further;
Leave off from sin, v. 10.
and order thy hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all wickedness; Have
I, O Lord, done so? O Lord, I have; by thy grace, I am come to a holy
detestation of my former sin; Is there any more? In thy Method there is more;
Give a sweet sauor^ and a memorial of fin^ flower, and make a fat of^fering,
as not being. And Lord, by thy grace, I have done that, sacrificed ^ little, of
that little which thou lentst me, to them for who^ thou lentst it and now in thy
metho^ and by thy steps, I am come to that, Then gi^^ place to the Phisician,
v, 12.
for the Lord has created him let him not go from the^ for thou have need of
him I send for the Phisicia^ but I will hear him en^ter with those words of
Peter, Act. 9.^4.
Jesus Christ makes thee whole; I long for his presence, but I look^ that the
power of the Lord, Luc. 5.17.
should be present to heal me.

4. PRAYER.
O Most mighty, and most merciful God, who art so the God of health, and
strength, as that without thee, all health is but the fuel, and all strength,
but the bellows of sin; Behold me^ under the vehemenc^ of two diseases, and
vn^der the nece^sity of tw^ Phisicia^s, authorized b^ thee, the bodily, and the
spiritual Phisician. I com^ to both, as to thine Ordi^nance, and bless, and
glo^rifie thy Name, that i^ both cases, thou have af^forded help to Man by the
Ministry of man^ Even in the new Ierusa^lem, Apo. 22.2^.
in Heaven it self, i^ has pleased thee to discover a Tree, which i^ a Tree
of life there, bu^ the leaves thereof are for the healing of the Nations; Life
it self is with thee there, for thou art life; and all kinds of Health,
wrought upon us here, by thine Instruments, descend from thence. Ier. 51.9.
Thou would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed; Take from me, O
Lord, her perverseness, her wilfulness, her refractarinesse, and hear thy
Spirit saying in my Soul, Heal me, O Lord, for I would be healed. Ephraim
saw his sickness, Ose: 5.13.
and Judah his wound; then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to King
Iareb, yet could no^ he heal you, nor cure you of your wound. Keep me back O
Lord, from them who mis-professe arts of healing the Soul, or of the Body, by
means not imprinted by thee in the Church, for the soul, or not in nature for
the body; There is no spiritual health to be had by superstition, nor bodily
by witchcraft^ thou Lord, and only thou art Lord of both. Thou in thy self
art Lord of both, and thou in thy Son art the Phisician, the applyer of both.
Esa.
With his stripes we are healed, says the Prophet there; there, before he
was scourged, we were healed with his stripes; how much more shall I be
healed now, now, when that which he has already suffered actually, is actually,
and effectually applied to me? Is there any thing incurable, upon which that
Balm dropps? Any vain (...) empty, as that that blo^^ cannot fill it? 2 Ch^o:
7.14.
Thou pro^misest to heal the ear^^ but it is when the i^^habitants of the
eart^ pray that thou woulde^^ heal it. Ezech: 47.11.
Thou promi^sest to heal their W^^ters, but their miery pl^^ces, and standing
waters^ thou say there, Tho^ wilt not heal: My retu^^n^ng to any sin, if
should return to the a^bilitie of sinning over all my sins again, thou
would not pardon^ ^eale this earth, O my ^od, by repentant tears, and heal
these waters, ^hese tears from all bit^^rnes, from all diffidence, from all
deiection, by e^^ablishing my irremo^able assurance in thee. ^hy Son went
about hea^^ng all manner of sicke^esses. Mat. 4.23.
(No disease incu^able, none difficult; Luc. 6.19.
he ^ealed them in passing) ^ertue went out of him, Io: 7.23.
and he healed all, all the ^ultitude (no person in^urable) he healed them
^uery whit, (as himself speaks) he left no relike of the disease; and wi^^
this universal Phisici^^ pass by this Hospital and not visit me? no^ heal
me? not heal m^ wholly? Lord, I look^ not that thou shoulde^ say by thy
Messenger t^ me, 2. Reg. 20.^.
as to Ezechias, B^^hold, I will heal thee, an^ on the third day thou sha^^
go up to the house of the Lord. I look not th^^ thou should say to m^^ as
to Moses in Miriam^ behalf, Number: 12.14.
when Mos^^ would have had he^^ heald presently, If her ^ather had but spit in
her ^ace, should she not been ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up seven
days, and then return; but if ^hou be pleased to multiply seven days, (and
seven is in^inite) by the number of my sins, (and that is more infinite) if
this day must remove me, till days shall ^ee no more, seal to me, my
spiritual health in affording me the Seals of thy Church, and for my
^emporall health, prosper thine ordinance, i^ their hands who sha^^ assist in
this sickness, i^ that manner, and in the measure, as may mo^^ glorify thee,
and mo^^ edify those, who ob^serue the issues of the servants, to their own^
spiritual benefit.

5. Solus adest. The Phisician comes.
5. MEDITATION.
AS Sickness is the greatest misery. s^ the greatest misery o^ ^icknes is
solitude; when ^he infectiousnes of the disease deterrs the^ who should assist,
from co^^ing; Even the Phisici^n dares scarce come. So^itude is a torment,
which is not threatened in hell it self. Mere vacuitie, the first Agent, God,
the first instrument of God, Nature, will not admit; Nothing can be utterly
^nptie, but so near a ^egree toward Vacutie, as Solitude, to be ^ut one,
they love not. When I am dead, and my body might infect, the^ have a remedy,
th^^ may bury me; but w^^ I am but sick, and mig^^ infect, they have no
^^^medy, but their absen^^ and my solitude. It is ^^ excuse to them that a ^^
great, and pre^end, and y^^ are loath to come; it is ^^ inhibition to those w^^
would truly come, because they may be ma^^ instruments, and pe^^ducts, to the
infectio^^^ others, by their co^min^^ And it is an Outlawry, (...)
Excommunication upon ^he patient, and seperats ^im from all offices not only
of Civility, but of ^orking Charity. A long ^icknesse will w^ary ^^i^nds a^
last, but a pe^tilentiall sickness auerts them from the begin^ing. God himself
would ^dmit a fig^^e of Society, ^s there is a plurality of ^ersons in God,
though ^here be but one God; and all his exte^nall actions testify a love of
So^i^tie and communion. In Heaven ther^ are Ordens of Angels, and Armies of
Martyrs, and in that hou^^ many mansions; in Ear^^ Families, Cities, Church^
Colleges, all plural things and lest either of the should not be compa^^
enough alone, there (...) an association of bo^^ a Communion of Sain^^ which
makes the M^^^tant, and Triumpha^^ Church, one Parish; (...) that Christ, was
not o^ of his Dioces, when h^ was upon the Earth, n^^ out of his Temple, wh^^
he was in our flesh G^^ who saw that all th^^ ^ee made, was good, ^ame not so
near seeing (...) defect in any of his works, as when he saw that it was not
good, ^or man to be alone, therefore h^e made him (...) helper; and one that
should help him so, as ^o increase the number, and give him her own, ^^d more
society. Angels, ^ho do not propagate, ^or multiply, were ^ade at first in an
abu^^ant number; and so ^ere stars: But for ^he things of this world, their
blessing was, Increase; for I think, I nee^ not ask leave to think that there
is no Phoenix nothing singular, no^thing alone: Men tha^ in here upon Nature
only, are so far from think^ing, that there is an^^thing singular in th^^
world, as that they wi^^ scarce think, that th^^ world it self is singula^
but that every Plane^ and every Star, is an^other World like this They find
reason t^ conceive, not onely^ plurality in every Species in the world, but a
plurality of worlds; so that the abho^rers of Solitude, are not solitary; for
God, and Nature, and Reason concur against it. Now, a man may counterfeyt the
Plague in a vow, and mistake a Disease for Religion; by such a re^iring, and
recluding of ^imselfe from all men, (...) to do good to no ^an, to converse
with ^o man. God has two ^estame^ts, two Wills; but this is a Scedule, and no^
of his, a Codicill, and no^ of his, not in the body o^ his Testaments, but
interlind, and postscrib'd by o^thers, that the way t^ the Communion of Saint^
should be by such a sol^^tude, as excludes all do^ing of good here. Th^^ is a
disease of the mind^ the height of an inf^^ctious disease of the bo^dy, is
solitude, to be left ^^lone: for this makes (...) infectious bed, equa^^ nay
worse then a gra^^ that though in both (...) equally alone, in my bed I know it,
and feel it, and shall not in my grave: and this too, that in my bed, my
soul is still in an infectious body, and shall not in my grave be so.

O God, my God, thy Son took it not ill at Marthaes hands, that when he said
unto her, Thy brother Lazarus shall rise again, Io: 13.23.

again in the Resurrection, at the last day^ for she was miserable by wanting
him then^ Take it not ill, O my God, from me, that though thou have o^dained i^
for a blessing, and for ^ dignity to thy people, That they should dwell alone,

Two are better then one; And Woe be unto him that is alone when he falleth^

Righteousness is immortal; I know thy wisdom has said so; but no Man,
though covered with the righteousness of thy Son, is immor^all so, as not to
die; for he who was righteousness it self, did die. I know that the Son of
righteous^nes, Mat. 14.23.
thy Son, refused no^ nay affected solitariness^ lonenesse, many, man^ times;
but at all time^ he was able to co^man^ more then twelve legions (...) Angels

and my kinsmen stand afar off, I cannot tell. ^ cannot fear, but that thou will reckon with me from this minute, in which, by thy grace, I see thee^
whether this understanding, and this will, and this memory, may not decay, to
the discouragement, and the ill interpretation of the^, that see that heavy
change in me, I cannot tell. It was for thy blessed, thy powerful Son alone,
Esa. 63.3.

^4.14.
I am left alone; an^ Martha murmured at that, Luc. 10.40.
and said to Christ, Lord, do not thou care, that my sister has left me to
serve alone? Neither could Jeremiah enter into his Lame^tations, from a higher
ground, then to say, Ier. 1.1.
How does the city sit solitary, that was full of people. O my God, it is the
Leper, that thou have condemned to live alone; Leu: 13.46.
Have ^ such a Leprosy in my Soul, that I must die alone; alone without thee?
Shall this come to such a Le^rosie in my body, that I must die ^^lone? Alone
without them that should assi^^ that should comfort m^^ But comes not this
E^^postulation too near murmuring? Must I b^^ concluded with that, Exo: 14.2.
th^^ Moses was commanded (...) come near the Lord alon^^ That solitarines,

ac^co^panies us most alon^^ May I not remember and apply to; Genesis 32.24.
that thogh^ God come not to Jacob till he found him alone, ^et when he found
him alone, he wrestled with him, and lamed him? That when in the dereliction
and forsaking of friends and Phisicians, a man is left alone to God, God may so
wrestle with this Jacob, with this Conscience, as to put it out of joint, and
so appear to him, as that he dares not look upon him face to face, when as by
way of reflection, in the consolation of his temporal or spiritual servants,
and ordinances he durst, (...) they were there? Ecclus. 6.16.
But ^ faithful friend is the physic of life, and they the fear the Lord,

Ph^^sician, who is my faith^full friend.

5. PRAYER.
O Eternal, and mo^^ gracious God, wh^^ calledst down fire from Heaven upon
the sinfu^^ Cities, but once, and op^^nedst the Earth to swallow the Murmurers,
but once^ and threwst down the Tower of Siloe upon sinners, but once, but for

him here, ^o whether it be thy will to continue me ^ong thus, or to dismiss
me by death, be pleased to afford me the helps fit for both conditions, either
for my weak sta^ here, or my final tran^^migration from hence^ And if thou
may r^^ceiue glory by that wa^^ (and, by all ways tho^^ may receive
glory) gl^^rifie thy self in preser^uing this body from suc^ infections, as
might withhold those, wh^ would come, or in da^^ger the^ who do come^ and
preserve this soul (...) the faculties thereof, fr^^ all such distempers,
(...) might shake the assu^rance which my self and others have had, that
because thou have loved me, thou would love me to my end, and at my end. Open
none of my doors, not of my heart, not of mine ears, not of my house, to any
supplanter that would enter to undermine me in my Religion to thee, in the time
of my weakness, or to defame me, and magnify himself, with false rumors of
such a victory, and surprisall of me, after I am dead; Be my salvation, and
plead my salvation; work it, and decla^^ it; and as thy triumpha^^ shall be, so
let the M^^tant Church be assure^ that thou wast my (...) and I thy servant,
to, an^ in my consummatio^ Bless thou the learning and the labors of th^^
Man, who^ thou sende^^ to assist me; and sinc^ thou take me by the hand, and
put me into his hands (for I come t^ him in thy name, who in thy name comes
t^ me) since I clog not m^ hopes in him, no nor my ^^ayers to thee, with any

thy will be done, pro^er him, and relieve ^^e, in thy way, in thy ^^me, and in

6. Metuit. The Phisician is afraid.
6. MEDITATION.
^ Observe the Phisician, with the same ^iligence, as he the dis^ase; I see
he fears, and I fear with him: I overtake him, I ouem him in his fear, an^
go the faster, because^ makes his pace slow^ fear the more, beca^^^ he
disguises his fear, (...) I see it with the mo^^ sharpness, because (...)
would not have me (...) it. He knows that (...) fear shall not disord^^^ the
practice, and exerci^^^ of his Art, but he kno^^ that my fear may diso^^der the
e^fect, and wo^^king of his practice. (...) the ill affections of (...)
spleen, complicate, an^ ^ingle themselus with ^^ery infirmity of the ^^dy, so
does fear insi^^at it ^elf in every acti^^ or passion of the mind; and as wind
in the body ^ill counterfeit any dis^ase, and seem the Stone, and ^eem the Gout,
so fear will counterfeit any dis^ase of the Mind; It shall ^eeme love, a love
of having, and it is but a fear, a jealous, and suspicious ^eare of loosing; It
shall ^eem valor in despising, and vnderualuing danger, and it is but fear, in
an ouer-valuing of ^^^^nion, and estimation, and fear of loosing that man that
is not afraid^ a Lion, is afraid of a (...) not afraid of starui^^ and yet is
afraid of so^^ joint of meat at the tab^^ presented to feed hi^ not afraid of
the so^^^ of Drums, and Tru^^pets, and Shot, and tho^^ which they seek (...)
drown, the last cries o^ men, and is afraid (...) some particular harm^^nious
instrument^ so much afraid, as that with an^ of these the enemy might ^riue
this man, otherwise ^aliant enough, out of ^^e field. I know not, what fear is,
nor I know ^ot what it is that I fear ^ow; I fear not the hastening of my
death, and yet I do fear the increase ^f the disease; I should ^elie Nature, if
I should deny that I feared this, and ^f I should say that I fea^ed death, I
should belie God; My weakness is from Nature, who has ^ut her Measure, my
^trength is from God, who possesses, and distri^butes infinitely. As the every
cold air, is no^ dampe, every shiuering not a stupefaction, so eue^ry fear,
is not a feare^^^nes, every declination^ not a running away, ^^uery debating is
not resolving, every wis^ that it were not thus, ^ not a murmuring, no^
deiection though it b^^ thus; but as my Phisici^^ fear puts not him from his
practice, neither do^^ mine put me, from r^^ceiuing from God, an^ Man, and my
self, spiritu^ll, and civil, and moral ^ssistances, and conso^ations.

6. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, I find in thy Book, that ^eare is a stifling spirit, a spirit
of suffocation; That ^^shbosheth could not speak, 2 Samuel: 3.11
not reply in his own defense ^o Abner, because he was ^fraid. It was thy
servant ^obs case too, 9.34.
who before he could say any thing to thee, says of thee, Let him take his
rod awa^ from me, Job 9.34.
and let not his fear^ terrify me, then would speak with him, and (...)
fear him; but it is not ^^ with me. Shall a fear (...) thee, take away my
d^^uotio^ to thee? Do tho^ command me to spea^^ to thee, and commaun^ me to
fear thee, and d^^ these destroy one ano^ther? There is no per^^plexity in
thee, my God; (...) inextricablenes in the^ my light, and my clearn^^ my Sun,
and my Moon^ that directest me as (...) in the night of adversity and fear, as
in my day of prosperity and confidence. I must the^ speak to thee, at all
times, but when must I fear thee? At all times to. When did thou rebuke any
petitioner, with the name of Importunate? Luc: 18.1.
Thou have propo^d to us a parable of a Judge that did Justice at last, because
the client was Importunate, and troubled him; But thou have told us plainly,
that thy use in that parable, was not, that thou wast troubled with our
importunities, but (as thou saye^^ there) That we should a^^wayes pray. Luc.
11.5.
And to th^^ same purpose thou pro^posest another, that Is^^ press my friend,
when he^^ is in bed, at midnight, (...) lend me bread, though h^^ will not
rise because I a^ his friend, yet because^ mine importunity, he wil^^ God will
do this, when^soeuer thon ask, an^ never call it importunit^e Pray in thy
bed at mid^night, and God will n^^ say, I will hear thee t^ mo^row upon thy
knees, at thy bed side; pray upon thy knees there, then, and God will not say,
I will hear thee on Sunday, at Church; God is no dilatory God, no froward God;
Prayer is never unseasonable, God is never asleep nor absent. But, O my God,
can I do this, and fear thee; come to thee, and speak to thee, in all places,
at all hours, and fear thee? Dare I ask this question? There is more
boldness in the question, then in the coming: I may do it^ though I fear

should always fea^^ thee, as that thou ha^^ provided, that we shol^ fear no

The Lord is my help, and m^ salvation, whom shall fear? Great enemies: no^
great enemies; for no ^^nemies are great to them that fear thee^ Number: 14.9.
Fear not the people of the l^^d, for they are Bread to you; They shall not
on^y not eat us, not eat our bread, but they shall be our Bread; Why should,
we fear them? But for all this Metaphorical Bread, victory over enemies, that
thought to devour us, may we not fear, that we may lack bread literally? And
fear famine, though we fear not enemies? Young Lions do lack, Ps: 35.70.
and suffer Hunger, but they that seek the Lord, shall not want any good
thing. Never? Though it be^ well with them at on^ time, may they not fea^ that

if thou fear God Thou art, O my God, so far from admitting us, that fear
thee, to fear others, as that thou make others to fear us; As Herod feared
John, Mar. 6.20.
because he was a holy, and a just man, and observed him How fully then O my
abundant God, how gently, O my sweet, my easy God do thou vnentangle m^e,
in any scruple arising out of the consideration of this thy fear? Is not this
that which thou intendest, when thou say, Psa: 25.14.
The secret of the Lord is with them, that fear him; The secret, the mystery
of the right v^^ of fear. Do thou no^ mean this, when tho^ say, Pro: 2.5.
We shall vnde^^stand the fear of the Lord Have it, and have benef^^ by it;
have it, and stan^ under it; be directed b^ it, and not be deiecte^ with it.
And do tho^ not propose that Chur^^ for our example, when thou say, Act.
9.31.
The Church of Judea, walked in t^^ fear of God; they ha^ it, but did not sit
dow^ lazily, nor fall down^ weakly, nor sink under it. There is a fear which
weakens men in the service of God: Adam was afraid, Genesis 3.10.
because he was naked. They who have put off thee, are a prey to all. They may
fear, for thou will laugh, Pro: 1.26:
when their fear comes upon them, as thou have told them, 10.24.
more then once; And thou will make them fear, Ps: 14.5.
where no cause of fear is, as thou have told them more then once too. 53 6.
There is a fear that is a punishment o^ former wickednesses, and induces
more: Thoug^ some said of thy Son, Christ Jesus, Io: 7.13.
that he wa^ a good Man, yet no M^^ spoke openly, for fear (...) the Jews:
19.38.
Joseph was h^^ Disciple; but secretly, for for fear of the Jews: The
Disciples kept some meetings, 29.19.
but with doors shut, for fear of the Jews. O my God, thou give us fear
for ballast to carry us stedily in all weathers. But thou would ballast us,
wit^ such sand, as should have gold in it, with that fear which is thy fear;
for tke fear of the Lord is his treasure. Esai: 33.6.
He that has that, lacks nothing that Man can have, nothing that God does
give. Timorous men thou rebukest; Mat. 8.26.
Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Such thou dismissest from thy
Service, with scorn, though of them there went from Gideons Army, Iud: 7.3.
22000. and remained but 10. Such thou sendest farther then so; thithe^ from
whence they n^^uer return, The fearefu^^ and the unbelieving, Apo: 21.8.
i^^^ that burning lake, which (...) the second death. There (...) a fear, and
there is a hope which are equal abo^minations to thee; for they were
confounded, Job. 6.20.
b^^cause they hoped, says the servant Job: because they had mis-placed,
mis-ce^tred their hopes; they hoped, and not in thee, an^ such shall fear, and
no^ fear thee. Bu^ in the fear, my God, and my fear, my God, and my hope, is
hope, and love, and confidence, and peace, and every limb, and ingredient of
Happiness enwrapped; for Joy includes all; and fear, and joy consist
together; nay, constitute one another; The women d^parted from the sepulcher,
Mat. 28.8.
the women who were made supernumerary Apostles, Apostles to the Apostles;
Mothers of the Church, and of the Fathers, Grandfathers of the Church, the
Apostles themselves, the women, Angels of the Resurrec^^^on, went from the
sep^^^chre, with fear and i^ they ran, says the (...) and they ran upon tho^^
two legs, fear, and joy; (...) both was the right leg^ they joy in thee O Lord
that fear thee, and fear^ thee only, who feel th^^ joy in thee. Nay, thy
fear^^ and thy love, are in^eperable; still we are called upon, in infinite
places, to fear God; yet the Commandment, which (...) the root of all, is,
Tho^ shall love the Lord thy God^ He does neither, that does not both; he
omits neither, Ps: 111.10.
that does one. Therefore when thy servant David had said, Pro. 1.7.
that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, And his Son had
repeated it again, He that collects both, calls this fear, Ecclus. 1.20.27.
the root of wisdom; And that it may embrace all, he ca^ls it wisdom it
self. A wise man therefore is never without it, never without the exercise of
it: Therefore thou sent^st Moses to thy people That they might learne^ fear
thee all the days ^ their lives: Deu: 4.10,
not in he^^uy, and calamitous, bu^ in good, and cheerf^^ days too: for, No^^
who had assurance (...) his deliverance, yet m^^ued with fear, Heb: 11.7.
prepar^ an Arc, for the sauing^ his house. Ecclus: 18.27.
A wise man (...) fear in every thing. An^ therefore though I pr^^tend, to no
other degre^ of wisdom, I am a^bundantly rich in thi^ that I lie here
posse^^ with that fear, which ^s thy fear, both that ^his sickness is thy
immediate correction, and ^ot merely a natural ^ccident, and therefore
^earefull, because it is a ^earefull thing to fall into ^hy hands, and that
this ^eare preserues me from all inordinate fear, arising out of the
infirmi^ie of Nature, because ^hy hand being upon me, thou will never let me
fall out of thy hand.

6. PRAYER.
O Most mighty God (...) merciful God, (...) God of all true sorrow, (...)
true joy to, of all fear, ^ of al hope to, as thou ha^^ given me a Repentan^^
not to be repented of, (...) give me, O Lord, a fea^^ of which I may not b^
afraid. Give me tende^ and supple, and confo^^mable affections, that (...) I
joy with them that i^^ and mourn with them that mourn, so I man fear with
them that fear. And since thou have vouchsafed to discover to me, in his fear
whom thou have admit^ed to be my assistance, ^n this sickness, that ^here is
danger therein, ^et me not, O Lord, go a^out to overcome the sense of that
fear, so far, as to pretermit the fitting, and preparing of my self, for the
worst that may be feared, the passage out of this life. Many of thy blessed
Martyrs, have passed out of this life, without a^^ show of fear; But the most
blessed Son him^selfe did not so. T^^ Martys were known^ be but men, and
therfo^^ it pleased thee, to fill t^^ with thy Spirit, and the power, in that

former coldnesses, and indeuotions, with ^hese heats, and quench^d my former
heates, with these sweats, and ^nundations, and rectified my former
pre^umptions, and negligences with these fears, ^ee pleased, O Lord, as one,

which thy Son, our S^^uiour Christ Jesus hat^ purchased for them whom thou
make^ partakers of his Resu^^rection. Amen.

7. Socios sibi iungier instat. The Phisician desires to have others joined
with him.
7. MEDITATION.
THere is more fear, therefore more cause. If the Phisician desire help, the
burden grows great: There is a grouth of the Disease then; But ^here must be
an Au^umne to; But whether an Autumn of the disease or me, it is not my pa^^
to choose: but if it be of me, it is of both; My disease cannot suruiu^ me, I
may over live i^ Howsoever, his desiring of others, argues his ca^^dor, and his
ingenuitie; (...) the danger be great, he^ iustifies his proceeding^ and he
disguises nothing that calls in witnesses^ And if the danger be not great, he
is not a^^bitious, that is so read^ to divide the thanks and the honor of the
work, which he beg^^ alone, with others. It diminishes not the dignity of a
Monarch, that he derive part of his care upon others; God has not made many
Suns, but he has made many bodies, that receive, and give light. The Romans
began with one King; they came to two Consuls; they returned in extremities, to
one Dictator^ whether in one, or many, the sovereignty is the same, in all
States, and the danger is not the more, and the providence is the more, when
there are more Phisicians; as the State is the happier, where businesses are
carried by more counsels, then can be in one breast, how large soever, Dise^ses
themselves hold Consultations, and conspire how they may multiply, and ioyn
with one another, and exalt one another force so; and shall we not cal^
Phisicians, to consultations? Death is in an old man's door, he appeare^ and
tells him so, and dea^^ is at a young man's back, and says nothing^ Age is a
sickness, and Youth is an ambush, and we need so many Phisicians, as may make
up a Watch, and spy every inconvenience. There is scarce any thing, that has
not killed some body; a hair, a feather has done it^ Nay, that which is our
best Antidote against it, has donn it; the best Cordial has been deadly
poison; Men have dyed of Joy, and almost forbidden their friends to weep for
the^, when they have seen the^ dye laughing. Even that Tiran Dy^^nisius (I
think the same^ that suffered so much a^^ter) who could not d^^ of that
sorrow, of tha^ high fall, from a King t^ a wretched private ma^^ dyed of so
poor a Joy, as to be declard by the peo^ple at a Theater, that he^ was a good
Poet. We sa^ often that a Man may li^^ of a little; but, alas, o^ how much less
may a Man dye? And therefore the more assistants, the better; who comes to a day
of hearing, in a cause of any importance, with one Advocate? In our Funerals, we
our selfs have no interest; there we cannot advise, we cannot direct: And
though some Nations, (the Egiptians in particular) built themselves better
Tombs, then houses, because they were to dwell longer in them; yet, amongst our
selves, the greatest Man of Style, whom we hane had, The Conqueror, was lest,
as soon as his soul left him, not only without persons to assist at his
grave, but without a grave. Who will keep us then, we know not^ As long as we
can, let us admit as much help as we can; Another, and another Phisician, is
not another, and another Indication, and Symptom of death, but an other^ and
another Assistant, and Proctor of life: No^ do they so much feed the
imagination with apprehension of danger, as the understanding with comfort; Let
not one bring Learning, another Diligence, another Religion, but every one
bring all, and, as many Ingredients enter into a Receipt, so may many men make
the Receipt. But why do I exercise my Meditation so long upon this, of having
plentiful help in time of need? Is not my Meditation rather to be inclined
another way, to condole, and commiserate their distress, who have none? How
many are sicker (perchance) then I, and laid in their woeful straw at home (if
that co^ner be a home) and have no more hope of help, though they die, then of
preferment, though they live? Nor do no more expect to see a Phisician then,
then to be an Officer after; of whom, the first that takes knowledge, is the
Sexten that buries them who buries them in obliuio^ too? For the^ do but fill
up the number of the dead in the Bill, but we shall never hear their Names,
till we read them in the Book of life, with our own. How many are sicker
(perchance) then I, and thrown into Hospitals, where, (as a fish left upon the
Sand, must stay the tide) they must stay the Phisicians hour of visiting, and
then can be but visited? How many are sicker (perchance) then all we, and
have not this Hospital to cover them, not this straw, to lie in, to die in,
but have their Graue-stone under them and breathe out their souls in the
ears, and in the eyes of passengers, harder then their bed, the flint of the
stre^t^ That taste of no part of our Physic, but a sparing diet; to whom
ordinary porridge would be Iulip enough, the refuse of our servants, Bezar
enough, and the off scou^ing of our Kitchen tables, Cordial enough. O my
soul, when thou art not enough awake, to bless thy God enough for his
plentiful mercy, in affoording thee many Helpers, rememb^r how many lack
them, and help them to them, or to those other things, which they lack as
much as them.

7. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, thy blessed Servant Augustine begged of thee, that Moses might
come and tell him what he^ meant by some place of Genesis: May I ha^^ leave to
ask of the Spirit, that writ the Book, why when D^^uid expected news fi^^
Ioabs army, 2 Samuel 18 25.
and that the Watchman told him that he saw a man ru^^ning alone, David
conclu^ded out of that circumstance, So al, but our Translation takes it. Even
Burcdorf. and Schindler.
That if he ca^^ alone, he brought (...) news? I see the Gra^^mar, the word
signify so, and is so ever accep^ted, Good news; but I see not the Logique,
nor the Rhetorique, how David would prove, or persuade that his news was
good, because he was alone, except a greater company might have made great
impressions of danger, by imploring, and importuning present supplies.
Howsoever that be, I am sure, that that which thy Apostle says to Timothy,
2.4.11.
Only Luke is with me, Luke, and no body but Luke^ has a taste of complaint,
and sorrow in it^ Though Luke want no testimony of ability, o^ forwardnes, of
constancy, and perseverance, in assisting that great building which S. Paul
labored in, yet S. Paul is affected with that, that there was none but Luke, to
assist^ We take S. Luke to have bin a Phisician, and it admits the application
the better, that in the presence of one good Phisician, we may be glad of
more. It was not only a civil spirit of policy, or order that moved Moses
father in law, to persuade him to divide ^he burden of Government, Exodus 18 13.
and Judicature, with others, and take others to his assistance, but it was
^lso thy immediate spirit O my God, that moved Moses to present unto ^hee 70 of
the Elders of Israel, Number. 11 16.
to receive of that spirit, which was upon Moses only before, such ^ portion
as might ease ^im in the government of that people; though Moses alone had
indowments above all thou gave him other assistants. I consider the
plentiful goodness, (...) my God, in employing Angels, more then on^ in so
many of thy remarkable works. O^ thy Son, thou say, Heb. 1.6
I^ all the Angels of God w^^^ship him; If that be i^ Heaven, upon Earth, h^^
says that he could co^^maund twelve legions (...) Angels; Mat. 26.53.
And when H^^uen, and Earth shall b^ all one, at the last day^ Thy Son, O
God, the S^^ of Man, Mat. 25.31.
shall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him. The Angels that
celebrated his birth to the Shepherds, Luc. 21.15.
the Angels that celebrated his second birth, his Resurrection to the Mary's,
were in the plural, Io. 20.12.
Angels associated with Angels. Genesis 28.12.
In Jacobs ladder, they which ascended and descended, and maintained the trade
between Heaven and Earth, between thee and us, they who have the Commission,
Psa. 91.13.
and charge to guide us in all our ways, they wh^^ hastened Lot, Genesis 19.15.
and in him^ us, from places of danger, and tentation, the^ who are appointed
to instruct and govern us in the Church here, Apo. 1.20.
they who are sent to punish the disobedient and refractar^^, Apo. 8.2.
they that are to be the Mowers, Mat. 13.39.
and harvest me^, after we are grown ^p in one field, the church, (...) the
day of Judgment, they that are to carry o^^ souls whither they ca^^^ed
Lazarus, Luc. 16.22.
they who attend at the several gate^ of the new Jerusalem, Apoc. 21.12.
to admit us there; all these, who administer to thy servants, from the first,
to their last, are Angels, Angels in the plural, in every service, Angels
associated with Angels. The power of a single Angel we see in that one, who
in one night destroyed almost 200. thousand in Sennacheribs army, 1. Reg. 19.35.
yet thou often imployest many; as we know the power of salvation is abundantly
in any one Evangelist, and yet thou have afforded us four. Luc. 4.18.
Thy Son pro^claimes of himself, the thy Spirit, has annoynte^ him to
preach the Gospel^^ yet he has given othe^s for the perfiting of the S. in the
work of the Mi^^^stery. Ephesians. 4.11.
Thou have made him Bishop of our souls, 1. Pet 2.25.
but there are others Bi^shops too. He gave the holy Ghost, Io. 20.22.
and others gave it also. Thy way, O m^ God, (and, O my God, tho^ love to
walk in thine own ways, for they are large) thy way from the beginning, is
multiplication of thy helps; and therefore it were a degree of ingratitude, not
to accept this mercy of affording me many helps for my bodily health, as a
type and earnest of thy gracious purpose now, and ever, to afford me the same
assistances. That for thy great Help, thy Word, I may seek that, not from
corners, nor Conuenticles, nor schismatical singularities, but from the
assotiation, and communion of thy Catholic Church, and those persons, whom
thou has^ always furnished the Church withal: And that I may associate the
Word, with thy Sacr^^ment, thy Seal with thy Patent; and in that S^^crame^t
associate the sig^^ with the thing signified, the Bread with the Bod^ of thy
Son, so, as I man be sure to have receiu^^ both, and to be ma^^ thereby, (as
thy blesse^ servant Augustine says) the Arc, and the Mon^^ment, and the Tomb
of the most blessed Son, that he, and all the merits of his death, may, by
that receiving, be buried in me, to my quickening in thi^ world, and my
immortal establishing in the next.

7. PRAYER.
O Eternal, and most gracious God, who gave to thy servants in the
wilderness, thy Man^a, bread so conditiond, qualified so, as that, to every man,
Manna tasted like that, which that man liked best, I humbly beseech thee, to
make this correction, which I acknowledge to be part of my daily bread, to taste
so to me, not as I would, but as thou would have it taste, and to conform my
taste, and make it agreeable to thy will^ Thou would have the corrections taste
of hum^^liation, but thou would have them taste ^ consolation too; taste o^
danger, but taste of ass^^rance too. As therefore thou have imprinted in all
thine Elements, of which our bodies consist, two manifest qualities, so that,
as thy fire dries, so it heats too; and as thy water moysts, so it cooles too,
so, O Lord, in these corrections, which are the elements of our regeneration,
by which our souls are made thine, imprint thy two qualities, those two
operations, that as they scourge us, they may scourge us into the way to thee:
that when they have showed us, that we are nothing in our selves, they may also
show us, that thou art all things unto us. When therefore in this particular
circumstance, O Lord (but none of thy judgments are circumstances; they are
all of the substance of thy good purpose upon vs^ when in this particular, that
he, who^ thou has^ sent to assist me, desires assistants to him, thou have let
me see, in how few hours thou cans^ throw me beyond the help of man, let me
by the same light see, that no vehimence of sickness, no tentation of Satan, no
guiltines of sin, no prison of death, not this first, this sick bed, not the
other prison, the close and dark grave, can remove me from the determined, and
good purpose, which tho^ sealed concerning me. Let me think no degree of this
thy correction, casual, or without signification; but yet when I have read it
in that language, as it is a correction, let me translate it into another, and
read it as a mercy; and which of these is the Original, and which is the
Translation, whether thy Mercy, or thy Correction, were thy primary, and
original inte^tion in this sickness, I cannot conclude, though death conclud^
me; for as it must necessarily appear to be ^ correction, so I can hau^ no
greater argument o^ thy mercy, then to die i^ thee, and by that death, to be
united to him, who died for me.

8. Et Rex ipse suum mittit. The King sends his own Phisician.
8. MEDITATION.
Still when we return to that Meditation, that Man, is a World, we find new
discoueries. Let him be a world, and him self will be the land, and misery the
sea. His misery, (for misery is his, his own; of the happinesses even of this
world, h^e is but tenant, but of misery the freeholder; of happiness he is but
the farmer, but the vsufructuary but of misery, the Lord, the proprietary) his
misery, as the sea, swells above all the hills, and reaches to the remotest
parts of this earth, Man; who of himself is bu^ dust, and coagula^ed and
kneaded into earth; by tears, his ma^te^ is ^arth, his form, misery. In this
world, that is Mankind, the highest ground, the emine^test hills, are kings;
and have they line, and lead enough to fadome this sea, and say, My misery is
but this deep? Scarce any misery equal to sickness; and they are subject to
that equally, with their lowest subject. A glass is not the less brittle,
because a Kings face is represented in it, nor a King the less brittle,
because God is represented in him. They have Phisicians continually about them,
and therefore sicknesses, or the worst of sicknesses, continual fear of it.
Are they gods? He that called them so, cannot flatter. They are Gods, but sick^
gods; and God is presented to us under many human affections, as fa^ as
infirmities; God is called angry, and sorry, and weary, and heavy; bu^ never a
sick God: for then he might die like men, as our gods do. The worst that they
could say in reproach, and scorn^ of the gods of the Heathen, was, that
perchance they were asleep; but Gods that are so sick, as that they cannot
sleep; are in an infirmer condition. A God, and need a Phisician? A Jupiter
and need an Aesulapius? that must have Rh^ubarbe to purge his Choler, lest he
be too angry, and Agarick to purge his s^^gme, lest he be too drowsy; that as
Tertullian says of the Egyptian gods, plants and herbs, That God was
beholden to Man, for growing in his garden, so we must say of these gods^
Their eternity, ( an eternity of threescore and ten years) is in the
Apothecaryes shop, and not in the Metaphorical Deity. But their Deitye is
betten expressed in their humility, then in their ^eighth; when abounding and
ouerflowing, as God, in means of doing good, they descend, as God, to a
communication of their abunda^ces with men, according to their necessities,
then they are Gods. No man is well, that understands not, that values not his
being well; that has not a cheerfulness, and a joy in it; and whosoever has
this Joy, has a desire to communicate, to propagate that, which occasions his
happiness, and his Joy, to others; for every man loves witnesses of his
happiness; and the best witnesses, are experimental witnesses; they who have
tasted of that in themselves, which makes us happy: It consummate^ therefore,
it perfits the happiness of Kings, to confer, to transfer, honor, and riches,
and (as they can) health, upon those that need them.

.8 EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, may God, I have a warning from the Wise man, Ecclus. 13.23.
tha^ when a rich man speaks, every man holds his tong^ and look what he
says, they extol it to the clouds; but if a poor man speak, they say, what
fellow is this? And if he stumble, they will help to overthrow him. Therefore
may my words be undervalued, and my errors aggrauated, if I offer to speak of
Kings; but not by thee, O my God, because I speak of them as they are in thee,
and of thee, as thou art in them. Certainly those men prepare a way of speaking
negligently, or irreuerently of thee, that give themselves that liberty, in
speaking of thy Vicegerents, Kings: Augustus,
for thou who gave Augustus the Empire, gave it to Nero to, and as
Vespasian had it from thee, so had Julian; Though Kings deface in themselves
thy first image, in their own soul, thou give no man leave to deface thy
second Image, imprinted indelibly in their power. But thou know, O God, that
if I should be slack in celebrating thy mercies to me exhibited by that
royal Instrument^ my Sou^raigne, to many other faults, that touch upon
Allegiance, I should add the worst of all, Ingratitude; which consti^utes an il
man, and faults which are defects in any particular sunction, are not so great,
as those that destroy our humanitie^ It is not so ill, to be an ill subject,
as to be an ill man^ for he has an universal illness, ready to blow^ and
power out it self into any mold, any form, and to spend it self in any
function. As therefore thy Son did upon the Coin, I look upon the King, and I
ask^ whose image, and whose inscription he has; and he has thine; And I give
unto thee, that which i^ thine, I recommend his happiness to thee, in al^ my
sacrifices of thanks, for that which he enioyes, and in all my prayers, for the
continuance and enlargement of the^ But let me stop, my G^d, and consider; will
no^ this look like a piece of art, and cunning, to convey into the world an
opinion, that I were more particularly in his care, then other men? And that
herein, in a a show of humility, and thankfulness, I magnify my self more
then there is cause? But let not that jealousy stopp me, O God, but let me go
forward in celebrating thy mercy exhibited by him. This which he does now, in
assisting so my bodily health, I know is common to me with many? Many, many^
have tasted of that expression of his gracio^snes. Where he ^an give health by
his own hands, he doth^ and to more then any of his predecessors have done:
Therefore has God reserved one diseas^ for him, that he only might cure it,
though perchance not only by one Title, and Interest, nor only as one king. To
those that need it not, in that kind, and so cannot have it by his own hand,
he sends a donatiue of health, in sending his Phisician: The holy King S. Lewis
in France, and our Maud is celebrated for that, that perso^ally they visited
Hospitals, and assisted in the Cure, even of loathsome Diseases. And when that
religious Empress Placilla, the wife of Theodosius was told, that she
diminished her self to much in those personal assistances, and might do
enough in sending ^eliefe, she said, She would send in that capacity, as
Empress, but she would go to, in that capacity, as a Christian, as a fellow
member of the body o^ thy Son, with them. 2 Samuel 19.12.
So thy servant David applies him self to his people, so he incorporates
himself in his people, by calling them his brethren, his bones, his flesh; and
when they fell under thy hand, even to the pretermitting of himself, he presses
upon thee, by praye^ for them; 2 Samuel 24.^^.
I have si^^ned, but these sheep what have they done? let thine hand I pray
thee be against me and against my fathers house. It is kingly to give; v. 17.
when Araumah gave that great, and free present to David, that place, those
instruments for sacrifice, and the sacrifices themselves, it is said there, by
thy Spirit, Al these things did Araumah give, as a King, to the King. To give
is an approaching to the Condition of Kings, but to give health, an approaching
to the King, of Kings, to thee. But this his assisting to my bodily health,
thou know O God, and so do some others of thine Honorable servants know, is
bu^ the twy-light, of that day, wherein thou^ through him, have shind upon me
before; but the Echo of that voice, whereby thou, through him, have spoke to
me before; Then, when he, first of any man conceived a hope, that I might be
of some use in thy Church, and descended to an intimation, to a persuasion,
almost to a solicitatio^, that I would embrace that calling. And thou who had
put that desire into his heart, did also put into mine, an obedience to it;
and I who was sick before, of a vertiginous giddines, and irresolution, and
almost spent all my time in consulting how I should spend it, was by this man
of God, and God of men, put into the poole, and recouerd: when I asked,
percha^ce, a stone, he gave me bread, when I asked, percha^ce, a Scorpion, he
gave me a fish; when I asked a temporal office, he denied not, refused not
that, but let me see, that he had rather I took this. These things, thou O
God, who forgettest nothing, have not forgot, though perchance, he, because
they were benefits, has; but I am not only a witness, but an instance, 2
Chro. 14.8.
that ou^ Iehosophat has a care to ordain Priests, as well as Judges: and not
only to send Phisicians for temporal, but to be the Phisician for spiritual
health.

8. PRAYER.
O Eternal and most gracious God, who though thou have reserved thy tresure of
perfect joy, and perfect glory, to be given by thine own hands then, when by
seeing thee, as thou art in thy self, and knowing thee, as we are known, we
shall possess in an instant, and possess for ever, all that can any way
co^duce to our happinesses, yet here also in this world, give us such
earnests of that full payment, as by the value of the earnest, we may give some
estimat of the tresure, humbly, and tha^kfully I acknowledge, that thy blessed
spirit instructs me, to make a difference of thy blessings in this world, by
that difference of the Instruments, by which it has pleased thee to derive
them unto me. As we see thee here in a glass, so we receive from thee here by
reflection, and by instruments. Even casual things come from thee; and that
which we call Fortune here, has another name above. Nature reaches out her
hand, and gives us corn, and wine, and oil, and milk, but thou fillest her
hand before, and thou openest her hand, that she may rain down her showers upon
us. Industry reaches out her hand to us, and gives us fruits of our labor, for
our selves, and our posterity; but thy hand guides that hand, when it sowes,
and when it waters, and the increase is from thee. Friends reach out their
hands, and prefer us, but thy hand supports that hand, that supports us. Of all
these thy instruments have I received thy blessing, O God, but bless thy name
most for the greatest; that as a member of the public, and as a partaker of
private favors too, by thy right hand, thy powerful hand set, over us, I have
had my portion, not only in the hearing, but in the preaching of thy Gospel.
Humbly beseeching thee, that as thou continuest thy wonted goodness upon the
whole world, by the wonted means, and instruments, the same Sun, and Moon, the
same Nature, and Industry, so to continue the same blessings upon this State,
and this Church by the same hand, so long, as that thy Son when he comes in the
clouds, may find him, or his Son, or his sons sons ready to give an
account, and able to stand in that judgment, for their faithful Stewardship,
and dispensation of thy tale^ts so abu^dantly committed to them; and be to him,
O God, in all diste^pers of his body, in all anxieties of spirit, in all holy
sadnesses of soul, such a Phisician in thy proportion, who art the greatest in
heaven, as he has bin in soul, and body to me, in his proportion, who is the
greatst upon earth.

9. Medicamina scribu^t. Upon their Consultation, they prescribe.
9. MEDITATION.
THey have seen me, and heard me, arraigned me in these fetters, and
received the evidence; I have cut up mine own Anatomy, diffected my self, and
they are gone to read upon me. O how manifold, and perplexed a thing, nay, how
wanton and various a thing is ruin and destruction? God presented to David
three kinds, War, Famine, and Pestilence; Satan left out these, and brought in,
fires from heaven, and winds from the wilderness. If there were no ruin but
sickness, we see, the Masters of that Art, can scarce number, not name all
sicknesses; every thing that disorders a faculty, and the function of that is a
sickness: The names will not serve the^ which are given from the place
affected, the Pluris^^ is so; nor from the effect which it works, the falling
sickness is so; they cannot have names ynow, from what it does, nor where it is,
but they must extort names from what it is like, what it resembles, and b^t in
some one thing, or else they would lack names; for the Wolf, and the Canker, and
the Polypus are so; and that question, whether there be more names or things,
is as perplexd in sicknesses, as in any thing else; except it be easily resolud
upon that side, that there are more sicknesses the^ names. If ruin were
reduced to that one way, that Man could perish noway but by sickness, yet his
danger were infinite; and if sickness were reduced to that one way, that there
were no sickness but a fever, yet the way were infinite still; for it would
ouerlode, and oppress any natural, disorder and discompose any artificial
Mem^ry, to deliver the names of several Fevers; how intricate a work then
have they, who ar^ gone to consult, which of these sicknesses mine is, and then
which of these fevers, and then what it would do, and the^ how it may be
countermind. But even in ill, it is a degree of good, when the evil will admit
consultation. In many diseases, that which is but an accident, but a symptom of
the main disease, is so violent, that the phisician must attend the cure of
that, though he pretermi^ (so far as to intermi^) the cure of the disease it
self. Is it not so in States too? sometimes the insole^cy of those that are
great, put the people into commotions; the great disease, and the greatest
danger to the Head, is the insolency of the great ones; and yet, they execute
Martial law, they come to present executions upon the people, whose commotion
was indeed but a simptom, but an accident of the maine disease; but this
symptom, grown so violent, would allow no time for a consultatio^. Is it not so
in the accidents of the diseases of our mind too? Is it not evidently so in our
affections, in our passions? If a choleric man be ready to strike, must I go
about to purge his choler, or to break the blow? But where there is room for
consultatio^, things are not desperate. They consult; so there is nothing
rashly, inco^sideratly done; and then they prescribe, the^ write, so there is
nothing covertly, disguisedly, vnavowedly done. In bodily diseases it is not
always so; sometimes, as soon as the Phisicians foot is in the chamber, his
knife is in the patients arm; the disease would not allow a minutes forbearing
of blood, nor prescribing of other remedies. In States and matter of government
it is so too; they are sometimes surprizd with such accide^ts, as that the
Magistrate asks not what may be done by law, but does that, which must
necessarily be don in that case But it is a degree of good, in evil, a degree
that ca^ies hope and comfort in it, when we may have r^^course to that which is
written, and that the proceedings may be apert, and ingenuous, and candid, and
auowable, for that gives satisfaction, and acquiescence. They who have received
my Anatomy of my self, consult, and end their consultatio^ in prescribing, and
in prescribing Physic; proper and convenient remedy: for if they should come in
again, and chide me, for some disorder, that had occasioned, and inducd, or
that had hastened and exalted this sickness, or if they should begin to write now
rules for my diet, and exercise when I were well, this were to antidate, or to
postdate their Consultation, not to give physic. It were rather a vexation,
then a relief, to tell a condemnd prisoner, you might have lived if you had
done this; and if you can get your pardon, you shall do well, to take this, or
this course hereafter. I am glad they know (I have hid nothing from them) glad
they consult, (they hide nothing from one another) glad they write (they hide
nothing from the world) glad that they write and prescribe Physic, that there
are remedies for the present case.

9. EXPOSTVLATION.
My God, my God, allow me a just indignation, a holy detestation of the
insole^cy of that Man, who because he was of that high ra^ke, of who^ thou have
said, They are gods, thought himself more then equal to thee; That king of
Aragon Alfonsus, so perfect in the motions of the heavenly bodies, as that he
adventured to say, That if he had bin of council with thee, in the making of
the heavens, the the heavens should have bin disposed in a better order, then
they are. 2. Chro. 25.16.
The king Amasiah would not endure thy prophet to reprehend him, but asked him
in anger, Art thou made of the kings councell^ When thy Prophet Esaias asks
that question who has directed the spirit of the Lord, 42.13.
or being his councellor has tought him. It is after he had settled and
determined that office, upon thy son, and him only, when he ioyns with those
great Titles, The mighty God, 9.6.
and the prince of peace, this also, the Councellor; and after he had settled
upon him, the spirit of might, and of council. 11.2.
So that the^, thou O God, though thou have no council from Man, yet do
nothing upon man, without council; In the making of Man there was a
consultation; let us make man. Genesis 1.26.
In the preserving of Man, O thou great preserver (...) men, Job.
thou proceededst by council; for all thy external works, are the works of
the whole Trinity, and their hand is to every action. How much more must I
apprehend, that al you bles^sed, and glorious persons of the Trinity are in
Consultation now, what you will do with this in firm body, with this leprous
Soul, that attends, guiltily, but yet comfortably, your determination upon it.
I offer not to counsel them, who meet in consultatio^ for my body now, but I
open my in^^rmities, I anatomise my body to them. So I do my soul to thee, O
my God, in an humble confession, That there is no vein in me, that is not
full of the blood of thy Son, who^ I have crucified, and Crucified again, by
multiplying many, and often repeating the same sins that there is no Artery
in me, 1. Tim. 4.1.
that has not the spirit of error, Ose. 4.12
the spirit of lust, the spirit of giddines in it^ Esa. 19.14.
no bone in me that is not hardened with the custo^e of sin, and nourished, and
soupled with the marrow of sin; no sinews, no ligame^ts, that do not tie, and
chain sin and sin together. Yet, O blessed and glorious Trinity, O holy, and
whole College, and yet but one Phisician, if you take this confession into a
consult^^^on, my case is not desp^rate my destruction is not decreed; If your
consultation determine in writing, if you refer me to that which is written,
you intend my recovery: for all the way, O my God, (ever constant to thine own
ways) thou have proceeded openly, intellig^bly, manifestly, by the book. From
thy first book, the book of life, neue^ shut to thee, but never thoroughly open
to us; from thy second book, the book of Nature, where though subobscurely, and
in shadows, thou have expressed thine own Image; from thy third book; the
Scriptures, where thou had written all in the Old, and then lightedst us a
ca^dle to read it by, in the New Testament; To these thou had added the book
of just, and useful Laws, established by them, to whom thou have committed
thy people; To those, the Manualls, the pocket, the bosom books of our own
Consciences, To those thy partcular books of all our particular sins; and to
those, the Book with seven seals, which only the Lamb which was slain, was
found worthy to open; Apoc. 7.1.
which, I hope, it shall not disagree with the meaning of thy blessed Spirit,
to interpre^e, the promulgation of their pardon, and righteousness, who are
washed in the blood of that Lamb; And if thou refer me to these Books, to a
new reading, a new trial by these bookes^ this fever may be but a burning in
the hand, and I may be saved, though not by my book, mine own conscience, nor by
thy other books, yet by thy first, the book of life, thy decree for my
election, and by thy last, the book of the Lamb, and the shedding of his blood
upon me; If I be still under co^sultation, I am not condemned yet; if I be sent
to these books I shall not be condemned at all: for, though there be something
written in some of those books (particularly in the Scripture) which some men
turn to poison, yet upon these consultations (these confessions, these takings
of our particular cases, into thy consideration) thou intendest all for
physic, and even from those Sentences, from which a too^late Repenter will
suck desperation, he that seeks thee early, shall receive thy morning dew, thy
seasonable mercy, thy forward consolation.

9. PRAYER.
O Eternal and most gracious God, who art of so pure eyes, as that thou can
not look upon sin, and we of so vnpure constitutions, as that we can present
no object but sin, and therefore might justly ^eare, that thou would turn
thine eyes for ever from us, as, though we cannot endure afflictions in our
selves, yet in thee we can^ so though thou can not endure sin in us, yet in
^hy Son thou can, and he has taken upon him se^fe, and presented to thee,
al those sins, which might displease thee in us. There is an Eye in Nature,
that kills, as soon as it sees, the eye of a Serpent; no eye in Nature, that
nourishes us by looking upon us; But thine Eye, O Lord, does so. Look
therefore upon me, O Lord, in this distress, and that will recall me from the
borders of this bodily death; Look upon me, and that will raise me again from
that spiritual death, in which my parents buried me, when they begot me in
sin, and in which I have pierced even to the laws of hell, by multiplying
such heaps of actual sins, upon that foundation, that root of original sin.
Yet take me again, into your Consultation, O blessed and glorious Trinity; and
though the Father know, that I have defaced his Image received in my Creation;
though the Son know, I have neglected mine interest in the Redemption, yet, O
blessed spirit, as thou art to my Conscience, so be to them a witness, that at
this minute, I accept that which I have so often, so often, so rebelliously
refused, thy blessed inspirations; be thou my witness to them, that at more
poores then this slack body sweates tears, this sad soul weeps blood; and
more for the displeasure of my God, then for the stripes of his displeasure.
Take me then, O blessed, and glorious Trinity, into a Reco^sultation, and
prescribe me any physic; If it be a long, and painful holding of this soul
in sickness, it is physic, if I may discern thy hand to give it, and it is
physic, if it be a speedy departing of this Soul, if I may discern thy hand
to receive it.

10. Lent and Serpenti satagunt occurrere Morbo. They find the Disease to
steal on insensibly, and endeavor to meet with it so.
10. MEDITATION.
THis is Natures nest of Boxes; The Heavens contain the Earth, the Earth,
Cities, Cities, Men. And all these are Concentrique; the common center to them
all, is decay, ruin; only that is Ecoentrique, which was never made, only that
place, or garment rather, which we can imagine, but not demonstrate, That
light, which is the very emanation of the light of God, in which the Saints
shall dwell, with which the Saints shall be appareld, only that bends not to
this Center, to Ruin; that which was not made of Nothing, is not threatened
with this annihilation. All other things are; even A^gels, eue^ our souls;
they move upon the same poles, they bend to the same Center; and if they were
not made immortal by preservation, their Nature could not keep them from
sinking to this center, Annihilation. In all these (the frame of the heuens,
the States upon earth, and Men in them, comprehend all) Those are the greatest
mischifs, which are least discerned; the most insensible in their ways come to
be the most sensible in their ends. The Heavens have had their Dropsy, they
drowned the world, and they shall have their Fever, and burn the world. Of the
dropsy, the flood, the world had a foreknowledge 120 years before it came;
and so some made provision against it, and were sau^d^ the fever shall break
out in an instant, and consume all; The dropsy did no harm to the heavens,
from whence it fell, it did not put out those lights, it did not quench those
heates; but the fever, the fire shall burn the furnace it self, annihilate
those heavens, that b^eath it out; Though the Dog-Starre have a pestilent
breath, an infectious exhalation, yet because we know when it will rise, we
clo^he our selves, and we die^ our selves, and we shadow our selves to a
sufficient preue^tion; but Comets and blazing stars, whose effects, or
significations no man can interrupt or frustrat, no man foresaw: no Almanac
tells us, when a blazing star will bre^k out, the matter is carried up in
secret; no Astrologer tells us when the effects will be accomplishd, for that's a
secret of a higher sphere, then the other; and that which is most secret, is
most dangerous. It is so also here in the societies of men, in States, and
Commo^wealths. Twenty rebellious drums make not so dangerous a noise, as a few
whisperers, and secret plotters in corners. The Canon does not so much hurt
against a wall, as a Mine under the wall; nor a thousand enemies that threaten,
so much as a few that take an oath to say nothing. God knew many heavy sins of
the people, in the wilderness and after, but still he charges the^ with that
one, with Murmuring, murmuring in their hearts, secret disobediences, secre^
repugn^nces against his declared will; and th^se are the most deadly, the most
pernicious. And it is so to, with the diseases of the body; and that is my
case. The pulse, the urine, the sweat, all have sworn to say nothing, to give
no Indication of any dangerous sickness. My forces are not enfeebled, I find
no decay in my strength; my provisions are not cut off, I find no abhorring in
mine appetite; my counsels are not corrupted nor infatuated, I find no false
apprehe^sions, to work upon mine vndersta^ding^ and yet they see, that
inuisibly, and I feel, that insensibly the disease preuailes. The disease has
established a Kingdom, an Empire in me, and will have certain Arcana
Imperij, secrets of State, by which it will proceed, and not be bound to
declare them. But yet against those secret conspiracies in the State, the
Magistrate has the ra^k^ and against these insensible diseases, Phisicians
have their examiners; and those these employ now.

10. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, I have bin told, and told by relation, by her own brother,
that did it, by thy servant Nazianzen, that his Sister in the veheme^cy of her
prayer, did use to threaten thee, with a holy importunity, with a pious
impudency. I dare not do so, O^ God; but as thy servant Augustine, wished that
Adam had not sinned, therefore that Christ might not have died, may I not to
this one purpose wish, Josephus.
That if the Serpent before the tentation of Eve, did go upright, and speak,
that he did so still, because I should the sooner hear him, if he spoke, the
sooner see him, if he went upright? In his curse, I am cursed too; his creeping
undoes me: for howsoever he begin at the heel, and do but bruise that;
Iere. 9.21
yet he, and Death in him is come into our windows; into our Eyes, and Ears,
the entra^ces, and inlets of our soul. He works upon us in secret, and we do
not discern him; And one great work of his upon us, is to make us so like
himself, as to sin in secret, that others may not see us; But his Masterpiece
is, to make us sin in secret so, as that we may not see our selus sin. For the
first, the hiding of our sins from other men, he has induo'd that, which was
his offspring from the beginning, Io. 8.44.
A lie: for man, is in Nature, yet, in posses^ion of some such sparks of
ingenuitie, and nobleness, as that, but to disguise Evil, he would not lie.
The body, the sin, is the Serpents, and the garment that couers it, the lie,
is his too. These are his; but the hiding of sin from our selves, is He
himself: when we have the sting of the Serpent in us, and do not sting our
selves, the venim of sin, and no remorse for sin, then, as thy blessed Son
said of Judas, He is a devil, Ioh. 6.70
not that he had one, but was one, so we are become devils to our selves, and
we have not only a Serpent in our bosom, but we our selves, are to our selves
that Serpent. How far did thy servant David press upon thy pardon, in that
petition, Ps. 19.12
Cleanse thou me from secret sins? can any sin be secret? for, a great part of
our sins, though, says thy Prophet, we conceive them in the dark, upon ou^
bed, yet says he, We do them in the light; there are many sins, which we
glory in doing, and would not do, if no body should know the^. Thy blessed
servant August confesses, that he was ashamed of his shamefastnes, and
tenderness of Conscience, and that he often be lied himself with sins, which
he never did, lest he should be unacceptable to his sinful companions. But if
we would conceal them, (thy Pr^phet found such a desire, and such a practice
in some, when he said, Esaias 47.10.
Thou have trusted in thy wickedkednes, and thou have said, None shall see me)
yet can we conceal the^? Thou O God, can hear of them by others; The voice
of Abels blood, Genesis 4.10.
will tell thee of Cains murder; the Heavens themselves will tell thee Heaven
shall reveal his iniquity; Ier. 20.27.
a small creature alone, shall do it, Eccle. 10.20.
A bird of the air shall carry the voice, and tell the matter: Thou will
trouble no Informer, thou thy self reuealedst Adams sin, Genesis 3.8.
to thy self; And the manifestation of sin is so full to thee, Eccles. 12.14.
as that thou shall reveal all to all, Thou shall bring every work to
Judgment, with every secret thing, and there is nothing covered, that shall
not be revealed: Mat. 10.26.
But, O my God, there is another way of knowing my sins, which thou love
better then any of these; To know them by my Confession. As Physic works so,
it draws the peccant humor to it self, that when it is gathered together,
the weight of it self may carry that humor away, so thy Spirit returns to my
Memory my former sins, that being so recollected, they may power out
them^elues by Confession. When I kept silence, says thy servant David, day,
and night, thy hand was heavy upon me, Psalm. 32.34.
But when I said, 8.5.
I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord, thou forgauest the iniquity
of my sin. Thou interpretest the very pu^pose of Confession so well, as that
thou scarce leauest any new Mercy for the action it self. This Mercy thou
leauest, that thou armest us thereupon, against relapses into the sins which
we have confessed. And that mercy, which thy servant Augustine apprehends,
when he says to thee, Thou have forgiven me those sins which I have done,
and those sins which only by thy grace I have not done: they were done in our
inclination to them, and even that inclination needs thy mercy, and that Mercy
he calls a Pardon. And these are most truly secret sins, because they were
never done, and because no other man, nor I my self, but only thou know,
how many and how great sins I have escaped by thy grace, which without that, I
should have multiplied against thee.

10. PRAYER.
O Eternal, and most gracious God, who as thy Son Christ Jesus, though he
knew all things, yet said he knew not the day of Judgment, because he knew it
not so, as that he might tell it us; so though thou know all my sins, yet
thou know them not to my comfort, except thou know them by my telling them
to th^e, how shall I bring to thy knowledge by that way, those sins, which I my
self know not? If I accuse my self of Original sin, will thou ask me if I
know what original sin is? I know not enough of it to satisfy others, but I
know enough to condemn my self, and to solicit thee. If I confess to thee the
sins of my youth, will thou ask me, if I know what those sins were? I know
them not so well, as to name them all, nor am sure to live hours enough to
name them al, (for I did the^ then, faster then I can speak them now, when
every thing that I did, conduced to some sin) but I know the^ so well, as to
know, that nothing but thy mercy is so infinite as they. If the naming of
Sins, of Thought, Word, and Deed, of sins of Omission, and of Action, of
sins against thee, against my neighbor, and against my self, of sins
unrepented, and sins relapsed into after Repentance, of sins of Ignorance,
and sins against the testimony of my Conscience, of sins against thy
Commandments, sins against thy Sons Prayer, and sins against our own
Creed, of sins against the laws of that Church, and sins against the laws of
that State, in which thou have given me my station, If the naming o^ these
sins reach not home to all mine, I know what will; O Lord pardon me, me, all
those sins, which thy Son Christ Jesus suffered for, who suffered for all
the sins of all the world; for there is no sin amongst all those which had
not been my sin, if thou had not been my God, and antidated me a pardon in
thy preventing grace. And since sin in the nature of it, retains still so
much of the author of it, that it is a Serpent, insensibly insinuating it
self, into my Soul, let thy brazen Serpent, (the contemplation of thy Son
crucified for me) be evermore present to me, for my recovery against the sting
of the first Serpent; That so, as I have a Lion against a Lion, The Lion of the
Tribe of Judah, against that Lion, that seeks whom he may devour, so I may
have a Serpent against a Serpent, the Wisdom of the Serpent, against the
Malice of the Serpent, And, both against that Lion, and Serpent, forcible, and
subtle tentations, Thy Dove with thy Olive, in thy Arc, Humility, and Peace,
and Reconciliation to thee, by the ordinances of thy Church^ Amen.

11. MEDITATION.
WHence can we take a better argument, a clearer d^monstration, that all the
Greatness of this world, is built upon opinion of others, and has in it self no
real being, nor power of subsistence, then from the heart of man? It is
always in Action, and motion, still busy, still pretending to do all, to
furnish all the powers, and faculties with all that they have; But if an ^nemy
dare rise up against it, it is the soonest endangered, the soonest defeated of
any part. The Brain will hold out longer then it, and the Liver longer then
that; They will endure a Siege; but an unnatural heat, a rebellious heat, will
blow up the heart, like a Mine, in a minute. But howsoever, since the Heart
has the birthright, and Primogeniture, and that it is Natures eldest Son in
us, the part which is first borne to life in man, and that the other parts, as
younger brethren, and servants in this family, have a dependence upon it, it is
reason that the principal care be had of it, though it be not the strongest
part; as the eldest is oftentimes not the strongest of the family. And since
the Brain, and Liver, and Heart, hold not a Triumuirate in Man, a Sovereignty
equally shed upon them all, for his well-being, as the four Elements do, for
his very being, but the Heart alone is in the Principality, and in the Throne,
as King, the rest as Subjects, though in eminent Place, and Office, must
contribute to that, as Children to their Parents, as all persons to all kinds
of Superiors, though oftentimes, those Parents, or those Superiors, be not
of stronger parts, then themselves, that serve and obey them that are weaker;
Neither does this Obligation fall upon us, by second Dictates of Nature, by
Consequences, and Conclusions arising out of Nature, or derived from Nature, by
Discourse, (as many things bind us, even by the Law of Nature, and yet not by
the primarie Law of Nature; as all Laws of Propriety in that which we
possess, are of the Law of Nature, which law is, To give every one his own,
and yet in the primarie law of Nature, there was no Propriety, no Meum and
Tuum, but an universal Community over all; So the obedience of Superiors, is
of the law of Nature, and yet in the primarie law of Nature, there was no
Superiority, no Magistracy;) but this contribution of assistance of all to
the Sovereign, of all parts to the Heart, is from the very first dictates of
Nature; which is in the first place, to have care of our own Preservation, to
look first to our selves; for therefore does the Phisician intermit the
present care of Brain, or Liver, because there is a possibility, that they
may subsist, though there be not a present and a particular care had of them,
but there is no possibility that they can subsist, if the Heart perish: and
so, when we seem to begin with others, in such assistances, indeed we do
begin with our selves, and we our selves are principally in our
contemplation; and so all these officious, and mutual assistances, are but
complements toward others, and our true end is our selves. And this is the
reward of the pains of Kings; sometimes they need the power of law, to be
obeyed; and when they seem to be obeyed voluntarily, they who do it, do it
for their own sakes. O how little a thing is all the greatness of man, and
through how false glasses does he make shift to multiply it, and magnify it to
himself? And yet this is also another misery of this King of man, the Heart,
which is also applyable to the Kings of this world, great men, that the venime
and poy^on of every pestilentiall disease directs it self to the heart,
affects that, (pernicious affection,) and the malignity of ill men, is also
directed upon the greatest, and the best; and not only greatness, but
goodness looses the vigor of being an Antidote, or Cordial against it. And
as the noblest, and most generous Cordialls that Nature or Art afford, or can
prepare, if they be often taken, and made familiar, become no Cordialls, nor
have any extraordinary operation, so the greatest Cordial of the Heart,
patience, if it be much exercised, exalts the venim and the malignity of the
Enemy, and the more we suffer, the more we are insulted upon. When God had
made this Earth of nothing, it was but a little help, that he had, to make
other things of this Earth: nothing can be nearer nothing, then this Earth; and
yet how little of this Earth, is the greatest Man? He thinks he treads upon
the Earth, that all is under his fe^te, and the Brain that thinks so, is but
Earth; his highest Region, the flesh that couers that, is but earth; and even
the top of that, that, wherein so many Absolons take so much pride, is but a
bush growing upon that Turfe of Earth. How little of the world is the Earth? And
yet that is all, that Man has, or is. How little of a Man is the Heart; and
yet it is all, by which he is: and this continually subject, not only to
foreign poisons, conveyed b^ others, but to intestine poisons bred in our
selves by pestilentiall sicknesses. O who, if before he had a being, he could
have sense of this misery, would buy a being here upon these conditions?

11. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, all that thou ask of me, Prou. 23.26.
is my Heart, My Son, give me thy heart; Am I thy son, as long as I have
but my heart? VVilt thou give me an Inheritance, a Filiation, any thing for my
heart? O thou, who saydst to Satan, Have thou considered my servant Job, Job.
1.8
that there is none like him upon the earth, shall my fear, shall my zeal,
shall my jealousy have leave to say to thee, Have thou considered my Heart,
that there is not so perverse a Heart upon earth; and would thou have that;
and shall I be thy Son, thy eternal Sons Coheire, for giving that? Ier. 17
9
The Heart is deceitful, above all things, and desperately wicked; who can
know it? He that asks that question, makes the answer, I the Lord search the
Heart. When did thou search mine? Do thou think to find it, as thou
made it in Adam? Thou have searched since, and found all these gradations in
the ill of our Hearts, Genesis 6.5
That every imagination, of the thoughts of our hearts, is only evil
continually. Do thou remember this, and would thou have my Heart? O God
of all light, I know thou know all; and it is Thou, Amos 4.14.
that declarest unto man, what is his Heart. Without thee, O Sovereign
goodness, I could not know, how ill my heart were. Thou have declared unto
me, in thy Word, That for all this deluge of evil, that has surrunded all
Hearts, yet thou soughtest and foundest a man after thine own heart, 1 Samuel 13
14.
That thou could and would give thy people Pastors according to thine
own heart; Ier. 3.15.
And I can gather out of thy Word, so good testimony of the hearts of men, as
to find single hearts, docile, and apprehensiue hearts; Hearts that can,
Hearts that have learnt; wise hearts, in one place, and in another, in a great
degree, wise, perfect hearts; straight hearts, no perverseness without, and
clean hearts, no foulness within; such hearts I can find in thy Word; and if
my heart were such a heart, I would give thee my Heart. But I find stony
hearts too, and I have made mine such: I have found Hearts, Ezech. 11 19.
that are snares; and I have conuersed with such; hearts that burn like Ouens;
Eccles. 7.26.
and the fuel of Lust, and Envy, and Ambition, has inflamed mine; Hearts in
which their Masters trust, And he that trusts in his own heart, Prou. 28.26.
is a fool; His confidence in his own moral Constancy, and civil
fortitude, will betray him, when thou shall cast a spiritual dampe, a
heaviness, and dei^ction of spirit upon him. I have found these Hearts, and a
worse then these, a Heart into the which the Devil himself is entered, Judas
heart. Io. 13.2.
The first kind of heart, alas, my God, I have not; The last are not Hearts to
be given to thee; What shall I do? Without that present I cannot be thy
Son, and I have it not. To those of the first kind, thou give ioyfulnes of
heart, Ecclus. 50.23.
and I have not that; To those of the other kind, thou give faintness of
heart: Leuit. 26 36.
And blessed be thou, O God, for that forbearance, I have not that yet. There
is then a middle kind of Hearts, not so pe^fit, as to be given, but that the
very giving, mends them: Not so desperate, as not to be accepted, but that the
very accepting dignifies them. Ios. 2.11.
This is a melting heart, and a troubled heart; and a wounded heart, and a
broken heart, and a contrite heart; and by the powerful working of thy
piercing spirit, such a Heart I have; Thy Samuel spoke unto all the house of
thy Israel, 1 Samuel 7.3.
and said, If you return to the Lord with all your hearts, prepare your hearts
unto the Lord. If my heart be prepared, it is a returning heart; And if thou
see it upon the way, thou will carry it ^ome; Nay, the preparation is thine
too; this melting, this wounding, this breaking, this contrition, which I have
now, is thy Way, to thy End; And those discomforts, are for all that, The
earnest of thy Spirit in my heart; 2. Cor. 1.22.
and where thou give earnest, thou will perform the bargain. Naball was
confident upon his wine, but in the morning his heart dyed within him; 1. Sam.
25.37.
Thou, O Lord, have given me Wormwood, and I have had some diffidence upon
that; and thon have cleared a Morning to me again, and my heart is alive.
Danids heart smote him, 24.5.
when he cut off the skirt from Saul; 1. Sam. 24.10.
and his heart smote him, when he had numbered his people: My heart has
struck me, when I come to number my sins; but that blow is not to death,
because those sins are not to death, but my heart lives in thee. But yet as
long as I remain in this great Hospital, this sick, this diseasefull world,
as long as I remain in this leprous house, this flesh of mine, this Heart,
though thus prepared for thee, prepared by thee, will still be subject to the
invasion of malign and pestilent vapors. But I have my Cordialls in thy
promise; 1. Reg. 8.38.
when I shall know the plague of my heart, and pray unto thee, in thy house,
thou will preserve that heart, from all mortal force, of that infection: And
the Peace of God, Phil. 4.7
which passes all understanding, shall keep my Heart and Mind through Christ
Jesus.

11. PRAYER.
O Eternal, and most gracious God, who in thy upper house, the Heavens, though
there be many Mansions, yet art alike, and equally in every Mansion, but here
in thy lower house, though thou fillest all, yet art otherwise in some rooms
thereof, then in others, otherwise in thy Church, then in my Chamber, and
otherwise in thy Sacraments, then in my Prayers, so though thou be always
present, and always working in every room of this thy House, my body, yet I
humbly beseech thee to manifest always a more effectual presence in my heart,
then in the other Offices. Into the house of thine Anointed, disloyal
persons, Traitors will come; Into thy House, the Church, Hypocrites, and
Idolatrers will come; Into some Rooms of this thy House, my Body, Tentations
will come, Infections will come, but be my Heart, thy Bedchamber, O my God,
and thither let them not enter. Job made a Covenant with his Eyes, but not his
making of that Covenant, but thy dwelling in his heart, enabled him to keep
that Covenant. Thy Son himself had a sadness in his Soul to death, and
he had a reluctation, a deprecation of death, in the approaches thereof; but
he had his Cordial too, Yet not my will, but thine be done. And as thou have
not delivered us, thine adopted sons, from these infectious tentations, so
neither have thou delivered us over to them, nor withheld thy Cordialls from
us. I was baptized in thy Cordial water, against Original sin, and I have
drunk of thy Cordial Blood, for my recovery, from actual, and habitual
sin in the other Sacrament. Thou, O Lord, who have imprinted all medicinal
virtues, which are in all creatures, and have made even the flesh of Vipers, to
assist in Cordialls, art able to make this present sickness, everlasting
health, this weakness, everlasting strength, and this very deiection, and
faintness of heart, a powerful Cordial. When thy blessed Son cried out to
thee, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me, thou did reach out thy
hand to him; but not to deliver his sad soul, but to receive his holy soul;
Neither did he longer desire to hold it of thee, but to recommend it to thee.
I see thine hand upon me now, O Lord, and I ask not why it comes, what it
intends: whether thou will bid it stay still in this Body, for some time, or
bidd it meet thee this day in Paradise, I ask not, not in a wish, not in a
thought: Infirmity of Nature, Curiosity of Mind, are tentations that offer;
but a silent, and absolute obedience, to thy will, even before I know it, is my
Cordial. Preserve that to me, O my God, and that will preserve me to thee;
that when thou have Catechized me with affliction here, I may take a greater
degree, and serve thee in a higher place, in thy kingdom of joy, and glory.
Amen.

12. -- Spirante Columba Supposita pedibus, Reuocantur ad ima vapores. They
apply Pigeons, to draw the vapors from the Head.
12. MEDITATION.
What will not kill a man, if a vapor will? how great an Elephant, how small a
Mouse destroys? to dye by a bullet is the Soldiers daily bread; but few men
dye by haile-shot: A man is more worth, then to be sold for single money; a
life to be valued above a trifle. If this were a violent shaking of the Air by
Thunder, or by Canon, in that case the Air is condensed above the thickness
of water, of water baked into Ice, almost petrified, almost made stone, and no
wonder that that kills; but that that which is but a vapor, and a vapor not
forced, but breathed, should kill, that our Nourse should ouerlay us, and Air,
that nourishes us, should destroy us, but that it is a half Atheism to
murmr against Nature, who is Gods immediate Commissioner, who would not think
himself miserable to be put into the hands of Nature, who does not only set
him up for a mark for others to shoot at, but delights her self to blow him
up like a glass, till she see him break, even with her own breath? nay if
this infectious vapor were sought for, or trauail'd to, as Pliny hunted after
the vapor of Aetna and dard, and challenged Death in the form of a vapor to
do his worst, and felt the worst, he dyed; or if this vapor were met withal
in an ambush, and we surprised with it, out of a long shut^ Well, or out of a
new opened Mine, who would lament, who would accuse, when we had nothing to
accuse, none to lament against, but Fortune, who is less then a vapor: But
when our selves are the Well, that breaths out this exhalation, the Oven that
spits out this fiery smoke, the Mine that spues out this suffocating, and
strangling dampe, who can ever after this, aggrauate his sorrow, by this
Circumstance, That it was his Neighbor, his familiar friend, his brother that
destroyed him, and destroyed him with a whispering, and a calumniating breath,
when we our selves do it to our selves by the same means, kill our selves
with our own vapors? Or if these occasions of this selfe-destruction, had any
contribution from our own wills, any assistance from our own intentions, nay
from our own errors, we might divide the rebuke, and chide our selves as much
as them. Fevers upon wilful distempers of drink, and surfets, Consumptions
upon inte^perances, and licentiousnes, Madness upon misplacing, or ouer-bending
our natural faculties, proceed from our selves, and so, as that our selves are
in the plot, and we are not only passive, but active too, to our own
destruction; But what have I done, either to breed, or to breath these vapors?
They tell me it is my Melancholy; Did I infuse, did I drink in Melancholy
into my self? It is my thoughtfulness; was I not made to think? It is my
study; does not my Calling call for that^ I have don nothing, wilfully,
peruersly toward it, yet must suffer in it, die by it; There are too many
Examples of men, that have bin their own executioners, and that have made hard
shift to be so; some have always had poison about them, in a hollow ring upon
their finger, and some in their Pen that they used to write with: some have
beat out their brains at the wall of their prison, and some have eat the fire
out of their chimneys: Coma, latro. in Val. Max.
and one is said to have come nearer our case then so, to have stra^gled
himself, though his hands were bound, by crushing his throat between his knees;
But I do nothing upon my self, and yet am mine own Executioner. And we have
heard of death, upon small occasions, and by scornful instruments; a pin, a
comb, a hair, pulled, has gangred, and killd; But when I have said, a
vapor, if I were asked again, what is a vapor, I could not tell, it is so
insensible a thing; so near nothing is that that red^ces us to nothing. But
extend this vapor, rarifie it; from so narow a room, as our Natural bodies,
to any Politic body, to a State. That which is fume in us, is in a State,
Rumor, and these vapors in us, which we consider here pestilent, and
infectious fumes, are in a State infectious rumors, detracting and
dishonorable Calumnies, Libels. The Heart in that body is the King; and the
Brain, his Council; and the whole Magistracy, that ties all together, is the
Sinews, which proceed from thence; and the life of all is Honor, and just
respect, and due reverence; and therefore, when these vapors, these venomous
rumors, are directed against these Noble parts, the whole body suf^ers. But yet
for all their privileges, they are not privileged from our misery; that as
the vapors most pernicious to us, arise in our own bodies, so do the most
dishonorable rumors, and those that wound a State most, arise at home. What
ill air, that I could have met in the street, what channel, what shambles,
what dunghill, what vault, could have hurt me so much, as these home-bredd
vapors? What fugitive, what Almes-man of any foreign State, can do so much
harm, as a Detracter, a Libeller, a scornful Iester at home? For, as they
that write of Poisons, and of creatures naturally disposed to the ruin of Man,
do as well mention the Flea, as the Viper, because the Flea, Ardionus.
though he kill none, he does all the harm he can, so even these libellous
and licentious Iesters, utter the venim they have, though sometimes virtue, and
always power, be a good Pigeon to draw this vapor from the Head, and from
doing any deadly harm there.

12. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, as thy servant James, when he asks that question, what is your
life, prouides me my answer, 4.14.
It is even a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away,
so if he did ask me what is your death, I am provided of my answer, It is a
vapor too; And why should it not be all one to me, whether I live, or die, if
life, and death be all one, both a vapor. Thou ha^t made vapor so indifferent a
thing, as that thy Blessings, and thy Judgments are equally expressed by it,
and is made by thee the Hierogliphique of both. Why should not that be always
good, by which thou have declared thy plentiful goodness to us? Genesis 2.6.
A vapor went up from the Earth, and watered the whole face of the ground, And
that by which thou have imputed a goodness to us, and wherein thou have accepted
our service to thee, sacrifices; for Sacrifices, were vapors, Leuit. 16 23.
And in them it is said, that a thick cloud of inc^nce went up to thee.
Ezech. 8.11.
So it is of that, wherein thou comst to us, the dew of Heaven, And of that
wherein we come to thee^ both are vapors; And he, in whom we have, and are all
that we are or have, te^porally, or spiritually, thy blessed Son, in the person
of wisdom, is called so to; she is (that is he is) the vapor of the power of
God, Sap. 7.24.
and the pure influence from the glory of the Almighty. Have thou, Thou, O my
God, perfumed vapor, with thine own breath, with so many sweet acceptations, in
thine own word, and shall this vapor receive an ill, and infectious sense? It
must; for, since we have displeased thee, with that which is but vapor, (for
what is sin, but a vapor, but a smoke, though such a smoke, as takes away our
sight, and disables us from seeing our danger) it is just, that thou punish us
with vapo^s to For so thou do, as the Wiseman tells us, Thou can punish us
by those things, wherein we offend thee; as he has expressed it there, B^
beasts newly created, breathing vapors. Sap. 11.18.
Therefore that Commination of ^hine, by thy Prophet, Joel. 2.30.
I will show wonders in the heaven, and in the Earth, blood and fire, and
pillars of smoke^ Act. 2.19.
thine Apostle, who knew thy meaning best, calls vapors of smoke. Psa. 78.8.
One Prophet presents thee in thy terriblenesse, so, There went out a smoke at
his Nostrils, and another, the effect of thine anger so, Esa. 6.4.
The house was filled with smoke; And he that continues his Prophecy, as
long as the world can continue, describes the miseries of the latter times so,
Out of the bottomless pit arose a smoke, Apo. 9.2.
that darkened the Sun, and out of that smoke came Locusts, who had the power
of Scorpions. Now all smokes begin in fire, and all these will end so too: The
smoke of sin, and of thy wrath, will end in the fire of hell. But have thou
afforded us no means to euaporate these smokes, to withdraw these vapors? When
thine Angels fell from heaven, thou tookst into thy care, the reparatio^ of
that place, and did it, by assuming, by drawing us thither^ when we fell from
thee here, in this world, thou tookst into thy care the reparation of this
place too, and did it by assuming us another way, by descending down to
assume our nature, in thy Son. So that though our last act be an ascending to
glory, (we shall ascend to the place of Angels) yet our first act is to go the
way of thy Son, descending, and the way of thy blessed spirit too, who
descended in the Dove. Therefore have thou bin pleased to afford us this remedy
in Nature, by this application of a Dove, to our lower parts, to make these
vapors in our bodies, to descend, and to make that a type to us, that by the
visitation of thy Spirit, the vapors o^ sin shall descend, and we tread them
under our feet. At the baptism of thy Son, the Dove descended, and at the
exalting of thine Apostles to preach, the same spirit descended. Let us draw
down the vapors of our own pride, our own wits, our own wills, our own
inue^tions, to the simplicity of thy Sacraments, and the obedience of thy
word, and these Doves, thus applied, shall make us live.

12. PRAYER.
O Eternal and most gracious God, who though thou have suffered us to destroy
our selves, and have not given us the power of reparation in our s^lues, have
yet afforded us such means of reparation, as may easily, and familiarly be
compassed by us, prosper I humbly beseech thee this means of bodily assistance
in this thy ordinary creature, and prosper thy means of spiritual assistance
in thy holy ordinances. And as thou have carried this thy creature the Dove,
through all thy ways, through Nature, and made it naturally proper to conduce
medicinally to our bodily health, Through the law, and made it a sacrifice for
sin there, and through the Gospel, and made it, and thy spirit in it, a
witness of thy sons baptism there, so carry it, and the qualities of it home
to my soul, and imprint there that simplici^y, that mildness, that
harmelesnesse, which thou have imprinted by Nature in this Creature. That so
all vapors of all disobedience to thee, being subdued under my feet, I may in
the power, and triumph of thy son, tread victoriously upon my grave, and
trample upon the Lion, and Dragon, Psa. 91.13.
that lie under it, to devour me. Thou O Lord by the Prophet call the Dove,
Eze. 7.16
the Dove of the Valleys, but promisest that the Dove of the Valleys shall be
upon the Mountain: As thou have laid me low, in this Valley of sickness,
so low, as that I am made fit for that question, asked in the field of bones,
37.3.
Son of Man, can these bones live, so, in thy good time, carry me up to these
Mountains, of which, even in this Valley, thou affordest me a prospect, the
Mountain where thou dwell, the holy Hill, unto which none can ascend but he
that has clean hands, which none can have, but by that one and that strong
way, of making them clean, in the blood of thy Son Christ Jesus. Amen.

13. Ingeniumque malum, numeroso stigmate, fassus Pellitur ad pectus, Morbique
Suburbia, Morbus. The Sickness declares the infection^ and malignity thereof
(...).
13. MEDITATION.
We say, that the world is made of sea, and land, as though they were equal;
but we know that there is more sea in the Western, the^ in the Eastern
Hemisphere^ We say that the Firmament is full of stars; as though it were
equally full; but we know, that there are more stars under the Northern, then
under the Southern Pole. We say, the Elements of man are misery, and
happiness, as though he had an equal proportion of both, and the days of man
vicissitudinary, as though he had as many good days, as ill, and that he liud
under a perpetual Equinoctial, night, and day equal, good and ill fortune in
the same measure. But it is far from that; he drinks misery, and he tastes
happiness; he mowes misery, and he gleanes happiness; he iournies in
misery, he does but walk in happiness; and which is worst, his misery is
positive, and dogmaticall, his happiness is but disputable, and
problematicall; All men call Misery, Misery, but Happiness changes the name,
by the taste of man. In this accident that befalls m^e now, that this sickness
declares it self by Spots, to be a malignant, and pestilentiall disease, if
there be a comfort in the declaration, that thereby the Phisicians see more
clearly what to do, there may be as much discomfort in this, That the
malignitie may be so great, as that all that they can do, shall do nothing;
That an enemy declares himself, then, when he is able to subsist, and to
pursue, and to atchiue his ends, is no great comfort. In intestine
Conspiracies, voluntary Confessions do more good, then confessions upon the
Rack; In these Infections, when Nature her self confesses, and cries out by
these outward declarations, which she is able to put forth of her self, they
minister comfort; but when all is by the strength of Cordials, it is but a
Confession upon the Rack, by which though we come to know the malice of that
man, yet we do not know, whether there be not as much malice in his heart
then, as before his confession; we are sure of his Treason, but not of of his
Repentance; sure of him, but not of his Accomplices. It is a faint comfort to
know the worst, when the worst is remediless; and a weaker then that, to know
much ill, and not to know, that that is the worst. A woman is comforted with
the birth of her Son, her body is eased of a burden; but if she could
prophetically read his History, how ill a man, perchance how ill a son, he
would prove, she should receive a greater burden into her Mind. Scarce any
purchase that is not cloggd with secret encumbra^ces; scarce any happiness, that
has not in it so much of the nature of false and base money, as that the Allay
is more then the Metal. Nay is it not so, (at least much toward it) even in
the exercise of Virtues? I must be poor, and want, before I can exercise the
virtue of Gratitude; miserable, and in torment, before I can exercise the
virtue of patience; How deep do we dig, and for how course gold? And what
other Touchstone have we of our gold, but comparison? Whether we be as happy,
as others, or as our selus at other times; O poor stepp toward being well,
when these spots do only tell us, that we are worse, then we were sure of
before.

13. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, thou have made this sick bed thine Altar, and I have no other
Sacrifice to offer, but my ^elf; and will thou accept no ^potted sacrifice?
Does ^hy Son dwell bodily in this flesh, that thou should look for an
vnspottednes here? Or is the Holy Ghost, the soul of this body, as he is of
thy Spouse, Can. 4.7.
who is therefore all fair, and no spot in her? or has thy Son himself no
spots, who has al our stains, and deformities in him? Or has thy Spouse, thy
Church, no spots, when every particular limb of that fair, and spotles body,
every p^rticular soul in that Church is full of stains, and spots? Thou bidst
us hate the garment, Iud. 23.
that is spotted with the flesh. The flesh it self is the garment, and it
spotteth it self, with it self. And if I wash my self with snow water; Job
9.30.
mine own clothes shall make me abominable; and yet no man yet ever hated his
own flesh: Ephesians. 5.29.
Lord, if thou look for a spotlesnesse, whom will thou look upon? Thy mercy
may go a great way in my soul, and yet not leave me without spots; Thy
corrections may go far, and burn deep, and yet not leave me spotles: thy
children apprehended that, when they said, Joshua 22.17.
From our former iniquity we are not cleansed, until this day, though there
was a plague in the Congregation of the Lord; Thou r^in^st upon us, and yet
do not always mollify all our hardness; Thou kindlest thy fires in us,
and yet do not always burn up all our dross; Thou healst our wounds, and
yet leauest scarres; Thou purgest the blood, and yet leauest spots. But the
spots that thou hate, are the spotts that we hide. Sap. 13.14.
The Caruers of Images cover spotts, says the Wise man; When we hide our
spotts, we become Idolatrers of our own stains, of our own foulenesses. But
if my spots come forth, by what means soever, whether by the strength of
Nature, by voluntary confession, (for Grace is the Nature of a Regenerate man,
and the power of Grace is the strength of Nature) or by the virtue of
Cordialls, (for eue^ thy Corrections are Cordials) if they come forth either
way, thou receiuest that Confession with a gracious Interpretation. Genesis 30.33.
When thy servant Jacob practiced an Invention to procure spotts in his sheep,
thou did prosper his Rodds; and thou do prosper thine own Rodds, when
corrections procure the discovery of our spotts, the humble manifestation of
our sins to thee; Till then thou may justly say, The whole need not the
Phisician; Mat. 9.12.
Till we tell thee in our sickness, we think our selves whole, till we show
our spotts, thou appliest no medicine. But since I do that, shall I not, Job
11.15.
Lord, lift up my face without spot, and be steadfast, and not fear. Even my
spotts belong to thy Sons body, and are part of that, which he came down to
this earth, to fetch, and challenge, and assume to himself. When I open my
spotts, I do but present him with that which is His, and till I do so, I
detain, and withhold his right. When therefore thou see them upon me, as
His, and see them by this way of Confession, they shall not appear to me, as
the pinches of death, to decline my fear to Hell; (for thou have not left the
holy one in Hell, thy Son is not there) but these spotts upon my Breast, and
upon my Soul, shall appear to me as the Constellations of the Firmament, to
direct my Contemplation to that place, where thy Son is, thy right hand.

13. PRAYER.
O Eternal, and most g^atious God, who as thou give all for nothing, if we
consider any precedent Merit in us, so give Nothing, for Nothing, if we
consider the acknowledgement, and thankefullnesse, which thou look for,
after, accept my humble thanks, both for thy Mercy, and for this particular
Mercy, that in thy Judgment I can discern thy Mercy, and find comfort in
thy corrections. I know, O Lord, the ordinary discomfort that accompanies that
phrase, That the house is visited, And that, that thy marks, and thy tokens
are upon the patient; But what a wretched, and disconsolate Hermitage is that
House, which is not visited by thee, and what a Wayue, and Stray is that Man,
that has not thy Marks upon him? These hea^es, O Lord, which thou have brought
upon this body, are but thy chafing of the wax, that thou might seal me to
thee; These spots are but the letters; in which thou have written thine own
Name, and conveyed thy self to me; whether for a present possession, by
taking me now, or for a future renersion, by glorifying thy self in my stay
here, I limit not, ^ condi^ion not, I choose not, I wish not, no more then the
house, or land that passes by any Civil conueyance. Only be thou ever
present to me, O my God, and this bedchamber, and thy bedchamber shall be all
one room, and the closing of these bodily Eyes here, and the opening of the
Eyes of my Soul, there, all one Act.

14. Idque notant Criticis, Medici euenisse Diebus. The Phisicians observe
these accidents to have fallen upon the critical days.
14. MEDITATION.
I Would not make Man worse then he is, Nor his Condition more miserable then
it is. But could I though I would? As a Man cannot flatter God, nor oue^ praise
him, so a Man cannot iniure Man, no^ undervalue him. Thus much must necessarily
be presented to his remembrance, that those false Happinesses, which he has in
this World, have their times, and their seasons, and their Critical d^yes, and
they are Judged, and Denominated according to the times, when they befall us.
What poor Elements are our happinesses made off, if Time, Time which we can
scarce consider to be any thing, be an ess^ntial part of our h^pines? All
things are done in some place; but if we consider place to be no more, but the
next hollow Superficies of the Air, Alas, how thin, and fluid a thing is
Air, and how thin a filme is a Superficies, and a Superficies of Air? All
things are done in time too; but if we consider Time to be but the Measure of
Motion, and howsoever it may seem to have three stations, past, present, and
future, yet the first and last of these are not (one is not, now, and the other
is not yet) And that which you call present, is not now the same that it wa^,
when you began to call it so in this Line, (before you sound that word,
present, or that Monosyllable, now, the present, and the Now is past,) if this
Imaginary halfe-nothing, Time be of the Essence of our Happinesses, how can
they be thought durable? Time is not so; How can they be thought to be? Time
is not so; not so, considered in any of the parts thereof. If we consider
Eternity, into that, Time never Entered; Eternity is not an everlasting flux of
Time; but Time is as a short parenthesis in a long period; and Eternity had
bin the same, as it is, though time had never been; If we consider, not
Eternity, bu^ Perpetuity, not that which had no time to begin in, but which
shall out-liue Time an^ be, when Time shall be^ no more, wh^t A Minu^^ is the
life of the Durablest Creature, compare^ to that? And what ^ Minute is Man's
life i^ respect of the Suns, o^ of a tree? and yet how little of our life is
Occasion^ opportunity to receyu^ good in; and how little of that occasion, do
we apprehend, and lay hold of? How busy, and perplexed a Cobweb, is the
Happiness of Man here, that must be made up with a Watchfulness, to lay hold
upon Occasion, which is but a little piece of that, which is Nothing, Time? And
yet the best things are Nothing without that. Honors, Pleasures, Possessions,
presented to us, out of time, in our decrepit, and distasted, and
vnapprehensiue Age, loose their office, and loose their Name; They are not
Honors to us, that shall never appear, nor come abroad into the Eyes of the
people, to receive Honor, from them who give it: Nor pleasures to us, who have
lost our sense to taste them nor possessions to us, who are departing from the
possession of them. Youth is their Critical Day; that Judges them, that
Denominates them, that inanimates, and informs them, and makes them Honors,
and pleasures, and possessions, and when they come in an vnapprehensiue Age,
they come as a Cordial when the bell rings out, as a Pardon, when the Head is
off. We rejoice in the Comfort of fire, but does any Man cleave to it at
Midsomer; We are glad of the freshness, and coolenes of a Vault, but does any
Man keep his Christmas there; or are the pleasures of the Spring acceptable in
Autumn? If happiness be in the season, or in the Clymate, how much happier
then are Birds then Men, who can change the Climate, and accompany, and enjoy
the same season ever.

14. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God would thou call thy self the Ancient of days, Dan. 7, 9.
if we were not to call our selves to an account for our days? would thou
chide us Mat. 20.6.
for standing idle here all the day, if we were sure to have more days, to
make up our haru^st? When thou biddest us take no thought for tomorrow; 6^34.
for sufficient unto the day (to every day) is the evil thereof, is this
truly, absolutely, to put of all that concerns the present life? When thou
reprehendest the Galatians 4.10.
by thy Message to them, That they observed days, and Months, and Times, and
Years, when thou sendest by the same Messenger, to forbid the Colossians all
Critical days, 2.16^
Indicatory days, Let no Man Judge you, in respect of a holyday, or of a new
Moon, or of a Saboth, do thou take away all Consideration, all destinction
of days? Though thou remove them from being of the Essence of our Salvation,
thou leauest them for assistances, and for the Exaltation of our Devotion, to
fix our selves, at certain periodicall, and stationary times, upon the
consideration of those things, which thou have done for us, and the Crisis, the
trial, the judgment, how those things have wrought upon us, and disposed us to
a spiritual recovery, and conualescence. For there is to every man a day of
salvation, 2. Cor. 6.2.
Now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation, And there is a great
day of thy wrath, Apoc. 6.17.
which no man shall be able to stand in; And there are evil days before, and
therefore thou warnest us, and armest us, Ephesians. 6.1.
Take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand in the
evil day. So far the^ our days must be critical to us, as that by
consideration of them, we may make a Judgment of our spiritual health; for that
is the crisis of our bodily health; Thy beloved servant S. Ioh. wishes to
Gaius, 3. Ioh. v. 2.
that he may prosper in his health so as his soul prospers; ^or if the Soul
be lean, the marrow of the Body is but water; if the Soul wither, the verdure
and the good estate of the body, is but an i^lusion, and the goodliest man, a
fearful ghost. Shall we, O my God, determine our thoughts, and shall we never
determine our disputations upon our Climaclericall years, for particular men,
and periodical years, for the life of states and kingdoms, and never consider
these in our long life, and our interest in the everlasting kingdom? We have
exercisd our curiosity in observing that Adam^ the eldest of the eldest world,
died in his climactericall year, and Sem the eldest son of the next world, in
his; Abraham the father of the faithful, in his, and the blessed Virgin Mary,
the garden, where the root of faith grew, in hers. But they whose
Climacteriques we observe, imployd their observation upon their critical
days, the working of thy promise of a Messiah upon them. And shall we, O my
God, make less use of those days, who have more of the^? We^ who have not
only the day of the Prophets, Heb. 1.2.
the first days, but the last days, in which thou have spoken unto us, by thy
Son? We are the children of the day, 2. These. 5.8.
for thou have shind in as full a Noone, upon us, as upon the Thessalonia^s;
They who were of the night, (a Night, which they had superinduced upon
themselves) the Pharisees; pretended, That if they had bin in their Fathers
days, Mat. 23.30^
(those indicatory, and iudicatory, those Critical days) they would not have
been partakers of the blood of the Prophets; And shall we who are in the day,
these Days, not of the Prophets, but of the Son, stone those Prophets again,
and crucify that Son again, for all those evident Indications, and critical
Iudicatures which are afforded us? Those opposd adversaries of thy Son, the
pharisees with the Herodia^s, watched a Critical day; Then when the State was
incensd against him, Mat. 22.15:
they came to tempt him in the dangerous question of Tribute. They left him,
and that day was the Critical day to the Saduces, The same day, says thy
Spirit, in thy word, the Saduces came to him to question him about the
Resurrection; V. 23.
and them he silenced; They left him; and this was the Critical day for the
Scribe, expert in the Law, who thought himself learneder then the Herodian, V.
34.
the Pharise or Saduce; and he tempted him about the great Commandment; and
him^ Christ left without power of replying. When all was done, and that they
went about to begin their circle of vexation, and tentation again, Christ
sile^ces them so, that, as they had taken their Critical days, to come, in
That, and in that day, so Christ imposes a Critical day upon them, From that
day forth, V. 46.
says thy Spirit, no man durst ask him any more questions. This, O my God, my
most blessed God, is a fearful Crisis, a fearful Indication, when we will
study, and seek, and find, what days are fittest to forsake thee in; To say,
Now, Religion is in a Neutralitie in the world, and this is my day, the day of
liberty; Now I may make new friends by changing my old religion, and this is
my day, the day of advancement. But O my God, with thy servant Jacobs holy
boldness, who though thou lamedst him, Genesis 32.26.
would not let thee go, till thou had given him a blessing, Though thou have
laid me upon my hearse, yet thou shall not depart from me, from this bed, till
thou have given me a Crisis, a Judgment upon my self this day. 2 Pet. 3.8
Since a day is as a thousand years with thee, Let, O Lord, a day, be as a
week to me; and in this one, let me consider seven days, seven critical
days, and judge my self, that I be not judged by thee. First, this is the day
of thy visitatio^, thy coming to me; and would I look to be welcome to thee,
and not entertain thee ^n thy coming to me? We measure not the visitations of
great persons, by their apparel, by their equipage, by the solemnity of their
coming, but by their very coming; and therefore, howsoever thou come, it is a
Crisis to me, that thou would not loose me, who seekst me by any means. This
leads me from my first day, thy visitation by sickness, to a second, to the
light, and testimony of my Conscience. There I have an evening, and a morning;
a sad guiltiness in my soul, but yet a cheerful rising of thy Son to^ Thy
Euenings and Mornings made days in the Creation, and there is no mention of
Nights; My sadnesses for sins are euenings, but they determine not in night, but
deliver me over to the day, the day of a Conscience dejected, but then
rectified, accused, but then ^cquitted, by thee, by him, who speaks thy word,
and who is thy word, thy Son. From this day, the Crisis and examination of my
Conscience, breaks out my third day, my day of preparing, and fitting my self
for a more especial receiving of thy Son, in his institution of the
Sacrament: In which day though th^re be many dark passages, and slippry steps,
to them who will entangle, and endanger themselves, in unnecessary disputations,
yet there are light hours enough, for any man, ^o go his whole journey
intended by thee; to know, that that Bread and Wine, is not more really
assimilated to my body, and to my blood, then the Body and blood of thy Son,
is communicated to me in that action, and participation of that bread, and that
wine. And having, O my God, walkd with thee these three days, The day of thy
visitation, the day of my Conscience, The day of preparing for this seal of
Reconciliation, I am the less afraid of the clouds or storms of my fourth day,
the day of my dissolution and tra^smigratio^ from hence. Nothing deserves the
name of happiness, that makes the remembrance of death bitter; Ecclus. 41.1.
And O death (...) bitter is the remembrance of thee, to a man that lives at
rest, in his possessions, the Man that has Nothing to vex him, yea unto him,
that is able to receive meat? Therefore have thou, O my God, made this sickness,
in which I am not able to receive meat, my fasting day, my Eve, to this great
festiual, my dissolution. And this day of death shall deliver me over to my
fifth day, the day of my Resurrection; for how long a day soever thou make that
day in the grave, yet there is no day between that, and the Resurrection. Then
we shall all be invested, reapparelled in our own bodies; but they who have
made just use of their former days, be superinuested with glory, whereas the
others, condemned to their old clothes, their sinful bodies, shall have
Nothing added, but immortality to torment. And this day of awaking me, and
reinuesting my Soul, in my body, and my body in the body of Christ, shall
present me, Body, and Soul, to my sixth day, The day of Judgment; which is
truly, and most literally, the Critical, the Decretory day; both because all
Judgment shall be manifested to me then, and I shall assist in judging the
world then^ and because then, that Judgment shall declare to me, and possess
me of my Seventh day, my Everlasting Saboth in thy rest, the glory, thy joy,
thy sight, thy self; and where I shall live as long, without reckning any more
Days after, as thy Son, and thy Holy Spirit lived with thee, before you
three made any Days in the Creation.

14. PRAYER.
O Eternal and most gracious God, who though thou did permit darkness to be
before light in the Creation, yet in the making of light, did so multiply
that light, as that it enlightened not the day only, but the night too, though
thou have suffered some dimnesse, some clouds of sadness and disconsolatenesse
to shed themselves upon my soul, I humbly bless and thankfully glorify thy
holy name, that thou have afforded me the light of thy spirit, against which
the prince of darkness cannot prevail, nor hinder his illumination of our
darkest nights, of our saddest thoughts. Even the visitation of thy most
blessed Spirit, upon the blessed Virgin, is called an ouershadowing: There wa^
the presence of the Holy Ghost, the fountain of all light, and yet an
ouershadowing; Nay except there were some light, there could be no shadow. Let
thy merciful providence so govern all in this sickness, that I never fall
into utter darkness, ignorance of thee, or inconsideration of my self; and
let those shadows which do fall upon me, faintnesses of Spirit, and
condemnations of my self, be overcome by the power of thine irresistible
light, the God of consolation; that when those shadows have done their office
upon me, to let me see, that of my self I should fall into irrecouerable
darkness, thy spirit may do his office upon those shadows, and disperse
them, and establish me in so bright a day here, as may be a Critical day to
me, a day wherein, and whereby I may give thy Judgment upon my self, and that
the words of thy son, spoken to his Apostles, may reflect upon me, Mat. 28.20.
B^hold, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.

Interea insomnes noctes Ego duco, Diesque. I sleep not day nor night.
15. MEDITATION.
Natural Men have conceived a two fold use of sleep; That it is a refreshing
of the body in this life; That it is a preparing of the soul for the next;
That it is a feast, and it is the Grace at that feast; That it is our
recreation, and cheeres us, and it is our Catechism, and instructs us; we lie
down in a hope, that we shall rise the stronger; and we lie down in a
knowledge, that we may rise no more. Sleep is an Opiate which gives us rest,
but such an Opiate, as perchance, being under it, we shall wake no more. But
though natural men, who have induced secondary and figurative considerations,
have found out this second, this emblematicall use of sleep, that it should be
a representation of death, God, who wrought and perfected his work, before
Nature began, (for Nature was but his apprentice, to learn in the first seven
days, and now is his foreman, and works next under him) God, I say, intended
sleep only for the refreshing of man by bodily rest, and not for a figure of
death, for he intended not death it self then. But Man having induced death
upon himself, God has taken Man's Creature, death, into his hand, and mended
it; and whereas it has in it self a fearful form and aspect, so that Man
is afraid of his own Creature, God presents it to him, in a familiar, in an
assiduous, in an agreeable, and acceptable form, in sleep, that so when he
awakes from sleep, and says to himself, shall I be no otherwise when I am
dead, than I was even now, when I was asleep, he may be ashamed of his waking
dreams, and of his Melancholique fancying out a hor^id and an affrightfull
figure of that death which is so like sleep. As then we need sleep to live
out our threescore and ten years, so we need death, to live that life which we
cannot out-liue. And as death being our enemy, God allows us to defend our
selves against it (for we victual ou^ selves against death, twice every day,
as often as we eat) so God having so sweetened death unto us, as he has in
sleep, we put our selves into our Enemies hands once every day; so far, as
sleep is death; and sleep is as much death, as meat is life. This then is the
misery of my sickness, That death as it is produced from me, and is mine own
Creature, is now before mine Eyes, but in that form, in which God has
mollified it to us, and made it acceptable, in sleep, I cannot see it: how
many prisoners, who have even hollowed themselves their graves upon that Earth,
on which they have lion long under heavy fetters, yet at this hour are
^sleepe, though they be yet working upon their own graves, by their own
weight? he that has seen his friend die to day, or knows he shall see it
to morrow, yet will sink into a sleep between. I cannot; and oh, if I be
entering now into Eternity, where there shall be no more distinction of
hours, why is it al my business now to tell Clocks? why is none of the
heaviness of my heart, dispensed into mine Eie-lids, that they might fall as
my heart does? And why, since I have lo^t my delight in all objects, cannot I
discontinue the faculty of seeing them, by closing mine Ei^s in sleep? But
why rather being entering into that presence, where I shall wake continually and
never sleep more, do I not interpret my continual waking here, to be a
p^rasceue, and a preparation to that?

15. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, I know, (for thou have said it) That he that keeps Israel,
Psa. 121.1.
shall neither slumber, nor sleep: But shall not that Israel, over whom thou
watchest, sleep? I know, (for thou have said it) that there are Men, 2 Pet.
2.3.
whose damnation sleeps not; but shall not they to whom thou art Salvation,
sleep? or will thou take from them that evidence, and that testimony, that
they are thy Israel, or thou their salvation? Thou give thy beloved sleep.
Psa. 127 1.
Shall I lack that seal of thy love? You shall lie down, Leu. 26.6.
and none shall make you afraid; shall I be outlawd from that protection? Ion.

Jonas slept in one dangerous storm, and thy blessed Son in another. Mat.
8.24.
Shall I have no use, no benefit, no application of those great Examples? Lord,
if he sleep, he shall do well, Io. 11.12.
say thy Sons Disciples to him, of Lazarus; And shall there be no room, for
that Argument in me? or shall I be open to the contrary? If I sleep not,
shall I not be well, in their sense? Let me not, O my God, take this too
precisely, too literally: There is that neither day nor night sees sleep with
his eyes, Eccles. 8.16.
says thy wise servant Solomon; and whether he speak that of worldly Men, or
of Men that seek wisdom, whether in justification or condemnation of their
watchfulness, we can not tell: we can t^ll, Pro. 4.16.
That there are men, that cannot sleep, till they have done mischief, and
^hen they can; and we can tell that the rich man cannot sleep, Eccles. 5.12.
because his abundance will not let him. Mat. 13.25.28.13.
The tares were sown when the husbandmen were asleep; And the elders thought
it a probable excuse, a credible lie, that the wa^chmen which kept the
Sepulcher, should say, 26.40.
that the body of thy son was stolen away, when they were asleep: Since thy
blessed Son rebuked his Disciples for sleeping, shall I murmr because I do
not sleep? Iud. 16.3.
If Samson had slept any longer in Gaza, he had been taken; And when he did
sleep longer with Delilah, he was taken. verse. 19.
Sleep is as often taken for natural death in thy Scriptures, as for natural
rest. Nay sometimes sleep ha^h so heavy a sense, as to be taken for sin it
self, Ephesians. 5.14.
as well as for the punishment of sin, Death. 1 These. 5.6.
Much comfort is not in much sleep, when the most fearful and most
irreuocable Malediction is presen^ed by thee, Ier. 51.59.
in a perpetual sleep. I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunk,
and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake. I must therefore, O my
God, look farther, than into the very act of sleeping, before I mis-interpret
my waking: for since I find thy whole hand light, shall any finger of that
hand seem heavy? since the whole sickness is thy Physic, shall any accident
in it, be my poison, by my murmuring? The name of Watchmen belongs to our
profession; Thy Prophets are not only seers, endued with a power of seeing,
able to see, but Watchmen, evermore in the Act of seeing. And therefore give me
leave, O my blessed God, to inuert the words of thy Sons Spouse; she said,
Can. 5.8
I sleep, but my heart waketh; I say, I wake, but my heart sleeps; My body
is in a sick weariness, but my soul in a peaceful rest with thee; and as
our eyes, in our health, see not the Air, that is next them, nor the fire, nor
the spheres, nor stop upon any thing, till they come to stars, so my eyes,
that are open, see nothing of this world, but pass through all that, and fix
themselves upon thy peace, and joy, and glory above. Almost as soon as thy
Apostle had said, Let us not sleep, 1 These. 5.6.
lest we should be too much discomforted, if we did, he says again, verse. 10.
whether we wake or sleep, let us live together with Christ. Though then this
absence of sleep, may argue the presence of death (the Original may exclude
the Copy, the life, the picture) yet this gentle sleep, and rest of my soul
betroths me to thee, to whom I shall be married indissolubly, though by this
way of dissolution.

15. PRAYER.
O Eternal and most gracious God, who art able to make, and do make the
sick bed of thy servants, Chapels of ease to them, and the dreams of thy
servants, Prayers, and Meditations upon thee, let not this continual
watch^ulnes of mine, this inabilitie to sleep, which thou have laid upon me,
be any disquiet, or discomfort to me, but rather an argument, that thou
would not have me sleep in thy presence. What it may indicate or signify,
concerning the state of my body, let them consider to whom that consideration
belongs; do thou, who only art the Physician of my soul, tell her, that thou will afford her such defensatiues as that she shall wake ever toward thee,
and yet ever sleep in thee; and that through all this sickness, thou will
either preserve mine understanding, from all decaies and distractions, which
these watchings might occasion, or that thou will reckon, and account with me,
from before those violencies, and not call any piece of my sickness, a sin.
It ^s a heavy, and indelible sin, that I brought into the world wi^h me^ It
is a heavy and innu^merable multitude of sins, which I have heaped up since; I
have sinned behind thy back (if that can be done) by wilful absteining from
thy Congregations, and omitting thy service, and I have sinned before thy face,
in my hypocrisies in Prayer, in my ostentation, and the mingling a respect of
my self, in preaching thy Word; I have sinned in my fasting by repining, when
a penurious fortune has kept me low; And I have sinned even in that fullness,
when I have been at thy table, by a negligent examination, by a wilful
preuarication, in receiving that heavenly food and Physic. But, as I know, O
my gracious God, that for all those sins committed since, yet thou will
consider me, as I was in thy purpose, when thou wrotest my name in the book of
Life, in mine Election: so into what deuiations so^uer I stray, and wander, by
occasion of this sickness, O God, return thou to that Minute, wherein thou wast
pleased with me, and consider me in that condition.

16. Et properare meum clamant, e Turre propinqua, Obstreperae Campanae aliorum
in funere, funus. From the bells of the church adjoining, I am daily remembered
of my burial in the funerals of others.
16. MEDITATION.
Magius.
WE have a Convenient Author, who writ a Discourse of Bells when he was
Prisoner in Turkey. How would he have enlarged himself, if he had been my
fellow Prisoner in this sick bed, so near to that steeple, which never
ceases, no more than the harmony of the spheres, but is more heard. When the
Turks took Constantinople, they melted the Bells into Ordnance; I have heard
both Bells and Ordnance, but never been so much affected with those, as with
these Bells. I have lien near a steeple, Antwerp
in which there are said to be more than thirty Bells; And near another, where
there is one so big, Roan.
as that the Clapper is said to weigh more than six hundred pound^ yet never so
affected as here. Here the Bells can scarce solemnise the funeral of any
person, but that I knew him, or knew that he was my Neighbor: we dwelt in
houses near to one another before, but now he is gone into that house, into
which I must follow him. There is a way of correcting the Children of great
persons, that other Children are corrected in their behalf, and in their
names, and this works upon them, who indeed had more des^rued it. And when
these Bells tell me, that now one, and now another is buried, must not I
acknowledge, that they have the correction due to me, and paid the debt that I
owe? There is a story of a Bell in a Monastery, Roccha.
which, when any of the house was sick to death, rung always voluntarily, and
they knew the ineuitablenesse of the danger by that. It rung once, when no man
was sick; but the next day one of the house, fell from the steeple, and died,
and the Bell held the reputation of a Prophet still. If these Bells that warn
to a Funeral now, were appropriated to none, may not I, by the hour of the
funeral, supply? How many men that stand at an execution, if they would ask,
for what dies that Man, should hear their own faults condemned, and see
themselves executed, by Attorney? We scarce hear of any man preferred, but we
think of our selves, that we might very well have been that Man; Why might
not I have been that Man, that is carried to his grave now? Could I ^it my
self, to stand, or sit in any Man's place, and not to lie in any man's grave? I
may lack much of the good parts of the meanest, but I l^cke nothing of the
mortality of the weakest; They may have acquired better abilities than I, but I
was borne to as many infirmities as they. To be an incumbent by lying down in a
grave, to be a Doctor by teaching Morti^ication by Example, by dying, though I
may have seniors, others may be elder than I, yet I have proceeded apace in a
good University, and gone a great way in a little time by the furtherance of a
vehement fever; and whomsoever these Bells bring to the ground to day, if he
and I had been compared yesterday, perchance I should have been thought
likelier to come to this preferment, then, than he. God has kept the power of
death in his own hands, lest any Man should bribe death. If man knew the gain
of death, the ease of death, he would solicit, he would provoke death to
assist him, by any ^and, which he might use. But as when men see many of their
own professions preferred, it ministers a hope that that may light upon them; so
when these hourly Bells tell me of so many funerals of men like me, it
presents, if not a desire that it may, yet a comfort whenever mine shall come.

16. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, I do not expostulate with thee, but with them, who dare do
that: Who dare expostulate with thee, when in the voice of thy Church, thou
give allowance, to this Ceremony of Bells at funerals. Is it enough to
refuse it, because it was in use amongst the Gentiles? so were funerals too.
Is it because some abuses may have crept in, amongst Christians? Is that
enough, that their ringing has been said to drive away evil spirits? Truly,
that is so far true, as that the evil spirit is vehemently vexed in their
ringing, therefore, because that action brings the Congregation together, and
unites God and his people, to the destruction of that Kingdom, which the evil
spirit vsurps. In the first institution of thy Church, in this world, in the
foundation of thy Militant Church, amongst the Jews, thou did appoint the
calling of the assembly in, Number. 10 1.
to be by Trumpet, and when they were in, then thou gave them the sound of
Bells, in the garment of thy Priest^ In the Triumphant Church, Exo. 18.
thou imploiest both too, but in an inuerted Order, we enter into the
Triumphant Church by the sound of Bells, (for we enter when we die;) And then
we receive our further edification, or consummation, by the sound of Trumpets,
at the Resurrection. The sound of thy Trumpets thou did impart to secular and
civil uses too, but the sound of Bells only to sacred; Lord let not us break
the Communion of Saints, in that which was intended for the advancement of it;
let not that pull us asunder from one another, which was intended for the
assembling of us, in the Militant, and associating of us to the Triumphant
Church. But he for whose funeral these Bells ring now, was at home, at his
iournies end, yesterday; why ring they now? A Man, that is a world, is all the
things in the world; He is an Army, and when an Army marches, the Vaunt may
lodge to night, where the Rear comes not till to morrow. A man extends to his
Act and to his example; to that which he does, and that which he teaches; so
do those things that concern him, so do these bells; That which rung
yesterday, was to convey him out of the world, in his vaunt, in his soule^ that
which rung to day, was to bring him in his Rear, in his body, to the Church;
And this continuing of ringing after his entering, is to bring him to me in the
application. Where I lie, I could hear the Psalm, and did join with the
Congregation in it; but I could not hear the Sermon, and these latter bells
are a repetition Sermon to me. But, O my God, my God, do I, that have this
fever, need other remembrances of my Mortality? Is not mine own hollow
voice, voice enough to pronounce that to me? Need I look upon a Deaths-head in
a Ring, that have one in my face? or go for death to my Neighbors house, that
have him in my bosom? We cannot, we cannot, O my God, take in too many helps
for religious duties; I know I cannot have any better Image of thee, than thy
Son, nor any better Image of him, than his Gospel: yet must not I, with
thanks confess to thee, that some historical pictures of his, have sometimes
put me upon better Meditations than otherwise I should have fallen upon? I
know thy Church needed not to have taken in from Jew or Gentile, any supplies
for the exaltation of thy glory, or our devotion; of absolute necessity I know
^hee needed not; But yet we owe thee our thanks, that thou have given her
leave to do so, and that as in making us Christians, thou did not destroy
that which we were before, natural men, so in the exalting of our religious
devotions no^ we are Christians, thou have been pleased to continue to us
those assistances which did work upon the affections of natural men before:
for thou love a good man, as thou love a good Christian: and though Grace
be merely from thee, yet thou do not plant Grace but in good natures.

16. PRAYER.
O Eternal and most gracious God, who having consecrated our living bodies, to
thine own Spirit, and made us Temples of the holy Ghost, do also requir^ a
respect to be given to these Temples, even when the Priest is gone out of
them, To these bodies, when the soul is departed from them; I bless, and
glorify thy Name, that as thou take care in our life, of every hair of our
head, so do thou also of every grain of ashes after our death. Neither
do thou only do good to us all, in life and death, but also would have
us do good to one another, as in a holy life, so in those things which
accompany our death: In that Contemplation I make account that I hear this
dead brother of ours, who is now carried out to his burial, to speak to me,
and to preach my funeral Sermon, in the voice of these Bells. In him, O God,
thou have accomplished to me, even the request of Dives to Abraham; Thou have
sent one from the dead to speak unto me. He speaks to me aloud from that
steeple; he whispers to me at these Curtains, and he speaks thy words;
Apoc. 14 13.
Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth. Let this prayer
therefore, O my God, be as my last gasp, my expiring, my dying in thee; That if
this be the hour of my transmigration, I may die the death of a sinner,
drowned in my sins, in the blood of thy Son; And if I live longer, yet I
may now die the death of the righteous, die to sin; which death is a
resurrection to a new life. Thou killest and thou give life: which soever
comes, it comes from thee; which way soever it comes, let me come to thee.

17. Nunc lento sonitu dicunt, Morieris. Now, this Bell tolling softly for
another, says to me, Thou must die.
17. MEDITATION.
PErchance he for whom this Bell tolls, may be so ill, as that he knows not
it tolls for him; And perchance I may think my self so much better than I am,
as that they who are about me, and see my state, may have caused it to toll
for me, and I know not that. The Church is Catholic, universal, so are all
her Actions, All that she does, belongs to all. When she baptizes a child, that
action concerns me; for that child is thereby connected to that Head which is
my Head too, and engraffe^ into that body, whereof I am a member. And when she
buries a Man, that action concerns me; All mankind is of one Author; and is
one volume; when one Man dies, one Chapter is not torn out of the book, but
translated into a better language; and every Chapter must be so translated; God
emploies several translators; some pieces are translated by Age, some by
sickness, some by war, some by justice; but Gods hand is in every
translation; and his hand shall bind up all our scattered leaves again, for
that Library where every book shall lie open to one another: As therefore the
Bell that rings to a Sermon, calls not upon the Preacher only, but upon the
Congregation to come; so this Bell calls us all: but how much more me, who am
brought so near the door by this sickness. There was a contention as far
as a suite, (in which both piety and dignity, religion, and estimation, were
mingl^d) which of the religious Orders should ring to prayers first in the
Morning; and it was determined, that they should ring first that rose earliest.
If we understand aright the dignity of this Bell, that rolls for our evening
prayer, we would be glad to make it ours, by rising early, in that
application, that it might be ours, as well as his, whose indeed it is. The
Bell does toll for him that thinks it does; and though it intermit again, yet
from that minute, that that occasion wrought upon him, he is united to God.
Who casts not up his Eye to the Sun when it rises? but who takes off his Eye
from a Com^t, when that breaks out? who bends not his ear to any bell, which
upon any occasion rings? but who can remove it from that bell, which is passing
a piece of himself out of this world? No Man is an Island, entire of it self;
every man is a piece of the Continent, a part of the maine; if a Clod be
washed away by the Sea, Europe is the l^sse, as well as if a Promontorie were,
as well as if a Manor of thy friends, or of thine own were; Any Man's death
diminishes me, because I am inuolued in Mankind; And therefore never send to
know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee. Neither can we call this a
begging of Misery or a borrowing of Misery, as though we were not miserable
enough of our selves, but must fe^ch in more from the next house, in taking
upon us the Misery of our Neighbors. Truly it were an excusable covetousness
if we did; for affliction is a treasure, and ^carce any Man has enough of it.
No Man has affliction enough, that is not matured, and ripened by it, and mad^
^it for God by that affliction. If a Man carry treasure in bullion, or in a
wedge of gold, and have none coined into current Moneys, his treasure will not
defray him as he trauells. Tribulation is Treasure in the nature of it, but it
is not current money in the use of it, except we get nearer and nearer our
home, heaven, by it. Another Man may be sick too, and sick to death, and this
af^liction may lie in his bowels, as gold in a Mine, and be of no use to him^
but this bell that tells me of his af^liction, digs out, and applies that gold
to mee^ if by this consideration of another danger, I take min^ own into
Contemplation, and so secure my self, by making my recourse to my God, who is
our only security.

17. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, Is this one of thy ways, of drawing light out of darkness,
To make him for whom this bell tolls, now in this dimnesse of his sight, to
become a superintendent, an ouerseer, a Bishop, to as many as hear his voice,
in this bell, and to give us a confirmation in this action? Is this one of thy
ways to raise strength out of weakness, to make him who cannot rise from his
bed, nor stir in his bed, come home to me, and in this sound, give me the
strength of healthy and vigorous instructions? O my God, my God, what Thunder
is not a well-tuned Cymball, what hoarsenesse, what harshnesse is not a clear
Organ, if thou be pleased to set thy voice to it? and what Organ is not well
played on, if thy hand be upon it? Thy voice, thy hand is in this sound, and
in this one sound, I hear this whole Consort. I hear thy Iaacob call unto his
sons, and ^ay; Genesis 49.1.
Gather your selves together, that I may tell you what shall befall you in the
last days: He says, That which I am now, you must be then. I hear thy Moses
telling me, and all within the compass of this sound, This is the blessing
wherewith I bless you before my death; Deuteronomy. 33 1.
This, that before your death, you would consider your own in mine. I hear
thy Prophet saying to Ezechias, Set thy house in order, for thou shall die, and
not live; 2 Reg. 20.1.
He makes us of his family, and calls this a setting of his house in order,
to compose us to the meditation of death. I hear thy Apostle saying, I think
it meet to put ^ou in remembrance, 2 Pet. 2.13.
knowing that shortly I must go out of this Tabernacle. This is the publishing
of his will, and this bell is our legacy, the applying of his present
condition to our use. I hear that which makes al sounds music, and all
music perfect; I hear thy Son himself ^aying, Ioh. 14.1.
Let not your hearts be troubled^ Only I hear this change, that whereas thy
Son says there, I go to prepare a place for you, this man in thi^ sound
says, I send to prepare you for a place, for a grave. But, O my God, my God,
since heaven is glory and joy, why do not glorious and joyful things lead
us, induce us to heaven? Thy legacies in thy first will, in thy old Testament
were plenty and victory; Wine and Oil, Milk and Honey, alliances of
friends, ruin of enemies, peaceful hearts, and cheerful countenances, and
by these galleries thou broughtest them into thy bedchamber, by these glories
and ioies, to the ioies and glories of heaven. Why have thou changed thine old
way, and carried us, by the ways of discipline and mortification, by the ways
of mourning and lamentation, by the ways of miserable ends, and miserable
anticipations of those miseries, in appropriating the exemplar miseries of
others to our selves, and usurping upon their miseries, as our own, to our
own prejudice? Is the glory of heaven no perfecter in it self, but that it
needs a foil of depression and ingloriousnesse in this world, to set it off?
Is the joy of heaven no perfecter in it self, but that it needs the soreness
of this life to give it a taste? Is that joy and that glory but a comparatiue
glory and a comparatiue joy? not such in it self, but such in comparison of
the ioilesnesse and the ingloriousnesse of this world? I know, my God, it is
far, far otherwise. As thou thy self, who art all, art made of no
substances, so the joys and glory which are with thee, are made of none of
these circumstances; Essential joy, and glory Essential. But why then, my
God, will thou not begin them here? pardon O God, this unthankful rashness;
I that ask why thou do not, find even now in my self, that thou do;
such joy, such glory, as that I conclude upon my self, upon all, They that
find not joy in their sorrows, glory in their deiections in this world, are
in a fearful danger of missing both in the next.

17. PRAYER.
O Eternal and most gracious God, who have been pleased to speak to us, not
only in the voice of Nature, who speaks in our hearts, and of thy word, which
speaks to our ears, but in the speech of speechless Creatures, in Balaams
Ass, in the speech of unbelieving men, in the confession of Pilate, in the
speech of the Devil himself, in the recognition and attestation of thy Son,
I humbly accept thy voice, in the sound of this sad and funeral bell. And
first, I blessethy glorious name, that in this sound and voice, I can hear thy
instructions, in another man's to consider mine own condition; and to know,
that this bell which tolls for another, before it come to ring out, may take in
me too. As death is the wages of sin, it is due to me^; As death is the end
of sickness, it belongs to me; And though so disobedient a servant as I, may
be afraid to die, yet to so merciful a Master as thou, I cannot be afraid to
come; And therefore, into thy hands, O my God, I commend my spirit; A
surrender, which I know thou will accept, whether I live or die; for thy
servant David made it, Psalm. 31.5.
when he put himself into thy protection for his life; and thy blessed Son
made it, when he delivered up his soul at his death; declare thou thy will
upon me, O Lord, for life or death, in thy time; receive my surrender of my
self now, Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit. And being thus, O my
God, prepared by thy correction, mellowed by thy chastisement, and conformed to
thy will, by thy Spirit, having received thy pardon for my soul, and asking no
reprieue for my body, I am bold, O Lord, to bend my prayers to thee, for his
assistance, the voice of whose bell has called me to this devotion. Lay hold
upon his soul, O God, till that soul have thoroughly considered his account,
and how few minutes soever it have to remain in that body, let the power of
thy Spirit recompense the shortness of time, and perfect his account, before
he pass away: present his sins so to him, as that he may know what thou
forgiuest, and not doubt of thy forgiveness; let him stop upon the
infiniteness of those sins, but dwell upon the infiniteness of thy Mercy:
let him discern his own demerits, but wrap himself up in the merits of thy
Son, Christ Jesus: Breath inward comforts to his heart, and afford him the
power of giving such outward testimonies thereof, as all that are about him may
derive comforts from thence, and have this edification, even in this
dissolution, that though the body be going the way o^ all flesh, yet that soul
is going the way of all Saints. When thy Son cried out upon the Cross, My
God, my God, Why have thou forsaken me? he spoke not so much in his own
Person, as in the person of the Church, and of his afflicted members, who in
deep distresses might fear thy forsaking. This patient, O most blessed God, is
one of them; In his behalf, and in his name, hear thy Son crying to thee,
My God, my God, Why have thou forsaken me? and forsake him not; but with thy
left hand lay his body in the grave, (if that be ^hy determination upon him)
and with thy right hand receive his soul into thy Kingdom, and unite him and
us in one Communion of Saints. Amen.

18. -- At inde Mortuus es, Sonitu celeri, pulsuque agitato. The bell rings
out, and tells me in him, that I am dead.
18. MEDITATION.
THe Bell rings out; the pulse thereof is changed; the tolling was a faint, and
intermitting pulse, upon one side; this stronger, and argues more and better
life. Hi^ soul is gone out; and as a Man who had a lease of 1000. years after
the expiration of a short one, or an inheritance after the life of a Man in a
Consumption, he is now entered into the possession of his better estate. His
soul is gone; whither? Who saw it come in, or who saw it go out? No body; yet
every body is sure, he had one, and has none. If I will ask mere
Philosophers, what the soul is, I shall find amongst them, that will tell me,
it is nothing, but the temperament and harmony, and just and equal composition
of the Elements in the body, which produces all those faculties which we
ascribe to the soul; and so, in it self is nothing, no seperable substance,
that ouerliues the body. They see the soul is nothing else in other Creatures,
and they affect an impious humility, to think as low of Man. But if my soul
were no more than the soul of a beast, I could not think so; that soul that
can reflect upon it self, consider it self, is more than so. If I will ask,
not mere Philosophers, but mixed Men, Philosophical Divines, how the soul,
being a separate substance, enters into Man, I shall find some that will tell
me, that it is by generation, and procreation from parents, because they think
it hard, to charge the soul with the guiltiness of Original sin, if the
soul were infused into a body, in which it must necessarily grow foul, and
contract original sin, whether it will or no; and I shall find some that
will tell me, that it is by immediate infusion from God, because they think it
hard, to maintain an immortality in such a soul, as should be begotten, and
derived with the body from Mortal parents. If I will ask, not a few men, but
almost whole bodies, whole Churches, what becomes of the souls of the
righteous, at the departing thereof from the body, I shall be told by some,
That they attend an expiation, a purification in a place of torment; By some,
that they attend the fruition of the sight of God, in a place of rest; but yet,
but of expectation; By some, that they pass to an immediate possession of the
presence of God. S. Augustine studied the Nature of the soul, as much as any
thing, but the salvation of the soul; and he sent an express Messenger to
Saint Hierome, to consult of some things concerning the soul: But he satisfies
himself with this: Let the departure of my soul to salvation be evident to my
faith, and I care the less, how dark the entrance of my soul, into my body,
be to my reason. It is the going out, more than the coming in, that concerns
us. This soul, this Bell tells me is gone out; Whither? Who shall tell me
that? I know not who it is; much less what he was; The condition of the Man,
and the course of his life, which should tell me whither he is gone, I know
not. I was not there, in his sickness, nor at his death; I saw not his way,
nor his end, nor can a^ke them who did, thereby to conclude, or argue, whither
he is gone. But yet I have one nearer me than all these; mine own Charity; I
ask that; and that tells me, He is gone to everlasting rest, and joy, and
glory: I owe him a good opinion; it is but thankful charity in me, because I
received benefit and instruction from him when his Bell told: and I, being made
the fitter to pray, by that disposition, wherein I was assisted by his
occasion, did pray for him; and I pray not without faith; so I do charitably,
so I do faithfully believe, that that soul is gone to everlasting rest, and
joy, and glory. But for the body, How poor a wretched thing is that? we
cannot express it so fast, as it grows worse and worse. That body which
scarce three minutes since was such a house, as that that soul, which made but
one step from thence to Heaven, was scarce thoroughly content, to leave that for
Heaven: that body has lost the name of a dwelling house, because none dwells in
it, and is making haste to lose the name of a body, and dissolve to
putrefaction. Who would not be affected to see a clear and sweet River in the
Morning, grow a kennell of muddy land water by noone, and condemned to the
saltness of the Sea by night? And how lame a Picture, how faint a
representation, is that, of the precipitatio^ of man's body to dissolution? Now
all the parts built up, and knit by a lovely soul, now but a statue of clay,
and now, these limbs melted off, as if that clay were but snow^ and now, the
whole house is but a handful of sand, so much dust, and but a pecke of
Rubbidge, so much bone. If he, who, as this Bell tells me, is gone now, were
some excellent Arti^icer, who comes to him for a clock, or for a garment now?
or for counsel, if he were a Lawyer? If a Magistrate, for justice? Man
before he has his immortal soul, has a soul of sense, and a soul of
vegitation before that: This immortal soul did not forbid other souls, to be
in us before, but when this soul departs, it carries all with it; no more
vegetation, no more sense: such a Mother in law is the Earth^ in respect of our
natural Mother; in her womb we grew; and when she was delivered of us, we
were planted in some place, in some calling in the world; In the womb of the
Earth, we diminish, and when she is delivered of us, our grave opened for
another, we are not transplanted, but transported, our dust blown away with
profane dust, with every wind.

18. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, if Expostulation be too bold a word, do thou mollify it
with another; le^ it be wonder in my self; let it be but problem to others;
but let me ask, why would thou not suffer those, that serve thee in holy
services, Leuit. 21 1.
to do any office about the dead, nor assist at their funeral? Thou had no
Counselor, thou need none; thou have no Controller, thou admittest none Why
do I ask? in Ceremonial things (as that was) any convenient reason is
enough; who can be sure to propose that reason, that moved thee in the
institution thereof? I satisfy my self with this; that in those times, the
Gentiles were ouerfull, of an ouer-reuerent respect to the memory of the dead:
a great part of the Idolatry of the Nations, flowed from that; an ouer-amorous
devotion, an ouer-zealous celebrating, and ouer-studious preserving of the
memories, and the Pictures of some dead persons: Sap. 14.14.
And by the vain glory of men, they entered into the world; and their statues,
and pictures contracted an opinion of divinity, by age: that which was at
first, but a picture of a friend, grew a God in time, as the wise man notes,
Sap. 13.9.
They called them Gods, which were the work of an ancient hand. And some have
assigned a certain time, when a picture should come out of Minority, and be
at age, to be a God, in 60. years after it is made. Those Images of Men, that
had life, and some Idols of other things, which never had any being, are by one
common name, called promiscuously, dead, and for that the wise man reprehends
the Idolatrer; for health he prays to that which is weak, Sap. 13.18.
and for life he prays to that which is dead. Should we do so, says thy
Prophet; Esaias 8.14.
should we go from the living to the dead? So much ill then, being occasioned,
by so much religious co^plement exhibited to the dead; thou o God, (I think)
would therefore inhibit thy principal holy servants, from contributing any
thing at all to this dangerous intimation of Idolatry; and that the people
might say, surely those dead men, are not so much to be magnified, as men
mistake, since God will not suffer his holy officers, so much as to touch them,
not to see them. But those dangers being removed, thou, O my God, do
certainly allow, that we should do offices of piety to the dead, and that we
should draw instructions to piety, from the dead. Is not this, O my God, a holy
kind of raising up ^eed to my dead brother, if I, by the meditation of his
death, produce a better life in my self? It is the blessing upon Reuben, Deu.
33.6.
and not die, and let not his men be few; let him propagate many. And it is a
Malediction, That that dies, let it die; Zechar. 11.9.
let it do no good in dying: for Trees without fruit, Iud. 12.
thou by thy Apostle callst, twice dead. It is a second death, if none live the
better, by me, after my death, by the manner of my death. Therefore may I
justly think, that thou made that a way to convey to the Egyptians, a fear
of thee, and a fear of death, Exo. 12.30.
that there was not a house, where there was not one dead; for thereupon the
Egyptians said, we are all dea^ men; the death of others, should catechize vs^
to death. Apo. 1.5.
Thy Son Christ Jesus is the first begotten of the dead; he rises first, the
eldest brother, and he is my Master in this science of death: but yet, for me,
I am a younger brother too, to this Man, who died now, and to every man whom I
see, or hear to die before me, and all they are vshers to me in this school
of death. I take therefore that which thy servant David's wife said to him, to
be said to me; 1 Samuel 19.11.
If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shall be slain. If the
death of this man work not upon me now, I shall die worse, than if thou had
not afforded me this help: for thou have sent him in this bell to me, as tho^
did send to the Angel^ of Sardis, Apoc. 3.2^
with commission to strengthen the things that remain, and that are ready to
die; that in this weakness of body, I might receive spiritual streng^h, by these
occasions. This is my strength, that whether thou say to me, as thine Angel
said to Gedeon; Iud. 6.23
Peace be unto thee, fear not, thou shall not die, or whether thou say, as
unto Aaron, Thou shall die there; Number. 20.26.
yet thou will preserve that which is ready to die, my soul, from the worst
death, that of sin. 1 Reg. 16 18.
Zimrie died for his sins, says thy Spirit, which he sinned in doing evil;
and in his sin, which he did to make Israel sin. For his sins, his many
sins; and then in his sin, his particular sin: for my sins I shall die,
whenever I die, for death is the wages of sin; but I shall die in my sin,
in that particular sin of resisting thy spirit, if I apply not thy
assistances. Does it not call us to a particular consideration, That thy
blessed Son varies his form of Commination, and aggrauates it in the
variation, when he says to the Jews, (because they refused the light
offered) you shall die in your sin; Ioh. 8.21
And then when they proceeded to farther disputations, and vexations, and
tentations, he adds, Verse. 24.
you shall die in your sins; he multiplies the former expressing, ^o a
plural. In this sinne^ and in all your sins; does not the resisting of thy
particular helps at last, draw upon us the guiltiness of all our former
sins? May not the neglecting of this sound ministered to me in this man's
death, bring me to that misery, as that I, whom the Lord of life loved so, as
to die for me, shall die, and a Creature of mine own shall be immortall^ that
I shall die, Esaias 66.14.
and the worm of mine own conscience shall never die?

18. PRAYER.
O Eternal and most gracious God, I have a new occasion of thanks, and a new
occasion of prayer to thee, from the ringing of this bell. Thou toldst me in
the other voice, that I was mortal, and approaching to death; In this I may
hear thee say, that I am dead, in an irremediable, in an irrecouerable state
for bodily health. If that be thy language in this voice, how infinitely am I
bound to thy heavenly Majesty, for speaking so plainly unto me? for even that
voice, that I must die now, is not the voice of a Judge, that speaks by way of
condemnation, but of a Physician, that presents health in that: Thou presentest
me death as the cure of my disease, not as the exaltation of it; if I mistake
thy voice herein, if I overrun thy pace, and prevent thy hand, and imagine
death more instant upon me than thou have bid him be, yet the voice belongs
to me; I am dead, I was borne dead, and from the first laying of these
mud-walls in my conception, they have moldred away, and the whole course of
life is but an active death. Whether this voice instruct me, that I am a dead
man now, or remember me, that I have been a dead man all this while, I humbly
thank thee for speaking in this voice to my soul, and I hum^ly beseech thee
also, to ^ccept my prayers in his behalf, by whose occasion this voice, this
sound is come to me. ^or though he be by death transplanted to thee, and so
in possession of inexpressible happiness there, yet here upon earth thou have
given us such a portion of heaven, as that though men dispute, whether thy
Saints in heaven do know what we in earth in particular do stand in need of,
yet without all disputation, we upon earth do know what thy Saints in heaven
lack yet, for the consummation of their happiness; and therefore thou have
affoorded us the dignity, that we may pray for them. That therefore this
soul now newly departed to thy Kingdom, may quickly return to a io^full
reunion to that body which it has left, and that we with it, may soon enjoy
the full consummation of all, in body and soul, I humbly beg at thy hand, O
our most merciful God, for thy Son Christ Jesus sake. That that blessed
Son of thine, may have the comsummation of his dignity, by entering into his
last office, the office of a Judge, and may have society of humane bodies in
heaven, as well as he has had ever of soules^ And that as thou hate sin
it self, thy hate to sin may be expressed in the abolishing of all
instruments of sin, The allurements of this world, and the world it self;
and all the temporary r^uenges of sin, the stings of sickness and of death;
and all the castles, and prisons, and monuments of sin, in the grave. That
time may be swallowed up in Eternity, and hope swallowed in possession, and
ends swallowed in infiniteness, and all men ordained to salvation, in body and
soul, b^ one entire and everlasting sacrifice to thee, where thou may
receive delight from them, and they glory from thee, for evermore. Amen.

19. Oceano tandem emenso, aspicienda resurgit Terra; vident, justice, medici,
iam cocta mederi se posse, indicijs. At last, the Physicians, after a long and
stormy voyage, see land; They have so good signs of the con^oction of the
disease, as that they may safely proceed to purge.
19. MEDITATION.
ALl this while the Physicians themselves have been patients, patiently
attending when they should see any land in this Sea, any earth, any cloud, any
indication of concoction in these waters. Any disorder of mine, any
pretermission of theirs, exalts the d^sease, accelerates the rages of it; no
diligence accelerates the concoction, the maturitie of the disease; they must
stay till the season of the sickness come, and till it be ripened of it self,
and then they may put to their hand, to gather it, before it fall off, but they
cannot hasten the ripening. Why should we look for it in a disease, which is
the disorder, the discord, the irregularitie, the commotion, and rebellion of
the body? It were scarce a disease, if it could be ordered, and made obedient
to our times. Why should we look for that in disorder, in a disease, when we
cannot have it in Nature, who is so regular, and so pregnant, so forward to
bring her work to perfection, and to light? yet we cannot awake the
Iuly-flowers in January, nor retard the flowers of the spring to Autumn. We
cannot bid the fruits come in May, nor the leaves to stick on in December. A
woman that is weak, cannot put off her ninth month to a tenth, for her
delivery, and say she will stay till she be stronger; nor a Queen cannot
hasten it to a seventh, that she may be ready for some other pleasure. Nature
(if w^ look for durable and vigorous effects) will not admit preuentions, nor
anticipations, nor obligations upon her; for they are precontracts, and she
will be left to her liberty. Nature would not be spurred, nor forced to mend
her pace; nor power, the power of man; greatness lou^s not that kind of
violence neither^ There are of them that will given that will do justice, that
will pardon, but they have their own seasons for all these, and h^ that knows
not them, shall starve before that gift come, and ruin, before the Justice,
and dye before the pardon save him: some tree bears no fruit, except much dung
be laid about it, and Justice comes not from some, till they be richly
manured: some trees require much visiting, much watring, much labor; and some
men give not their fruits but upon importunity; some trees require incision,
and pruning, and lopping; some men must be intimidated and syndicated with
Commissions, before they will deliver the fruits of Justice; some trees require
the early and the often access of the Sun; some men open not, but upon the
favors and letters of Court mediation; some trees must be ^ousd and kept
within doors; some men lock up, not onley their liber^litie, but their
Justice, and their compassion, till the solicitation of a wife, or a son, or
a friend, or a servant turn the key. Reward is the season of one man, and
importunity of another; fear the season of one man, and favor of another;
friendship the season of one man, and natural affection of another; and he
that knows not their seasons, nor cannot stay them, must lose the ^ruits; As
Nature will not, so power and greatness will not be put to change their
seasons; and shall we look for this Indulgence in a disease, or think to
shake it off before it be ripe? All this while therefore, we are but upon a
defen^iue war, and that is but a doubtful state: Especially where they who
are besieged do know the best of their defenses, and do not know the worst of
their enemies power; when they cannot mend their works within, and the enemy
can increase his numbers without^ O how many far more miserable, and far
more wor^hy to be less miserable than I, are besieged with this sickness, and
lack their Sentinels, their Physicians to watch, and lack their munition,
their cordials to d^f^nd, and perish before ^^e ^nemies weakness might inuit
them to sally, before the disease show any declination, or admit any way of
working upon it self? In me the siege is ^o far slackned, as that we may
come to fight, and so die in the field, if I die, and not in a prison.

19. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, Thou a^t a direct God, may I not say, a literal God, a God
that would be understood literally, and according to the plain sense of
all that thou say? But thou art also ( Lord I intend it to thy glory, and
let no profane misinterpreter abuse it to thy diminution) thou art a
figurative, a metaphorical God too: A God in whose words there is such a
height of figures, such voyages, such peregrinations to ^e^ch remo^e and
precious metaphors, such extentions, such spreadings, such Curtains of
Allegories, such third Heavens of Hyperboles, so harmonious eloquutions, so
retired and so reserved expressions, so commanding persuasions, so persuading
commandments, such sinews even in thy milk, and such things in thy words, as
all profane Authors, seem of the seed of the Serpent, that creepes, thou art
the dove, that flies. O, what words but thine, can express the inexpressible
texture, and composition of thy word; in which, to one Man, that argument that
binds his faith to believe that to be the Word of God, is the reverent
simplicity of the Word, and to another, the majesty of the Word; and in which
two men, equally pious, may meet, and one wonder, that all should not
understand it, and the other, as much, that any man should. So, Lord, thou
give us the same Earth, to labor on, and to lie in; a house, and a grave, of
the same earth; so Lord, thou give us the same Word for our satisfaction, and
for our Inquisition, for our instruction, and for our Admiration too; for there
are places, that thy servants Hierom and Augustine would scarce believe (when
they grew warm by mutual letters) of one another, that they understood them,
and yet both Hierome and Augustine call upon persons, whom they knew to be
far weaker, than they thought one another ( old women and young maids) to
read thy Scriptures, without con^ining them, to these or those places. Neither
art thou thus a figurative, a Metaphorical God, in thy word only, but in thy
works too. The style of thy works, the phrase of thine Actions, is
Metaphoricall^ The institution of thy whole worship in the old Law, was a
continual Allegory; types and figures ouerspread all; and figure^ flowed into
figures, and powered themselves ou^ into farther ^igures; Circumcision carried a
fig^^^ of Baptism, and Baptis^^ carries a figure of that purity, which we
shall have in perfection in the new Jerusalem. Neither did thou speak, and
work in this language, only in the time of thy Prophets; but since thou
spokest in thy Son, it is so too. How often, how much more often does thy Son
call himsel^e a way, and a light, and a gate, and a Vine, and bread, than the
Son of God, or of Man? How much oftener does he exhibit a Metaphorical
Christ, than a real, a literal? This has occasioned thine ancient servants,
whose delight it was to write after thy Copy, to proceed the same way in
their expositions of the Scriptures, and in their composing both of public
liturgies, and of private prayers to thee, to make their accesses to thee in
such a kind of language, as thou wast pleased to speak to them, in a
figurative, in a Metaphorical language; in which manner I am bold to call the
comfort which I receive now in this sickness, in ^he indication of the
concoction and maturity thereof, in certain clouds, and reside^ces, which the
Physicians observe, a discovering of land from Sea, after a long, and
tempestuous voyage. But wherefore, O my God, have thou presented to us, the
afflictions and calamities of this life, in the name of waters? so often in the
name of waters, and deep waters, and Seas of waters? must we look to be
drowned? are they bottomless, are they boundles? That's not the dialect of thy
langauge; thou have given a Remedy against the deepest water, by water; against
the inundation of sin, by Baptism; and the first life, that thou gave to
any Creatures, was in waters, therefore ^hou do^^t not ^hr^^ten v^, wi^h an
irrem^diablenesse, when our affliction is a Sea. It is so, if we consider our
selves; so thou call Gennezareth, which was but a lake, and not salt, a Sea;
so thou call the Mediterranean Sea, still the great Sea; because the
inhabitants saw no other Sea; they that dwelt there, thought a Lake, a Sea, and
the others thought a little Sea, the greatest, and we that know not the
afflictions of others, call our own the heauiest. But, O my God, that is truly
great, that ouerflowes the chan^ell; that is really a great affliction, which
is above my strength, but, thou, O God, art my strength, and then what can be
above it? Psalm. 46.3.
Mountains shake with the swelling of thy Sea, secular, Mountains, men strong
in power, spiritual mountains, men strong in grace, are shaked with
afflictions; Psa. 33.7
but thou laiest up thy sea in storehouses; even thy corrections are of thy
treasure, and thou will not waste thy corrections; when they have done their
service, to humble thy patient, thou will call them in again; for, Psa. 8.29
thou give the Sea thy decree, that the waters should not pass thy
Commandment. All our waters shall run into Jordan, Ios. 3.17
and thy servants passed Jordan dry foot; they shall run into the red Sea (the
Sea of thy Sons blood) and the red Sea, that red Sea, drownes none of thine.
But, Ecelus. 43.24.
they that sail in the Sea, tell of the danger thereof; I that am yet in this
affliction, owe thee the glory of speaking of it; But, as the wise man bids me,
verse. 27.
I say, I may speak much, and come short; wherefore in sum, thou art all.
Since thou art so, O my God, and affliction is a Sea, too deep for us, what is
our refuge? thine Arc, thy ship. In all other Seas, in all other afflictions,
those means which thou have ordained; In this Sea, in Sickness, thy Ship is
thy Physician. Sap. 14.3.
Thou have made a way in the Sea, and a safe path in the waters, showing that
thou can save from all dangers; yea, though a man went to Sea without art;
yet where I find all that, I find this added, Nevertheless thou woul^est
not, that the work of thy wisdom should be idle. Thou can save without
means; but thou have told no man that thou will: Thou have told every man,
that thou will not. When the Centurion believed the Master of the ship more
than Saint Paul, Act. 17.11.
they were all opened to a great danger; this was a preferring of thy means,
before thee, the Author of the means; but, my God, though thou be every
where, I have no promise of appearing to me, but in thy ship: Thy blessed Son
preached out of a Ship: Luc. 5.3.
The means is preaching, he did that; and the Ship was a type of the Church;
he did it there^ Thou gave S. Paul the lives of all them, Act. 27.24.
that saild with him; If they had not been in the Ship with him, the gift had
not extended to them. Mar. 5.2.
As soon as thy Son was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of
the tombs, a man with an unclean spirit, and no man could hold him, no not
with chains. Thy Son needed no use of means; yet there we apprehend the
danger to us; if we leave the ship, the means; in this case, the Physician.
But as they are Ships to us in those Seas, so is there a Ship to them too, in
which they are to stay. Give me leave, O my God, to assist my self with such
a construction of these words of thy servant Paul, to the Centurion, when the
Mariners would have left the Ship, Act. 27.31.
Except these abide in the Ship, you cannot be safe; Except they who are our
ships, the Physicians, abide in that which is theirs, and our ship, the truth,
and the sincere and religious worship of thee, and thy Gospel, we cannot
promise our selves, so good safety; for though we have our ship, the Physician,
he has not his ship, Religion; And means are not means, but in their
concatenation, as they depend, and are chained together. Iac. 3.4.
The ships are great, says thy Apostle, but a helm turns them; the men are
learned, but their religion turns their labors to good: And therefore it was
a heavy ^^^se, when the third part o^ the ships perished: Apo. 8.9.
It is a heavy case, where either all Religion, or true Religion should forsake
many of these ships, whom thou have sent to convey us over these Seas. But, O
my God, my God, since I have my ship, and they theirs, I have them, and they
have thee, why are we yet no nearer land? As soon as thy Sons Disciple had
taken him into the ship, immediately the ship was at the land, Io. 6.21.
whither they went. Why have nor they and I this dispatch? Every thing is
immediately done, which is done when thou would have it done. Thy purpose
terminates every action, and what was done before that, is undone yet. Shall
that slacken my hope? Thy Prophet from thee, has forbid it. Lam. 3.26.
It is good that a man should both hope, and quietly wait for the salvation of
the Lord. Thou put off many judgments, till the last day, many pass this
life without any; and shall not I endure the putting off thy mercy for a day?
and yet, O my God, thou put me not to that; for, the assurance of future
mercy, ^s present mercy. But what is my assurance now? What is my seal? It is
but a cloud; that which my Physicians call a cloud, in that, which gives them
their Indication. But a Cloud? Thy great Seal to all the world, the rainbow,
that ^ecured the world for ever, from drowning, Exo. 13.21.
was but a reflection upon a cloud. A cloud it self was a pillar which guided
the church, and the glory of God, 16.10.
not only was, but appeared in a cloud. Let me return, O my God, to the
consideration of thy servant Eliahs proceeding, 1 Reg. 19.43.
in a time of desperate drought; he bids them look toward the Sea; They look,
and ^ee nothing. He bids the^ again and again, seven times: and at the
seventh time, they saw a little cloud rising out of the Sea; and presently they
had their desire of rain. Seven days, O my God, have we looked for this
cloud, and now we have it; none of thy Indications are frivolous; thou make
thy signs, seals; and thy Seals, effects; and thy effects, consolation, and
restitution, whersoeuer thou may receive glory by that way.

19. PRAYER.
O Eternal and most gracious God, who though thou passedst over infinite
millions of generations, before thou came to a Creation of this world, yet
when thou beganst, did never intermit that work, but continuedst day to day,
till thou had perfited all the work, and deposed it in the hands and rest of
a Sabbath, though thou have been pleased to glorify thy self in a long
exercise of my patience, with an expectation of thy declaration of thy self in
this my sickness, yet since thou have now of thy goodness afforded that,
which affords us some hope, if that be still the way of thy glory, proceed in
that way, and perfect that work, and establish me in a Sabbath, and rest in
thee, by this thy seal of bodily restitution. Thy Priests came up to thee, by
steps in the Temple; Thy Angels came down to Iaacob, by steps upon the ladder;
we find no staire, by which thou thy self came to Adam in Paradise, nor to
Sodom in thine anger; for thou, and thou only art able to do all at once.
But, O Lord, I am not weary of thy pace, nor weary of mine own patience. I
provoke ^he^ not with a prayer, not with a wish, not with a ^ope, to more haste
than consists with thy purpose, nor look that any other thing should have
entered into thy purpose, but thy glory. To hear thy ^steps coming toward
me, is the same comfort, as to see thy face present with me; whether thou do
the work of a thousand year in a day, or extend the work of a day, to a
thousand year, as long as thou workest, it is light, and comfort. Heaven it
self is but an extention of the same joy; and an extention of this mercy, to
proceed at thy leisure, in the way of restitution, is a manifestation of heaven
to me here upon earth. From that people, to whom thou appearedst in signs, and
in Types, the Jews, thou art departed, because they trusted in them; but from
thy Church, to whom thou have appeared in thy self, in thy Son, thou will
never depart; because we cannot trust too much in him. Though thou have
afforded me these signs of restitution, yet if I confide in them, and begin
to say, all was but a Na^urall accident, and nature begins to discharge her
self, and sh^e will perfect the whole work, my hope shall vanish because it is
not in thee. If thou should take thy hand utterly from me, and have nothing
to do with me, Nature alone were able to destroy me; but if thou withdraw thy
helping hand, alas how frivolous are the helps of Nature, how impotent the
assistances of Art? As therefore the morning dew, is a pawn of the evening
fatness, so, O Lord, let this days comfort be the earnest of to morrowes, so
f^rre as may conform me entirely to thee, to what end, and by what way so^uer
thy mercy have appointed me.

20. Id^agunt. Upon these Indications of digested matter, they proceed to purge.
10. MEDITATION.
THoug^ counsel seem rather to consist of spiritual parts, than action, yet
action is the spirit and the soul of counsel. Counsels are not always
determined in Resolutions; we cannot always say, this was concluded; actions
are always determined in effects; we can say this was done. Then have Laws
their reverence, and their majesty, when we see the Judge upon the Bench
executing them. Then have counsels of war their impressions, and their
operations, when we see the seal of an Army set to them. It was an ancient
way of celebrating the memory of such as deserved well of the State, to afford
them that kind of statuarie representation, which was then called Hermes;
which was, the head and shoulders of a man, standing upon a Cube, but those
shoulders without arms and hands. All together it figured a constant supporter
of the state, by his counsel: But in this Hierogliphique, which they made
without hands, they pass their consideration no farther, but that the
Counselor should be without hands, so far, as not to reach out his hand to
foreign tentations of bribes, in matters of Counsel, and, that it was not
necessary, that the head should employ his own hand; that the same men should
serve in the execution, which assisted in the Counsel; but that there should
not belong hands to every head, action to every counsel, was never intended,
so much as in figure, and representation. For, as matrimony is scarce to be
called matrimony, August.
where there is a resolution against the fruits of matrimony, against the
having of Children, so counsels are not counsels, but illusions, where there is
from the beginning no purpose to execute ^he determina^ions of those counsels.
The arts and sciences are most properly referred to the head; that is their
proper Element and Sphere; But yet the art of proving, Logique; and the Art of
persuading, Rhetorique, are deduced to the hand, and that expressed by a hand
contracted into a sist, and this by a hand enlarged, and expanded; and evermore
the power of man, and the power of God himself is expressed so^ All things are
in hi^ hand^ neither is God so often presented ^o us, by names that carry our
consideration upon counsel, as upon execution of counsel, he is oftener called
the Lord of Hosts, ^han by all other names, that may be referred to the other
signification^ Hereby^ therefore we take into our meditation, the slipperie
condition of man, whose happiness, in any kind, the defect of any one thing,
conducing to that happiness, may ruin; but i^ must have all the pieces to
make it up. Without counsel, I had not got thus farre^ without action and
practice, I should go no farther toward health? But what is ^he present
nec^ssary action? purging: A withdrawing, a violating of Nature, a farther
weakening: O dear price, and O strange way of addition, to do it by
substraction; of restoring Nature, to violate Nature; of providing strength, by
increasing weakness. Was I not sick before? And is it a question of comfort
to be asked now, Did your Physic make you sick? Was that it that my Physic
promised, to make me sick? This is another step, upon which we may stand, and
see farther into the misery of man, the time, the season of his Misery; It
must be done now: O ouer-^^nning, ouer-watchfull, ouer-diligent, and
ouer-sociable misery of man, that seldom comes alone, but then when it may
accompany other miseries, and so put one another into the higher exaltation,
and better ^eart. I am ground even to an attenuation, and must proceed to
euacuation, all ways to exinani^ion and annihilation.

20. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, the God of Order, but yet not of Ambition, who assignest place
to every one, but not contention for place, when shall it be thy pleasure to
put an end to all these quarrels, for spiritual precedences? when shall men
leave their uncharitable disputations, which is to take place, faith or
repentance, and which, when we consider faith, and works? The head and the hand
too, are required to a perfect natural man; Counsel and action too, to a
perfect civil man; says and works too, to him that is perfi^ly spiritual. But
because it is easily said, I believe, and because it does not easily lie in
proof, nor is easily demonstrable by any evidence taken from my heart, (for
who sees th^^, who f^^rches those Rolls^) whether I do believe, or no, is it
not therefore, O my God, that thou do so frequently, so earnestly, refer us
to the hand, to the observation of actions? There is a little suspicion, a
little imputation laid upon ouer-tedious and dilatorie counsels. Many good
occasions slip away in long consultations; and it may be a degree of sloth, to
be too long in mending nets, though that must be done. Eccles. 11.4.
He that observes the wind, shall not saw, and he that regards the ^^ouds,
shall not reap; that is, he that is too dilatorie, too superstitious ^n these
observations, and ^tudies but the excuse of his own idleness in them; But,
that which ^he same wise and royal servant of thine, says in ^n other place,
all accept, and ask no comment upon it, Prou. 10 4.
He becomes poor, that deals with a slack hand^ but the hand of the
diligent makes rich; All evil imputed to the absence, all good attributed to
the presence of the ^and. I know, my God, (and I bless thy name for knowing
it^ for all good knowledge is from thee) that thou considerest the heart; but
thou take not off thine eye, till thou come to the hand. Nay, my God, does
not thy spirit intimate, that thou beginnest where we begin, (at least, that
thou allowest us to begin there) when thou orderest thine own answer to
thine own question, Psalm. 24.3.
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? Thus, he that has clean hands,
and a pure heart? Do ^^ou not (at least) send (...), first to the hand? and
is not the work of their hands, that decla^^tion of their holy zeal, (...)
the present execution ^f manifest Idolatrers, ^^lled a consecration of
^^emselues, Exodus 31.29.
by thy holy spirit? Their hands are ^alled all themselves: for, ^uen counsel
it self goes under that name, in thy word, who know best ^ow to give right
names: because the counsel of the ^riests assisted David, Saul says, the hand
of the Priest is with Dauid^ 1 Samuel 22.17.
And that which is often said by Moses, is very often repeated by thy other
Prophets, Leuit. 8.36.
These and these things, the Lord spoke, and the Lord said, and the Lord
commanmanded, not by the counsels, not by the voice, but by the hand of Moses,
and by the hand of the Prophets: Evermore we are referred for our Evidence, of
others, and of our selves, to the hand, to action, to works. There is something
before it, believing; and there is some thing after it, suffering; but in the
most eminent, and obuious, and conspicuous place, stands doing. Why then, O my
God, my bl^ss^d God, in the ways of my ^pirituall strength, come ^l so slow to
action? I was whipped by thy rod, before I came to consultation, to consider my
state, and shall I go^ no farther? As he that would describe a circle in
paper, if he have brought that circle within one inch of finishing yet if he
remove his compass, he cannot make i^ up a perfect circle, excep^ he fall to
work again to find out the sam^ center^ so, though setting that foot of my
compass^ upon thee, I have gon^ so far, as to the consideration of my self,
yet i^ I depart from thee, my center, all is vnperfit^ This proceeding to
action therefore, is a returning to thee, and a working upon my self by thy
Physic, by thy purgative physic, a free and entire euacuation of my soul
by confession. The working of purgative physic, is violent and contrary to
Nature. O Lord, I decline not this potion of confession, how ever it may be
contrary to a natural man. To take phys^cke, Gal^n.
and not according to the right method, is dangerous. O Lord, I decline not
that method in this physic, in things that burden my conscience, to make my
confession to him, into whose hands thou have put the power of absolution. ^
know that Physic may be made so pleasant, Galen.
as tha^ it may easily be taken; bu^ not so pleasant as the ver^tue and nature
of the me^dicine be extinguished I know, I am not sub^mitted to such a
confession as is a rack and tor^ture of the Conscience but I know I am not
exempt from all. If it were merely problematicall left merely indifferent
whether we should tak^ this Physic, use thi^ confession, or no, a great
Physician acknowledges this to have been his practice, Galen.
To minister many things, which he was not sure would do good but never any
other thing, but such as he was sure would do no harm. The use of this
spiritual Physic can certainly do no harm; and the Church has always
thought that it might, and doubtless, many humble souls have found, that it
has done them good. I will therefore take the cup of Salvation, Psa. 106 12.
and call upon thy Name; I will fill this Cup of compunction, as full as I have
formerly filled the Cups of wo^ldly confections, that so I may escape the cup of
Malediction, and irrecouerable destruction that depends upon that. And since
thy blessed and glorious Son, being offered in the way to his Execution, Mar.
15 23.
a Cup of Su^pefaction, to take away the sense of his pain, (a charity
afforded to condemned persons ordinarily in those places, and times) refused
that ease, and embraced the whole torment, I take not this Cup, but this
vessel of mine own sins, into my contemplation, and I power them out here
according to the Motions of thy holy Spirit, and any where, according to the
ordinances of thy holy Church.

20. PRAYER.
O Eternal, and most gracious God, who having married Man, and Woman together,
and made them one flesh, would have them also, to become one soul so, as
that they might maintain a simpathy in their affections, and have a conformity
to one another, in the accidents of this world, good or bad, so having married
this soul and this body in me, I humbly beseech thee, that my soul may look,
and make her use of thy merciful proceedings toward my bodily restitution,
and go the same way to a spiritual. I am come by thy goodness, to the use of
thine ordinary means for my body, to wash away those peccant humors, that
endangered it. I have, O Lord, a River in my body, but a Sea in my soul, and a
Sea swollen into the depth of a Deluge, above the Sea. Thou have raised up
certain hills in me heretofore, by which I might have stood safe, from these
inundations of sin. Even our Natural faculties are a hill, and might preserve
us from some sin. Education, study, observation, example, are hills too, and
might preserve us from some. Thy Church, and thy Word, and thy Sacraments, and
thine Ordinances, are hills, above these; thy Spirit of remorse, and
compunction, and repentance for former sin, are hills too; and to the ^op of
all these hills, thou have brought me heretofore; but this Deluge, this
inundation, is got above all my Hills; and I have sinned and sinned, and
multiplied sin to sin, after all these thy assistances against sin, and
where is there water enough to wash away this Deluge? There is a red Sea,
greater than this Ocean; and there is a little spring, through which this
Ocean, may power it self into that red Sea. Let thy Spirit of true contrition,
and sorrow pass all my sins through these eyes, into the wounds of thy
Son, and I shall be clean, and my soul so much better purged than my body,
as it is ordained for a better, and a longer life.

21 -- Atque annuit Ille, Qui, per eos, clamat, Linquas iam, Lazare, lectum.
God prospers their practice, and he, by them, calls Lazarus out of his tomb,
me out of my bed.
21. MEDITATION.
IF man had been left alone in this world, at first, shall I think, that he
would not have fallen? If there had been no Woman, would not Man have served,
to have been his own Tempter? When I see him now, subject to infinite
weaknesses, fall into infinite sin, without any foreign tentations, shall I
think, he would have had none, if he had been alone? GOD saw that Man
needed a Helper, if he should be well; but to make Woman ill, the Devil saw,
that there needed no third. When God, and we were alone, in Adam, that was not
enough; when the Devil and we were alone, in Eve, it was enough^ O what a
Giant is Man, when he fights against himself, and what a dwarf, when he
needs, or exercises his own assistance for himself? I cannot rise out of my
bed, till the Physician enable me, nay I cannot tell, that I am able to rise,
till he tell me so. I do nothing, I know nothing of my self: how little, and
how impotent a pe^ce of the world, is any Man alone? and how much less a piece
of himself is that Man? So little, as that when it falls out, (as it falls out
in some cases) that more misery, and more oppression, would be an ease to a
man, he cannot give himself that miserable addition, of more misery^ A man
that is pressed to death, and might be eased by more weights, cannot lay those
more weights upon himself: He can sin alone, and suffer alone, but not
repent, not be absolved, without another. Another tells me, I may rise; and I
do so. But is every raising a preferment? or is every present preferment a
station? I am readier to fall to the Earth now I am up, than I was when I lay
in the bed: O perverse way, irregular motion of Man; even rising it self is
the way to Ruin. How many men are raised, and then do not fill the place they
are raised to? No corner of any place can be empty; there can be no vacuity;
If that Man do not fill the place, other men will; complaints of his
insufficiency will fill it; Nay, such an abhorring is there in Nature, of
vacuity, that if there be but an imagination of not filling, in any man, that
which is but imagination neither, will ^ill it, that is, rumor and voice, and
it will be given ^ut, (upon no ground, but Imagination, and no man knows,
whose imagination) that he is corrupt in his place, or insufficient in his
place, and another prepared to succeed him in his place. A man rises,
sometimes, and stands not, because he does not, or is not believed to fill his
place; and sometimes he stands not, because he ouer-fills his place: He may
bring so much virtue, so much Justice, so much integrity to the place, as shall
spoil the place, burden the place; his integrity may be a Libell upon his
Predecessor, and cast an infamy upon him, and a burden upon his successor, to
proceed by example, and to bring the place it self, to an undervalue, and
the market to an uncertainty. I am up, and I seem to stand, and I go round;
and I am a new Argument of the new Philosophy, That the Earth ^oues round; why
may ^ not believe, that the ^hole earth moves in a round motion, though that
seem to me to stand, when as I seem ^o stand to my Compa^y, and yet am
carried, in a giddy, and circular motion, as I stand? Man has no center, but
misery; there and only there, he is fixed, and sure to find himself. How
little soever he be raised, he moves, and moves in a circle, giddily; and as
in the Heavens, there are bu^ a few Circles, that go about the whole world,
but many Epicicles, and other lesser Circles, but yet Circles, so of those men,
which are raised, and put into Circles, few of them move from place to place,
and pass through many and beneficial places, but fall into little Circles,
and within a step or two, are at their end, and not so well, as they were in
^he Center, from which ^hey were raised. Eue^y thing serves to exem^lifie, to
illustrate man's ^isery; But I need go ^o farther, than my self; ^or a long
time, I was not ^ble to rise; At last, I ^ust be raised by others; and now I
am up, I am ready to sink lower than before.

^1. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, how large a glass of the next World is this? As we have an
Art, to cast from on^ glass to another, and so to carry the Species a great
way off, so have thou, that way, much more; we shall have a Resurrection in
Heaven; the knowledge of that thou castest by another glass upon us here; we
feel that we have a Resurrection from sin; and that by another glass too;
we see we have a Resurrection of the body, from the mise^ies and calamities
of ^his life. This Resurre^tion of my body, shows me the Resurrection of any
soul; and both ^ere severally, of both together hereafter. Since ^hy Martyrs
under the Altar, press thee with their solicitation for the Resurrection of
the body to glory, thou would pardon me, if I should press thee by Prayer,
for the accomplishing of this Resurrection, which thou have begun in me to
(...) blessed and glorious Tr^^nity, was none to hear but you three, and yo^
easily hear one ano^ther, because you sa^ the same things. Bu^ when thy Son
cam^ to the work of Re^demption, Io. 12.28.
thou spokest and they that heard it took it for Thunder and thy Son
himself cried with a loud voice^ upon the Cross, twice^ as he, who was to
prepare his comming^ John Baptist, Mat. 27 46.50.
was the voice of a crier, and ^ot of a Whisperer. Still, ^f it be thy voice,
it is a loud voice; Deuteronomy. 5.22.
These words, ^aies thy Moses, Thou ^okest with a great voice, and thou addest
no more, ^aies he there; That which thou have said, is ^uident, and it is
evident, that none can speak so ^oud; none can bind us ^o hear him, as we
^ust thee. The most high uttered his voice: what was his voice? 2 Samuel 22.14.
The Lord ^^undred from heaven, it might be heard; But ^his voice, thy voice,
is also a mighty voice; Psalm. 68 33.
not only mighty in power, it may be heard, nor mighty in obligation, it
should be heard, but mighty in operation, it will be^ heard; and therefore
has^ thou bestowed a whol^ Psalm upon us, Psalm. 29.
to lead^ us to the consideration of thy voice. It is such a voice, as that thy
Son says, Io. 5.25.
the dead shall hear^ it; and that's my state^ And why, O God, do thou not
speak to me^ in that effectual loudness? Saint John heard a voice, Apo. 1.12.
^^d he turned about to see ^he voice: sometimes we ^^e too curious of the
^^strument, by what man ^od speaks; but thou ^peakest loudest, when ^hou
speak to the ^eart. There was silence, and I heard a voice, Job. 4.16
says ^ne, to thy servant Job. I ^earken after thy voice, (...) thine
Ordinances, and ^ seek not a whispering ^n Conuenticles; but yet, O my God,
speak louder, that so, though I do ^eare thee now, then I may hear nothing
but thee. My sins cry aloud; Cains murder di^ so; my afflictions cri^
aloud; Psa. 93.3.4.
The floods hau^ lifted up their voice, (an^ waters are afflictions) bu^ ^hou,
O Lord, art migh^tier than the voice o^ many waters; than ma^ny temporal, many
spi^rituall afflictions; tha^ any of either kind; and why do thou no^ speak
to me in that voice? Ecclus. 8.8.
What is man, and whereto serves he? what is hi^ good, and what is his evil?
My bed of sin is no^ ^uill, not desperately evil, for thou do call me out
of it; but my rising out of it is not good, (not perfitly good) if thou call
not louder, and hold me now I am up. O my God, I am afraid of a fearful
application of those words, when a man ^ath done, then he begin^eth; Ibid. v.
7.
when his body is unable to sin, his sinful memory sins over his old
sins again; and that which thou would have us to remember for
co^punction, we remember with delight. 1 Samuel 19.15.
Bring him to me in his bed, that I may kill him, says Saul of David; Thou
have not said so, that is not thy voice. Ioasb his own servants slew him, when
he was sick in his bed; 2 Chro. 24.25.
Thou have not ^uffered that, that my servants should so much as neglect me,
or be weary of me, in my sickness. Thou threatnest, Amos 3.12.
that as a shepherd takes out of the mouth of the Lion, two legs, or a peec^
of an ear, so shall the children of Israel, that ^well in Samaria, in the
corner of a bed, and in Da^ascus, in a couch be ta^en away. That even they
that are secure from danger, shall perish; How much more might I, who was in
the bed of death, die? But thou have not dealt so with me. Act. 5.15.
As they brought out sick persons in beds, that thy servant Peter's shadow
might ouer-shadow them; Thou have, O my God, ouer-shadowed me, refreshed me:
But when will thou do more? when will thou do all? when will thou speak in
thy loud voice? when will thou bid me take up my bed and walk? Mat. 96
As my bed is my affections, when shall I bear them so as to subdue them? As
my bed is my afflictions, when shall I bear them so, as not to murmr at
them? When shall I take up my bed and walk? not lie down upon it, as it is my
pleasure, not sink under it, as it is my correction? But, O my God, my God,
the God of all flesh, and of all spirit too, let me be content with that in my
^ainting spirit, which thou declarest in this decayed flesh, that as this body
is content to sit still, that it may learn to stand, and to learn by standing
to walk, and by walking to travel, so my soul by obeying this thy voice of
rising, may by a farther and farther growth of ^hy grace, proceed so, and be
so established, as may remove all suspicions, all iealousies between thee and
me, and may speak and hear in such a voice, as that still I may be
acceptable to thee, and satisfied from thee.

21. PRAYER.
O Eternal and most gracious God, who have made little things to signify
great, and conuaid the infinite merits of thy Son in the water of Baptism,
and in the Bread and Wine of thy other Sacrament, unto us, receive the
sacrifice of my humble ^hanks, that ^hou have not only af^orded me, the
ability ^o rise out of this bed of weariness and discom^ort, ^ut have also
made this bodily rising, by thy grace, an earnest of a second resurrection from
sin, and of a third, to everlasting glory. Thy Son himself, always
infinite in himself, and incapable ^f addition, was yet pleased to grow in the
Virgi^s womb, and to grow in stature, in the sight of men. Thy good pu^poses
upon me, I ^now, have their determination and perfection, in thy holy will
upon me; there thy grace is, and there I am altogether; but manifest the^ ^o
unto me in thy seasons, and in thy measures and degrees, that I may not only
have that comfort of knowing thee to be infinitely good, but that also of
finding thee to be every day better and better to me: and that as ^hou gave
Saint Paul, ^he Messenger of Satan, to humble him, so for my ^umiliation, thou
may give me thy self, in this ^nowledge, that what ^race soever thou af^ord
me to day, yet I should perish to morrow, if I had not to morrowes grace too.
Therefore I beg of thee, my daily bread; and as thou gave me the bread of
sorrow for many days, and since the bread of hope for some, and this day the
bread of possessing, in rising by that strength, which thou the God of all
strength, have infused into me, so, O Lord, continue to me the bread of life;
the spiritual bread of life, in a faithful assurance in thee; the
sacramental bread of life, in a worthy receiving of thee; and the more real
bread of life, in an everlasting union to thee. I know, O Lord, that when thou
had created Angels, and they saw thee produce foul, and fish, and beasts,
and worms, they did not importune thee, and say, shall we have no better
^reatures than these, no better companions than these; but staid thy leisure,
and then had man delivered over to them, not much inferior in nature to
themselves. No more do I, O God, now that by thy first mercy, I am able to
rise, importune thee for present confirmation of ^ealth; nor now, tha^ by thy
mercy, I am brought to see, that thy correction has wrought medicinally upon
me, presume I upon that spiritual strength I have; but as I acknowledge, that
my bodily strength is subject to every pu^^e of wind, so is my spiritual
strength to every blast of vanity. Keep me therefore still, O my gracious
God, in such a proportion of both strengths, as I may still h^^e something to
thank thee for, which I have received, and still something to pray for, and
ask at thy hand.

^^. Si^ morbi fomes tibi cura; ^he Physicians consider the root and occasion,
the embers, and coals, and fuel of the disease, and seek to purge or correct
that.
^2. MEDITATION.
HOw ruinous a farm has man taken, in ^aking himself? how ^eady is the house
eue^y day to fall down, and how is all the groun^ ouer-spread with weeds^ all
the body with diseases? where not only every turfe, but every stone^ bears
weeds; not only every muscle of the flesh, but every bone of the body, has
some infirmitie^ every little flint upon the face of this soil, has some
infectious weed, every tooth in our head, such a pain, as a constant man is
afraid of, and yet ashamed of that fear, of that sense of the pain. How
dear, and how of^^n a rent does Man ^ay for this farm? he ^ies twice a day,
in ^ouble meals, and how ^^tle time he has to raise (...) rent? How many ho^^
days to call him from ^s labor? Every day is ^alfe-holy day, half spent ^n
sleep. What repara^ions, and subsidies, and ^ontributions he is put to,
^esides his rent? What ^edicines, besides his di^^? and what Inmates ^e is
feign to take in, besides ^is own family, what infectious diseases, from
other men. Adam might have had Paradise for dressing and keeping it; and then
his ren^ was not improued to such a labor, as would have made his brow sweat;
and yet he gave it over; how far greater a rent do we pay for this farm,
this body, who pay our selves, who pay the farm it self, and cannot live upon
it? Neither is our labor at an end, when we have cut down some weed, as
soon as it sprung up, corrected some violent and dangerous accident of a
disease, which would ^aue destroyed speedily; ^or when we have pulled up that
weed, from the very root, recovered ^ntirely and soundly, from that particular
disease; but the whole ground is of an ill nature, the whole soil ill
disposed; there are ^nclinations, there is a propensnesse to diseases in the
body, out of which without any other disorder, diseases will grow, and so we
are put to a continual labor upon this farm, to a continual study of the
whole complexion and constitution of our body. In the distempers and diseases
of soiles, soreness, dryness, weeping, any kind of barrenness, the remedy
and the physic, is, for a great part, sometimes in themselves; sometime the
very situation releeues them, the hanger of a hill, will purge and vent his
own malignant moisture; and the burning of the upper ^urfe of some ground (as
^ealth from cauterizing) ^uts a new and a vigorous youth into that soil, and
there rises a kind of Phoenix out of the ashes, ^ fruitfulness out of that
which was barren before, and by that, which is the barrennest of all, ashes.
And where the ground cannot give it self physic, yet it receives Physic
from other grounds, from other soiles, which are not the worse, for having
contributed that help to them, from Marle in other hills, o^ from slimie sand
in other shoares: grounds help themselves, or hurt no other grounds, from
whence they receiu^ help. But I have taken a farm at this hard rent and upon
those heau^^ covenants, that it can afford it self no help; (no part of my
body, if it were cut off, would cure another part; in some ca^es it might
preserve a sound part, but in no case recover an infected) and, if my body may
have any Physic, any Medi^ine from another body, one Man from the flesh of
another Man (as by Mummy, or any such composition,) it must ^ee from a man that
is dead, and not, as in other soiles, which are never the worse for
contributing their Marle, or their fat slime to my ground. There is nothing in
the same man, to help man, nothing in mankind to help one another, (in this
sort, by way of Physic) but that he who ministers the help, is in as ill
case, as he that receives it would have been, if he had not had it; for he,
from whose body the Physic comes, is dead. When therefore I took this farm,
undertook this body, I undertook to draine, not a marish, but a moat, where
there was, not water mingled to offend, but all was water; I undertook to
perfume dung, where no one part, but all was equally unsavory; I undertook to
make such a thing wholesome, as was not poison by any manifest quality, intense
heat, or cold, but poison in the whole substance, and in the specifique form
of it. To cure the s^arpe accidents of diseases, is a great work; to cure the
disease it self, is a greater; but to cure the body, the root, the occasion of
diseases, is a work reserved for the great Physician, which he does never any
other way, but by glorifying these bodies in the next world.

22. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, what am I put to, when I am put to consider, and put off, the
root, the fuel, the occasion of my sickness? What Hypocrates, what Galen,
could show me that in my body? It lies deeper than so; it lies in my soul:
And deeper than so; for we may well consider the body, before the soul came,
before inanimation, to be without sin; and the soul before it come to the
body, before that infection, to be without sin; sin is the root, and the
fuel of all sickness, and yet that which destroies body and soul, is in
neither, but in both together; It is in the vnion^ of the body and soul; and,
O my God, could I prevent that, or can I dissolve that? The root, and the fuel
of my sickness, is my sin, my actual sin; but even that sin has
another root, another fuel, original sin; and can I deuest that? Will thou
bid me to separate the leven, that a lump of Dowe has received, or the salt,
that the water has contracted, from the Sea? Do thou look, that I should so
look to the fuel, or embers of sin, that I never take fire? The whole world
is a pile of fagots, upon which w^e are laid, and (as though there were no
other) we are the bellows. Ignorance blows the fire, Leu. 5.2
He that touched any unclean thing, though he knew it not, became unclean,
Number. 15 22.
and a sacrifice was required, (therefore a sin imputed) though it were done in
ignorance. Ignorance blows this Coal; but the^ knowledge much more; for, Romans
1.32.
there are that know thy judgments, and yet not only do, but have pleasure
in others, that do against them. Nature blows this Coal; Ephesians. 2.3.
By nature we are the children of wrath: And the Law blows it, thy Apostle,
Saint Paul, ^ound, That sin took occasion by the Law, that therefore because
it is forbidden, we do some things. If we break the Law, we sin; 1 ^o. 3.4.
Sin is the transgression of the Law; And sin it self becomes a Law in our
members. Romans 7.23.
Our fathers have imprinted the seed, infused a spring of sin in us: Ier. 6.7.
As a fountain casts out her waters, we cast out our wickedness; 7.26.
but we have done worse than our fathers. We are open to infinite tentations,
and yet, as though we lacked, Jacob. 1.14.
we are tempted of our own lusts. And not satisfied with that, as though we
were not powerful enough, or cunning enough, to demolish, or undermine our
selves, when we our selves have no pleasure in the sin, we sin for others
sakes. Genesis 3.6.
When Adam sinned for Eues sake, and Solomon to gratify his wives, 1 Reg. 1^.3.
it was an vxorious sin: When the Judges sinned for Iezabels sake, 1 Reg. 21
and Ioab to obey David, 1 Par. 22 3.
it was an ambitious sin: Lu^. 23.23.
When Pilat sinned to humor the people, Act. 12.3.
and Herod to give farther contentment to the Jews, it was a popular sin:
Any thing serves, to occasion sin, at home, in my bosom, or abroad, in my
Mark, and aim; that which I am, and that which I am not, that which I would
be, proves coals, and embers, and fuel, and bellows to sin; and do thou
put me, O my God, to discharge my self, of my self, before I can be well?
When ^hou bidst me to put off ^he old Man, Ephesians. 4.22.
do thou mean, not only my old habits of actual sin, but the oldest of
all, original sin? When thou biddest me purge out the ^euen, 1 Cor. 5.7.
do thou mean, not only the sowrenesse of mine own ill contracted customs,
but the innate tincture of sin, imprinted by Nature? How shall I do that which
thou requirest, and not falsify that which thou have said, that sin is gone
over all? But, O my God, I press thee not, with thine own text, without thine
own comment; I know that in the state of my body, which is more discernible,
than that of my soul, thou do effigiate my Soul to me. And though no
Anatomist can say, in dissecting a body, here lay the coal, the fuel, the
occasion of all bodily diseases, but yet a man may have such a knowledge of his
own constitution, and bodily inclination to diseases, as that he may prevent
his danger in a great part: so though we cannot assign the place of original
sin, nor the Nature of it, so exactly, as of actual, or by any diligence
deuest it, yet having washed it in the water of thy Baptism, we have not
only so cleansed it, that we may the better look upon it, and discern it,
but so weakened it, that howsoever it may retain the former nature, it does not
retain the former force, and though it may have the same name, it has not the
same venom.

22. PRAYER.
O Eternal and most gracious God, the God of security, and the enemy of
security too, who would have us always sure of thy love, and yet would
have us always doing something for it, let me always so apprehend thee, as
present with me, and yet so follow after thee, as though I had not apprehended
thee. Thou enlargedst Ezechias lease for fifteen years; Thou renewedst
Lazarus his lease, for a time, which we know not: But thou did never so put
out any of these fires, as that thou did not rake up the embers, and wrap up
a future mortality, in that body, which thou had then so reprieued. Thou
proceedest no otherwise in our souls, O our good, but fearful God: Thou
pardonest no sin so, as that that sinner can sin no more; thou make no
man so acceptable, as that thou mak^st him impeccable. Though therefore it were
a diminution of the largeness, and derogatorie to the fullness of thy mercy,
to look back upon those sins which in a true repentance^ I have buried in
the wounds of ^hy Son, with a jealous or suspicious eye, as though they were
now my sins, when I had so ^ransferred them upon ^hy Son, as though ^hey
could now be raised to life again, to condemn me to death, when they are
dead in ^im, who is the fountain of life, yet were it an irregular
anticipation, and an insolent presumption, to think^ that thy present mercy
extended to all my future sins, or that there were no embers, no coals of
future sins left in me. Temper therefore thy mercy so to my soul, O my
God, that I may neither decline to any faintness of spirit, in suspecting thy
mercy now, to be less hearty, less sincere, than it uses to be, to those
who are perfitly reconciled to thee, nor presume so of it, as either to think
this present mercy an antidote against all poisons, and so expose my self to
tentations, upon confidence that this thy mercy shall preserve me, or that
when I do cast my self into new sins, I may have new mercy at any time,
because thou did so easily afford me this.

23. -- Metusque, Relabi They warn me of the fearful danger of relapsing.
23. MEDITATION.
IT is not in man's body, as it is in the City, that when the Bell has rung,
to cover your fire, and ^ake up the embers, you may lie down, and sleep
without fear. Though you have by ^^ysicke and diet, raked up the embers of
your ^isease, still there is a fear of a relapse; and the greater danger is in
that. ^uen in pleasures, and in ^^ines, there is a propriety, ^ Meum and Tuum;
and a man is most affected with that pleasure which is his, his by former
en^oying and experience, and most intimidated with those pains which are his,
his by a woeful ^ense of them, in former ^fflictions. A covetous ^erson, who
has preoccupated all his senses, filled all his capacities, with the delight
of gathering, wonders how any man can have any taste of any pleasure in any
opennesse, or liberality; So also in bodily pains, in a fit of the stone, the
patient wonders why any man should call the Gout a pain: And he that has
felt neither, but the toothache, is as much afraid of a ^it of that, as either
of the other, of either of the other. Diseases, which we ^euer felt in our
selves, ^ome but to a compassi^^ of others that have ^ndured them; Nay,
^ompassion it self, comes ^o no great degree, if we ^aue not felt, in some
^roportion, in our selves, that which we lament and condole in another. But
when we have had those torments in their ^^altation, our selves, we ^emble at
a relapse. ^hen we must pant through all those fiery ^eats, and sail through
^ll those ouerflowing sweats, when we must watch through all those long
nights, and mourn through all those long days, ( days and nights, so long,
as that Nature her self shall seem to be perverted, and to hau^ put the
longest day, and the longest night, which should be six months asunder, into
one natural, unnatural day) when we must stand at the same bar, expect the
return of Physicians from their consultations, and not be sure of the some
verdict, in any good Indications, when we must go the same way over again,
and not see the same issue, this is a state, a condition, a calamity, in
respect of which, any other sickness were a ^onualescence, and any greater,
less. It adds to the affliction, that relapses are, (and for the most part
justly) imputed to our selves, as occasioned by some disorder in us; and so we
are not only passive, but active, in our own ruin; we do not only stand
under a falling house, but pull it down upon us; and we are not only
executed, (that implies guiltiness) but we are executioners, (that implies
dishonor;) and executioners of our selves, (and that implies impiety.) And we
fall from that comfort which we might have in our first sickness, from that
meditation, Alas, how generally miserable is Man, and how subject to diseases,
(for in that it is some degree of comfort, that we are but in the sta^e common
to all) we fall, I say, to this discomfort, and self accusing, and self
condemning; Alas, how improvident, and in that, how unthankful to God and his
instruments am I, in making so ill use of so great benefits, in destroying so
soon, so long a work, in relapsing, by my disorder, to that from which they
had delivered me; and so my meditation is fearfully transferred from the body
to the mind, and from the consideration of the sickness, to that sin, that
sinful carelessness, by which I have occasioned my relapse. And amongst the
many weights that aggrauate a relapse, this also is one, that a relapse
proceeds with a more violent dispatch, and more irremediably, because it finds
the Country weakened, and depopulated before. Upon a sickness, which as yet
appears not, we can scarce fix a fear, because we know not what to fear;
but as fear is the busiest and irksomest affection, so is a relapse (which is
still ready to come) into that, which is but newly gone, the nearest object,
the most immediate exercise of that affection of fear^.

23. EXPOSTVLATION.
MY God, my God, my God, thou mighty Father, who have been my Physician; Thou
glorious Son, who have been my physic; Thou blessed Spirit, who have
prepared and applied all to me, shall I alone be able to overthrow the work
of all you, and relapse into those spiritual sicknesses, from which your
infinite mercies have withdrawn me? Though thou, O my God, have filled my
measure with mercy, yet my measure was not so large, as that of thy whole
people, the Nation, the numerous and glorious nation of Israel; and yet how
often, how often did they fall into relapses? And then, where is my assurance?
how easily thou passedst over many other sins in them, and how vehemently
thou insistedst in those, into which they so often relapsed; Those were their
murmurings against thee, in thine Instruments, and Ministers, and their
turnings upon other gods, and embracing the Idolatries of their neighbors. O
my God, how slipperie a way, to how irrecouerable a bottom, is murmuring? and
how near thy self he comes, that murmures at him, who comes from thee? The
Magistrate is the garment in which thou apparellest thy self; and he that
shoots at the clothes, cannot say, he meant no ill to the man: Thy people
were fearful examples of that; for, how often did their murmuring against thy
Ministers, end in a departing from thee? when they would have other officers,
they would have other gods; and still to days murmuring, was to morrowes
Idolatry; As their murmuring induced Idolatry, and they relapsed often into
both, I have found in my self, O my God, (O my God, thou have found it in me,
and thy finding it, has showed it to me) such a transmigration of sin, as
makes me afraid of relapsing too. The soul of sin, (for we have made sin
immortal, and it must have a soul) The soul of sin, is disobedience to
thee; and when one sin has been dead in me, that soul has passed into
another sin. Our youth dies, and the sins of our youth with it; some sins
die a violent death, and some a natural; poverty, penury, imprisonment,
banishment, kill some sins in us, and some die of age; many ways we become
unable to do that sin; but still the soul lives, and passes into another
sin; and that, that was licentiousness, grows ambition, and that comes to
indeuotion, and spiritual coldness; we have three lives, in our state of
sin; and where the sins o^ youth expire, those of our middle years enter;
and those of our age after them. This transmigration of sin, found in my
self, makes me afraid, O my God, of a Relapse: but the occasion of my fear,
is more pregnant ^han so; for, I have had, I have multiplied Relapses already.
Why, O my God, is a relapse so odious to thee? Not so much their murmuring, and
their Idolatry, as their relapsing into those sins, seems to affect thee, in
thy disobedient people. They limited the holy one of Israel, Psalm. 78.41.
as ^hou complainest of them: That was a murmuring; but before thou chargest
them with the fault it self, in the same place, thou chargest them, with the
iterating, the redoubling of that fault, before the fault was named; How often
did they provoke me in the Wilderness; and grieve me in the Desert? That
which brings thee to that exasperation against them, as to say, that thou
would break thine own oath, Number. 14 22.
rather than leave them unpunished, (They shall not see the land, which I swear
unto their fathers) was because they had tempted thee ten times, infinitely;
upon that, thou threatnest with that vehemency, Ios. 23.12.
if ye do in any wise go back, know for a certainty, God will no more drive
out any of these Nations from before you; but they shall be snares, and traps
unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, till ye perish.
No tongue, but thine own, O my GOD, can express thine indignation, against a
Nation relapsing to Idolatry. Idolatry in any Nation is deadly; but when the
disease is complicated with a relapse (a knowledge and a profession of a former
recovery) it is desperate: And thine anger works, not only where the
evidence is pregnant, and without exception, (so thou say, when it is said,
Deuteronomy. 13 12.
That certain men in a City, have withdrawn others to Idolatry, and that
inquiry is made, and it is found true, the City, and the inhabitants, and the
Cattle are to be destroyed) but where there is but a suspicion, a rumor, of
such a relapse to Idolatry, thine anger is awakened, and thine indignation
stirred. I^s. 22.11.
In the government of thy servant Joshua, there was a voice, that Reuben and
Gad, with those of Manasseh, had built a new altar. Israel does not send one to
enquire; 1.12.
but the whole congregation gathered to go up to war against them; and there
went a Prince of every Tribe: And they object to them, not so much their
present declination to Idolatry, as their Relapse; Number. 25 4.
is the iniquity of Peor too little for us? An idolatry formerly committed, and
punished with the slaughter of twenty four thousand delinquents. At last
Reuben, and Gad satisfy them, that that Altar was not built for Idolatry, but
built as a pattern of theirs, that they might thereby profess themselves to
be of the same profession, that they were; and so the Army returned without
blood. Even where it comes not so far, as to an actual Relapse into
Idolatry, Thou, O my GOD, becommest sensible of it; though thou, who see the
heart all the way, preuentest all dangerous effects, where there was no ill
meaning, how ever there were occasion of suspicious rumors, given to thine
Israel, of relapsing. So odious to thee, and so aggravating a weight upon
sin, is a relapse. But, O my God, why is it so? so odious? It must be so,
because he that has sinned, and then repented, has weighed God and the
Devil in a balance; he has heard God and the Devil plead; and after
hearing, given Judgment on that side, to which he adheres, by his subsequent
practice; Tertull.
if he return to his sin, he decrees for Satan; he prefers sin before
grace, and Satan before God; and in contempt of God, declares the precedence
for his adversary: And a contempt wounds deeper than an injury; a relapse
deeper, than a blasphemy. And when thou have told me, that a relapse is more
odious to thee, need I ask why it is more dangerous, more pernicious to me?
Is there any other measure of the greatness of my danger, than the greatness
of thy displeasure? How fitly, and how fearfully have thou expressed my case,
in a storm ^t Sea, if I relapse? (They mount up to Heaven, Psa. 107 26.
and they go down again to the depth:) My sickness brought me to thee in
repentance, and my relapse has cast me farther from thee: Mat. 12.45.
The end of that man shall be worse than the beginning, says thy Word, thy
Son; My beginning was sickness, punishment for sin; but a worse thing may
follow, Io. 8.14.
says he also, if I sin again: not only death, which is an and, worse than
sickness, which was the beginning, but Hell, which is a beginning worse than
that end. Mar. 14 70.
Thy great servant denied thy Son, and he denied him again; but all before
Repentance; here was no relapse. O, if thou had ever readmitted Adam into
Paradise, how abstinently would he have walked by that tree? and would not the
Angels, that fell, have fixed themselves upon thee, if thou had once
readmitted them to thy sight? They never relapsed; If I do, must not my case
be as desperate? Not so desperate, for, Ecclus. 2.18.
as thy Majesty, so is thy Mercy, both infinite: and thou who have commanded
me to pardon my brother seventy seven times, have limited thy self to no
Number. If death were ill in it self, thou would never have raised any dead
Man, to life again, because that man must necessarily die again. If thy
Mercy, in pardoning, did so far aggrauate a Relapse, as that there were no
more mercy after it, our case were the worse for that former Mercy; for who is
not under, even a necessity of sinning, whilst he is here, if we place this
necssity in our own infirmity, and not in thy Decree? But I speak not this, O
my God, as preparing a way to my Relapse out of presumption, but to preclude
all accesses of desperation, though out of infirmity, I should Relapse.

23. PRAYER.
O Eternal and most gracious God, who though thou be ever infinite, yet
enlargest thy self, by the Number of our prayers, and take our often
petitions to thee, to be an addition to thy glory, and thy greatness, as ever
upon all occa^ions, so now, O my God, I come to thy Majesty with two Prayers,
two Supplications. I have Meditated upon the Ielouzie, which thou have of thine
own honor; and considered, that Nothing can come nearer a violating of that
h^nor, nearer to the Nature of a scorn to thee, then to sue out thy P^rdon,
and receive the Seal^s of Reconciliation to thee, and then return to that
sin, for which I needed, and had thy pardon before. I know that this comes to
near, to a making thy holy Ordinances, thy Word, thy Sacraments, thy Seals,
thy Grace, instruments of my Spiritual Fornications. Since therefore thy
Correction has brought me to such a participation of thy self ( thy self, O
my God, cannot be parted) to such an entire possession of thee, as that I
durst deliver my self over to thee this Minute, If this Minute thou would
accept my dissolution, preserve me, O my God the God of constancy, and
perseverance, in this state, from all relapses into those sins, which have
induced thy former Judgments upon me. But because, by too lamentable
Experience, I I know how slippery my customs of sin, have made my ways of
sin, I presume to add this petition too, That if my infirmity overtake me,
thou forsake me not. Say to my Soul, My Son, thou have sinned, do so no
more; Ecclus. 21.1.
but say also, that though I do, thy Spirit of Remorce, and Compunction shall
never depart from me. Thy Holy Apostle, Saint Paul, 2. Cor. 11.25.
was shipwrackd thrice; and yet still saved. Though the rocks, and the sands,
the heights, and the shallowes, the prosperity, and the adversity of this
world do diversely threaten me, though mine own leakes endanger me, yet, O
God, let me never put my self aboard with Hymeneus, Timo. 1.19.
nor make shipwreck of faith, and a good Conscience, and then thy longliud,
thy everlasting Mercy, will visit me, though that, which I most earnestly pray
against, should fall upon me, a relapse into those sins, which I have truly
repented, and thou have fully pardoned.

FINIS.
