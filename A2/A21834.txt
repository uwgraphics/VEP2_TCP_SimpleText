By the Queen. royal blazon or coat of arms A true Copy of the Proclamation
lately published by the Queens Majesty, under the great Seal of England, for
the declaring of the Sentence, lately given against the Queen of Scotts, in
form as follows.
ELizabeth, by the grace of God, Queen of England, France and Ireland,
defender of the Faith, etc.

Whereas we were given to understand very credibly, (though to our great
grief,) that diverse things were, and of late time had been compassed,
imagined and resolutely intended, tending directly to the hurt and destruction
of our Royal person, and to the subversion of the Estate of our Realm, by
foreign invasions, and rebellions at home, as well by the Queen of Scotts,
remaining in our Realm under our Protection, as by many diverse other wicked
persons with her priuitie, who had freely confessed the same, and had th^reupon
received open trial, Judgment and Execution according to the laws for their
deserts: And though, in very truth we were greatly and deeply grieved in
our mind, to think or imagine that any such unnatural and monstrous Acts
should be either devised, or willingly asseted unto against us, by her being a
Princess borne, and of our sere and blood, and one also whose life and honor
we had many times before saved and preserved: Yet were we so directly drawn to
think all the same to be true, by the sight and understanding of such proofs,
as were manifestly produced before us, upon matters that had as well proceeded
from her self, as from the conspirators themselves, who voluntarily and
freely without any coertion had confessed their conspirations, both jointly
with her, and directed by her, against our Person and our Realm, and therefore
also we saw great reason, to think the same over dangerous, to be suffered to
pass onwarde to take their full effect. Wherefore, we were by sundry Lords
of our Nobility, and others our loving subjects, earnestly moved and
counseled, to take vndelaied order, for the inquisition and examination of all
these dangerous enterprises, and conspiracies by sundry ways directly auowed
to be by the said Queen of Scotts, against us and our Realm certainly
intended, and also to use all present means with expedition, to withstand, or
rather to prevent the same. And for that we were very unwilling to proceed
against her, considering her birth and Estate, by such usual sort as by the
common laws of the Realm, we might have lawfully done, which was, by
indictment and arrainment by ordinary Iuries: therefore, in respect both of
our own honor, and of her person, we yielded, by good advise given to us, to
proceed in the most honorable sort that could be devised within our Realm
to the examination hereof, according to a late Act of Parliament made the
xxiii. day of November, in the xxvii. year of our Reign. Whereupon by our
Commission under our great Seal of England, bearing Date at our Castle of
Windsor in our County of Barkshire, the sixth day of October now last past, we
did for that purpose, according to the said Statute, assign, name, and
appoint all the Lords and others of our Privy counsel, and so many other
Earls and Barons Lords of Parliament, of the greatest degree and most ancient
of the Nobility of this our Realm, as with the (...) Lords and others of our
privy counsel, made up the number of forty and two, adding also thereto a
further number, according to the tenor of the foresaid Act of Parliament, of
certain of the chiefest and other principal Judges of the Courts of Record
at Westminster, amounting in the whole to the number of forty and seven, to
examine all things compassed and imagined, tending to the hurt of our Royal
person, as well by the said Queen of Scotts, by the name of Marie, the
daughter and heir of James the fifth, late King of Scotts, commonly called
the Queen of Scotts and Dowager of France, as by any other by her priuitie,
and all the circumstances thereof, and thereupon, according to the tenor of ye
said Act of Parliament, to give sentence or judgment, as upon good proof the
matter unto them should appear, as by the same Commission more fully
appears.

And where afterward the more part of the said Counselors, Lords and Judges
in our said Commission named, that is to say, the number of xxxvi. did in the
presence and hearing of the said Queen of Scots, where she remained at our
Castle of ^oderinghaie, at diverse days and times in public place, very
exactly, uprightly, and with great deliberation, examine all the matters and
offenses, whereof she was charged and accused, tending to the dangers before
rehearsed and mentioned in our said Commission, and all the circumstances
thereof, and heard also at large in all favorable manner, what the same Queen
did, or could say for her excuse and defense in that behalf: whereupon
afterward on the xxv. day of October now last past, all the said Counsel,
Lords, and Judges that had heard and examined the same cause in the said
Queens presence, as before is mentioned, with one assent and consent, after
good deliberation, did give their sentence and judgment in this sort following:

That after the first day of June, in the seven and twentieth year of our
reign, and before the date of our said Commission, diverse things were
compassed and imagined within this Realm of England, by Anthony Babington and
others, with the priuitie of the said Mary, pretending title to the Crown of
this Realm of England, tending to the hurt, death and destruction of our
Royal person:

And likewise, that after the same first day of June, and before the date of
our said Commission, the said Mary, pretending title to the same Crown, had
compassed and imagined within the same Realm, diverse things tending to the
hurt, death and destruction of our royal person, contrary to the form of the
said Statute: which sentence and judgment, the same Lords and Commissioners
have with one full consent caused to be put in writing, and duly engrossed,
with the whole process of their proceedings thereto belonging, and have
subscribed the same with their hands, as by a record thereof showed to us,
more fully and largely does appear.

And whereas also, sithence the same sentence and Judgment so given and
recorded, the Lords and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, have
also at sundry times in open Parliament, heard and considered the principal
evidences, proofs, and circumstances, whereupon the same sentence and
Judgment was grounded, and have by their public assent in Parliament
affirmed the same to be a just, lawful and true sentence, and so have allowed
and approved the same in writing presented unto us: and have also notified to
us, how deeply they did foresee the great and many imminent dangers, which
otherwise might and would grow to our person, and to the whole Realm, if
this sentence were not fully executed: and consequently therefore, they did by
their most humble and earnest petitions in that behalf, of one Accord, having
access unto us (upon their sundry requests) most instantly upon their knees,
pray, beseech, and with many reasons of great force and importance, move and
press us, that the said sentence and Judgment so justly and duly given, and
by them approved, as is aforesaid, might (according to the express tenor of
the said Act of Parliament by our Proclamation under our great Seal be
declared and published, and the same also finally executed.

But after such most earnest request, so made to us from all the said Lords
and Commons in Parliament, they perceiving by our own speeches and answers,
how deeply we were grieved to hear of these horrible and unnatural attempts
and actions of that Queen, whose many former offenses, manifestly and
daungerously committed against us, our Crown and Realm, we had ouerpassed
with our over great clemency, contrary to the many aduices and requests of
our Subjects, as well in Parliament as otherwise: and therefore they also,
understanding from our self, how desirous we were to have some other means
devised by them in their several places of Parliament, to withstand these
mischiefs intended both against our self, and the public quiet state of our
Realm, and surety of our good subjects, then by execution of the foresaid
sentence, as was required: they did after their sundry consultations apart, and
conferences jointly with one accord, in the names of all the Lords of
Parliament, even by the particular votes of them all assembled, and also of the
Commons with one universal assent, representing the State of all our Realm, at
their several times of access unto us, allege, declare, and protest, that
upon their long, many, and advised consultations and conferences by our
commandment, and for our satisfaction in that behalf had, they could not by
any means find or devise, how the suertie of our Royal person, and the
preservation of themselves and their posterity, with the good state of the
Realm, might be provided for and continued, without the publication and due
execution of the said sentence.

Whereupon, being not only moved to our grief, but also overcome with the
earnest requests, declarations, and important reasons of all our said
Subjects, the Nobles and Commons of our Realm, whose judgment, knowledge, and
natural care of us, and the whole Realm, we know does far surmount all
others being not so interessed therein, and so justly to be esteemed: and
perceiving also the said sentence to have been honorably, lawfully and justly
given, agreeable to Justice and to the Laws of our Realm: we did yield, and
do according to the said Statute by this our Proclamation under our great
Seal of England, declare, notify, and publish to all our loving Subjects,
and other persons whatsoever, that the said sentence and Judgment is given in
manner aforesaid, to the intent, that they and every of them, by this our
Proclamation may have full understanding and knowledge thereof. We do also will
you, that you do return this our Proclamation into our Court of Chauncerie,
as speedily as you may conveniently, with the place and time of the proclayming
thereof thereupon indorsed, whereof fail you not.

In witness whereof, we have caused this our Proclamation to be made Patent,
and sealed with the great Seal of England. At our Manor of Richmont the iiii.
day of December, the xxix. year of our Reign, and in the year of our Lord
God, 1586.
God save the Queen.
Imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queens most
excellent Majesty.
