beginning of the Reign of our noble Progenitor King Richard the second, was
wholly burnt and made desolate by the French, and two of the said Churches and
the body of the 3. Church utterly burnt, rased and defaced, so as there
remained only the ruinated Chancell of one of the said Churches, which the
late Inhabitants of the said Town have repaired and maintained for the
exercise of divine service, and administration of the Sacraments. Now forasmuch
as the opportunity of the place (by reason of the conueniencie of harbor and
our Castle there, together with our incoporating the same, and granting
liberties thereunto) has induced many to resort unto, build, and dwell in the
said Town, whereby the said Chauncell is not of sufficient greatness and
capacity to contain the present Inhabitants who resort thither to divine
service, and the estate of the said Town and the Inhabitants thereof is not
such, as that they are able to build a Church fit and decent for those who do
already reside there, much less for those who in future times are hoped to
resort thither.

Inhabitants thereof, and favoring their honest and religious save concerning

and charitable a work, whereby not only a competent and convenient place for
preaching the word, and other divine exercises may be prepared, but also that
Trade and Traffic for the benefit of the said Inhabitants and other our
loving Subjects, may hereafter be there increased.) Of our especial Grace and
Princely compassion have given and granted, and by these our letters Patents
do give and grant unto our said loving Subjects the Mayor and Burgesses of our
said Town of Yarmouth and their Successors, and to their Deputy the bearer
hereof, full power, license, and authority to ask, gather receive, and take
