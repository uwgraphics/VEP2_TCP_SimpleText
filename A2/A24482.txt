An Alphabetical Prophecy found in Dubline, in the year 1689, kept secret
then, because of the hight of Popery. Showing what should fall out in 1692.
THese Letters five P. R. J. W. and L.
Together strive which of them shall prevail,
P. claims pre eminency over R. J. L. and W.
For I. and R. makes all the World ado:
P. pulled down shall be: but R. shall rise,
J. L. shall fall, and W. shall gain the prise;
A. ante M. shall then hold E. his staff,
And keep at under S. G. J. and F.
D then shall dance, and G. shall glorify,
And B. shall boast of this great Victory;
N. after all recover shall the day,
And O. his Banner valiantly display;
No wapon traimd against Z, prosper shall,
Tho other Nations they keep under thrall.
Therefore, good People strive, yea, strive I say,
For that Above, which never will decay.
Note, All Letters here, except Z. and W.
Are those, the Irish Characters allow,
And when they do admit them with the rest,
Then may the Land again be at the best.
For the Readers better understanding the Author has set down the Denotation of
these Letters.

P. Popery, R. Reformed Religion, J. James, L. Lewis, W. William, I. and R. in
the fourth line, Interest and Religion, A. ante M. Anti Monarchy, or State
Government, E. Europe, S. Spain, T. Turkey, C. Cham of Tartery, F. France, D.
Denmark, G. Germany, B. Britain, N. Norway, O. Orange, Z. Church of GOD.
