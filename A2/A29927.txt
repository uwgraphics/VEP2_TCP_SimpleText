To the Honorable the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses in Parliament Assembled,
The Humble Petition of Percivall Brunskell, Gent.
Shows,
THAT King Charles the Second, and his Now Majesty, were Bountifully Inclined
to Your Petitioner; but such as were Entrusted to fulfill Their Majesty's
Pleasure, neglected your Petitioner: And your Petitioner being sent to
Parliament, his Case, with the Committees Resolutions thereon, and the Reports,
Opinions and Certificates of Learned Men in the Late Reigns and This,
Representing your Petitioner Worthy of Reward, were laid before the Late House,
27 December 1690. And several Laws are since Made, and others have been on the
Stage for Redress of Abuses, particularly set forth in your Petitioner's Case.
And Last Session your Petitioner's Case was Re-Examined and Reported worthy the
Consideration of the House; and the Honorable Committee Resolved and Reported
their Resolutions, That the House be moved, That an Humble Address be made to
His Majesty, That He would be Graciously pleased to take into His Princely
Consideration the Services and Sufferings of your Petitioner, and Reward the
same: But the Report being made the 20th Day of April last, just at the ending
of the Session, and when the House was Busily Employed to find out Persons
suspected to be Guilty of Bribery, the Sad Effects of Buying and Selling
Offices, and Places of Trust and Profit, to which all Miscarriages by Sea and
Land-may be imputed. Your Petitioner was dropped and remains a poor Petitioner,
stripped of all his own Estate and Practice, plunged 3000 l. in Debt, which
Increase^h every Year 180 l. for want of Something to pay off either Principal
or Interest, and is forced to Abscond, so that he cannot work for his own and
Families Subsistence, and has gotten Nothing after Long Attendance and
Dependence, but what will not pay off Tradesmen to give him Credit for his own
and Families Necessaries. And though Offices become Void daily, wherein your
Petitioner may be Serviceable to His Majesty, and His People, and Pay Debts,
and make Provision for himself and Family: And although all that Love and
Honor His Majesty, Agree, That your Petitioner's Afflictions have rather
Improved than Impaired him for the Service of the Government, yet your
Petitioner is neglected, whereby his Oppression is greater than Tongue or Pen
can express.

Now for as much as all in such Employments as your Petitioner was in, are
obliged to take Oaths which enjoin them to make Discoveries and Proposals for
the Service of the Public, as your Petitioner has done, Oaths being all the
Security the People have, That the Laws shall be duly and impartially Executed,
without which the People cannot be Maintained and Defended in their Rights,
Liberties and Properties: Your Petitioner hopes that the Parents of the Law
will not suffer him to Languish under Oppression, for obeying Lawful Commands.

Your Petitioner therefore most Humbly prays this Honorable House to take his
Sad and Deplorable Case into Consideration, That he may be Relieved as to your
Honors may seem Meet and Just:

And your Petitioner, as in Duty Bound, shall Ever Pray, etc.
