THE CAUSES OF GOD's WRATH Against ENGLAND; AND A Faithful Warning From the
LORD to Speedy Repentance; Foretold by, and delivered in, A LETTER to the
KING, Dated the 4th of the 7th month, 1663.

By CHARLES BAYLEY, then Prisoner in the City of Bristol, now in the Tower of
London.

London, Printed in the Year, 1665.

A Copy of a LETTER to the KING, etc.
O KING, The Whirlwind of the Lord God is coming on the Nation, and Woe is ready
to be poured forth upon all the workers of Iniquity: so that all are to to have
to meet the Lord in Judgment; and thou amongst the rest, O King, wilt not be
exempted; but naked must thou appear before the King of kings, who is come, and
risen to take to himself the Possession, and sole Rule of all the Kingdoms of
this World: And this in England will first be known and brought to pass, in as
much, as it has first been warned above, and beyond all the Nations and
Kingdoms of the world.

Therefore hear, and give ear, O King, what in the Life of Love I shall in much
plainess say unto thee, and what in the Vision of the Almighty, I have seen
concerning those, who seem to be nearly allied unto thee.

I saw, and beheld them as men feeding themselves for the slaughte^, fatted and
full, living in their fullness without measure; then I heard a voice, which
said, Their time is but short; and verily, I laid up the saying in my heart,
waiting in quietness until I might have a fit opportunity to speak unto thee
concerning this matter, for I often remember the promise I made to thee, when I
spoke unto thee last, which was, That if I did know any thing which would do
thee hurt, I should tell thee of it; so that I being thus bound by promise, I
could do no other in this Message and Warning of Love than to advise thee of
these following things, which tend to thy utter ruin, hurt and destruction.

First, The great Rioting and excess of Eating and Drinking without fear, and
rising up to play, all which is found daily within thy Courts, the Lord's Soul
abhors it.

Secondly, The great Chambering and Wantoness, and the making provision for the
flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof, the Spirit of the Lord God is grieved
therewith, and his Anger is kindled against it, and ready to break forth, and
burn with unquenchable fire, which not any thing will be able to quench, except
true and unfeigned Repentance, which will be hard to be found within thy
dewlling place, O King.

Thirdly, The great and grievous Oppressions which are within thy
dewlling place, the Land mourns because thereof; as also, the great Swearing,
and For-swearing Pride, and Hypocrisy which is within the Gates, the Lord's
Controversy is against thy Family for it.

Fourthly, The many and grievous Injuries which the Lord's People have
sustained under thy Name and Government, the Lord of Truth is highly displeased
with thee because of it.

For consider, O King, (as thou art an earthly Prince) would it not have been a
grievous thing for thee to have seen thy true and faithful Subjects, to be
taken and cast into Prison, and there kept until death, and the spoiling their
goods, to the undoing, not only of themselves, but their Families, for no other
cause, but for their Loyalty and Subjection to thee, having a tender care and
respect to thy Law; yea, may I not say, that thing has gone already very near
thee, even the things which have been done against thy Fathers Subjects, and
thy own: And thou know right well, that thou art not clear from taking
revenge upon thine and their adversaries for such like doings.

Then, O King, What may thou in righteousness expect to be done, or will be
done unto all those who have had a hand in the imprisoning in like manner, the
Friends, Servants and Subjects of the Most High God, for no other cause, then
before mentioned in the similitude concerning thee and thy Loyal Subjects.

Verily, O King, because I love thy soul, I cannot flatter thee, but in the
truth and sincerity of my heart deal faithfully and plainly, and tell thee,
thou art highly guilty in, and concerning this matter, in as much as thou have
consented to the harm which has been done to the Followers of the Lamb, who is
the absolute KING of Kings, and PRINCE of Princes, and JUDGE of all the Judges,
Rulers and Potentates in the Earth, and he will verily take Vengeance on his,
and his Fathers enemies; and this is the Word of the Lord God unto thee, which
shall surely be fulfilled ere this Generation pass away, and I shall be clear
of thy blood concerning this matter, before the Lord and all his holy Angels,
and Saints who have suffered Death in nasty Holes and Dungeons in this Nation,
and still do in many places suffer in like manner, for no other cause, than for
the Cause of God, and the Testimony of a good Conscience, witnessing against
Tithes, that insupportable Popish Superstition, and Imposition, which has been
contrary to the Mind and Will of God set up in this Nation; as also Swearing,
and other things, which for conscience sake they could not do, they have, and
do still suffer deeply.

And know, O King, that the Death and sufferings of Gods People is verily come
very nigh unto him: Therefore this further I have to say unto thee, in the
tender bowels of God's Love, Oh that the Repentance of Nineveh could but yet be
seen or found within thy House, before the Anger of the Lord break forth, and
there be no remedy.

Sodom and the parts adjacent thereunto, were consumed because of Lust,
Idleness and fullness of bread; now see whether all these things be not found
within thy borders; than why should I be blamed, for preaching Repentance unto
all, who thus in the Light and Day of God are found guilty of these things?

And then again, read and consider, was it not because of Whordoms, and such
like doings, which caused the Spirit of Truth to say, That it repented the Lord
at the heart that he had made man, by which it was said, My Spirit shall not
always strive with man; so that the flood of his wrath overwhelmed the wicked,
and brought them under his sore displeasure. And seeing that God is
unchangable, the same yesterday, to day, and for ever, may not the same thing
be expected suddenly to be done, though not by water, yet in and by
unquenchable fire it shall be done; and what if I should say in the Spirit of
the Lord, that this fire is already kindled, before which the wicked shall be
as stubble fully dried; surely, O King, I am ready to seal the same with my
blood: yea, and furthermore, I say, it shall never be extinguished more until
that Iniquity, and the workers thereof shall utterly be consumed from off the
Earth; though at present it may, and has but yet appeared as a little spark,
yet behold it burns secretly and hiddenly, and none but those who are in the
Light and Mystery of God can see it, or understand the matter; but
notwithstanding the wicked shall feel it to their utter overthrow and misery.

Further, I say unto thee, Believe not those that most flatter thee with
fawning and flattering Titles and Behavior, for verily they are thy greatest
enemies, and will soonest turn their hand against thee, and this is the
infallible Truth of God unto thee, written in tender love and pity unto thy
soul, and one day thou shall come to witness, and know this to be the Truth of
God, sent unto thee by a real and unfeigned Lover of thy soul, which I desire
might find acceptance with God.

When thou wast low in thine own eyes, God brought thee without the help of the
arm of flesh into thy Kingdom, and thou being now highly exalted, there is
great danger nigh: I know it not from man, nor by man, but in, and by the
Spirit of the Lord God, who will not respect the persons of any.

And this is a true and faithful Message unto thee, O King, written, and sent
in love to thy immortal soul, to the end, thou might not be wholly rejected
of the Lord, and deprived both of this Kingdom, and that which is to come; for
if a repenting heart be but yet found within thy breast, thou may surely be
everlastingly happy for ever in the Heavens with the blessed Host of God,
though thy outward Kingdom should be taken from thee suddenly, which thing only
lies in the power of him who has given thee life and breath, to do and
dispose of to whom he will; and lay this to heart, that without holiness no man
shall see the Lord, but in dreadful Judgment. O King, of a truth for thy sake I
could dye, that thou may yet live and reign for ever and ever.

Written by one that is a Prisoner in Newgate in the City of Bristol, for the
Testimony of God's Truth, and for the witnessing against the Idol-Priests,
against whom the Anger of the Lord is kindled, who has decreed that not one of
them shall remain in the Land; And let me not be accounted thy Enemy, because I
tell thee the truth in this matter.

There are many more things, which the controversy of the Lord is against; but
for brevities sake I shall forbear to speak of them at present, desiring so
much favor of thee, as to see thy face, that I might yet further show thee the
Mind and Will of God, in the doing of which, thou would be blessed; which is
my true and unfeigned desire concerning thee.

the 4th of the 7th month, 1663. Known by the Name of CHARLES BAYLEY.

THE END.
