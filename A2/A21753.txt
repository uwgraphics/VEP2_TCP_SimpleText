By the Queen.
WHere in the Parliament holden at Westminster, the second day of Apryl, in
the.xiii. year of the reign of our sovereign Lady the Queen, there was for
the relief of diverse poor decayed towns, and of great multitudes of her
poor subjects, who otherwise were likely to perish, or to become
unprofitable and dangerous to the common weal, among other provided and
established, one good and beneficial statute, entitled, An act for the
continuance of making of cappes. By mean of which statute, great numbers of
idle, poor, and impotent persons were for a season set on work, while the awe
of the said statute, and fear of due execution thereof continued, to the
marveylous great commodity of this Realm, and help of the needy, and
redress of ill occupied persons, as by the experience thereof has been
manyfestly proved. And whereas nevertheless by little and little, the
disobedience and wanton disorder of evil disposed and light persons, more
regarding private fancy and vanity, then public commodity or respect of
duty, has increased by want of execution of the said law, whereby those
good and honest subjects that have means of the said statute, set to work a
great number of poor people, are like to be driven to give over their said
trade of making of cappes, and to send abroad again into idleness and
misery, those multitudes that have been by them relieved, whereby is lykely to
grow great enormitie and inconvenience, if speedy remedy therefore be not in
time provided. The Queens most excellent Majesty therefore tenderly
consydering the premises, straightly charge and commands al Justices of
assizes, Justices of peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, and other head
officers of Cities, Borroughes, and Towns corporate, and the Lords,
Stewardes, Bayliffes, and other officers of Leetes, Lawdayes, and liberties,
and al and singular Constables, Third borroughes, Tithingmen, Churchwardens,
and al other her highness subjects, to whom the executyng or puttyng in ure
of the same statute any way may apparteyne, that every one of them, accordying
to his office, place, and callying, do their uttermost endeavor for the due
execution of the said statute: and that they the said Bayliffes, Constables,
Third borroughes, Tithingmen, Churchwardens, and al other like inferior
officers, and every of them, to every Sunday and Festiual day, make diligent
view and search in all Churches, Chapels, and al other places within the
circuites and compasses of their offices and aucthorities, for all and singular
breakers and offenders of the said statute, and without delay cause the names
of al such offenders, and of the parents, gardians, governors, and masters
of every child, servant, and ward, so offendyng, together with the day and
place of the offense committed, to be then written, and to be lawfully and
orderly presented, at such assizes, sessions, or courts, (next after such
offenses) as have authority to enquire or determine the said offenses: And
that al Majors, Sheriffs, and Bayliffes, of Cities, Borroughes, and Towns
Corporate, and al lords of Leetes, Lawdayes, and liberties, do immediately upon
the proclamation hereof, call before them all the said Constables, Third
borroughes, Tithyngmen, Churchwardens, inferior Bayliffes, and al other the
abouesaid inferior officers, that shallbe under their charge of government, and
them, and every of them, forthwith in our names do s^rayghtly charge and
command, that they, and every of them, to the uttermost of their powers, do
every Sunday and Festiual day, make such diligent view and search, and such
note also of the names of al such offenders, and such presentment of al such
offenses as is abouesayde: and that al Justices of assizes, and Justices of
peace, in their circuites and sessions, and al Stewardes in their Leetes, upon
pain of her Majesty's high displeasure, omit not in any wise from time to
time, specially to give in charge, and cause to be enquired of al offenses
against the said statute committed, or to be committed within their several
precinctes or jurisdictions, and also do duly hear and determine the same,
punishyng every of the said offenders according to the said statute: and
that all the said lords and owners of Leetes, and Lawdayes, do as much as in
every of them shall lie, to cause their Stewardes througly to execute their
office and authority, according to the same statute, and that upon every
such offense found, both the said owners of Leetes, and also the rulers and
chief governors of every City, Borrough, Town, or Hamlet, where any such
offense shall be tried and found, shall do their uttermost endeavor by the law
to recover, have, and obtain of every such offendour, all the penalties to
them, or any of them, by the said statute forfeyted, or to be forfeyted.

God save the Queen.
