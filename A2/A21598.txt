AProclamation against selling of Ships.
THe Queens Majesty understanding out of sundry parts of her Realm, and
specially of such as be nigh to her Sea costs, what greatscaratie of Timber
there is, and in long time not to be recovered, meet for the building of
Ships, either for her own Majesty's Navy, or for the Merchants of her
Realm: has by good advice of her Counsel, thought meet, as for some
particular relief herein, to command: and so her Highness by these presents
does command, that no manner person, borne within her obeisance, shall sell or
by any manner means, directly or indirectly, alienate any manner Ship or
Vessel, of what burden soever the same shall be, being meet to sail upon the
seas, to any manner of person, either borne or resident out of her Highness
dominions, as the same will answer at their uttermost peril.

And likewise her Highness commands all manner of persons, to have due regard
to the observation of the Statutes ordained for the good keeping and increase
of Timber, so as upon inquisition to be made therefore by her Highness
Commission, they be not found therein in default.

Yeuen at her Majesty's honor of Hampton Court, the xxiii. day of August, in
the first year of her Highness Reign. God save the Queen.
Imprinted at London in Powles Church yard, by Richard Judge, and John
Cawood, Printers to the Queens Majesty.
