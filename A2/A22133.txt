By the King.
A Proclamation against Steelets, Pocket Daggers, Pocket Dagges and Pistols.
THe love and care We have toward the preservation of Our Subjects, and the
keeping of Our Land from being polluted with blood; does make Us strive with
the evil humors and depraved customs of the times, to reform and suppress
them by Our Princely policy and Justice; To which end and purpose, We have by
the severity of Our Edict, (proceeding from Our own pen, and by the exemplar
censure and Decrees of Our Court of Star Chamber) put down, and in good part
mastered that audacious custom of Duelles and Challenges, and have likewise by
a Statute made in Our time, taken away the benefit of Clergy in case of
Stabbing, and the like odious Man-slaughters:

Wherefore it being always the more principal in Our intention to prevent,
then to punish, being given to understand of the use of Steelets, pocket
Daggers, and pocket Dags and Pistols, which are weapons utterly unserviceable
for defense, Military practice, or other lawful use, but odious, and noted
Instruments of murder, and mischief; We do straightly will and command all
persons whatsoever, that they do not henceforth presume to wear or carry
about them any such Steelet or pocket Dagger, pocket Dagge or Pistol, upon
pain of Our Princely Indignation and displeasure, Imprisonment and Censure in
the Star Chamber; And We do likewise straightly forbid upon like pain all
Cutlers, or other person, to make or sell any of the said Steelets, pocket
Daggers, pocket Dagges or Pistols.

Given at White Hall, the 25. day of March, in the fourteenth year of Our
Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the nine and
fourtieth. God save the King

Majesty. ANNO DOM. 1616.
