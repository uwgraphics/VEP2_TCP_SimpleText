By the Queen.
THe Queens Majesty understanding the great disorder that of late has been,
and yet is daily used, in and about the Cities of London and Westminster, and
especially in and about Westminster hall, and the palace of Westminster, by
diverse light and evil disposed persons, who in great routes and companies have
assembled themselves together, against such as be informers upon penal laws
and statutes, commonly called Promoters, And so being assembled, have not only
beaten, and very evil entreated diverse of the same informers: but also have
made great outcries against the same persons, whereby the Courts and places of
justice in Westminster hall, and other places there abouts, have been much
disquieted and troubled, and the Queens Majesty's peace broken, whereof great
mischief and inconvenience might likely grow, if speedy remedy be not
therein provided.

Wherefore, her Majesty does straightly charge and command all persons, that
they, nor any of them, do here after commit or do, or consent, or procure to
be committed or done, any such disorder or misbehauiour by any act, deed or
mordes, openly or secretly against any such informers, or against any other
person or persons, in any the places aforesaid, or in any other place within
this Realm, upon pain to suffer imprisonment of their bodies by the space of
three months, without bail or maineprise, and also have such further open
punishment for their offenses by whipping, standing upon the pillorie, or
otherwise, as by her Majesty's Counsel of her Highness Court of
Star Chamber shall be judged and ordered. And further, her Majesty's pleasure
and express commandment is, that diligent inquiry shall be made of such, as
have been offenders in any the premises, to the intent that due and condign
punishment and correction may be to them ministered, according to their
offenses. And that all Justices, Officers and ministers, shall in all places
where such offenses shall happen hereafter to be committed, cause the
offenders, their procurers, and abetters, to be apprehended and taken, and
presently to be committed to some prison, there to remain in safe keeping,
until they may be brought before her Majesty's said Counsel in the
Star Chamber, there to be ordered to such punishment, as by the said
Counsel shall be thought convenient.

Given at her Majesty's palace of Westminster, the tenth day of November 1566,
in the eight year of her Majesty's reign.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty.

Anno Domini 1594.
