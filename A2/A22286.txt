By the King.
A Proclamation to restrain the excessive carriages in Wagons and four
wheeled Carts, to the destruction of the Highways.
WE have many times heretofore expressed the great care and desire We always
had, that the Common Highways and Bridges within this Realm, might be kept
in due repair, for the general ease and good of Our loving Subjects, and have
given many and often directions to Our Privy Counsel, Judges, and other
Officers, for effecting thereof; And finding a chief cause of the exceeding
decays thereof, to be the extraordinary carriages with Carts, and Wagons with
four wheels, carrying excessive burdens, whereby the Highways are so
galled, and the very foundations of any Ordinary Bridges shaken, that no
ordinary repair can maintain and keep the same passable: We did heretofore
cause Our Judges to advise thereof, by whom We were resolved, that those
extraordinary carriages were common Nusances and annoyances against the Weal
Public, and the use of them an offense against Our Crown and Laws: We did
therefore by Our Proclamation, in the sixteenth year of Our Reign of England,
prohibit the going or travailing with any such Cart or Wagon. Notwithstanding
all which, and the great care, as well of Our Privy Counsel, as of Our Judges
in their Circuites, We find no amendment, but that the High ways, not only
in the remoter parts, but also in places of Our own usual access, are still
spoiled and ploughed up by those unreasonable carriages, so as they continue
still so foul and deep, as they are often times almost impassable. We therefore
intending redress and reformation in the Premises, and being resolved, that
for the effecting thereof, a more severe and strict course be taken then has
been heretofore, have thought it agreeable to Our own princely goodness,
once more to warn Our Subjects thereof, that such as shall hereafter offend,
and shall be justly punished therefore, may be altogether inexcusable.

And therefore, We do by this Our Proclamation, and by the advice of the Lords
and others of Our Privy Counsel, straightly charge, require and command; That no
common Carryer, or other person, or persons whatsoever, shall from, and after
the Feast of S. Michael the Archangel, now next coming, use, go, or travel
with any Cart, or Wagon, made with four wheels, nor with any other Cart or
Wagon whatsoever, but only such Wagons and Carts, as shall have but two
wheels; and that they do not carry in any Wayne, Cart, or carryage, to be
after that time used, any load or burden, above the weight of twenty hundred,
nor shall draw, or use their said Cards, or waynes, or carryages, with more
then five horses at once in their journey, upon pain of our heavy indignation,
and displeasure, and of the seuerest censure of Our high Court of Star Chamber,
and such further pains, punishments, and imprisonments, as by the Laws and
Statutes of this Realm may be inflicted upon the offenders, for such their
offense and contempt.

And therefore We do hereby require Our Attorney general, for the time being,
upon notice given unto him of any such offender, or offenders, to prosecute
him, and them in the said high Court of Starchamber, there to receive such
censure and punishment, by fine, imprisonment, and otherwise, as their
contempts and offenses against this Our Royal Command shall deserve. And
lastly, We do hereby will and require, all Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes,
Justices of Peace, and other Our Officers, and Ministers, in all Counties, and
privileged places whatsoever, within this Our Realm, That they, and every of
them, in their several Offices, and places, do from time to time provide, and
see to the due execution of this Our pleasure, and Royal Commandment; And
that they discover and make known all offenders herein, that they may be
severely punished for their offenses and contempts; As also, that they neglect
not, but continue the repair and maintenance of Highways, Bridges, and
Causeys within this Our Realm, according to the Laws, Statutes, and
Ordinances now in force, and Our Commandment heretofore given, as they tender
Our pleasure, and will answer the contrary, at their uttermost perils.

Given at Our Court at Windsor, the sixth day of August; In the years of Our
Reign of England, France, and Ireland, the twentieth, and of Scotland the six
and fiftieth.
