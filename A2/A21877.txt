By the Queen.
A Proclamation straightly commanding that no Corn nor other Victual, nor any
Ordonance, nor furniture for shipping be carried into any of the king of Spaines
countries, upon pain to be punished as in case of Treason: nor that any of the
like kinds be caned out of the Realm^ to other Countnes without special
l^^ence upon sundry great p^^^es.
FOrasmuch as it is manifestly seen to all the world how it has pleased
Almighty God of his most singular savor to have taken this our Realm into
his special protection these many years, even from the beginning of our
reign, in the midst of the troubled estate of all other kingdom next
adjoining, with a special preservation of our own person, as next under his
Almightinesse supreme Governor of the same, against many malicious and violent
attempts: for which cause it behooves us in very duty, first to continue our
own perpetual thanks to his goodness for so wonderful a favor, and next to
employ all the forces of those his good people which he has committed to our
rule and gouermnent, in defense of themselves and all our Realms and dominions,
against such our Potent and violent enemies, as only for the maintenance of
our selves and our Subjects in the profession of his holy Gospel, have these
many years made open wars against us, and consquently also not to be
negligent, but to foresee and provide by all good, politic, and lawful
means, that our said enemies be not aided, strengthened, and made more able
to increase and extend their forces against us and our people, by sufferance of
provisions for the war, as Corn and other uictuall, munition of sundry
kinds of Artillery, Shot, and Powder, and other furniture for shipping to be
carried out of any our dominions, or from other Foreign parts through our
narowe Seas by wilful sufferance, into Spain, Portingall, and other dominions
of the king of Spain, who of any Monarch or Prince in Christendom, is at this
day the onelyenemie to our state, and has longest continued in mortal war
against us, manifestly violating the treaties of Peace, and refusing to live in
such peace with us, as has been by solemn contrats and Leagues aunciently
established and continued betwixt our Predecessors and his, and specially
betwixt the two Princes in this latter age of most noble memory the Emperor
Charles, and King Henry the eight our Fathers: notwithstanding we even at the
beginning of our Reign, did offer by a noble Ambassade to have faithfully
observed and confirmed the same, which by the said king was refused. For this
purpose cosidering that our Realms and dominions are plentifully blessed by
Gods singular favor, with the plenty of Corn and all other Victual, and
with furniture of sundry kinds of munition meet for the sustentation and
defense of our own people against all Foreign enemies, and also for
maintenance and furniture of our Armies both by Sea and Land, which we are
constrained to prepare and hold against his violence. And that it is most
manifest that the said king, though he have abundance of treasure by his Indian
Mines, yet he has in his own Country great wanes of such kind of Victual,
specially of Corn and munition for the war, and of Mariners and other
furniture for his Hause, a whereof our dominions have by Gods goodness,
plenty, for the recovery whereof he is forced to expend great treasures to
get Corn, ship, ping, and other necessaries for shipping, yea Mariners out of
the East countries of Almaine, and has attempted to corrupt some of our
Subjects, and some Strangers also inhabiting our Countries, to procure the
conueiance of such kinds of his wants, either directly by stealth to known
Countries, or indirectly and coulourably first to some other Countries adjacent
to his, and from thence to be conveyed to his own. We do therefore by our
Royal authority, and as in Princely providence we are bound to do, most
straightly charge and command, and so we will it to be published and known,
that no person either naturally borne within any of our Realms or residing
within the same, do from henceforth carry or cause to be carried, or be
assisting to any that shall carry, or that shall bargain or contract for
carriage of any kind of some or Grain, or of any Ordonance, Brass, or Iron,
Shot, Powder, or any Cordage, Tackle, or any thing belonging to the surniture
of any Shipping out of our Realm into Spain, or into any Dominions of the
king of Spain, or to any adjacent countries from the which the same may be
colourably carried into the king of Spaines Dominions, nor that any person
suffer any of the aforesaid kinds which he may say, to be carried to the said
countries of the said king as long as he shall use and exercise any war
against us or our subjects: upon pain that all and every person so offending
in any point before mentioned, shall be taken, used, tried, judged, and executed
as traitors to us and our contries. Ind further we will and command, that no
manner of Corn or grain, nor any ordonance of Brass or Iron, be carried out of
any our dominions to any other foreign Countries, besides the king of Spaynes
countries, without our special license, upon pain that whosoever being owner
of the Corn or Ordonance shall so do, or shall be assisting thereto, and the
Owner and Master of the vessels shall be committed to dose prison, and there to
remain one whole year, and further also, until they have made fine, and
answered the same to the quadruple va^^^ of the Corn and Ordonance carried. And
because it has pleased almighty God, to grant this year to our country such
plenty of Corn, (...) it is likely, that diverse of our people near the Sea
coasts, shall be desirous to have cause to vent some part of that which they
shall have of their own growth, for lack of sale within our realm: For
remedy thereof, We do first advise, and earnestly require, the principal
persons of wealth, both in Towns corporate and other places (in such a time as
this is, so needful to restrain caryage of grain to our ene^ies, or out of
our Realm, whereby our enemies may be relieved) to buy in the markets of the
countries near the Sea coast, such quanti^^^ of grain as the owners cannot
forbear, but shall be constrained to sell for their necessity: And the same
to keep in store to serve the mar^ets in the latter end of the year, before
the coming of new Corn to use.

And if by such good means (which we desire greatly to be used) the necessity
of them that shall be constrained to sell their grain, cannot (...) satisfied
without such venting out of our Realm, upon certificate to be made to our
Counsel, from those which shall have commission as ^ath been accustomed to
restrain the carrying of Corn out of the Realm, of such necessity to have
the same vented out of the Realm, There tall be order and power given from our
Counsel, to the same Commissioners, upon their certificates, that jointly with
the the warrant of our treasurer of England, to the officers of the ports,
such as be the proper owners of such Corn, and not Merchants, shall pass by
sea with such quantity only as shall manifestly appear, may be spared to be
transported in English ships into the Countries, with whom we are in ^ood
amity, and not into any other, with such bonds and conditions as the enemy
may not be relieved thereby. And like wise order shall be ^iuen to the
foresaid Commissioners, that where any just cause shall be to carry and Corn
from one port of this our Realm to another, for ^eliefe of our people in
parts where there is lack of Corn, There shall be by consent of the said
Commissioners, authority given to our of^^cers of our ports, to suffer such
quantity to be carried to the ports of the Countries where need shall be. And
yet with such caution, as if a^y portion shall by color thereof, be carried out
of the Realm, besides the forfeiture of the bonds that shall be taken by our
officers, the owners ^f the Corn, and the Masters and Owners of the Ships
shall suffer imprisonment for one whole year, and further until fine be made
to us, (...) the quadruple value of the Corn. And this our order, we command
to be duly executed by all manner our officers, ministers, and subjects, there
default shall or may be found, upon pain of our indignation, and of such pain
as may thereto belong.

Given at the Castle of Basing, in (...) County of Southhampton, the xvi, day
of September, in the xxxiii, year of our reign. 1591.

Queens most excellent Majesty.
