MILK FOR BABES.

THE ENGLISH CATECHISM, SET DOWN IN THE Common Prayer Book, briefly explaned
for the private use of the Younger and more unlearned sort of his Parishioners
of Apleton, in the County of Berks.

By W. D.

1. PET. 2.2. As newborn Babes desire the sincere Milk of the word that ye
may grow thereby.

Ad Ecclesiae filios instruendos addendum est nostri sermonis obsequium. Non
enim timens ne spiritales and eruditi nota fastidiant ad quorum fructum
pertinet alijs insinuare quod ipsi cum magna sui vtilitate didicerunt. Leo

TO HIS PARISHIONERS GRACE, MERCY, PEACE AND LOVE, BE MVLTIPLIed through our
Lord Jesus Christ.
THE Title and frontispice of this book, shows for whom it is provided: such
as have need of milk and not of strong meat, Heb. 5.
and are unskillful in the word of righteousness. And to these I do present
and offer it as the fittest dish for their use; wherein the milk of the
Catechism is as it were chewed, and softened in the mouth, that their
understandings may the more easily receive, and digest it into nourishment, and
strength. It was my error I confess, to make an open and public offer of
this meat unto you, not considering how some had rather ever want then seem at
any time to be in need, and to perish rather then acknowledge their infirmity:
But I am at length reformed and become the man you would perchance have me to
be, an house-Chaplaine, or private Minister to Catechize, instruct, and teach
you, and your Children, and your servants at home in the rudiments and
beginnings of your Christian profession. Whosoever you be take heed how you
slight, and contemn the learning of these small and Childish things; for they
are the first principles of the Oracles of God as the Apostle calls them, Heb.
5.
and the foundation whereon the spiritual building of Grace and everlasting
blessedness stands; Neither do ye, that are yet unlearned and ignorant,
content your selves with a bare memory, and Mother-beleefe of words, without
some knowledge and understanding of what you speak, and profess and to
believe, or do. For of good and evil the more known the easier the one is to
be avoided, and the other done: And in matters of faith persuasion takes most
hold, and application is made with most comfort and assurance where
understanding leads the way. The like is to be observed in Prayer, and other
Religious works, understanding and knowledge must go along with them. 1. Cor
14.15
For I will pray with the spirit says (the Apostle) and I will pray with
understanding also. And I will singe with the spirit and I will singe with the
understanding also. Jn your several trades and callings it is easy to observe
that you have them not by roate only; but are therein skillful and
understanding, and able to give an account and a reason of your work: And my
desire and purpose is to make you as learned in the word of Righteousness,
skillful to discern both good and evil, Heb. 5. 1. Pet. 3.
and able to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope
that is in you. And for this cause I have taken this form with which the
Printer has pleased to Cloth me, and wherein I may without any trouble
continually be present among you, and upon all occasions ready to do you
service in the work of the Ministry. No time will be unseasonable for me to be
your Teacher as long as you shall find any need, or will in your selves to be
instructed. Fix and fasten me to some convenient place in your Houses
(otherwise I shall be in some danger to be swept out of doors) and let me be
unto you for a Fringe that you may look upon it, and remember all the
Commandments of the Lord and do them; And that you seek not after your own
heart and your own eyes after which you use to go a whoring. Numb. 15.
That you may remember and do all the Commandments and be holy unto your God.
J shall be well pleased to stand a side while your daily, and necessary
employments are in your hands (for there is no good kindred and agreement
betwixt us) but at your times of rest and leisure, or in the Euenings, or while
you are absent from the Church, I could wish my self your Compainon to pass a
way the time with all. Here together with your Children, and the rest of your
Family ye may continually exercise your selves, by conferring, admonishing
examining and edifying one another and searching the Scriptures whether the
things be so as you find them reported to be. By this means you may cause the
word of Christ to dwell in you richly, Colos. 3.
your Faith may be increased, and confirmed, your understanding and knowledge
in the things of God bettered, and enlarged, your affections and will refined,
and rectified, and at length come unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the
stature of the fullnes of Christ: That henceforth ye be no more Children
ready to be tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by
the sleight of men, Ephesians. 4.
and cunning craftines whereby they lie in wait to deceive: But being grounded
and settled in your own professed Religion, ye may with boldness make
resistance against the underminings of our Romish adversaries who closlie
steal into our houses, and surprise weak and unsettled minds, and wrest them
unto a denial and hate of the Church and profession whereunto they were
Baptized before they have learned either what our Church does teach them to
believe and know, or they themselves ought to profess, and practice for the
salvation of their souls. Therefore my people are gone into Captivity says
the Lord, Isai. 5.
because they have noe knowledge. Without this a man is like a City without a
wall or a trench; having not where with all to gainesay and resist an assault
made, presently thinks on a compositio^, and for some fair promises will be
content to exchange, and deliver himself for ever a slave unto the Conqueror.
Luke 11.
But God be thanked hitherto our houses, and goods are in peace as if we were
all strong men armed the Enemy has not broke in upon us spoiled our houses,
or carried any of us away Captives. And in this estate, and Liberty of truth
noe doubt we shall continue firms and settled, if so be that we be not at any
time wanting unto our selves, and neglect the means of strength and knowledge
whereby we may be enabled to resist in the day of temptation. For whosoever
has, to him shall be given and he shall have in more abundance. Luke 8.
But whosoever has not, from him shall be taken even that he seems to have
says our Savior Christ. I beseech you therefore beloved Parishioners and
exhort you by the Lord Jesus Christ that ye labor to put of all Childishnes
in understanding, and be strong in the word of God, and in the knowledge of his
truth and of your Christian duty, go on from strength to strength, from
knowledge to knowledge, from grace to grace, and give not over till you have
clothed your selves with the whole Armor of God. So shall you approve your
selves worthy of the vocation where with you are called in Jesus Christ, and
he will accept of your Godly endeavors, and zeal, and will add thereunto of
his spirit in more abundance, and increase you with increase of God, until he
shall have brought you to be perfect and complete in himself, who fills all
things, to whom be honor and praise and thanksgiving now and for ever. The
grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

MILK FOR BABES.
Question.

WHAT is your Name?

Answer.

N. or M.

Question.

Who gave you this Name?

Answer.

My Examples show that Parents have anciently used, to give names to their own
Children, ( Genesis 21.3. 1 Samuel 1.20. Luke 1.63. Mat. 1.21.) wherein at this day
it is very reasonable that their desire and direction should not be altogether
neglected by godfathers and godmothers;
Godfathers and Godmothers in my Baptism, The Christian man.
wherein I was made a Not by the bare sprinkling or dipping into the water
without the Spirit of God: (Ioh. 3.5. Romans 8.9. 1 Cor. 12.12.13.) by whom we
are properly quickened, and made lively members of Christ Jesus. 2. Cor. 3.6.
Gal. 4.6.7. Romans 8. 11. Now faith and the works of a new life will show whether
the Spirit of God, did assist and join with the work of the Minister or not.
1. Cor. 12.3. Gal. 5.16. 1. Ioh. 4.2.
member of Christ, the Child of God, and an inheritour of the kingdom of
Heaven.

Q. What did your Godfathers and Godmothers then for you?

A. They did promise and vow three things in my name. Note that all the good
and benefit in the former answer mentioned, and which we are to expect from
Christ in our Baptism sealed unto us, is with condition, namely if we shall
perform the promise made in our behalfs by our godfathers and godmothers.
Math. 16.27.

Q. What does your Godfathers promise?

A. First that I should forsake the Devil and all his works the pompes and
vanities of the wicked world, His vow.
and all the sinful lusts of the flesh. The reason hereof is because being by
baptism entered, and enroled a servant of God, and received into his house and
family, that is into his Church: you are therefore to renounce all love and
obedience to these masters, to which by nature you are subject, and to put your
self in open defiance against his enemies which are the Devil, this world,
and your own flesh. Math. 6.24. Romans 6.12. etc. Ephesians. 6.11, etc.

Secondly that I should believe all the Articles of the Christian faith: The
reason hereof is, because Christ has inseperably tied and annexed faith unto
Baptism, without which Baptism profits nothing, and salvation is not to be
had. Mar. 16.16. Act. 2.41.8.36.37.38.

Thirdly that I should keep Gods holy will and commandments, and walk in
the same all the days of my life. The reason hereof is because the faith of
belief here required of such as are Baptized must be a working, and a lively
faith, openly showing forth in the sight of God and men their obedience and
love, in performing the will and commandment of God, and of our Lord Jesus
Christ. Math. 5.16. Luke 1.74.75. Tit. 1.16. Iam. 2.17. 2. Pet. 1.4.5. 1. Ioh.
5.1.2.

Q. Do thou not think that thou art bound to believe and to do as they
have promised for thee?

A. Yes verily, and by Gods help so I will: 1. Cor. 15.10. Iam. 4.15. and I
do heartily thank our heavenly Father that he has called me, to this state of
salvation, through Jesus Christ our Savior. Ephe. 1.3. etc. 2. Tim. 1.9. and I
pray god to give me his grace that I may continue in the same to my lives end.
Math. 24.13. Luke 22.32.

Q. Rehearse. (Romans 10.8.9. Math. 10.32.33. 1. His belief
Pet. 3.15.) then the Articles, or several parts or points of thy belief, or
of those things which thou art to believe for the salvation of thy soul

A. 1. I Believe in God the father Almighty maker of heaven and earth. That is
I Act. 8.37.
my self do believe, that God (the first Person in the Godhead) is the Math.
3.17. Ioh. 1.14.18.
father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and, through him, my Math. 23.9. Ioh. 20.17.
Ephe. 1.5. Iam. 1.18.
Father also, in whom I trust, and Luke 12.22. etc.
rely on his providence and provision of all things necessary both for my
body and soul: in as much as he is Genesis 17.1 Luke 1, 37. Romans 9.19.
able, and has the might and power to do all things whatsoever he will, and
that he Ioh. 1.3. Coll. 1.16. Rev. 10. 6.
created and made the heavens, and earth, and all things therein, and Ephesians.
1.11.12. 2.10.
me in particular to his own glory and service, and to the obteining of that
salvation which he has promised to all that believe in his son Jesus Christ.

2 And in Jesus Christ his only son our Lord. That is I my self do believe
that Jesus Christ (the second Person in the Godhead) is the Math. 3. 17. Ioh.
1.14.3.16. Colos. 1. 15.2.9.
only natural, and proper son of God, begotten from everlasting of the
Father (having and receaving from him the same nature, substance, and Ioh. 5.26.
as natural Children begotten do receive from there natural parents) and
that he is Math. 11.27. Luke 2.11. Romans 6.23.
Lord as well as his Father having power and dominion to rule and dispose of
all things according to his own will and pleasure, not only as he is our Ioh.
1, 1.2.3. Heb. 1.10.
creator and maker, but more especially do I acknowledge him our Lord, for as
much as he has Luke 1.74. 75. Gal. 4.4.5. Romans 6. 22.
redeemed, and set us free from the power of the Devil, sin and death and
made us his servants to serve him in righteousness and holiness all the days of
our life.

3 Which was conceived by the holy Ghost borne of the Virgin Mary. That is, I
do believe that Jesus Christ the son of God was also John: 1.14. Heb. 2.16.
made man, being Genesis 3.15. Isa. 7. 14 Luke 1.35.
conceived of the seed of a woman the Virgin Mary by the holy Ghost after an
unspeakable manner, and in due time was borne of her a perfect man, bone of
her bone and flesh of her flesh in all things, ( Romans 8.3. 2. Cor. 5.21. Heb.
4.15.
sin only excepted) like unto other Children and sons of men. Isay. 9.6.
Luke 2. 11. Heb. 2.14.


4. He suffered under Pontius Pilate was Crucified, dead and buried. That is, I
do believe, that Jesus Christ (to Is. 53.5. Ioh. 3. 14. Romans 4.25. Gal. 3.13.
deliver me body and soul from the curse of the law and everlasting Damnation,
and to Isay. 53.5. Romans 5.10.6.23. 2. Cor. 5.18. Colos. 1.20.
procure unto me peace with God and the gift of everlasting life) has Math.
2.13.4. 1. etc. 11.19. Luke 9.58 Ioh. 7.44.8.48.9. 22.10.31. 11.53.
suffered the wrath of God al his life time; but especially near his end, not
in body only but in Ps. 116.3. Mat. 26. 38.27.46. Luke 22.42.43.44. Heb. 5.7.
Isay. 53.6. Gal. 3.13.
soul, he was humbled, and suffered the uttermost extremity of his Justice,
and of those unutterable sorrows and torments (due to the sins of the whole
world) under Math. 26.27. Mark. 14.15. Luke 22.23. Ioh. 18.19.
Pontius Pilate the governor of the country being adjudged by him to be nailed,
and fastened to the accursed Cross, whereon he died, and was after taken down
and laid into a grave and buried

5. He descended into Hell, the third day he rose again from the dead. That
is, I do believe that Jesus Christ went down and plainly appeared and
presented himself in hell, Psa. 86.12.13. Ephesians. 4.9.10. Colos. 1.18.
and on the Math. 12.40. Mark. 8.31. Ioh. 19.42.20.1. etc. Act. 10.40.
third day after he had been dead and buried, his soul and body came
together again and he, the very same person revived from death by his own
Ioh. 2.19.10.18.
power came forth a conqueour from Hell, rose, and came out of the Sepulcher or
grave wherein he had been laid. Hereby showing 1. Cor. 15.17.54.55.56. Romans
4.25.14.9.
that he had fully satisfied and overcome the Devil, Death, Hell and the
grave, and all punishment due unto my sins, and has from henceforth cleared
a passage Hosea: 6.2. 1. Cor. 15.20. etc. These. 4.14. Romans 8.11.
for me and al believers unto life eternal.

6. He ascended into Heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father
Almighty. That is, I do believe that the Ioh. 3.13.
same Christ Jesus, after he had stayed Act. 11.3.
some days and conversed with his Disciples on Earth, was truly Luke 24.51.
Act. 1.9.
and justly translated, and moved from thence up into Heaven ( Ioh.
14.2.3.17.24.
there to prepare a place for me) where he has all power, majesty and glory,
all things being made subject unto him Psa. 110.1. Colos. 3.1. Mark. 14.62.
Luke 22.69. Ephesians. 1.20. etc. 2. Pet. 3.22.


7. From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. That is, I do
believe that Christ Jesus will Act. 1.11.
come again from Heaven Math. 24.30.
visibly, and Ioh. 5.22. Act. 10.42. 2. Tim. 4.1.
judge and give sentence upon all men according to their Math. 12.36.37.25.34.
2. Cor. 5.10. Revel. 20.12.
works, as well those that are then living, as those which have been dead
unto that day.

8. I believe in the holy Ghost. That is, I do acknowledge the holy Ghost (the
third person in the Godhead) to be Math. 28.19. Acts. 5.3.4.28.25. Job. 33.4.
1. Cor. 12.11.
God, the Math. 21.19. 28.19. Luke 12.10. Heb. 9.8. 1. Ioh. 5.7.
same and equal with God the Father, and his son Jesus Christ, in whom also
I do believe and trust upon as the especial worker of all grace, and holiness
in me, by Mar. 13.11. Ioh. 14.26.16.13. Act. 2.33. Romans 8.15.16. 1. Cor: 2.12.
teaching Math: 1.20. Rom: 1.4. 1. Cor: 3.16.17.6.11. 1 Pet: 1.2.
sanctifying, Ioh: 14:16.17, Acts: 5:41.7.55.
comforting, Ioh: 14, 23. Rom: 8.11. 1. Cor: 12.13. 2. Cor: 1.22. Gal: 4.6.
Ephe: 1, 13, 4. 1. Ioh: 3.24.
and knitting or uniting me and all belieuers into Christ Jesus,

9. The holy Catholic Church the communion of Saints. That is I do believe,
and acknowledge that God has and will gather and call forth (through his
spirit and the preaching of his word) a Church Catholic, or universal, that
is a Genesis 12.1.15.6.7. Mat. 16.18. Acts. 2.41.47. Romans 1.7.10.12. etc. 1. Cor.
10.2. Rev. 2.
Company of men of Esaias. 49. 5.6. Mar. 16.15. Act. 10.34.35 Ephe. 5.26. Gal.
26. etc. Revel. 5.9.
all sorts, times and places through out the whole world agreeing in the faith
of Jesus Christ, and through him made Esaias. 62.12. Acts. 9.13.26.10.18. 1. Cor.
14.33.16.11. Ephe: 5.27. 1. Pet. 2.9. Revel. 19.8.
holy, sanctified, and set a part for his own service and honor, and the
attainment of everlasting life: And I do likewise believe, that these men thus
sanctified, and made holy, are united as members of one and the same body, into
Jesus Christ, and are Isay. 65.25. Ioh. 10.16.17.21. 1. Cor: 12.13.14. To:
8.32. Ephe. 2.19. etc. 4.5.16.
fellows and partakers or intercommoners in all the promises of his Gospel,
and in all those gifts and graces, which are requisite and needful either for
his own glory, or the common good and salvation of his whole Church.

10. The forgiveness of sins. That is I do believe that God, (for that all
sufficient satisfaction made unto his Justice by Jesus Christ through his
blood, and death, and his fullfilling Math. 3.15.
of all righteousness,) will Psalm: 32.2. 2. Cor. 5.19. Romans 4.6.7.8.
pardon and forgive all my sins, accompting of them as if no sin had been
committed, and that he will To. 5.18.19. 1 Cor. 1.30. 2. Cor. 5.21.
impute unto me his righteousness that so I may not at any time come into Romans
5.1.8.1.
condemnation. Exo. 34.7, Mar: 2.7. Ioh: 20.23.
1. Ioh: 1.7. 2.2. Colos: 1.14.19.20. Gal: 3.13.


11. The resurection of the body. That is I do believe that the Ioh. 5.28. 1.
Cor. 15. Revel. 20.12.13. Job. 19.26.27.
bodies of al men shallbe raised to life again, and being united to their
souls, they the same men in substance both Math. 16.27, 2. Cor. 5, 10. 2.
These. 1.7. etc. Revel. 22.12.
good and bad shall stand before Gods Judgment seat, and be sentenced
according to their works done in there life time

12. And the Life everlasting. That is I do believe, that both to Ioh.
3.16.5.24.10.28. Romans 6.23. 1. Cor. 2.9. 1. These. 4.16.17. 2. Tim. 4.8.
me and all the elect and Saints of God the gift of everlasting life, that is
an everlasting estate in perfect holiness and unutterable happiness, shallbe
given by Christ Jesus my Savior; and together with him I shall live in his
kingdom and enjoy the full measure of blessedness for ever and ever.

Amen: That is. So verily are these things, and may they be as I have
confessed and acknowledged them.

Q. What do thou chiefly Learn in these Articles of thy Belief.

A. First I learn to believe in God the Father who has made me and all the
world As it does appear out of the first Article.

Secondly in God the son who has redeemed me and all mankind As it does
appear both by the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh Articles, which
show what God did, or what means he used, and will use for the perfect
redemption, of them that believe as much: and also by the Ninth, Tenth,
Eleventh, and Twelfth Articles which show what, or wherein our redemption does
consist

Thirdly in God the holy Ghost who Sanctifies me and all the Elect people of
God As we Learn out of the Eight, and Ninth Articles.

Q. It semes by your answer that there are three gods, God the Father, God the
Son. God the Holy Ghost.

A. There is but one god (1. John. 5.7.) but three Persons as I am taught to
believe in Athanasius his Creed commonly called by the name of Quicunque vult)
which is not a Different or several Creed from the Apostles Creed or the
Nicene Creed (which is usually read after the Gospel) but a commentary rather
or large exposition thereof.

Q. What do you mean by a Person?

A. By this word Person I do understand a diverse, and Incommunicable manner
and order of being and working in God. And this is plainly set forth in
Athanasius his Creed. Touching the diverse manner of being in the Godhead thus
it is. The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten. The Son is
of the Father alone not made nor created but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the
Father and of the Son neither made nor created nor begotten but proceeding
and as it were Breathed from both. Ioh 15.26.16.15.20.22. Now the diverse order
of working in God is thus. The creation of all things is the proper and
immediate work of the Father, the first Person of the three. The redemption of
mankind is the proper and immediate work of the Son, the second Person of
the three Sanctification is the proper and immediate work of the holy Ghost
the third Person of the three. And thus God is One in substance Power, and
Eternity. Three in Number of Persons, both according to the diverse manner of
being, in respect of one another and also of their Different order of working
upon other things.

Q. You said that your Godfathers and Godmothers did promise for you, that you
should keep Gods Commandments. His works
Tell me how many there be

A. Ten.

Q. Which be they?

A. The same which God spoke in the Twentieth Chapter of Exodus saying, I am
the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the Land of Egypt out of the
house of bondage.

Q. What does God command in these words?

A. God commands nothing in these words, but rather shows us his authority
and power in making Laws, and the reasons why we are to obey and do them.
First, I am the Lord says he: and therefore to him belongs the power of making
laws. Secondly, I am thy God and brought thee out of Egypt says he, and
therefore thou art to obey and suffer thy self to be ruled by me.

Q. Which then is the first commandment?

A. 1. Thou shall have none other Gods but me.

Q. What does God require of thee in this first commandment?

A. This is to be noted and observed in general, of this and of all the
Commandments following, that in those commandments which are negative, that
is, forbidding somewhat to be done, there also is employed a Command, bidding us
to do, those duti^^ which are contrary to them which are expressly forbidden
(...) so in those Commandments which are Affirmative, that is bidding somewhat
to be done, there is also employed a command, forbidding us to do the contrary,
to them which are expressly enjoined, for example, in this first commandment:
as God forbids us to be Atheists, that is to have and acknowledge no God at al,
(Psa. 13.1.) or to be Idolators, that is, to have a false god, or many gods:
(Exo. 23.24.25. Deuteronomy. 32.12. Iosu. 24.14.) so does he requier us to have him
to our god, and only him. Deuteronomy. 6.12.13.14. Ios. 23.7.8. Math. 4.10.

Q. What is it to Have God or to have no other God?

A. It is as much as if I should say. First that I must Deuteronomy. 31.12.13. 1.
Cron. 29.10. etc. Psalm. 100.3. Ierem. 9.24.7. Zephan. 1.5. Ioh. 17, 3. Colos.

he has revealed of himself Secondly that I must humble and Deuteronomy. 10.12. 2.

not advance my self against him or obey other men, or mine own will, or any
way grudge at his doings, or slight his power and goodness Thirdly that I must

Q. Which is the second Commandment?

A. Thou shall not make to thy self any graven Image nor the likeness of any
thing that is in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath or in the water under
the Earth. Thou shall not bow down to them, nor worship them.

Q. What art thou taught in this commandment?

A. I am taught after what manner god is pleased to be worshipped, namely, That
I Exodus: 23.24.32.1.4.5.8. Deuteronomy: 4.15.16:27.15. Psalm. 50.21.97.7: Isay: 40.18.
Acts: 17.23. 1. Ioh: 5.21,
am not to conceive a false, and an unworthy opinion of God, as that he is like
unto man, or any other thing whatsoever, or to express him, in any such
visible resemblance, Image, or Picture, and to worship it as God or God in it:
but rather am Deuteronomy: 12.30. etc, Iosu: 4.23.24. Mat: 15.9, Acts: 10 33, Luk:
1.75. Numb: 16.1. 1, Sam: 15.19, 1. Cor: 11.20. Isai: 1.10. etc,
I so to think of God, as he has revealed himself, and only to worship him,
as he does by his word, direct me.

Q, What is the meaning of these words, For I the Lord thy God am a Jealous God
and visit the sins of the Fathers upon the Children unto the third and fourth
generation of them that hate me, and show mercy unto thousands in them that
love me and keep my Commandments.

A. In these words nothing is commanded, but they are annexed to the second
Commandment, to persuade me to obedience, and to a just performance, of the
aforesaid Command: Threatening Gods vengeance to all, both Parents and
Childeren that offend against it: and on the other side promising mercy and
love to many posterities of those that observe to do it.

Q. Repeat the third commandment,

3. A. Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.

Q. What does God require of thee in this Commandment.

A. That in my outward actions, dealings, and commerce with others I do not at
any time abuse, profane, or mention the holy name of God, or any thing that is
properly, unbeseeming his great honor, and majesty: but by all the means I
may set forth his glory, and with all possible devotion and reverence in word
and deed use his name to his honor.

Q. How is Gods name taken in vain or abused.

A. Diverse ways. First to swear by any thing besides God, either, supposed
Gods, or parts of God, or other creatures. Exodus 23.13. Ierem: 5.7. Zepha. 15.
Mat. 23.6. etc.

Secondly by using his name, or swearing in our ordinary talk, and upon every
slight occasion, in some passion, or otherwise. Lev: 5.4.5. 1. Sam. 14.39.44.
Mat. 5.34.37. Iam. 5.12. Thirdly to think and speak despitefully,
irreverently, and reprochfully of God, Exodus: 5.2. Lev: 24.15.16. 2. King.
18.22.32. etc. Psalm. 10.11.14.1.50.11.78.19. Rom: 1, 23, 9:20. Fourthly to
abuse his name in vowing and swearing that which is either absolutely false and
unlawful, or at least not to acknowledge true and lawful, or with a purpose to
deceive the belieuer, or not to stand to that which is sworn, or (...) vowed,

Q. You have told how many ways Gods name may be abused, or taken in vain,
now tell me how Gods name may be used well, or Glorified, and Sanctified,
which is a Duty implied, and required of thee in this Commandment: Psalm.
29.1.2. Mat. 6.9. 1. Cor. 10.31.

A. Gods name is glorified: First by swearing, and confirming all truth (not
other ways to be manifested) in his name only, or with some invocation, and
attestation referred unto him, though not plainly named. Exodus 22.11. Deuteronomy:
6.13. 1. King. 8.31.32. Isay: 45.23.65.16. Ierem. 4. 2. Heb. 6.16.17. Secondly
by performing the works of piety: as Blessing and Making Vows in his name
only, and praising, thanksgiving, and praying unto him only. 1. Sam. 1.11. Psa.
50.14.15.23.66, 13.14.160.4.105. 1. Mat: 5.44. Romans 12.14. 2. Cor: 11.31.
Ephesians. 6.18. Philip: 4.6. Colos. 3.17. 1. These. 5.17.18. Thirdly by an holy and
godly conversation of life answerable to our profession. Ioh. 15.8. 2. Cor.
8.19. Ephesians. 4.1.5.3.4. 2. Tim. 2.19. Tit: 2.10. Isay. 1.13. etc. 66.3. Philip.
2.11. Fourthly by teaching, and causing others to glorify Gods name, and by

4.29.. Colos. 3.16.

Q. What is the meaning of these words; For the Lord will not hold him
guiltles that takes his name in vain.

A. These are annexed to the commandment to give warning to all that they take
heed how they offend against it: for whosoever they be that any way shall
presume to dishonor Gods most holy name, let them be assured that God does
take notice of their sin, and will esteem of them as guilty, and will in due
time cause just punishment to be executed upon them. Levit: 24.15.16.

Q. Proceed to the next Commandment.

A. Remember that thou keep holy the Sabouth day

Q. What does God require of thee in this commandment.

A. Three things: First to observe one day of Seven for a Sabbath day, that is
a day of rest, and cessation from all worldly labors and business. To which use
the Lords day, wherein he rose from the dead, is generally received by
Christians, amongst us commonly but corruptly called Sunday. Secondly to set
apart. Sanctify, or keep this day holy to Gods service and worship. Thirdly
to remember that above all other things it be duly observed.

Q. How is the Sabbath day to be keept holy.

A. Diverse ways. First by ceasing from all manner of bodily labors and
worldly businesses which are not agreeable unto, or cross, slaken, or hinder
the service and worship of God. As from the ordinary works of our special
callings, from bargainings, buying and selling, and iourneying, from mercy
meetings, feastings, and drinkings, and fruteles pastimes, sports and gaimings:
yea from talking, thinkeing, or contriuing in our minds any of these things
against another day. Exodus 16.29.31.14.32.6.18.19. 1. Cor. 10.7. Exodus 34.21.
Ierem. 17.21.22. Neh. 13.15. Isay: 58.13.14.

Q. It seems by your answer that God does not simply forbid all manner of
works, and labors on the Sabbath day.

A. He does not. For works of mercy and piety, and such as directly tend to
the good of man, or other creatures, and furtherance of the service of God he
does allow. 2. Kings: 4.44.23. Nehem. 8.10. Hosea. 6.6. Mat. 12.1. etc. Mark.
3.4. Luke 13.14. etc. Acts: 1.12. Iam. 1.27. Also works of necessity, such as
cannot be deferred without peril, or what nature, and the maintenance of our
being, and common civility and decency does require. 1. Macab. 2.40. Mat.
12.1.4.11. Mark. 2.27. Luke 14.5. Exodus 19.10.11.

Q. You have answered well. Go on now and tell me how else the Sabbath day is
to be kept holy.

A. By a spiritual rest, and cessation from sin, or the occasion of sin,
either in word, thought, or deed. For such a rest and Sabbath there is in
heaven whether we are to labor to come. Heb: 4.9.10. Isay: 1, 11, etc: 56,
2, 58, 13, 14: Ierem: 7, 9, etc. Thirdly by exercising, and performing all such
holy works which are commanded by God for the Sanctifying of the Sabbath,
namely by Psalm: 84, 1, 2, 95, 100, 122, 1, 2, Ecles: 5, 1, Isai: 2, 3, Act.:
2, 1, 1 Cor: 11, 18, 14, 26.
repairing to the appointed, and public place of Gods worship with due
reverence and preparation, by Levit: 10, 11, Nehem: 8, 4, 8, John: 5.24. Acts.
2.14.13.14. etc. 15.21.17.11. 1. Tim 4.13.15.16. Heb: 10.24.25. Psalm:
1.2.22.22. Luk: 24.14.15. 1. Pet: 2.2. James: 22.
expounding, reading, hearing the word of God, and meditating, mutually
discoursing thereon, and doing it, by Mat: 18.19.20.21.13. Psalm:
95.100.105.122.150. Ephesians. 5.18.19.20. Colos: 3.16.17. 1. Tim: 2.1.
praying, thanksgiving, and, singing of psalms to the honor of his name by
Acts: 2.42.20.7. 1. Cor. 11.20. etc. 16.2. Heb: 3.16. Nehem: 8.10.
frequenting of his Sacraments, and charitable contributions tothe poor, and
suchlike Godly works.

Q. But why does God require that we should Remember to do this commandment
above any of the rest.

A. The reasons are diverse. First because the continual remembrance and sight
of this day, or rather of God, who is to be Sanctified this day, will keep us
more entirely in our obedience to him, and bind us as it were to our good
behavior in all his other Commandments. Secondly the remembrance thereof will
cause us to order all our doings and dealings so that on that Day we may able
be to give up a good account thereof before him. Lastly it will cause us to
cast, and appointe our weekly business with respect unto this Day, that by no
means we may be Distracted and hindered from an exact observance thereof
when it comes. And thus we are to make a Daily preparation for the Sanctifing
of this one day, as well by calling to mind and remembering what has been done
in the Sabbath Day past, as namely what we prayed for, promised, and vowed to
God touching the amendment and Sanctification of our lives, and what we were
taught out of his word: as what we are to do on the next which is to come. But
more especially the day, or rather the afternoon of the day immediately goeing
before the Sabbath or Lords day is appointed by the Church for preparation that
is by giving over our weekly works and labors and by fasting, and prayer.

Q. What do the other words of this commandment serve for.

A. They contain diverse reasons and motives to persuade us to the observation
and keepeing of the Sabbath day. As first God allows us Six days in every
week to do our own business, and therefore we may the willinger allow one to
his honor and service. Secondly the seventh day is the Lords day, he has
chosen and set it apart for himself and it is none of ours, and therefore we
must do his work, and none of our own on this day. Thirdly God himself
rested from his work on the Seventh day, and therefore it will become us to
do the like. Fourthly god has annexed a blessing unto this day; insomuch as
that he which observes, and Sanctifies it shall also be blessed, and holy,
and therefore for this cause are we to keep this Commandment, namely that we
may be holy and blessed lastly this circumstance is to be noted by Parents,
Masters and Governors that they take especial care, that together with
themselves, there whole families, and such as are under their power, or
soiournors sanctify this day.

Q Tell me which is the Fifth Commandment.

A. Honor thy Father and thy Mother.

Q. What does God require in these words.

A. That all superiors, or such as have rule, power and preheminen^e in any
kind above others: as for example natural Parents, Princes, Magistrates, and
their Debuties and Commissioners Ministers of the Gospel, Husbands, Masters of
families, and such as exceed in learning, wisdom, counsel, riches, age, and
other gifts, and callings be honored, that is their worthiness, be
acknowledged, and reverent respect, and due subjection yielded unto them by
their inferiors.

Q. How are natural Parents to be honored by their Children.

A. First they are to be beloved, and feared, and not contemned, and hated by
them, Levit: 19.^. Ruth: 1.16. Mat. 10.37. Deuteronomy. 27.16. Prove. 20.20. Secondly

Q. You have answered well: now rehearse the ninth Commandment.

A. Thou shallt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

Q. Show me the meaning of this Commandment.

A. In this Commandment God provides for the preservation and maintenance of
the good name, reputation and credit both of our selves and our neighbors,
forbidding all manner of falsehoode, and untruth, and abuse of the tongue
against our neighbor of our selves, either in Judgment, or otherwise. And
requiring truth, integrity, charity in all our speeches and surmises, that so,
for as much as lies in us, the estimation, credit; and good name of all men
may be preserved and increased

Q. How many ways is a man said to bear false witness against his own, or
his neighbors credit,

A. First by false witnessing, and accusing of our neighbor before a Judge, or
by accepting of slight and insufficient proof against him in Judgment, or by
counselling assisting, persuading, or setting on any such injury to be
practiced Levit. 19.16. Deuteronomy. 17.6.19.16. 1. Kings. 3.16. etc. 1. Sam. 1.13.

talebearing, scoffing, reviling, and discovering of secret faults, with a
purpose to disgrace, and by hard censuring upon weak grounds: all which things
are as so many false witnesses against the credit of our neighbor, Genesis 39.19.

Q. Now tell me how thou art to preserve, defend, and increase the good name,
credit, and honor, both of thine own particular, and also of thy neighbor;
and then we will proceed to the next Commandment.

name, and credit.

Q. Now you are come to the tenth Commandment, repeat it.

A. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, thou shall not covet thy
neighbors wife, nor his servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor
any thing that is his.

Q. Tell me the meaning of this Commandment.

A. The beginning, fountain, and foundation of all sin forbidden in the
former Commandments is here prohibited. (Now the beginnings and fountain of
sin are the first motions, and inclinations of the mind or heart to evil,
or evil thoughts, phansies, and imaginations: these in the scriptures are
commonly called by the name of lust, concupiscence, or coveting whether the
consent, purpose or delight, of the heart be joined therewith, or no) all be it
indeed the particular lust coveting or desiring of our neighbors house, or
his servant, or his wife, or any other thing else which is not our own is by
name forbidden.

Q. How does it appear unto you that our thoughts phansies, and imaginations
of evil, or the bare motions and inclinations of the mind to evil (though
without the consent and purpose of the heart to do them) be forbidden.

A These texts of holy Scripture do show as much. Gen: 3.6. Exodus: 16.3. Numb:
15.39. etc: Deuteronomy: 15.9. Psalm: 139.23. Prove: 15.26.24.9. Isai: 55.7. Acts: 8.22.
Rom: 1.21.24.7.5. 7.22.23. Gal: 5.16. Coloss: 3.5. Tit: 2.12. Iam: 12.14.15.

Q And where do you find that the concupiscence, and desiring of the
particular things of our neighbor (which are specified in the command) are
forbidden.

A. These texts of Scripture following speak as much Deuteronomy: 5.21. Josh: 7.21.
1. Sam. 12.3. 2. Sam. 12.1. King. 21. Isai: 5.8. Acts: 20.23.

Q. You have told and proved unto me what is forbidden in this tenth
Commandment; tell me now what it is which God does require of us to be done.

A. The contrary to that which is forbidden, that is, That Luk^ 1. 74.75. Ephe.
4.23.24, 1. These. 5.23. 1. Tim: 1. 5. 1. Pet. 1.15. 16. 2, Pet. 3, 10.11.
all our thoughts, desires, imaginations, motions, and inclinations, or
covetings of our hearts should be altogether pure, holy, righteous, and
blameless, as God in Adam first made them to be; and that we should labor
Psalm. 119. 37. Job: 31.1. Prove. 4.23. Mat: 6.13. Rom: 7.15. 16.22. 1. Cor:
10.24, 2. Cor: 10.5. Ephesians: 4.22.6.10. etc: Philip: 4.11. 1. Pet: 2.2. 2. Pet:
3.18.
and delight to make and keep them so by all the means we may.

Q What do thou chiefly learn by these Commandments.

A I learn two things: My duty toward God, set down in the first Table
containing the first four Commandments: and My duty toward my Neighbor
comprised in the second Table which does contain the six last Commandments.
Deuteronomy: 10.1. etc: Mat: 22.36. etc:

Q What is thy duty toward God.

A My duty toward God is etc:

Q What is thy duty toward thy Neighbor.

A My duty toward my Neighbor is etc:

Q My good Child know this that thou art not able to do these things of thy
self, nor to walk in the Commandments of God, and to serve him (Gen: 6.5.
Isai: 6.4.6. Mat: 7.18. etc: 8.3. 2. Cor: 3.5.) Without his special grace
(Psalm: 119. 33. Ioh. 1. 17. Ephesians: 2.1. 8.9.10.) Which thou must learn at all
times to call for by diligent prayer. (Luk: 18.1. 11.9.) Let me here therefore
if thou can say the Lords prayer.

His Prayer
A Our Father etc:

Q Why is this prayer called the Lords prayer.

A Because Christ Jesus our Lord upon request taught and appointed his
Disciples to use this form of prayer. Mat: 6.9. Luk: 11.1.

Q. What are you taught to pray for in this pattern and plat-forme of prayer.

A As it is an absolute good and perfect prayer of it self: So does it teach
us as it were by a sampler and pattern, how I am to frame and fashion my
particular and private prayers unto God, for all things that are needful for
my body and soul, or which concern either this life, or that which is to
come, in the next world, or, as St Peter speaks which pertain to life and
godliness. As it may more plainly appear by the several petitions, prayers
and requests, which are easily to be seen and distinguished in this prayer.

Q Are there then several matters to be noted in this prayer.

A There be. For this Prayer has first a Preface or Compellation of him to
whom it is directed: then follow the several Petitions, and lastly the
conclusion shuts up all with Amen.

Q Which words call you the Preface.

A These, Our Father which art in heaven. That is to say, O God which dwell
in the Psalm: 123.1. Isai. 66.1.
heavens, full of all glory and majesty, who art pleased to be a Father Isai:
63.16. Mat: 23.9. Ioh: 20.17. Rom: 8.15.
unto us in creating Gen: 1.26. Luk: 3.38.
and making us out of the dust, the chiefest of thy creatures; but more
especially by regenerating Gal: 4.6.
and calling us to be thy Children in Jesus Christ.

Q How many Petitions be there.

A Six several Petitions or Prayers, whereof the first three teaches, and
directs us to ask those things, which principally respect the honor of God
our Father, and our duty and thankfulness toward him: the three last tell us
what we are to pray for touching our present life and welfare.

Q Name the first Petition.

A Hallowed be thy name.

Q Tell me the meaning of this Petition in more words.

A That is to say Grant O Father which art in heaven, or I pray thee to give
us the grace always to acknowledge thee such as thou have declared thy self
to be the only Holy one, and accordingly to reverence, and magnify thy
greatness and worthynes, and that in all our thoughts, words, dealings, and
doings, we may principally seek, desire, confess, and declare thy glory, and
show forth the honor and reverence we bear unto thy holy name, by giving all
due observance, respect, thanksgiving, and worship thereunto, and that we may
not at any time forget, or neglect this our duty, or profane thy most holy
name. 2. Sam, 7.26. 1. Chron: 16.35. Nehem: 9. 4. etc: Job: 1.21. Psalm:

Q Proceed and tell me the next Petition.

A Thy Kingdom come.

Q Speak this Petition or prayer in more plain words, that I may perceive you
do fully understand it.

A That is to say, I pray thee O Father let no thing hinder, but that thy
power, Psalm: 29:1: etc: 93:1:94:95:
providence, and government, may continually be exercised, and flourish in this
world, and thy grace Psalm: 51:10:119. 5:33: etc: 143:10: Mat: 6:33: Luk: 17:21:
Rom: 5:21:16:24: Ephesians: 1:17: etc: 1: These: 3: 12:13:
may come upon us, and by all means be increased, and improued in us daily
that being ruled and guided thereby we may have thy promised Psalm: 24:7: 2:
Tim: 4:8: Revel: 22:17:20:
glory and salvation hastened, and accomplished in us.

Q Which is the third Petition.

A Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.

Q What do you pr^y for in this.

A That is I pray thee O Father not to leave us to the lust, and errors of our
own or other men's will, to follow our own evil imaginations, and desires;
but to give us the grace always to do, observe, and keep thy will,
Commandments, and word here on earth, as sincerely, constantly and fully, even
as the holy Angels are said to do in heaven. Psalm: 27:9.51:10: etc, 119.11.

Q The fourth Petition follows repeat it.

A Give us this day our daily bread:

Q What is your request to God in this Petition.

A That is, I do pray God this day, and every day to give, bless, and
Sanctify unto us all things needful, convenient, and properly belonging to
this present life, as our Food, Raiment, Health, Peace, Dwelling,
seasonablenes of weather, and such like suitable to our condition and calling.

Q Which is the fifth Petition:

A Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us.

That is, I beseech thee O Father in Exodus 32.31.32. Deuteronomy. 9.18 Ps. 51.1. etc:
32.1. etc: 79.8. etc: Isai. 64.1. etc: Hose. 14.1. etc: Acts. 5.31. Rom: 8.1.

Jesus Christ to remit, pardon, and forget our sins and the manyfolde
transgressions of thy holy will and word that we may not therefore be
condemned even as Mat. 6.14, 18.22.35. Mark. 11.25.26. Luk: 17.3. Acts. 7.60.
we our selves most freely and sincerely from the heart do remise and forgive
all that revenge, and punishment due unto those men who have sinned in
offending and wronging of us.

Q Now you are come to the sixth and last Petition, what is it.

A Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.

Q What is the meaning of it.

A That is, Genesis 3, 20.6. 2. Sam. 24. 1. Psalm. 5.8. etc.
19.13.119..37.117.133.81.11. etc. 51.11. Mat. 4.1: etc. 26.41. John. 17.15.

that so the wicked inticements and temptations of the divill, the world, and
our flesh, may at any time prevail over us, and draw, or harden us in sin:

be pleased to preserve, keep, and deliver us from all manner of evil which
the wicked one the divill, or his instruments, or our own evil deservings,
has or may bring upon us.

Q You have truly numbered the Petitions what serve the next words for, for
thine is the Kingdom and the power and the Glory for ever Amen.

A These are the Conclusion of the prayer wherein by diverse arguments, and
reasons we are taught to assure our selves that our prayers will as certainly
take effect as we have prayed for. For first whom we pray, all right 1. Sam.
2.8. 1. Cor. 29.11. etc. Psalm. 22.28. etc. 24.1. etc. Romans 10.12. 1. These.
2.11.12. 1. Tim. 6.15.
and authority of granting our requests only belongs to him the Lord and King,
and therefore we may assure our selves that he will be good, and gracious unto us
his Subjects and Servants in hearing our prayers, and granting our requests.
Then he has 2. Chron. 20. 6. etc. Job. 42.2. Psalm. 18.1. and. 89.8. Isay.
40.26. Mat. 29.26.
power to give whatsoever he will give, or we have neeede of, and nothing can
hinder his good pleasure and therefore we are not to doubt of his goodness.
And lastly all this we are the rather confident he will do because the honor

4.18 1. Pet. 4. 11.
and glory of all shall return and redounde unto himself from whom every
good and perfect gift comes upon his people. Even so O Father be al these
petitions, requests, and prayers certainly accomplished in us for the honor of
thy kingdom and power, the manefestation of thy everlasting glory, and the
good of thy Children.

Q What desire thou of God in this prayer.

A I desire my Lord God etc.

The signs and seals of his Profession.
Q How many Sacraments has Christ ordained in his Church.

A Two There be diverse Sacraments in a large sense so called; but generally
necessary for all people there be two several Sacraments appointed by Christ
(as we may learn out of Matthew: 28:19: Mark: 14:22:16:15:16: Luke: 22:19:20:
1: Cor: 11:23:12:13:) and only two and noe more.
only as Generally necessary to salvation that is to say Baptism (by which
every one has his beginning and entrance into the life and being of a
beleiuing, Spiritual, or Christian man) and the supper of the Lord which
affords spiritual food, and norishment to strengthen and preserve him in the
said life and new-beeing. The reason is because to the making, and being of a
Sacrament of the Gospel or New Testament there is necessarily required. First
the word and appointment of Christ. Secondly the Ceremony or visible sign
with a certain form of words to be used there with all. Thirdly the promise
of grace annexed to the thing worthyly received. Now these three things are to
be found in the Sacraments of Baptism and the supper of the Lord, and in
nothing else that we can read of in the holy Scriptures.

Q What meanest thou by this word Sacrament

A I mean an outward visible sign of an inward sprituall grace given unto us
by the hand of Gods minister, so ordained by Christ himself and none other, as
a means whereby we receive the same spiritual grace, and a pledge or seal to
assure us thereof that we have indeed received it, and are to show it forth to
the honor of Christ Jesus in our life and conversation.

Q How many parts be there in a Sacrament.

A Two: the outward visible sign and the inward spiritual grace.

Q what is the outward visible sign of form in baptism.

A Water unmingled and clean (the usual means to do a way filthiness) wherein
the person Baptized is dipped or sprinkled with it, and with this certain
form of words, In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Ghost.

Q What is the inward and spiritual grace.

A A death The outward washing, dipping or sprinkling of the body with water,
whereby the foulnes thereof is usually cleansed a way, does show and signify
unto the party Baptized that the uncleanness and filthiness of his soul, that
is, his sins are forgiven, or as it were purged and washed a way in the
blood of Christ Jesus. Ezekiel. 36.25. Acts. 22.16. Ephesians. 5.26.27. Tit.
3.5.1.1.2.3.21. Reve. 1.5.
unto sin and a new The grace of gods holy spirit sanctifiing and renewing
the hearts of the Baptized unto the works of righteousness, together with their
own promised obedience unto Gods holy will and Commandments, and a purpose of
proceeding in all virtue and Godlynes of liveing is the regeneration, or New
birth unto rightteousnes here spoken of, which is represented unto us by
taking the Baptized out of the Four, as it were from the grave of his sins
washed and purified from his natural corruptions, and receiving him into the
number of the faithful, and to the service of a new master, in whose name he
is Baptized, as it were a new creature unto a new manner of being and living.
Romans 6.4. 1. Cor. 6.11. Colos. 2.12. etc. Tit. 3.5.
birth unto righteousness for being by nature borne in sin and the Children
of wrath we are hereby made the Ch^lderen of grace. Now sins being thus
taken away, or forgiven unto the Baptized through faith in the blood of Jesus
Christ (they also themselves by the mouth of their Sureties professing and
promising to renounce and forsake the works of the Devil, the covetous
desires of the world, the carnal desires of the flesh) are from henceforth
accounted as if sin were dead in them and they to it so that they will not
follow nor be lead by it. And this death of sin or rather to sin is the
spiritual and inward grace represented, and assured unto every true Christian
and beleiver by the outward washing and Baptism.

Q What is required of Persons to be Baptized.

A Repentance whereby they forsake sin (Mat. 2:7. 8.11. 4.17. Mark. 1.4.5.
Acts. 2.38.) and faith whereby they steadfastly believe the promises of God,
made to them in that Sacrament. Mark: 16.16. Acts. 8.37. etc.

Q Why then are Infants Baptized, when by reason of their tender age they
cannot perform them.

A Yes: They do perform them, (Acts. 2.39. Romans 11.16.) by their sureties who
promise and vow them both in their names, which when they come to age
themselves are bound to perform them, that is, both to repent, and to believe
in Christ Jesus: and that this work is acceptable and well pleasing to God,
done in the behalf of Infant-children of the faithful, examples do testify,
Genesis 17.7. etc. Mat. 19.14. Luke 1.59. 1. Cor. 1.16.

Q Why was the Sacrament of the Lords supper ordained.

A For the continual Luke 22.19. 1. Cor. 11.24. etc.
remembrance of the Heb. 5.7.7.25. etc. Revel. 5.12.
sacrifice of the death of Christ, offered up to God upon the Altar of the
Cross, and the benefits which we receive thereby, that is, by that sacrifice
of his blood and life made in our behalf, clensing us from sin, and
sanctifying, and renewing us unto righteousness, for which cause Sacrifices
were figuratively in use in the old Testament. Lev, 4.5.6:12.14. Ephe: 2.13.
etc. Heb. 7. 1. Ioh. 1.7.

Q What is the outward part or sign of the Lords supper.

A These two things most fitly represent both Christ Crucified, and also the
spiritual benefits and blessings which belong to those who do believe in him
so crucified. The resemblance of Christ's body broken and mangled on the Cross,
and of his blood shed, is in the threshing, grinding, baking, breaking, and
eating of the bread: and in cutting, pressing, or treading of the grape,
pouring out of the wine, and drinking of it. For as the corn, and grape are so
to be used before they become food to them that eat or drink thereof: even
so Christ's body first bruised, and broken on the Cross, and his most precious
blood pressed forth becomes spiritual food to such as by faith eat and
drink thereof.
Bread and Wine which the Lord has commanded to be received. Mat. 26.26. etc.

Q What is the inward part, or thing signified.

A The body and blood of Christ. (Mark. 14.22. etc. Luke 22.19.20. Ioh. 6.47.
etc. 1. Cor. 11. 23. etc.) which after an heavenly and spiritual manner are
verily and indeed taken and received of the a faithful in the Lords supper. A
Faith or belief in the passion and death of Christ is the means; the hand as
it were to take, the mouth to eat, the stomach to receive, and digest the body
and blood of Christ, that so the beleiuer and Christ may thereby be
incorporated, and united, and after an heavenly and spiritual manner made one
and the same body, as the natural body and the food thereof eaten and
digested, becomes one and the same flesh. Ioh. 6.35.55.56. 1. Cor. 10.16.17. 2.
Cor. 13.5. Ephesians. 5.30.

Q What are the benefits whereof we are partakers thereby.

A The strengthening and refreshing of our souls by the body and blood of
Christ, We may observe and consider these two things in Bread and Wine
received: First there is a mutual union, and incorporation of them and the
body, they become one and the same flesh and bone, and body. Secondly the
benefit of this union or incorporation, namely, the body is strengthened,
refreshed, and preserved thereby: so is it betwixt the beleiuer and worthy
receiver of the Sacrament, and Christ, first they are mutually united,
communicated, or incorporated one into the other, and are made the same flesh,
bone, and body. Ioh. 6.56.17.21. My beloved is mine and I am his, says the
Spouse in the Canticles. 2.16. and more plainly speaks the Apostle St Paul
Ephesians. 5.30. We are members of his body, and of his flesh, and of his bone.
This is a great mystery, or secret says the Apostle, too deep for our shallow
understanding to conceive, or our tongues to express, how Christ and his Spouse
the Church, that is, every true beleiuer becomes one flesh. Yet so far forth as
secrets are revealed, we may as Christ speaks of himself, handle them and
see how or what they be. The stringes by which they are knit together, or the
hands by which they are as it were molded one into the other, and made one
lump, and bread are plainly named unto us in the holy Scripture; and these
are the Holy Spirit, or Spirit of Christ and Faith. His Spirit unites and
quickneth, Ioh. 6.63. 1. Cor. 6.17. Gal. 2.20. 1. Ioh. 4.13. For as the Nerves
or Sinews pass into all parts of the body from the brain, and tie all
together: Even so his spirit from him the Head descending is derived into every
one of his members, (1. Cor. 12.) and thereby the whole body by joynt^ and
bands, having nourishment ministered and knit together, increases with the
increase of God. Colos. 2.9. And again as the soul diffuseth it self
thorough the whole, and every faculty, and limb of the body, and gives life
and motion proportionable to the condition, and being of every part: In like
sort his spirit goes into every member, and quickneth it with the life of
Christ, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part.
Ephesians. 4. 16. And thus we see what means Christ for his part uses to unite
and quicken; yet every man is not hereby united into his body, and made a
living member of him, but only such as are fitted, and disposed by Faith, which
is the pipe as it were and door thorough which Christ's Spirit does descend,
and comes into men's hearts, quickens them with his life of grace and as it were
moulds them into his body, and makes them one flesh. Ioh. 1.22. Romans 1.17. Gal.
2.20. ^5.5. Ephesians. 3. 17. Heb. 3.14. And let this suffice to be spoken of the
union, or rather Communion between Christ, and the faithful or belieuers: he
being by his spirit as truly and effectually made theirs, and they members and
branches of his body, as the meat and drink we receive into our natural
bodies, is made flesh of our flesh, and lives by the same life, as our whole
body does. Now this Communion premised is the foundation of all those blessed
promises made unto the worthy Receivers of the Sacrament of the body and blood
of Christ, and the fountain from whence all the benefits of his Passion,
Death, Resurrection, and Asscension issue and derive themselves upon the
faithful. All are yours says the Apostle to the Corinthians, 1. Cor. 3.22.
but how comes it to pass. Why ye are Christ's and Christ is Gods. First there
must be a union and partaking of Christ, yea of God, or the whole godhead (
Ioh, 17.9. 10.11.21.) before we can be capeable of the blessings of God. And
thus it is: First out flesh is taken, and united into the second Person of the
godhead, that is Christ Jesus. Ioh. 1. 14. Heb. 2. 14.16. Secondly by the Holy
Ghost the third Person in the godhead, we are united into Christ's flesh and
body, and made one with him, which is not a carnal but a spiritual union,
according to the means by which it is wrought. 1. Cor. 12.13. Thirdly being
thus united into Christ by his Spirit, we have hereby fellowship with the
Father the first Person of the godhead, and are made one with him. Ioh.
17.22.23. 1. Ioh. 1.3. The first union of our flesh with Christ Jesus is
carnal, natural, and corporeal (for Christ is true man) and this was
Necessary, in that he himself having suffered being tempted, might be able
to succor them that are tempted, and be a merciful and faithful high Priest
in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the
people Heb. 2.17.18. The second union of our selves, and all beleivers into
Christ is altogether supernatural, and spiritual, and this is Sufficient to
make us partakers of the benefits promised to the worthy receivers of the
Sacrament. For as it suffices to make all men partakers in the Curse of Adam
because they are of one and the same nature with him, and his flesh by
propagation; though not any man is corporally, and personally united unto him;
so on the other side does it suffice us by a spiritual, and not by any
corporeal and carnal, union into Christ Jesus to be made partakers of his
Blesings 1. Cor. 15.20.21.23. And that no man should think a carnal and
corporal union or Communion with Christ to be Necessary (as the Papists at
this day do teach that there must be a carnal uniting of Christ with every
believer by eating and drinking his natural flesh and blood) he plainly tells
us ( Ioh. 6. 63.) that the flesh that is his flesh eaten by the bodily mouth
profits nothing, that is, it does not make a man any whit the nearer unto
Christ, and those benefits and blessings which he brings along with him. Again
the Apostle ( Ephesians. 5.32.) by comparing the union or conjunction of Christ and
the Church, or the faithful unto Marriage, plainly speaks it not to be a
corporeal, and local union, or Communion. For the man and the woman are
truly united together by marriage (though several bodies and locally divided)
and they two are one flesh. In like manner Christ the Husband and Head, and the
Church his Wife and the Faithful his members (although carnally and locally
divided) yet are truly One. And that this kind of union, or Communion with
Christ is sufficient, profitable, and effectual to all purposes as well as if
it were carnal, we may easily gather from his own words ( Ioh. 15.) where
under the parable of the Vine, and the Branches either natural or graffed in,
shows the efficacy of the union, or (to speak in his own phrase) of the
mutual abiding of himself and the faithful one in the other: namely, That as
the branches do partake of the same nature, juice, life, and fruitfulnes with
the stock and root, whereof they are branches: so the spiritual b^^nches,
that is the Faithful and worthy receivers of the Sacrament do truly partake
of their root and stock, that is Christ Jesus, and from him receive spiritual
strength, nourishment, life, growth, fatness, and fruitfulnes. Consider we
therefore now what the stock and root is and that those heavenly blessings and
benefits are a rising from thence, such are the branches, and such fruit they
bear. For if the first fruit be holy the lump is also holy says the Apostle
( Romans 15.61.) and if the root be holy so are the branches. Now Christ Jesus
has satisfied the debt of punishment due to our sins, and has borne our
curse (Gal. 3.13.) and we in him have done the like, and now there rema^nes
unto us no condemnation therefore. Romans 8. 1. Again Christ Jesus has
fulfilled all righteousness, and in him we shall be found having the
righteousness which is of God by faith, Philip. 3.9. Romans 3.22. Add hither
that he was without sin, and so are we by imputation, and there is nothing to
be laid to our charge ( Romans 8.33.) being justified by him in whom we have
redemption, even the forgiveness of sins. Coloss. 1.14. Lastly he by his
own power, being dead and buried, raised himself to life again, and ascended
up into heaven with the very same body and flesh, as he went into the grave,
and there for ever lives, and reigns: And by the same power we also shall be
raised from corruption, the grave, and death, and made a live again, 1. Cor.
15. and with these same bodies, made like unto his most glorious body, (Philip.
3.24.) shall be translated into heaven, (Ioh. 14.3.) and together with him
shall live, and reign for ever and ever. Mat. 25.46 John. 11. 26, 27. Revel.
3.21.7.13: etc.

These are the benefits whereof we the members and branches are in Christ Jesus
the head and root, made partakers as effectually and truly, as by Bread and
Wine received the body is strengthened and refreshed: these being the visible
signs and seals, by which God and Christ Jesus does witness, and confirm
his word, and promise made unto every true Beleiuer, and worthy Receiver of the
blessed Sacrament.


as our bodies are by the bread and wine.

Q What is required of them which come to the Lords Supper?

A To examine themselves whether they repent truly of their former sins,
steadfastly purposing to lead a new life, have a lively faith in Gods mercy
through Jesus Christ, with a thankful remembrance of his death, and be in
Charity with all men.

There be diverse things carefully to be observed in this answer: First the
examination of our selves, before we come to the Supper of the Lord, and then
the several points or matter whereof we are to examine ourselves. That we are
to examine our selves the Apostle teaches, Let a man examine himself and so
let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup. For he that eats and
drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, nor discerning
the Lords Body. 1. Cor. 11. 28.29.

The principal matter wherein we are to examine our selves is touching our
Faith, whether we do indeed and sincerely believe in Jesus Christ, as we make
our profession and confession thereof in the Creed. And this also the Apostle
advises us unto. 2. Cor. 13. 5. Examine your selves whether you be in the
Faith: prove your own selves. Now the means to know this much, is by the
works of true Faith. Iam. 2.18. I will show thee my Faith by my works. The
works are: 1. Repentance, which has two parts. The first is a Detestation,
sorrow and comfession of former sins. 2. Sam. 24.10. 1. King. 8. 33. etc. 2.
Chron. 33. 12. Job 42. 6. Prove. 28. 13. Isai. 1.16. Joel. 2.12. Jonah. 3. 8. 2.
Cor. 7.11. 1. Ioh. 1.9. The second is an Holy desire and purpose and labor
after a new life, Deuteronomy. 4.29. 1. Chron. 7.14. Nehem. 1. 9. Ezekiel. 18.31.

Luke 1.74.75. Mat. 16.16. 1. Cor. 11.26. Gal. 3.1.) and of Men, especially
such as have any way offended us, by laying aside all maliciousnes, and
revengfull desires and purposes, and forgiving the injury. Mat. 5.
23.34.44.45.6.12. 1. Pet. 2.1. etc.
