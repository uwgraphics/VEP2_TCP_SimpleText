A Proclamation against making Collections without License under the Great
Seal.
FOrasmuch as the Lords of His Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council have
been informed that his Majesty's loving Subjects in sundry places of this
Kingdom have been much wronged and abused by forged and counterfeited
Certificates and warrants, or Licenses for Collections, made in the Names of
persons of Quality, and others his Majesty's Ministers and Servants: upon
which said forged Certificates, Warrants, and Licenses, public Collections
have been made, as well in Churches, as otherwise, to the abuse of the Charity
of his Majesty's good Subjects, and discouraging the forwardness of such as
are well disposed to help such as have had great Damage and Losses, both by
Shipwreck and Pirates at Sea, and by fire and other casualties at Land.

His Highness therefore with the advice of His Privy Council, does by this
His Proclamation straightly Charge and Command all his Majesty's Officers, and
Ministers whatsoever, whom it shall concern, not to suffer any such
Collections to be made hereafter for any person, or persons, upon any pretense
whatsoever, without Warrant, or License for the doing thereof under the great
Seal of England first obtained, and had in that behalf: And that none of His
Subjects presume to Grant or Issue any such Warrants, upon pain of His
Majesty's high indignation and displeasure.

Given at the Court at Whitehall, this one and twentieth day of March, in the
eighth year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord, CHARLES by the grace of God
King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
MAJESTY: and by the Assigns of John Bill. M.DC.XXXII.
