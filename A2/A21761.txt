Where as in and adioinyng to our County of Deuon, there is between the Haven
of Exmouthe in the said County of Deuon, and our Cobbe of Lime Regis in our
County of Dorcet, one Baie very dangerous in time of Winter and Tempests:
In and nere which place in times paste, has been a good and safe Port and
Haven; called Culliton Haven at Seaton, in our said County of Deuon: as may
well appear both by ancient writings, and other evidence: and also by
sundry Anchors and Ship timber, daiely found in the land Meddowes, and
Marshes there about, as we are informed. Which Haven at that time was of
great use and commodity, for the trade and traffic of Merchandise, for the
benefit and relief of the Subjects of this our Realm, for the profit of the
Country adioynyng, for the maintenance of the Navy, Fishermen, and Mariners,
as well of our Proginitours, as of their Subjects. And especially has been a
great succor, and place of refuge, and safeguard for ships and men, arriuyng
about the same coasts: and where by the decaie and stoppyng of the said
Haven, and for lack of such a sure place of arrival in so great a space,
and upon so large and dangerous seas, great number of Ships, and bodies of
English Merchants, Passengers, Mariners, and other people, and also of
sundry strangers Merchants, and other being in amity with us, have yearly
been most lamentably cast away and perished, and are like to be cast away
and perish, if good remedy in that behalf be not provided: All which
matters together, with the great importance, necessity, and profit to this
our Realm, that the Haven there may be repaired and restored, has been
certified unto us by the Justices of Peace, and other Gentlemen, inhabityng
within our said County of Deuon. And where our loving and faithful Subjects,
the good men and inhabitauntes of our town of Culliton, in our said County
of Deuon, have not only made their most humble suite to us, that of our
gracious goodness and clemency, it would please us to provide some convenient
mean, that the said Haven may be new made, and repaired: But also have
offered to employe their travails, diligences, and expenses of their goods,
to the uttermost of their habilities, for the performance of the said good and
charitable work. And for that the finishyng thereof, far surmounteth their
power and substance, and the benefit is to grow thereby not to them selves
alone, but to the whole body of our Realm and Subjects, either tradyng the
Seas, or having commodity and use of things carried out, or brought in by way
of Merchandise, and specially to those whose persons of their friends or
goods, may by so good a Port be preserved: They have most humbly besought
us to commend the same good laudable deed, and the charitable furtheraunce
thereof, to the benevolence of all our Subjects, trustyng that all good
Christian and English persons, will for common Charity and love to their
Country, and the rather for our good commendation, the more liberally
contribute, that the same may be speedely and substancially done and
performed. We therefore tenderyng the said humble petitions, and of our due
and royal care for the preservation, defense, and advancement of this our
Realm and Subjects, esteemyng no one thing more necessary then the increase
of the Navy, Fishermen, and Merchants, which without good Ports and
Havens, can not be sustained: Of our special grace, certain knowledge, and
mere motion, have given and granted, and by these our Letters Patentes, do
