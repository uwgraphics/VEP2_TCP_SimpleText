HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon of the House of Stuart
By the King. A Proclamation for restraining the abuses in Tin, according to
the Laws and ordinances of the Stanneries.
WHereas for the well ordering of that ancient and Royal Commodity of the
Tin of this Our Realm of England, diverse and sundry good Laws and
Ordinances have been heretofore made and established, by the wisdom of
former times; amongst which there has been ever special care and provision,
that all the said Tin should be duly brought to Our Coynage beams, and
there tried and assayed, and by Our Stamp or Mark sealed and allowed, before
the same should be put to Sale within the Land, or offered to be shipped for
foreign Vent: And to that end also our noble Progenitors have been at charge
to crect and maintain certain Coynage houses in several set Towns within
Our Counties of Deuon and Cornwall, lying most commodious for the said
Coynage: At which places at certain set days of Coynage and post Coynage
appointed, Our special Officers of the Stanneries, do, and have been wont
duly to attend to Receive, Try, Assay, Coin, Seal, and allow the said
Tin, by setting Our Mark, Seal or Stamp upon the same: By which means
both We Our self were secured of the preemption and Coynage duties of the
said Tin (being ancient and undoubted Prerogatives annexed to Our Crown,
with our Duthie of Cornwall) and also the Tin had his just and true Assay,
according to the goodness and richness of it, that neither Our own Subjects
nor others might be defrauded in the buying of the same, nor yet the Subject
hindered by any unnecessary delay in the lawful Trading and Merchandising
thereof. And whereas out of Our princely care to cherish and maintain the
Trade and working of such a worthy and Staple Commodity, of so much honor and
profit to this Commonwealth, We have not long since taken order to allow a
greater price for the working and making thereof, then ever was given before;
and have also by the extraordinary care and industry of Our right trusty and
right well-beloved Cousin and Counselor, Thomas Earl of Suffolk, Our high
Treasurer of England, and of Our trusty and Right well-beloved Counselor, Sir
Foulke Greuill, Knight, Chancellor of our Exchequer, lately settled the said
Tin works and Tin business, in a more orderly and better course then ever
before it was, as well for the benefit of Our most dear Son CHARLES the
Prince, to whom We have lately made Liuerie of Our said Duchy of Cornwall,
as for the contentment and satisfaction of Our loving Subjects the Merchants
and Pewterers of London, and other places, from whose Petitions and Complaints,
We could never be free before.

Bet nevertheless, We are informed that by the secret practice and combination
of sundry ill minded and covetous Owners and workmen of the said Tin works,
a great part of the said Tin has been heretofore, and daily is Bought and
Sold, Received, Delivered, and carried away uncoined, as well in Ships and
other vessels, which under color of coming to buy Cornish Slate and Stone
upon the Coast of Cornwall, between Foway and Meuagase, do imbesell much
uncoined Tin in Blocks, as also by Mariners and Seafaring men, who buy up
the Tin in Bars, commonly called Pocket Tin, of Pewterers and others,
contrary to the ancient Ordinances of Our Stanneries aforesaid, to Our
preindice and wrong in Our said Prerogative, the disgracing of Our said
Commodity, and abuse of Our Subjects buying the same untried, and not Assayed.
In respect whereof, as We might most justly take advantage of sundry offenders
notoriously faulty in this behalf, which in Our natural inclination to
Mercy and Pardon, We are graciously contented to pass by, so We cannot in
Our Princely care of the Common wealth, and Our own Right, but provide for
redress and reformation of these great disorders for the time to come. And
therefore do by these presents straightly charge and command as well all and
singular Our loving Subjects, as all other person and persons whatsoever, that
none of them presume upon any color, shift or pretense whatsoever, at any time
or times hereafter, to Utter, Sell, Deliver, or put to Sale, or to Receive,
Ship, carry, land or contract for any black Tin vnblowen, but to such as
cause the same to be Cast and blown before it be sold for use, or any white
Tin, or Cast Tin before it be first Coined and Stamped with our Seal or
Mark, appointed for that purpose as aforesaid, upon pain of forfeiture,
as well of the said Tin and other condign punishment in case of land carriage,
as also of confiscation of the Ships, Hoyes, Barques, Lighters, and other
Vessels wherein any such prohibited Tin shall be shipped, or laden for
Transportation, contrary to the intendment of this Our Proclamation; and also
upon pain of Our high displeasure, and of such further penalties, forfeitures,
and punishments in both cases, as by the Statutes and Ordinances of Our said
Stanneries, or any other Law or Statute whatsoever, or by the censure of Our
high Court of Star chamber, for disobeying this Our Royal commandment and
Iniunction, or otherwise may be inflicted upon the offenders in this behalf:
Giving all Our loving Subjects to know, that any toleration or forbearance for
the time past, shall be so far from justifying or warranting the like abuses
to be continued in time to come, as contrariwise it shall aggrauate the fault
thereof in respect of Our former clemency.

And whereas We are given to understand, That there are certain wandering
petie Chapmen, or Tinkers, and others, haunting much about the Tin works
aforesaid, who do make it an usual Trade to buy black Tin by the Bowl,
and white Tin uncoined by the pound weight, or other small quantity; and so
do carry the same from the work houses to certain private places of Receipt,
till having gotten by this unlawful means some store together, they vent or
spend the said black Tin before it be blown, and sell the said white Tin
before it be Coined, by Sea or by Land, where they find best Chapmen, to the
preindice of Us and Our loving Subjects, as aforesaid: Our will and pleasure
is, and We straightly charge and command all and singular Our Justices of Peace,
before whom any such Tinker, petic Chapman, or other person offending shall be
brought, diligently to examine and find out, where, and of whom he had the
said prohibited Tin, white or black, found with him, and where, and to whom
he meant, or intended to sell the same, or has heretofore sold any other of
like sort; and as well the said Tinkers and petie Chapmen, as all other persons
who shall be found privy to the Buying, or Selling, Receiving, or Delivering
of the said Tin, black or white, as aforesaid, to commit to Our Jail of the
County where they shall be taken, and otherwise to punish according to the
Laws, Customs, and Ordinances of Our Stannerics, and as the quality and
nature of the offense shall by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm deserve,
for contempt of Our Royal Commandment and Proclamation in this behalf:
Willing, and requiring all and singular Our Shiriffes, Mayors, Bayliffes,
Constables, and other Our Officers and loving Subjects, to Attach, Stay, and
Arrest all such Purloyners and secret Cariers of Tin, black or white, and to
bring them before the next Justice of Peace, for order to be taken with them,
as aforesaid, as they and every of them will answer for the contrary hereof at
their uttermost perils.

Given at Royston the 26. day of October, in the thirteenth year of Our Reign
of Great Britain, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the nine and fourtieth.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most excellent
Majesty. Anno Dom. 1615.
