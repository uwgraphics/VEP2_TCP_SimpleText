THe two Luminaries (as may be observed) shall suffer four Eclipses this Year,
namely two of the, and two of the, whereof the last of the Moon will only be

September, which will be visible at Edinburgh (to such as please to take the
pains to observe it) it continues almost 3 whole hours. The digits Eclipsed are
3 minutes, in the forenoon, that being the time the true opposition.

The fourth and last, is an invisible Eclipse of Sun upon Monday, the 3 of
October, near abou^^

But of all Drinks Canary is the host;
It is the Poets Helliconian Liquor,
R^^ens his Wits, and makes his Pen run quicker.
This month we are like to have either fair or soul weather, or perhaps both.
Foul weather shall be more plentiful than fair dealing. Many men shall be

A great Consumption this month shall be in Poem purses, occasioned by the
juice of the Spanish Grape; and let the weather be what it will, the Spring

Of Cowslips, Peagles, Violets, Primroses,
Wherewith young Country Lasses make them Poses.
^mall hopes by the Stars that it will rain money into (...) men's purses,
Saturn being malevolent, says plainly the Lawyers having little to do, they
may if they please study Astrology, to find out who kisses their wives at
home, when they are bawling at the Parliament-Hall.

weather, with some raw frosts in the morning.

Raw fruit, through ripe, may sickness bring;
Unripe, much eat, a dangerous thing.
If now a Surfeit thou do take,
When others sleep thou must awake.
The eleventh day of this month, a thousand pound to a penny but the days and
nights will be of equal length, Venus being in her detriment, shows that a
great controversy will arise amongst the Chyrurgions in Vtopia, whether men
first got the Pox from women, or women from men; but Mars being well fortified
in the tenth house, it is plain it will be carried on the men's side. Those
women that are born when the Moon wears horns, will be sure to cuckold their
Husbands, and those men that are born under a three-penny Planet, will never be
worth a Groat as long as they live.

13, 14, 15 violent winds, from the 15 to 23 some showers of hail with rain, and
various to the end of the month.

Warm clothes must now provided be,
Also warm meats are good for thee.
Have good regard thy feet be dry,
Thou shall avoid much harm thereby.
Now young men and maids begin to mind the thing called Marrying, they consider
that the Winter is coming on, and that two in a head will be warmer then one. I
perceive by the stars that Lawyers will not refuse to take Fees when it is
proffered them; Oh the power of Golden showers, how it ripens Causes and
Proceedings! but Mars and Luna being opposite in the fiery Trigion, denotes
that it will be dangerous to kiss a handsome wise before her jealous husbands
face.

Knaveries, Ribaldries, Rogueries, and Treacheries,
In this month (as other months) some do sit and devise;
Many would be counted wise, but most men are otherwise,
For whimzies and prodigies fills men's heads with coleries.
The weather now beginning to grow cold, men will be think themselves of
providing them Night-wast-coats; as ^or the women they can provide for
themselves, and in despite of fate will verify that Proverb, to make much off
^ought. The Devil will not in this, nor in any other month go to look for
Userers in Almshouses, if he do, he may chance to loose his labor.

The first 8 days cold and nipping, 9 10 11 12 strong frost, 13 14 15, rain or

The weather now is cold, the ways are dirty,
Keep then the house, and play at One and thirty.
Minced Pyes do not grow upon every tree,
But search the Ovens for them, and there they be.
Though the weather be cold, there will be hot doings this month in Cooks
shops, the belly must be fed, although the back be but mean clad. The third
sort of Court-Cards shall be more used than all the rest in the Pack. It will
be very dangerous this month for a man to pay money that has none. About the
latter end of the 31 day, a man may venture a good wager that the year is near
expiring.

The use of this Table and the practical part thereof is this. First find the
age of the on the other side, with which age of the, enter this little Table,
which (by inspection) will show you the hour and minut of full Sea or high
Water at Leith.

Example, I desire to know the time of full Sea or high Water at Leith, the 15
day of January (this Year 1670.) Therefore I look in the following Table for
the 15 day of January, against which I find the age to be 4 days old, with
which 4 days of the age, I enter this little Table, and having found the same
therein, over against it, I find 5 8. viz. 5 hours 8 minutes, that is to say, 8
min. past 5 in the morn (or afternoon) the said 15 day of January, 1670. it
will be full Sea, or high Water at Leith.

Here note, that every 12 hours, it is full Sea or high Water at Leith. As
also, that every Tide alters 24 minutes of time, so that the afternoons Tide is
24 minutes later then the mornings Tide.
