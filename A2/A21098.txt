To the Right Worshipful Sir Thomas Gerard Knight.
SIR, it is not long, since it first pleased you to grace me with your
acquaintance. Yet in so littell time, I have observed great arguments, of your
more then most singular love, to this never sufficiently beloved and admired
faculty of Music: as namely, the perfect pleasure and contentment you seem to
take therein; Your indefatigable assiduitie in the private exercise thereof,
which has gained you such a perfection that way, as is rare in a Gentelman of
your rank:

And lastly your courteous and amiable deportment toward my poor self, and
others, such as my self; the sons of Music, when by chance you light among
us. Unworthy were I then of that thrice worthy Mother, unworthy to be
phrased a son of Music, should I not heartily affect and honor you, in such
sort as I do, whom I find so entirely to love and honor her. And hence it is,
even of my love which you have well deserved for loueing her so well, that I
have singled you out among so many my worshipful good friends for the Patron
of these my second labors, and have first presented them unto your name, that
under your protection and countenance they might pass abroad into the world.
May it please you therefore to entertain them, coming from a good affection,
with a favorable acceptance* which I assure my self you^ gentelnesse will
vouchsafe to do; especially since they come in so seasonable a time, at the
very entrance of a new year, when usually all gifts are well taken, even
trifles at their hands whose ability will not reach to present matters of
higher worth: And so I humbly take my leave,

from Ely house in Holborne. Yours in all love and duty, Michaell Est.
