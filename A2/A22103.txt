By the King.
A Proclamation prohibiting the Importation of Allome into any his Majesty's
Dominions.
James by the Grace of GOD, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc. To all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting.
Whereas We have always held it one of the most and necessary cares and
considerations incident to the State and Office of Kings and Sovereign
Princes, so to dispose of their people and government, as the knowledge and use
of good and profitable Arts and Inventions may become common and frequent among
their people, the same being one of the greatest means to increase and
preserve the wealth and strength of State and people, considering how contrary
effects Labor and Idleness do produce; the one making Kingdoms great and
flourishing, the other, always bearing the marks of beggerie and contempt:
Forasmuch as some of Our good and loving Subjects of Our Realm of England,
have of late to their great charge, and no less commendation, found out, and
made proof of sundry Mines in Our County of York, and elsewhere within Our
Realm of England, for the making of Allome, a Merchandise of great necessity,
and use sundry ways for all Our Dominions, and did so well and commendably
proceed therein, as that they were able to make sufficient store of Allome, not
only to serve for the use and expense of all Our said Kingdoms, but also to
afford and spare great quantities thereof, to be every year Transported for
the use and service of Our neighbor Kingdoms and Nations: And whereas the
said persons by their skill and industry, have effected so good and great a
work, have willingly and freely offered and yielded up the same Allome Mines
into Our hands, upon such conditions and considerations, as have given them
full contentment and satisfaction, all men being able to judge, that a matter
of that consequence, and wherein so many of Our people should be interessed,
was more fit for Us to take into Our hands, then to leave the same in the
power of private men: For which causes and considerations, We have caused the
said whole Work to be taken into Our possession, and of late have disbursed
great sums of Money thereupon for the setting forward and aduanting the said
Work, for the good and be^^^^^ of Our people and loving Subjects, and have
also provided and taken sufficient order, that Our loving Subjects in all
parts, shall not at any time want convenient quantity of the said Commodity
of Allome for their use, and shall also be served of it at reasonable prices:
which care and good intention of Ours, has of late been greatly interrupted
and opposed, by the bringing into Our said Kingdoms and Dominions, great
quantities of foreign Allome from diverse parts beyond the Seas, whereby this
so excellent an Invention and blessing of Almighty GOD, bestowed upon Us and
Our people, is likely to be utterly defeated and overthrown, if the same by
Our care should not be provided for, and carefully prevented. And albeit that
by means of the Allome made and to be made within Our said Realms, We shall
receive great hinderance in Our Customs, and other duties, formerly paid
unto Us and Our predecessors, Kings and Queens of this Realm, for and upon
that commodity imported; yet We, that in all Our actions and proceedings have
Our eye of Grace rather upon the flourishing estate of Our Kingdoms, and the
comfort of Our people, then upon Our profit, have resolved rather to quit and
forsake such benefit unto Our own Coffers, then to interrupt or overthrow so
excellent a Work, of Our care and Princely policy, for the welfare of Our
Subjects.

These are therefore to require and command all and singular person and persons
whatsoever, as well Our natural borne Subjects, as Denizons or Strangers, That
none of them, nor any other person or persons whatsoever, do at any time or
times hereafter, attempt or presume to bring, or cause to be brought into these
Our Realms of England, Scotland, or Ireland, or any other Our Dominions, or
into any the Ports, Havens, Creekes, or places of any of them, any Allome, in
greater or lesser quantities, made or to be made in any foreign part or place
whatsoever, or of Allome made here within this Kingdom, after that the same
has been exported, upon pain of forfeiture of all and every quantity and
quantities of Allome, so brought, or caused to be brought into Our said
Dominions, contrary to this Our present commandment: All which said Allome
brought and to be Imported and forfeited, Our will and pleasure is, that such
person and persons as shall make seizure of the same Allome, shall forthwith
convey the same Allome to the Warehouse of Robert Johnson Merchant, one of Our
Agents for that business, lying in Our City of London, where he so bringing
and delivering the same, shall have and receive of Our said Agent, upon the
delivery thereof, the full sum of Twelve pounds for every Tun of Allome,
and so ratably Twelve shillings for every Hundredth weight of such, and so much
as he and they shall bring thither; to the end that the same Allome, shall be
with all convenient speed Exported out of this Kingdom into some foreign
parts beyond the Seas, so as no foreign Allome be sold, spent or used, within
these Our said Realms or Dominions, or any part thereof; And also upon pain
of Our high indignation and displeasure, and of such further pains, penalties
and punishments, as for the contempt of Our commandment Royal in this
behalf, may any way be inflicted upon them, or any of them so offending,
contrary to the true intent and meaning herein signified.

And We do further straightly charge and command all and singular persons,
that shall seize any such foreign Allome as aforesaid, shall forthwith
convey and bring the same, and the whole quantity thereof (without selling,
uttering, compounding or delivering back any part,) unto the house of the said
Robert Johnson, as is before declared, upon pain of Imprisonment, and such
other punishment as shall be fit to be inflicted for the breach of this Our
Royal Commandment. And We do also further require and command, all and
singular the Officers of Our Customs within all and every the Ports and Havens
of the same Our Dominions, and the Creekes and members of the same Ports, that
they and every of them, do from and after the date hereof, at all times
forbear to take any entry or entries, or to take and make any Composition for
any Custom, Subsidy, or other duty, for or upon any Allome, brought or to
be brought into any Our Dominions, from any foreign parts: And also that
they and every of them (whom it does and shall concern) do stay and seize as
forfeited and confiscated, to the use and uses aforesaid, all and singular such
Allome, as from and after the date hereof, shall be by any person or persons
whatsoever, brought into any Port, Haven or Creek of the same Our Dominions,
upon pain of forfeiture of their Offices, and of undergoing Our high
indignation and displeasure, with such further pains and punishments, as for
the same their contempts or defaults, may any way be inflicted upon them, and
every of them in this behalf offending.

And for the better execution of this Our present will and Commandment, We
do straightly charge and command all Justices of the Peace, Majors, Bayliffes,
Sheriffs, Constables, Headboroughes, Tything-men, and all other Our Officers,
Ministers and loving Subjects, to whom it shall and may appertain, That they
and every of them, at all time and times hereafter, and from time to time, be
ayding and assisting to Our said Customers, Collectors, Searchers, Waiters, and
to all such other person and persons, as We shall lawfully authorize for the
searching, seizing, taking, and carrying away of all and every such Allomes,
Imported, or hereafter to be Imported, contrary to this Our Royal Prohibition
and Commandment. And nevertheless We do hereby signify and declare, That
whereas We did publish a former Proclamation of this nature, bearing date the
Nineteenth day of June, in the seventh year of Our Reign, that Our intention
is, that the same (as to all offenses past,) do stand in full force, any thing
in this present Proclamation to the contrary notwithstanding.

Given at Royston the tenth day of October, in the twelfth year of our Reign
of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the eight and fourtieth.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. Anno Dom. 1614.
