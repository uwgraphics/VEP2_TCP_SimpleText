The morale proverbs of Cristyne
tHe great vertus of our elders notable
Often to remember is thing profitable
An happy house is. where dwells prudence
For where she is Raison is in presence
A temperat man cold from have asseured
May not lightly long saison be miseured
Constante couraigis in sapience formed
Wole in no wise to vicis be conformed
Where nys Justice* that land nor that country
May not long regne in good prosperity
Withouten faith may there no creature
Be unto god plaisant. as says scripture
Propre worldly and to god acceptable
Can noman be. but he be charitable
Hope keeps not promys in eury wise
Yet in this world hit guides ma^ny a wise
In greet estat ligth not the gloire
But in virtue which worth is memoire
A cruel prince gronded in avarice
Should his peuple not trust. if he be wise
Yiuyng in time and wisely to refreigne
Makes oon welthy and in estat to reign
Now preyse now blame com^unely by vsance
Shows folly and no maniere constance
A pryncis court without a gouuerneur
Being prudent can not lest in honneur
Great diligence with a good Remembrance
Does a man often to high honneur auance
A fool can preyse naught for lak of Raison
And the wise man^ has no presumpcion
A mighty prince that wole here his consaille
Patiently, to prospere can not faille
He is prudent, that makes pourueyance
For thing to come before er fall the chance
A man in pride fixed with heart and mind
Casts no dread, yet woo soon does him find
That land has hap. whereof the lord or king
Is sad and true, and uses good living
Lightly to here and to love flaterye
Gendreth error and werre does multiplye
Wise is not he. that weneth to be sure
Of his estat, though he have hit in ure
In souffisance of this worldis richesse
Is surer Rest than in the great largess
To hante vertus and vicis to bannysshe
Makes a man wise, and godly to finysshe
A benign prince of good conditions
Draws ma^ny oon to his opinions
He is happy that can exemple take
Of his neighburgh seeing him sorwes make
Wisdam they lakke, that fortune do not dread
For ma^ny a wight to trouble does she led
Much to enquire is no thing profitable
Nor for to be greetly entermettable
To much trustyng has hindered ma^ny a man
So has wenyng, that well deceive oon can
A Railing man and for alier knawe
Uneath has trust. though he tell asooth saw
He is wise, that his Ire can restreigne
And in anger his tongue also refreigne
He* that is fed and has his hertis lust
What peigne the hungry has. he wole not trust
Falsehede is not to cautele so applied
But by som^e folkis sometime hit is aspied
His Renon shall be good and long lasting
That has the fame of truth in his deling
Full greet peigne is to change condition
After. that aige has oon in hire bandon
Whoo wole him self to greet estat enhance
Must before he acqueinted with suffrance
Faueur gileth, and ma^ny a time hit tourneth
The Right to wrong, and wrong to right retourneth
Oon aughte to work. whil he has liberte
For saison lost can not Recouured be
To much to think or else having no thought
Makes oon foryete such thing, as he ne ought
An aiged man withouten wit or connyng
Is a vessel* that virtue is lakkyng
He* that secheth often other to blame
Yiueth right cause to here of him the same
True gentillesse can be noon other thing
But the palais where honneur is dwelling
Blame and reprief to have is he worthy
That sees the good and Iugeth contrary
He. that may not evil company escheue
Yet at the lest late him soon thens Remeue
Great folly is in him. that takes head
Upon other, and not to his owen need
Necessite at sometime to consent
Causes famyne greet trouble and tormente
Repented has ma^ny a creature
Thing done away. which in his hand was sure
Courtoise spekyng refreigneth often Ire
For to the heart hit is a greet plaisire
Often is seen a man^ in Indigence
To high estat comen by his diligence
Opinions with faueured sentence
Guides the world more than vraye seyence
There aughte noman to be fires ne cruelle
For what may fall him self, he can not tell
Rather to bow, than break is profitable
Humylite is a thing commendable
He is a fool. that does his charge enhance
Upon promys without other substance
Hit sits not a woman to diffame
For upon him self shall return the blame
For to foryete a yifte or courtosy
Shows ingratitude euydently
Sured maniere and few wordis well set
In women does rightwel, where they be met
Service in court is no seur heritaige
Hit failleth often with little auantaige
He. that spurneth an al with violence
Unto him self does most grief and offense
To torn to Iape an Injury or a wroong
Is greet wisdam to be used emoong
Goodly raisons not well taken^ ne construde
Seems flowers cast among bestis rude
A wrettheful man or oon in geleusye
Aughte have no trust. for often they wole lie
Cruel spekyng in a matiere hayneuse
Axeth answer angry and despiteuse
There can no good endure saison ne space
But oonly such, as came by goddis grace
Idele plaisirs used coustumably
Be hard to change, though they be blame worthy
He that loves evil tales to report
To make debate seems well his disporte
Necessite, pouert and Indigence
Causes ma^ny greet Inconvenience
A meene estat is better to entende
Than high climmyng lest that oon sone descend
Right to relesse sometime is no dotaige
So that hit be for a more auantaige
In well doing having a true Renon
Bringueth a man to good conclusion
Foryeting god for this worldis richesse
Shows no faith, but slauthe and great latchesse
