Instructions concerning the Gamut.
IN the First Column of your Gamut, you have the Names of the several Lines and
Spaces. In the Second, you have the Notes to each Line and Space, and their
Names as they are to be Sung when Mi is Bmi.

In the Third, you have the Notes to each Line and Space, and their Names as
they are to be Sung when Mi is in Ela.

In the Fourth and last Column you have the Notes to each Line and Space, and
their Names as they are to be Sung when Mi is in Alamire.

Secondly, you see the Lines of your Gamut are divided into three Fives,
expressing the Three several Parts in Music (viz.) Treble, Tenor and Bass: And
upon one of these Five Lines in every Part, you will find a particular Mark or
Character called a Cliff; by which you may know exactly how to call every Note,
that is placed upon the five Lines, or Spaces; for upon the fourth Line from
the bottom, which is F-faut, you will see this Mark * which is called the Bass
or F-faut Cliff; because it is placed upon F-faut: And upon the Second Line
above it you will see this Mark * which is called the Tenor or C-sol-faut
Cliff. And upon the Second Line above that you will find* this Mark * which is
called the G-sol-reut or Treble Cliff.

Now take any of the Five Lines which you see Tied or Braced together out of
the Scale, and you will find these several Cliffs placed as follows: The Bass upon
the upper Line but one of the Five. The Tenor upon the middle Line of the Five,
and the Treble upon the lower Line but one of the Five,

Now as I said before, by these Cliffs you may know exactly how to name your
Notes when you see them pricked down, either in Treble, Tenor, or Bass. But
that you may the better understand them, I Will lay before you these following
Examples in the Three several Cliffs.

The First Example in the Treble or Gsolreut Cliff.
^ Sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol, la, fa, sol, ^ la, mi, fa, sol, la, fa,
sol, la, mi, fa, sol, ^ la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la,

The Second Example in the Tenor, or Csolfaut Cliff.
^ la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la, ^ mi, fa, sol, la, fa, sol,
la, mi, fa, sol, la, ^ fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi,

The Third Example in the Bass, or F-faut Cliff.
^ fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi ^ fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la,
mi, fa, sol, la, fa, ^ sol, la, mi, fa, sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa*

Thirdly, You may here observe by these Examples that Mi is the principal or
Master-Note, which leads you to know all the rest; for having found out that,
the other follows in course. And this Mi, as I have already shown, has its
being in Three several places. The first of them you see is in Bmi, but if a
Flat, which is known by this Mark () be set in that place, then it is removed
into its second place, which you see is Elami; and if a Flat be also set in
that place, then it is removed into its Third place, which you see is Are or
Alamire: so that in which of these places you find it, the next Notes above it
Ascending (as you may see in the foregoing Examples) are called Fa, sol, la,
Fa, sol, la; and then you see the next Note is called Mi again: In like manner
the next Notes below it Descending are called La, sol, fa, La, sol* fa, and
then you see the next Note is called Mi again, for it is found but once in
eight Notes Ascending or Desecending.

Now I proceed to the first Example of Tuning the Voice, or a Lesson of Plain
Song upon Five Lines in the Treble, or Gsolreut Cliff, consisting of eight
Notes gradually Ascending and Desending.

^ Sol, la, mi, fa, sol, la, fa, sol, sol, fa, la, sol, fa, mi, la, sol,

Now you are to observe when a Sound is given to the first Note, which is
called Sol, you are then to rise to La (as the next in order above it) one
whole Tone or Sound, and another whole Tone to Mi: From Mi to Fa is but half a
Tone; From Fa to Sol, and Sol to La, are whole Tones; From La to Fa, but half a
Tone; From Fa to Sol a whole Tone; And you might Ascend, if your Voice would
permit you, Ten Thousand Octaves in the same Order as this one. The difference
between whole Tones and half Tones either rising or falling, are easily
distinguished; for all whole Tones are cheerful to the Ear, but half Tones are
melancholy; and you will always meet with two half Tones (either rising or
falling) within the compass of Eight Notes, and those two are called Fa: For to
rise from Bmi to Csolfa, and from Ela to F-faut, are melancholy Sounds; Also
to fall from F-faut to Ela, and from Csolfa to Bmi are melancholy sounds.

Now for fear you should not Sing these Notes in Tune at the first, you ought
to get the Assistance of a Person, either skilled in the Voice or Instrument,
and let him Sing or Play your Eight Notes over with you, till you can retain
the sound in your Memory so well, as you may be able to do it without him: And
when you are perfect in this first Example, here is a second Example a little
harder which is called Thirds* because of the skipping from the first Note to
the Third, and so missing a Note upon every Key as you rise and fall.

^ sol, mi, la, fa, mi, sol, fa, la, la, fa, sol, mi, fa, la, mi, sol,

But for fear you should not rightly understand what I mean by skipping a Note,
I have set you a third Example, thus: ^ Sol, la, mi, sol, mi, la, mi, fa, la,
fa, mi, fa, sol, mi, sol, ^ fa, sol, la, fa, la, la, sol, fa, la, fa, sol, fa,
mi, sol, mi* ^ fa, mi, la, fa, la, mi, la, sol, mi, sol.

You see now from the first Note of this Example you Ascend three Notes
gradually, as you were Taught before in your Eight Notes, and then you fall to
your first again, then leaving out the second Note which should be Alamire, you
skip from the first to the third, or from Gsolreut to Bfabemi, which will be
the same thing with the Second Example, called Thirds: And the same Method you
must observe in the rest of this Example: Also the like must be done with
Fourths, Fifths, Sixths, Sevenths, and Eighths, As you may see in this Fourth
Example, wherein these several Leaps, or Skippings in general are proved.

^ Sol, la, mi, sol, mi, sol, la, mi, fa, sol, fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol, sol,
sol ^ Sol, la, mi, fa, sol, la, sol, la, sol, la, mi, fa, sol, la, fa, sol, fa
^ Sol, la, mi, fa, sol, la, fa, sol, sol, sol, ^ sol, fa, la, sol, la, sol, fa,
la, sol, sol, sol, sol, fa, la, sol, fa, sol, fa, ^ Sol, fa, la, sol, fa, mi,
sol, mi, sol, fa, la, sol, fa, mi, la, sol, la, ^ Sol, fa, la, sol, fa, mi, la,
sol, sol, sol,

I shall now proceed to give you some Instruction in the Flats and Sharps,
which are two Characters of a different Quality, and much used in Music.

A Flat is known upon a Line or Space by this mark () and a Sharp by this ()
and the use of them are to Flat and Sharp any Note they are placed before.

As for Example.

Suppose you were singing your Eight Notes, and when you come to Csolfa, or the
first Fa above your Mi you should find a Sharp in that Space, you must not Sing
it as I directed you in your first Example of Tuning the Voice, where I told
you it was but half a Note or Tone above your Mi, but you must sing it a whole
Tone above your Mi, for the Quality of a Sharp is to raise any Note it is
Placed before half a Note or Tone higher, (or to speak like a Musician) sharper
than it was before. Also when you descend to a Sharp, as from Ela, to Dlasol,
or from Alamire to Gsolreut, and a Sharp, should be in Dlasol or Gsolreut, then
you are to fall but half a Note, which is a Melancholy sound, as I before told
you all half Notes were, either rising or falling, and consequently you may
easily distinguish whether you sound it right or not, for it is like falling
from Ffaut to Ela, or from Csolfa to Bfabemi.

A Flat, when it is placed before any Note which you should sound a whole Tone
or Note higher than the Note immediately before it, obliges you to sound it but
half so high, in the same manner as from Bfabemi to Csolfa, or from Ela to
Ffaut.

Observe also, that when these Flats or Sharps are placed at the beginning of
your five Lines immediately after your Cliff, they serve to all the Notes that
shall happen in that Line or Space where you see them placed, unless it is
contradicted by a Flat or Sharp placed before that Note which the Composer has
a mind should be so: And when they are not placed at the beginning, they serve
only to those Notes they are placed before. To conclude: I have made it my
Endeavor so to perfect and finish this Work, that nothing should be wanting to
render it useful to the End it is designed.

His Gift alone did make thee so complete.
Polish the Fabric of reformed Times,
Fresh, fair and fine, to flourish as thy Rhimes.
Lo, thou have art, the learned to content;
To please the curious thou art eloquent,
Quickness thou giv'st to those that quickness want,
And do interpret to the ignorant.
The scrupulous thy skill does satisfy,
And captious carpers are convinced thereby.
Thy price is little, but thy worth is such,
That every leaf deserves twice as much.

The Psalms of David in Meter.
Psalm I.
David's Tune.
^ BLes -- sed, O bes-sed Man is he
^ that shans the Sin -- ners way:
^ the coun -- sell and the com -- pa -- ny
^ of such as go a -- stray:
The scorner's seat that has abhorred:

Upon the Law of God the Lord,
and minds it day and night.

is planted near a River;
Which in his season brings forth fruit,
whose leaf shall never wither.
And all he does is blessed of God.

But are like chaff dispersed abroad,
when stormy wind does blow,

nor may the sinner stand
In Congregation of the just,
when Judgment goes in hand.

the Lord with favor knows:
Whereas the ways shall perish quite
Wherein the sinner goes.
PSALM I.
Meter 2. To the 148 Psalm Tune.
^ THrice bles -- sed Men are they
^ that no bad coun -- sels hear;
^ Nor walk in Sin -- ners way;
^ Nor sit in scorn -- ers Chair,
^ But with de-light do mind the word
^ of God the Lord, both day and night.

by Rivers spreading root
Which when his seasons be,
brings forth his pleasant fruit;
Whose leaf likewise, is always seen
most fresh and green, and never dies.
And whatsoever deed
he puts his hand unto,
Shall Prosper and succeed,

For surely they, shall be like Chaff
which winds blow off, and drive away.

in judgment shall not stand,
Nor sinners have a place
with Saints at Christ's right hand.

but theirs in wrath, he overthrows.
Psalm II.
Windsor Tune.
^WHy rage the hea -- then fu -- -rous-ly?
^and peo -- ple plot vain things?
^The earth-ly Kings their powers ap -- ply,
^and ru -- -lers with the Kings.
God and his Christ oppose they do,
and thus presume to say;

and cast their cords away.

and does in heaven abide,
Shall laugh at this conspiracy,
and their attemps deride.

in wrath, and furious heat:
And very sorely vex his foes;
in his displeasure great*

upon my holy hill,
Enthroned with glorious dignity,
to reign in Sion still.

the Lord has said to me,
Thou art my son, and lo, this day
I have begotten thee.

the priv'ledge of thy birth:
For thine shall all the nations be,
and utmost parts on earth.

and thou shall lift it up
To dash thy foes in pieces small,
like to a potters cup.

ye judges of the land,
Be well instructed in the things
ye ought to understand.

in Gods true service here:
Mix trembling always with your joy,
and worship him in fear.

lest ye excite his wrath:
And so be made to miss the way,
and perish from the path.
For if his anger never so small,
be kindled in his breast,
Then happy, happy are they all
that on their Savior rest.
Psalm III.
Lincoln Tune.
^O Lord, how much do they in-crease,
^that rise to trou -- ble me?
^And they that do di-sturb my peace,
^how ma -- -- ny, Lord, they be?
^How ma -- -ny of my soul have said,
^(pre -- -su -- -ming to pre -- sage)
^There is for him no hope of aid.

when I am hard bestead:

And from his hill of holiness
he heard me graciously.

Because I knew assuredly
the Lord did me sustain.

And came on purpose to oppose,

For thou have smote mine enmies all
upon the bare cheek-bone:
Thou brok'st the teeth of impious men.

Upon thy chosen people then,
thy blessing sure shall be.
Psalm IV.
St. Marys Tune.
^HEar me, O God my right'ous-ness,

How long will ye love vanity,

And he will surely hear my voice,

And silent on your beds begin

And wholly put your confidence

No wickedness nor any ill

And worship in thy holy fear,

And thy strait paths, lest I transgress,

Their throats are open sepulchers,

And into just destruction fall,
by counsels of their own,
And let them be cast out and quelled

For they have wickedly rebelled
against the Lord therein.

Be ever joyful in the same,

And ever compass him about

Psalm X.
Lincoln Tune.
^WHy do thou, Lord, stand off so far,

And he does bless the covetous,

such is his haughty pride:
In all his thoughts God comes not,

Alas! what can the righteous do,

And tongues that speak presumptuous things:

Nor puts out Coin to Usury:

Defend my soul from wicked men,

Which in this life their portion have,

They spend their substance at their will,

And let the Lord my Savior,

So that my moisture did become

My trespass and iniquity

I said, I will to God confess
what all my sins have been:
Then thou forgav'st the wickedness,
and guilt of all my sin.

Sure when great floods of water be,
he safely stands his ground.

from straits thou sets me free:
And with sweet songs of saving grace
thou do encompass me.

My watchful eye shall be thy guide,
lest thou should go astray.

Whose mouth if that the corb it wants,

But him that in the Lord does trust,

With joyful shouts lift up your voice,

Therefore my heart quite fails me,

And with great speed do thou afford

That so his name and memory

His heart heaps up iniquity,

and jointly they combine
Against me to devise my hurt

And now that he lies languishing,
he shall rise up no more.

I was so confident,
That at my table eat my bread,
his heel's against me bent.

and raise me up again:
That I may justly recompense
the doings of these men.

by this good sign I see:
Because my foe may not insult,
nor triumph over me.

And thou for ever set me

From age to age for evermore

And by my toes are brought to dust?

while still the echo to my groans,
Where is thy God, thy only trust?

Bowed down and sunk beneath thy load?
O hope in God, and on him wait,
For I his praise will celebrate,

But as for these, Lord, thou shall please

And make resort unto thy court,
a dweller there to be.
Where all that do abide,

With grace, of which the house is rich

O God of our protecting power,

And also theirs whom the ocean bears;

Gods river which makes the earth so rich,
pours down at thy command,
It does with water flow,
and corn thou do bestow,
When as thou have by thy forecast,
provided for it so.

thou water'st very often:
Her surrows all thou make to fall,
with showers thou make it soft.

thy goodness, Lord, no less
Does crown the year, and every where
thy paths drop fruitfulness.

While rain distills, the little hills

And covered over with stock and store,
they shout for joy and sing.

But now thou have thy people led

And I will offer thee likewise

What he for my poor soul has done,

My tongue likewise extolled his fame
with great alacrity.

For then I knew when I did pray,
my prayer should not be heard.

Unto my prayer and fervent cry,
which did to him ascend.

that always had regard;
And never put my prayer away,
nor sent me home unheard.

Lead captive our captivity,

Yea even for rebellious men

That God the Lord might dwell with them,
and they rebellion leave.

Even that God that has bestowed

In token that he should be crowned,

He is a mere reproach and prey

Wherefore have thou employed thy power,

And stop the hand that stops his breath,
to bring him to the grave?

Which thou have sworn so solemnly
to David in thy truth.
