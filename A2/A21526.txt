A Proclamation, set forth by the Kings Majesty, with the advice of his
highness most honorable counsel, for the reformation of Vagabondes, tellers of
news sowers of sedicious rumors, players, and printers without license, and
diverse other disordred persons, the.xxviii. day of April. in the.v. year of his
highness most prosperous reign.
THe kings most excellent majesty, our natural sovereign lord, certainly
knowing and understanding by the good advise and information of the Lords and
others of his privy counsel, that by the setting forth of Gods holy word,
and th establishment of a pure and sincere religion, conformable to gods
institucion, and the usage of the holy catholic church, with th
administration of Justice, and th observation of the Laws and statutes of this
Realm indifferently among al his subjects, he should not only discharge
his duty to god, but also give an occasion of perfect quietness, humble
obedience, charitable concord, great felicity and wealth, to al his people,
every man in his degree: And upon trust to se th effects and fruicte of the
same, having caused gods word to be truly and sincerely taught and preached,
and a godly order for the administracion of the Sacraments, and other
convenient and decent orders, to be set forth in the church, Is most sorry,
and earnestly from the botom of his heart does lament, and so done all his
counsailors, to hear and se many of his subjects to abuse daily by their
vicious liuinges and corrupt conuersations, that most precious Iuell the word
of god, and by their licencious behauiors, leude and sedicious talks, boldly
and presumpteously without fear either of gods plague, or the swearde of
their Prince, to break continually the Laws and statutes of the realm, to
dispute of his majesty's affairs, to sow, sprede abroad, and tell from man to
man, false lies, tales, rumors, and sedicious devises, against his majesty,
his counsaillors, Magistrates, and Justices: The sede and rote whereof, as they
first had beginning and sprang of the corrupt nature, and ill disposicion of
naughty men (which therefore without short amendment, must and shall be first
scourged with the rod of the prince, and afterward by most dreadful
condempnation at gods hand) So the great fault for the continuance of the
people in evil, has proceeded for want of execution of the good Laws and
Statutes of the realm, and especially the statutes made against vagaboundes,
unlawful games, tellers of news, Inuentors of tales and rumors, unlawful
assembles, riotes, rowtes, huntinges, fishinges, shoting in handgonnes and
Crossebowes, keeping of ale houses, eating of flesh on fishedaies, regrators,
forstallers, breakers of th order of religion and sundry other like statutes,
should undoubtedly not only have caused each man, to have lived in quiet, and
to have applied himself according to his vocation and degree: but also been
causers of great wealth and felicity in this realm. No prince in the world is
more loathe to use thextremitie of correction upon his subjects, then is his
majesty, nor no counsailors more unwilling to advise his majesty thereunto,
then his highness counsailors be, but if the subjects do grow into such a
contempt of their prince, of his laws, and of his ministers, as they care not
to use al such ways as may be dangerous to their sovereign lord and his
estate, and desperately and obstinately in the end, to cast them selfs into
utter ruin and destruction: In this case his Majesty will severely, and sharply
look upon, correct and ponishe, these offenders, thereby to presetue his
estate, and to save the rest of the members of his politic body, which be
his faithful loving and obedient subjects. And yet before his majesty proceed
so far forth, he will use a fatherly facion, and gentely admonish and give
warning ere his majesty fall to chastising. Wherefore his highness on gods
behalf, most heartily does require, and nevertheless, by his royal power and
princely authority, straightly charge and commands all and every his
subjects, of what estate, degree, or condition soever he be, to dread and
fear god and his plagues, to convert and amend their manners, and to live
according to the profession of christen men, to love his Majesty, and to fear
his Sword, to observe his highness Laws* Statutes and Proclamations, to live
every man within the compass of his degree, contented with his vocation, every
man to apply himself to live obediently, quietly, without murmur, grudging,
sowing of sedicion, spreding of tales, and rumors, and without doing or saying
of any manner of thing (as nere as God will give them grace) that may touch
the dignity of his majesty, his counsayl, his magistrates or ministers, or be
hurtful to his neighbor, or in any wise contrary to his majesty's laws,
statutes, or proclamations, whereby his majesty shall the rather be moved to
study, devise, and put in ure, by the good advise of his counsel, al good
ways and means, that may reduce again this realm, unto that prospetite,
estimation, and wealth, which by sundry occasions in process of time has and
is decayed, a thing that his majesty and counsel do most desire, and dout
not, with some convenient time to bring to pass, if the nawghtines of some
evil hearts give not cause of let and empechement to the same, whereunto, if
any shall be so unhappy as to give themselfes, his majesty will with the sharp
sword of his princely power, so sharply chastise and correct them, as may be
to the fearful example of all other. And for the better aduoiding of al such
inconveniences, his majesty straightly charge and commands, all Justices,
Mayors, Shirifes, baylifes, Constables, Hedboroughes, Tithing men, and al other
Officers and ministers of what estate, degree, or condition soever they be, from
hencefurth, to look to their offices, and earnestly, truly, and uprightly, to
execute and se executed, al his majesty's Laws, Statutes and proclamations,
which be within the compass of their offices, and specially the statutes
above rehearsed, and others of like kind and quality, And for because that
within the city of London, there is at this present a great number of idle
persons and masterles men, which seek rather by Idelnes, and mischief to live
by other men's labors and industries, the^ to trauail by any pains taking, to
live like good and obedient members of the common wealth: His majesty
straightlye charge and commands all manner of vagaboundes, and masterles
men, upon the pains, not only all ready appoyncted by the Laws and Statutes
made for such manner of men. But also upon such pains as his majesty may
and will ordain, to be inflicted upon them, by his prerogative royal, to
depart al such out of the city of London, and the Suburbs of the same,
within.iiii. days after the making of this proclamation home to the place
either where they were borne, or where they have dwelt last three years within the
realm, going at the least vii^. miles a day (if they have so far to go from
London) and passing not above.ii. or iii. or iiii. at the most in a company,
and not to abide above one night in a place, till they come home (e^cept cause
of sickness, the same cause to be allowed by a Justice of the peace, dwelling
next to the place where he or they shall fortune to be sick) And that al
vagabondes, and masterles men in all other places, within this realm, shall
also within iiii. days after the making of this proclamation, in the next
market town, where they shall fortune to be, depart likewise to the place
where they were borne, or last dwelled three years within the realm, without
longer tar^eng by the way or going mo in company together, or fewer miles, in a
day, then aforesaid: And upon like pains as is aforesaid for them which
depart from London.

And furthermore, his majesty straightly charge and commands, that no man
be so hardy either to devise any tale, rumor or talk, touching his majesty,
his Counsel, Magistrates, Justices, officers, or ministers, nor hearing any
such tale, rumor, or talk, to tell, report, or speak, the same again to any
other person or persons, then to either one of his counsayl or to a Justice of
peace, and there withal to show also, of whom he had the same, to the intent
that the same person, from whom the tale or rumor comes, may be punished for
the devising of it, if he devised it, or for the telling of it, to any other
person, then by this proclamation is appointed.

And forbicause diverse Printers, Bokeselers, and Plaiers of Enterludes, without
consideration or regard to the quiet of the realm, do print, sell, and play,
whatsoever any light and fantastical head lists to invent and devise, whereby
many inconveniences has, and daily does arise and follow, among the kings
majesty's loving and faithful subjects: His highness therefore straightly
charge and commands that from hencefurth, no printer or other person do
print nor sell, within this Realm or any other his maiestis dominions, any
matter in thenglish to^g, nor they nor any other person, do sell, or otherwise
dispose abroad any matter, printed in any forreyn dominion in thenglishe
tongue, onles the same be first allowed by his majesty, or his privy
counsayl in writing signed with his majesty's most gracious hand or the hands
of six of his said privy counsayl, upon pain of Imprisonment, without bail
or mayneprice, and further fine at his majesty's pleasor. Nor that any common
players or other persons, upon like pains, do play in thenglish tongue, any
manner Interlude, play, or matter, without they have special license to show for
the same in writing under his majesty's sign, or signed by.vi. of his highness
privy counsel willing and straightly charging and commanding al Justices,
Mayors, Shirifes, Bailifes, Constables, and other officers and ministers,
diligently to enquire for, and search out al manner offenders, within the
limits and compass of their commissions, and specially al such as shall
offend against any the poinctes or branches expressly setfurthe in this
proclamation, and to punish the same without remission: Willing likewise, and
also strayghtely charging and commanding, al his good, true, loving and
faythefull Subjects to be aiding, helping, and assisting, to all and every
officer, in thexecution of their charges, as they tender the favor of his
Majesty, and the preservation of the common wealth, as they will answer to
his Majesty, for the contrary at their uttermost peril.

God save the King.
