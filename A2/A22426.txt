By the King.
A Declaration of His Majesty's clear intention, in requiring the Aid of His
loving Subjects, in that way of Loan which is now intended by His Highness.
WHen, with the Advice of Our Privy Counsel, We had resolved, for the
necessary defense of Our Honor, Our Religion, and Kingdoms, to require the
Aid of Our loving Subjects in that way of Loan, for the effecting whereof,
Our Commissions are speedily to go out into the several Counties and Cities
of this Our Realm; We have thought it fit, to publish and declare unto all
Our loving Subjects, what Our clear intention and Royal purpose is thereby,
That, what ever the occasions are, for the public cause both of Religion and
State, and how great soever, for the common defense, (which are obuious to
every man) and no other possible and present course being to be taken, nor this
to be avoided, if We as a King shall maintain the cause and party of
Religion, preserve Our own Honor, defend Our people, secure Our Kingdoms,
and support Our Allies, all which We are tied to do by that bond of
Souereignty, which under God We bear over you: Nevertheless, We are
resolved, and do so declare and publish to all Our loving Subjects Our clear
intention to be, That this course, which at this time is thus enforced upon us
by that necessity, to which no ordinary course can give the Law, shall not in
any wise be drawn into example, nor made a President for after times.

And because We already hear, that some maleuolous persons, who under
pretense of common liberty, factiously intend nothing but the ruin both of
Religion and State, and by delay of present remedy make way to foreign
practices, give out, and scatter their speeches (amongst others) that if this
way of raising Money take place, then no Parliament shall be called hereafter,
and that this course may be taken every year, upon pretense of necessity and
lack of Money; We do hereby publish and proclaim, That, as We will not
suffer any such speeches or practices to go unpunished, So likewise, that the
suddenness and importance of the occasions are such, as cannot possible admit
Us so long time, as the Summoning, Assembling, and Resolution of a Parliament
will necessarily require, And that it is far from Our heart, to make any such
use of the love of Our people, or to make this any annual or usual course of
raising Moneys, But that We are fully purposed to call a Parliament, so soon
as conveniently We may, and as often as the Commonwealth and State-occasions
shall require it; And that by Our peoples affections now showed unto Us in this
way of necessity, they shall the sooner inuit Us to the frequent use of
Parliaments, being confident in the hearts of Our people.

Given at Our Court at White Hall the seventh day of October, in the second
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland. God save the King.
