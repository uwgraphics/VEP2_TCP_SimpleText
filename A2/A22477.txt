A Proclamation for the calling in, and suppressing of two Sermons, Preached
and Printed by Roger Manwaring, Doctor in Divinity, entitled, Religion and
Allegiance.
WHereas Roger Manwaring, Doctor in Divinity, has lately preached two Sermons,
the one upon the fourth, the other on the nine and twentieth of July last, and
after caused them to be printed, and bound up into one Volume, and entitled
by him, Religion and Allegiance, in which Sermons, although the grounds thereof
were rightly laid, to persuade obedience from the Subjects to their Sovereign,
and that for conscience sake; Yet in diverse passages, inferences, and
applications thereof, trenching upon the Laws of this Land, and proceedings of
Parliaments, whereof he was ignorant, he so far erred, that he has drawn
upon himself the just Censure and Sentence of the high Court of Parliament, by
whose judgment also that Book stands condemned: We, taking this into Our
serious consideration, and being desirous to take away all occasions of
scandal or offense, have thought fit, that those Sermons, in respect of those
inferences and applications which he made thereon, be totally suppressed.

And, to that purpose, We do hereby straightly charge and command all and every
person and persons whatsoever, in whose hands any of those Books now are, or
hereafter shall be, that they forthwith deliver, or cause the same to be
delivered, to the Bishop, or other Ordinary of that Diocese or place where he
or they at any time are, if it be not within either of Our Universities; and if
it be in either of the Universities, that then he or they deliver the same to
the Vicechancellour of that University, to whom We do hereby give special
charge and command to cause them all to be utterly suppressed.

And We do further charge and command, that no man hereafter presume to print
the said Sermons, or either of them again, upon pain of Our high displeasure,
and of such further punishment, as for their presumption, in that behalf, may
any way be inflicted upon them.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the four and twentieth day of June, in the
fourth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by BONHAM NORTON and JOHN BILL, Printers to the Kings most
Excellent Majesty, M.DC.XXVIII.
