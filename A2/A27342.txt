A SONG,
Set by Mr. John Eccles,
Sung by Mr. Gouge, in the Farce called Women will have their wills,
exactly engraved by Tho: Cross.
^ Belinda's pretty, pretty, pleasing Form does my happy, happy, happy, happy
Fancy charm: Her prittle-prattle, tittle-tattles all engageing, most obliging;
whilst I Am pressing, clasping, kissing, Oh! Oh! how She does my Soul alarm --
larm There is such Magic in her Eyes, Such Magic in her Eyes, in her Eyes,
does my woe -- nd'ring Heart Surprise: Her prinking, mimping, twinking, pinking;
whilst I Am courting, for transporting, how like an Angel She panting lies, She
pa -- nting lies, lies.

For the Flute.
