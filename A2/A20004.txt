DEATH DANCE.
To be sung to a pleasant new tune, cal^^^ Oh no, no, no, not yet, or, the
meddow brow.


If Death would come and show his face,
as he dare show his power,
And sit at many a rich man's place,
both every day and hour.
He would amaze them every one,
to see him standing there,
And wish that soon he would be gone,
from all their dwellings fair.
Or if that Death would take the pains,
so go to the water side,
Where Merchauts purchase golden gains
to pranke them up in pride.
And bid them think upon the poor,
or else I^le see you soon,
There would be given then at their door,
good alms, both night and noone.
Or walk into the Royall-Exchange,
when every man is there,
No doubt his coming would be strange,
to put them all in fear.
How they do worldly buy and sell,
to make their markets good,
Their dealings all would prosper well,
if so the matter stood.
Or if Death would take the pains,
to go to Paul's one day,
To talk with such as there remains,
to walk and not to pray.
Of life they would take lasting Lease,
though nere so great a Fine,
What is not that, but some would give,
to set them up a Shrine.
If Death would go to Westminster,
to walk about the Hall,
And make himself a Counselor,
in pleas amongst them all.
I think the Court of Conscience,
would have a great regard,
When Death should come with diligence,
to have their matters heard.
For Death has been a Checker man,
not many yeeares ago,
And he is such a one as can,
bestow his checking so.
That never a Clarke within the Hall.
can argue so his case,
But Death can ouerrule them all,
in every Court and place.
If Death would keep a tippling house,
where Roysters do resort,
And take the cap, and drink, carowse,
when they are in their sport.
And briefly say, my Masters all,
why stand you idle here,
I bring to you Saint Gibs his bowl,
twold put them all in fear.
If Death would make a step to dance,
where lusty Gallants be,
Or take Dice, and throw a chance,
when he does gamesters see.
And say, my Masters, Have at all,
I warrant it will be mine.
They would in amazement fall,
to set him any Coin,
If Death would Gossip now and then,
amongst the crabbed Wives,
That taunts and railes at their good men,
to make them weary lines.
It would amaze them, I might say,
so spightfully to boast:
That they will be^are the swing and sway,
and overrule the roast.
If Death would quarterly but come,
amongst the Landlords crew,
And take a count of every sum,
that rises more than de^e.
As well of Income, as of Fine,
above the old set Rent.
They would let Leases Without Coin,
for fear they should be shent.
If Death would take his daily course,
where Tradesmen sell their Ware,
His welcome sure would be ma^^ worse,
then those of monyes bare,
It would affright them for to see,
his lean and hollow looks,
If Death should say, come show to me,
my reckoning in your books.
If Death would through the Markets trace
where Conscience used to dwell,
And take but there a Hucksters place,
he might do wondrous well.
High prizes would abated be,
and nothing sound too dear,
When Death should call, Come buy of me,
would put them all in fear.
If Death would prove Gentleman,
and come to court our Dames,
And do the best of all he can,
to blazon forth their names.
Yet should he little welcomes have,
amongst so fair a crew,
That daily go so fine and brave,
when they his face do view.
Or if he would but walk about,
our City Suburbs round,
There would be given him out of doubt
full many a golden pound.
To spare our wanton femall crew,
and give them longer day:
But Death will grant no Leases new,
but take them all away.
For Death has promised to come,
and come he will indeed,
Therefore I warn you all and some,
beware and take good heed.
For what you do, or what you be,
he is sure to find and know you,
Though he be blind, and cannot see,
in earth he will bestow you.
FINIS.
