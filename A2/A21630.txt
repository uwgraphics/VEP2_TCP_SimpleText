Articles for instruction of all the Uiceadmiralles within the Realm, how to
proceade for the preservation of the quiet trade of all Merchants and
Fysshermen, as well strangers as English, resortyng to the Seas for exercise of
their lawful trades.
THe Uiceadmiralles in every part of this Realm, shall in their own persons,
if they possible may, or else by their deputies, repair immediately to all the
Ports and Crekes within their jurisdiction, and calling unto them the Majors.
Bailiffes, Iurates, or other governors, with the Customers, Comptrollers, and
Serchers of every such Port and Creke, shall impart to them the contents of
these Articles following. For speedy execution whereof, the Queens Majesty's
pleasure is, that every one of the said officers shall endeavor them selves, as
to their calling shall appertain.

First, the said Uiceadmiralles, with the help of the said officers, shall
by an inquest taken, or otherwise, enquire how many vessels do belong
distinctly to every Port and Creke, who be the owners thereof, what the burdens
and names thereof be: and if they be gone to the Seas, then to understand when
they departed thence, with what Captains or Masters, with how many persons,
with what wares or marchaundizes: how much customed, how much not, to what
parts their journey was intended, and when their return was looked for. And
this inquisition made, the said Uiceadmirals shall cause the same to be put in
writing, and subscribed by the hands of him self and these officers
abouesayde.

The like shall be done touching all other vessels remaining in any port, and
not sent forth to the Seas: and it shall be understand that it is not requisite
to certify by force hereof any vessels under the burden of.xvi. Tonnes,
except it shall appear that any under that burden are departed to the seas
suspiciously to do some evil, in which case they shall certify as much as
shall seem to them convenient.

Item they shall enquire and certify how many Mariners be dwelling within
every Port and Creke, how many of them Masters and Pilotes, how many others,
and how many married, how many unmarried, how many owners of Ships and
Uesselles, and how many not.

Item it shall be enquired whether any vessel of any Port, or any person have
gone forth out of any Port or Creke since March last, being not a notorious
merchant man, or a daily fysherman, without good suertie given for his good
behavior, as by ancient order has been used: and of these, certificat shall be
made in manner and form above expressed.

Item after this view taken in every Port and Creke, the owners of every
vessel shall be enjoined upon pain of forfaiture of their vessel, not to suffer
their vessels to go to the seas without good suertie given to the
Uiceadmirall, or to the principal officer of the Port, for to answer all
manner of things that shall be objected against them: so as the Queens Majesty
means to charge either the Uiceadmirall or the chief ruler of the port
town, to answer hereafter for all manner of spoils to be done by any vessel
of such Port: And therefore the said Uiceadmirall and other officers, shall do
well to see to the observation of this charge, and yet to exact nothing upon
any of them for the said assurance: but such as be not to be suspected, to
take their own ^andes: and of others to take suerties. In this matter, except
they see cause, they shall not need to trouble the honest ^yshermen, that do
wekely go to the Seas and wekely return.

Item commandment shall be given in every Port and Creke, that no manner of
ship, other then known Merchants and fysshermen, shall from that time
following, be permitted to come into any Port or Creke to receive any succor
of victual, or to discharge or set upon land any manner of thing, until
either the Uiceadmirall or his deputy, or the principal officer of the town
or place shall have due knowledge whether the said ship have haunted the seas
for any other purpose then for Marchau^dizes or fisshing, or for some special
service done by authority of her Majesty: and if any shall be found suspected
of any evil doing, the same shall be arested and examined, and as the cause shall
require, certificate to be made to the Lord Admiral of England.

Item because there be diverse Skottyshmen and some English with them, that
haunte the Seas under color of a letter of Mark, to take the subjects of the
king of Portugale, whereby many inconveniences have lately ensued: order and
commandment shall be given, that if any ship or vessel shall come into any
Port or Creke, with any wares or goods that may be suspected to have been
taken by color of such letter of Mark, or if any person pretendinge to have
any such letter of Mark, shall come to any Port or Creke for victual or any
succor: The Captain, Master or Pylot of the same shall be arrested, attached,
and examined, and the same being certified to the said lord Admiral, shall
not be permitted to depart before answer given from her Majesty, her privy
Counsel, or the said Admiral. And if any person shall repair to any such
suspected vessel either to buy any thing of them, or to succor them with any
thing, the same shall be committed to prison, and there remain until the said
Lord Admiral shall give order therein.

Finally the said Uiceadmirall and the other officers shall consult emonges
themselves, how they may not only execute these articles effectually, but
also how it may be surely ordered by some other like means, that neither such
as be Pirates and Rouers shall have succor, but be apprehended: and how also
none other may hereafter be permitted to go to the seas for such evil intent
and purpose, and their particular orders in that behalf shall be by them
certified to the Lord Admiral. For such is the principal intent of her
Majesty, to provide that in time of peace both her own subjects and other
Princes might use the trade of Marchaundizes in this Realm, or fysshyng upon
the costs without the danger of depredacion.

God save the Queen.
