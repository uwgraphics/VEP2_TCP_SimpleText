By the King.
A Proclamation establishing the Continuance of His Majesty's Farthing Tokens,
And prohibiting the use of all other Tokens whatsoever
Having heretofore by two several Proclamations, The first bearing Date at
White Hall the nineteenth day of May, in the eleventh year of Our reign of
Great Britain, France and Ireland, The second Dated at Our Manor of
Greenewich, the one and twentieth day of June, in the twelfth year of Our
reign, published Our Royal Will and pleasure, touching the use and
continuance of Our Farthing Tokens of Copper, and the suppressing of the
manifold abuses committed by Tokens of Lead, Brass, or any other Metal, or
matter which Tradesmen do use between them and their Customers in some
derogation to Our prerogative Royal; Thereby straightly forbidding and
prohibiting all and every person and persons whatsoener, to use, deliver, or
receive any such Leaden Tokens as have been formerly tolerated: And yet
nevertheless not only the making and utterance of the said unlawful Tokens
of Lead, or other Metal, or matter contrary to Our said Proclamations, in
contempt of Our Royal commandment, and derogation of Our Royal Prerogative
has been continued; but also diverse abuses have been practiced concerning
our said Farthing Tokens, contrary to the true intent of Our said former
Proclamations. To the end therefore that every person may be left without all
excuse, if again they shall presume to infringe Our Royal commandment, We
do by these presents publish and declare Our Royal Will and pleasure, That
all points and articles contained in either of the said former Proclamations be
duly in all things observed and performed; And that the further use and
continuance of the said Leaden Tokens be utterly put dowme, and abolished; And
that Our Farthing Tokens shall continue without any alteration of the Stamp,
and Print now used, according to the true intent of Our said former
Proclamations; And that no person or persons shall go about to mark, deface,
boar, or clip, any of our Farthing Tokens, or to give, or deliver any other
Tokens of their own making, or made by others for Tickets, with any of Our
Farthing Tokens, either made of Lead, Paper, or Stuff, or Metal whatsoever:
And that in case any of Our said Farthing Tokens have been formerly defaced,
clipped, boared, or any ways altered, We do straightly forbid that none of
the same shall be hereafter used or received: And that no person and persons
shall receive at the hands of any other person whatsoever, any other Farthing
Tokens, or Half peny-Tokens, or any other Tokens then Our said Farthing
Tokens, according to Our former Proclamations: and therefore We do straightly
prohibit and forbid as aforesaid, all and every person and persons whatsoever,
as well to use and receive any Tokens whatsoever, other then Our said Farthing
Tokens, as also to make and counterfeit such Our Farthing Tokens, or the
Engines and Instruments, whereby they are made, or to be made, upon pain of
condign punishment for their offenses in that kind; And do likewise
straightly charge and command all and singular Mayors, Justices of the Peace,
Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Constables, Headboroughs, and all other Officers, and
Ministers to whom it shall or may appertain, to do, their uttermost endeavor,
for the discovery and searching out of all offenses and offenders against this
our Royal commandment, and for the due performance, and execution of the
Premises.

Given at Royston the six and twentieth day of October, in the thirteenth
year of Our Reign of Great Britain France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the
nine and fourtieth.
God save the King.
