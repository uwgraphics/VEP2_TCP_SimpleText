By the King.

WHereas the Kings Majesty has always been ready to embrace and cherish such
a perfect amity and friendship between him and the King of Spain, and the
Archdukes his good brethren, as might stand with his own Honor, and the
common good of his people (For the better and more particular observation
whereof, there has been lately passed a Treaty, wherein his Majesty's royal
will and pleasure is made so notorious to the world in all things, as whosoever
does, or shall cross the sincerity of his Majesty's intention by any action
of theirs, cannot avoid the censure of high and wilful contempt against his
person and State,) Although his Majesty is not ignorant, that these offenses
for the most part, are daily committed by such, as (partly out of their own
original corruption, and partly by habit of spoil and rapine) are become so
insensible or desperate of the peril they draw upon themselves, and the
imputation they cast upon the honor of their Sovereign (so precious to him)
as his Majesty is driven for repair thereof, to make open profession of his
sincerity in this kind, more often then otherwise he would: Nevertheless,
his Majesty having lately found by many circumstances, that most of these
great faults do grow and multiply, by negligence of inferior Officers,
(especially such as are resident in the Ports, and dwell in the Maritime
Counties,) from whom his Majesty expects so continual care and vigilancie
(not only out of fear of his Majesty's displeasure, but even for conscience
sake,) as they should be rather industrious watches over those that run such
wicked courses, then (in any degree) Receitors or Abettors of the same,
considering that those are as well accomptable to God, that hinder not the
evil of others (being in their power, and incident to their peculiar places
and duties) as those that are the personal Actors, or contriuers of the same:
His Majesty has thought it necessary once again to publish to all persons of
what place or condition soever within his Majesty's Dominions, these Rules and
Ordinances following, as things whereunto he commands all persons
(whatsoever) to yield their duetifull obedience, upon peril of his heavy
indignation, and the grievous pains belonging to the same.

FIrst, his Majesty commands that no Seaman or Mariner whatsoever, shall be
suffered to put himself into any Warlike service at Sea of any foreign Prince
or State, straightly charging all that are in any such Service already, to
leave the same presently and without delay, and to record their appearance in
their native Country, to some of his Majesty's Officers, upon pain to be held
and punished as Pirates.

Item, If any person offending, do at any time hereafter come into any port,
or place of his Majesty's Dominions, upon what pretext soever: his Majesty
expressly charge all his Officers forthwith to apprehend the same, and to
commit them to prison without Bail or Mainprise, and the Certificat thereof to
be presently returned into the Admiraltie Court, to the end that they may be
proceeded withal, according to the Laws of the Realm, and the contents of
his Majesty's former Proclamations.

Item, His Majesty commands all his Subjects, (as they will avoid his heavy
indignation) to forbear to be aiding or receiving of any Pirates, or such
persons as shall continue in any such Warlike service, as aforesaid, or any
person not being a known Merchant, by contracting, buying, selling, or by
victualling of them, or any of their Company, upon pain for so doing, to be
punished presently, as the principal Offenders and Pirates ought to be.

Item, That no shipping, or men of war, of what estate or condition soever,
going forth with commission of reprisall, or in any other warlike manner to
serve at Seas, shall be permitted in any of his Majesty's ports, or in the
members thereof to victual or relieve themselves with any warlike provisions,
thereby to enable themselves the better, to any acts of hostility at Sea
against any of his Majesty's friends: but only in their return homewards, if
they happen to come into any of his Majesty's ports, that then it shall be
lawful for them to relieve themselves with victual, or other necessaries to
serve them only for the space of twenty days and no more, which is a
proportion reasonable to use in trade of merchandise.

Item, That all vice admirals, Customers, or other officers of the Ports shall
not suffer any Ship of his Majesty's subjects to go to the Seas, before such
time as they (respectively in their several ports) have duly searched and
visited the same, to the intent to stay such persons as apparently shall be
furnished for the wars, and not for merchandise or fishing. And if there
shall be any manner of suspicion, that the said person (though he shall pretend
to trade for merchandise or fishing) has or may have any other intent by his
provisions or furniture, then to use the trade of merchandise or fishing, that
in such case of suspicion, the officers of the Ports shall stay, and no ways
suffer the same to pass to the Seas, without good bands with sufficient
sureties first had, to use nothing, but the lawful trade of merchandise or
fishing. And if the said officers shall suffer any persons otherwise to repair
to the Seas, then above is mentioned, they shall not only answer for any
Pyracies, which any such person shall chance hereafter to commit upon the Seas,
but shall suffer imprisonment until the offenders may be apprehended, if they
shall be living.

And further, as his Majesty declares and denounces generally all such
Pirates and Rouers upon the Seas to be out of his protection, and therefore to
be lawfully pursued and punished to the uttermost extremity: so because his
Majesty presumes, that all other States and persons in peace and friendship
with him, will think it just and honorable to proceed toward him, with the
same sincerity, which he observes toward them: His Majesty does also
hereby notify to the world, that where it falls out that diverse of his
Subjects are or may be enterteyned to serve at Sea under Captains and
Commanders belonging to some foreign Prince or State, (which are now or may
be in terms of Hostility with any of his Majesty's friends) thereby imagining,
when they shall (upon occasion) enter with their Ships into any of his
Majesty's Harboroughs, that they shall be free from any interruption, according
to the liberty of Common Amity and correspondency which is usually observed
between Princes in such cases, only because the Commander or Captain with
some few persons besides are strangers, and the rest only discovered to be
his Majesty's Subjects: For as much as his Majesty (having made his just and
equal intentions thus apparent to all men by his public Proclamations) would
be loath to frustrate the expectation of any his friends whom it does or may
concern: He does hereby declare to all the world, that if he shall hereafter
find any such fraudulent course taken, in hope colourably to avoid the true
construction of his so just and necessary ordinances, the breach whereof gives
cause of further trouble and iealousies to arise between his Majesty and
other Princes in the mutual exercise of their Subjects free trade and
intercourse: he will make absolute stay of any such ships and persons, which
shall be so brought into his Ports or Harboroughs, as persons and things wholly
exempted from that protection and favor, which he entendeth to maintain and
afford to all others which shall not in such kind go about to abuse his
Majesty's integrity, whose desire is to receive no better measure in any
thing, then he is willing to yield to others upon the like occasions.

Given at our Castle of Windsor the viij. of July 1605. in the third year of
our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. ANNO DOM. 1605.
