royal blazon or coat of arms HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE By the King.
A Proclamation, for the suppressing of a Book, entitled, Appello Caesarem,
or, An Appeal to Caesar.
WHereas We, out of Our care to conserve and maintain the Church, committed
to Our Charge, in the unity of true Religion, and the bond of peace, and not to
suffer unnecessary disputes, which may trouble the quiet both of Church and
State, have lately caused the Articles of Religion to be reprinted, as a rule
for avoiding of diversities of opinion, and for the establishing of consent in
true Religion; We, continuing Our desire to compass this wished effect, and
considering that the Book written by Richard Montague, now Bishop of
Chichester, then but Bachelor of Divinity, entitled, ( Appello Caesarem, or,
An Appeal to Caesar,) and published in the year (1625.) was the first cause
of those disputes and differences, which have sithence much troubled the quiet
of the Church; have thought it fitting to ta^ away the occasion by calling in
the said Book: And therefore, We do hereby will and straightly command all and
singular persons whatsoever, who have, or shall have any of them in their hands
or custody, that upon pain of Our high displeasure, and the consequence
thereof, they do deliver the same presently upon this publication, to the Lord
Bishop of the Didcesse, or his Chancellor, if it be out of the Universities,
or if it be in either of the two Universities, to the Chancellor or
Vice Chancellor there, whom We straightly command to suppersse the same;
hoping thereby, that men will no more trouble themselves with these unnecessary
questions, the first occasion being taken away: But if We shall be deceived
in this Our expectation, and that by reading, preaching, or making Books,
either pro or contra, concerning these differences, men begin anew tO dispute,
We shall take such order with them, and those Books, that they shall wish
they had never thought upon these needless Controversies.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, The seventeenth day of January, in the
fourth year of Our Reign, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
God save the King.
