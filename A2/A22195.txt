JAMES, By the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Freland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all and singular Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, Deanes, and their
Officials: parsons, Thears, Curats, and to all spiritual persons: And also to
all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Co^stables, Churchwardens,
and Headboroughs: And to all Officers of Cities, Boroughes, and Towns
corporate: And to all other our Officers, Ministers, and Subjects whatsoever
they be, as well within liberties, as without, to whom these presents shall,
greeting.
WHEREAS by the humble Supplication and Petition of our tive and Royal
Subjects the Inhabitants of our Town of Stains within our County of
Middlesex, We are gtuen to understand as well of the great ruynes and decays
of the Bridge of Stains, as also of the wasting and decays of the Causway of
Egham which leads to the said Bridge from the Western parts to one City of
London; Whereupon We forthwith directed our Commission under our great Seal
of England. to our sight trusty and well beloved Thomas Lord Knynet, Sir John
Dodderidge Knight one of the Justices of our Benth, Sir John Derham. Kinght one
of the Barone of our Exchecquer, sir Henry Spiller Knight, William Mynterne,
and Adryan Moore Esquiors, to authorize them to forney the foresait ruynes and
decays of the said Bridge and Causway, and to make Certificate unto Us of the
present neecssity of the reparation of the same, of the charge thereof, and how
the same may be raised; the which accordingly they have performed: and they do
find, as well by their own view, as also ^^on the examination of the Wardens of
the said Bridge and diverse skillful workmen in these affairs, that the said
Bridge is so dangeroully ruynated in the Foundation thereof, and generally in
all the parts, and the Causway so worn and eaten away by great Floods, as of
necessity there must be speedy reparation; the charge whereof, will amount noere
upon the Sum of One Thousand Pounds. And moreover there have been many breaches
which have been made by reason of the said great floods, which have drowned up
the Country thereabouts, and undone many of the Inhabitants. And forasmuch as
many inconveniences and great hindrances will daily arise in stopping of
recourse of trading and other occasions for the service and provision of our
City of London, (the said Causway and Bridge being the direct and only passage
for diverse Counties in the Western parts to our foresaid City, and from the
said City into those Countries again, it bee^ng also the only way for our own
Carriages to pass over, as often as our occasions call us that way, Our self
being lately and eye witness of the ruins and decays aforesaid, and of the
present necessity of repayring the same,) We have thought good (upon do
consideration had thereof, as well for preventing of many mischiefs and untimely
accidents that happen hereafter, as also for the maintaining and preserving of
the passage there, it being of that coasequence and ymportance as concerns
the general good of the Common wealth, to take some course in time for the
raising of the forsaid Sum of Money, that those decays may speedily be
repaired and amended. And albeit our poor Subjects the Inhabitants of Stains
are most ready and willing to the uttermost of their power, to contribute
toward the finishing and performing of this good and necessary work, yet
finding the charge thereof far beyond their power (they receiving yearly by the
toll of the passengers there, but Twenty Four Pounds at most, and having in
stock but Eighteen Pounds, the which is already ymployed in Timber towarts
the beginning of this work) they have most humbly besought Us for the better
furtherance thereof, to commend this good and laudable deed unto the charitable
consideration of all our loving and well disposed subjects within certain
Counties of this Kingdom, and especially such as may or viually have recourse
of trading that way, not doubting but that all good Christians and true
Subjects (well weighing the premises) will be ready and forward (and the
rather for our good commendation heerof) to extend their liberal contributions
toward speedy finishing and performing of this needful and necessary work.
And forasmuch also, as it plainly appears to all those to whom these
presents shall come, that this work tends not to the private good of any
particular person, but generally to the ea^e and benefit of ye Conmon wealth,
and that the necessity of the performance thereof requires a special course
abone other ordinary Collections, and a care extraordinary to be had for the
speedy collecting and bringing in of present supplies of moneys on this
behalf, We have thought good to Commend the furtherance of this good work
unto the serious consideration and beneuole^ce of all our loving subjects
within our Cities of London, and Westminster, with the suburbs and liberties
thereof, and in our Counties of Middlesex, Surrey, Sussex, Southampton, W^ltes.
Dorset. Somerset, Devon and Cornwall, with out Cities of Chichester. and
Winchester, with our Isle of Wight. and Town of Souch ampton, and in our Cities
of Salisbury, Bristoll, Bath, and Wells, and Exeter, with our Town and County
of Poole: And in all Towns corporate, privileged places, Parishes* Villages,
and in all other places whatsoever within our foresaid Counties, for and
toward the raising of the Sum of moneys aforesaid, to finish ye said work.

NOW know ye therefore, that Our pleasure is, and We do by these our Letters
Patents authorize and require every Church warden and Petty Constable of every
Parish within any the Counties, Cities, Towns corporate, or privileged
places before recited, that forthwith upon receipt of these our Letters Patents
or ye Brief thereof, they collect and gather of every person within their
Parish from house, to house, their contributions toward this good work. and
to endorse the names of the giuers, and the Sum given, on the back side of the
Brief, and to return the Brief and moneys thereupon collected, unto such
Justices of the Peace in every County, City, or Town corporate, as our
Justices of Assize in their next Circuit shall nominate and appoint. And Our
further pleasure is, that those Justices of the Peace shall return the money
to them delivered by the Churchwarde^s or Petty Constables, unto the Bridge.
Masters of Stains Bridge, before the end of Easter Term next ensuing the
date of these our Letters Patents, that this necessary work may speedily be
finished and performed. Any Statute, Law, Ordinance, or provision heretofore
made to the contrary in any wise not withstanding.

IN witness whereof, we have caused these our Letters to be made Patents for
the space of One whole year next after the data hereof to endure.

Witness our self at Westminster, the Eighteenth day of February, in the
Sixteenth year of our Reign of England, France and Ireland; and of Scotland
the Two and Fiftieth. Steward
