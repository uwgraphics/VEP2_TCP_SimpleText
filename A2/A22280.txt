royal English blazon or coat of arms By the King. A Proclamation for the
preventing of the exportation of Woolles, Woolle-fels, Yarne, Fullers earth,
and Woad-ashes, and for the better vent of Cloth, and Stuff made of Wool,
within this Kingdom.
Having understood by the general complaints of Our loving Subjects from the
several parts of this Our Realm of England, that of late years the Woolles
of this Our Kingdom are exceedingly fallen from their woonted values, and that
the Cloth and Stuffes of this Our Kingdom, have not that vent in foreign
parts which formerly they have had: We taking these things, and the weighty
consequence thereof, into Our Princely consideration, as matter of very great
importance to the wealth and welfare of this Our Kingdom, and being careful
to provide a speedy and effectual remedy against such a growing evil, and to
the end that the honest Clothiers, and those painful workfolkes that depend
upon them, might be comforted in their labors, and be encouraged in their
trades, and the Woolles and manufactures of Woolles restored to their wonted
estimation; Have therefore seriously and often advised with Our Privy Counsel
for the good of Our people; and the better to be informed, both of the true
causes, and the fittest remedies, thought it expedient, first to nominate a
Committee of twelve persons of quality and known abilities, not only to
inform themselves out of their own observations and judgments, but also by
conference with diverse Knights and Gentlemen of several Counties, Merchants of
diverse Societies, Clothiers of several clothing-Shires, and with all such
others as they in their opinions thought fit, and then afterward to make
report to Us and Our Privy Counsel of their proceedings in that behalf.

Which Committee, according to Our trust in them reposed, have with great care
and diligence traveled therein, and exactly inquired both into the causes, and
after the remedies, and made their report unto Us accordingly: Whereupon, and
after advise taken with Our Privy Counsel, We find amongst other things of
moment, That the exportation of Woolles, Woolle-fels, Woollen yarne, Fullers
earth, and Woad-ashes, are a great means to enable the foreign making of
Cloth, and a principal impediment to the vent of Our Clothes made in England;
And that the false and deceitful making, dying, and dressing of Our Cloth and
Stuffes here made of Woolles, does exceedingly disgrace and discredit the
Drapery of this Our Kingdom, and does very much hinder the vent of these
commodities.

We therefore out of the great desire We have to advance the wealth of Our
people, and by all means possible to cherish and comfort their labors, do by
these presents straitely charge and command, that no manner of Woolles,
Woolle-fels, Woollen yarne, Cornish-hayre, Fullers earth, Woad ashes, be at any
time or times hereafter, exported out of this Our Realm of England, Dominion
of Wales, Town or Port of Barwicke, or any the Isles, Ports, Creekes, or places
thereof, into any foreign parts, or into Our Kingdom of Scotland, nor that any
manner of Woolls, Wooll-fels, Woollen yearne, Fullers earth, or Woad-ashes, be
transported out of Our Kingdom of Ireland, into any other parts then into the
Realm of England only, upon pain of confiscation of all such Woolles, and
other the premises so transported, or endeavored to be transported, as also of
Our highest indignation, and the seurrest censure of Our Court of
Star Chamber, and of such other pains and penalties as by the Laws and
Statutes of this Our Kingdom, and by Our Prerogative Royal may be inflicted.

And to the end that all Officers and Ministers in, or about Our Ports of
England, may the more strictly look to the observance of this Our will and
pleasure, for the weal of this Our Kingdom; We do further straightly charge and
command, that if any Officer or Minister of or belonging to Our Customs or
Ports, or attending at any the Havens, Creekes, or places adjacent, or carrying
to the Sea, shall consent or conniue at the unlawful exportation of the
premises, or any of them: Or if any of them shall make any certificate upon
any cocket of the landing of any Woolles in any Ports of this Our Realm,
unless the Officer himself, who shall make such certificate, do first see the
same Wools landed, according to the contents of the said certificate: Or if the
said Officers or any of them shall make any cocket, which shall not contain
both the number of Sackes, and the weight of the Wool in every Sack contained
in such cocket; That then every such Officer and Minister, who shall offend in
any the premises, shall not only forfeit his Office, place, and employment,
but shall also incur all other the pains and penalties aforesaid. And if any
Minister or Officer of, or many ship or other Vessel, shall permit and suffer
any Woolles, Wooll-fels, or any other of the premises to be transported in
any Ship, Bottom, or other Vessel, wherein, or whereof he is or shall be
Master, or other Officer; That then every person so offending shall be subject
unto such pains and penalties as aforesaid.

And in case there be now in force any former Licenses or authorities
heretofore given and granted by Us, or any of Our Predecessors, for
transportation of Woolles, or any other the premises, We do hereby revoke
and disanull the same; And are resolved that none such hereafter shall be
granted: And for the better utterance of Cloth within this Our Kingdom, We
do straightly charge and command, that when, and as often as upon the occasion
of any Burials or Funerals, any Blacks be hereafter given or worn; That then
such blackes and mourning stuffes shall be only of Cloth and Stuffes, made of
the Wool of this Kingdom, and not elsewhere, nor otherwise.

And for that We are informed that the false dying of Cloth and Stuffes made
of Woolls, is a great hinderance to the vent of those commodities: Therefore We
straightly will and command, That no person whatsoever in, or toward the dying
of any Cloth, of what sort soever, or of any Stuffes made of Wool, shall use
any Logwood or Blockewood, the use whereof about the said Clothes and Stuffes,
has so often by several Laws and Proclamations been already condemned: And
for the better discovery of false and deceauable dying, and the suppressing of
the said Logwood and Blockewood, in and about the dying of Stuffes made of
Wool, We straightly charge and command the Wardens of the Diers of London,
within the compass of their search, and all other Officers in other places,
That from time to time they make careful and diligent search for the discovery
of all false and deceitful dying: and if in their searches they shall find
any Cloth or Stuff died with Logwood or Blockewood, either in all or in part,
That they seize the same, and inform Our Attorney General for the time being
thereof, that such proceeding may be speedily had against the offenders, as so
great a contempt deserves.

Further. We do hereby straightly charge and command all Justices of Peace,
Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Officers, and other persons whatsoever, to do
their best endeavors to discover all and every the offenders against this Our
Proclamation. And for the better encouragement of all such as shall take care
and pains to make such discoueries. Our will and pleasurs is, that every such
person that shall be the first discouerer of such offender, shall be rewarded
with the moity, or one half of such sums of money as shall come unto Us by
virtue of any forfeiture incurred upon this Our Proclamation, Giving also like
charge and command, that all persons of what degree, quality or place soever,
to whom it shall appertain, do diligently observe, and readily assist the due
performance of this Our Proclamation in all things.

Also We do hereby think good to declare to all Our loving Subjects, that,
for the more equal ballancing of trade, furthering of Commerce, increasing of
Merchandise, remoouing of impediments of Trade, and applying of remedies,
according to the variation of occasions, and for diverse other weighty matters,
much importing the enriching and flourishing estate of this Our kingdom of
England, We are resolved forthwith, by Commission under Our great Seal of
England, to authorize some select persons to be Our Commissioners, who shall
take into their special care and consideration the causes and matters
aforesaid, and they from time to time to make report thereof to the Body of our
privy Counsel, whereupon, We with the advice of Our privy Counsel, shall
apply such further help in each particular as shall be aptest and fittest for so
great a work.

And for the better proceeding in this Our intension, to the honor and weal
of all Our Kingdoms, We are also resolved, with all convenient speed, to give
directions, that some Commissioners out of Our Kingdom of Scotland, shall meet
and confer with Our Commissioners to be authorized by Us in this Our Realm
of England, to advise of the best way, how the Woolles of that Our kingdom of
Scotland, which shall not there be draped, may be brought hither into England,
and here from time to time be bought up and employed in the Draperie of this
kingdom.

Given at Our Manor of Otelands, the eight and twentieth day of July, in the
twentieth year of Our Reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland
the five and fiftieth.
God save the King.
