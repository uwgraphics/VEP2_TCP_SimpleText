Forasmuch as the kings Majesty has of late for the redress of unlawful
enclosures, and such like enormities directed his several Commissions with
large instructions for the same into every his cou^ties, not only aucthorifyng
his Commissioners, to redress and reform al manner of things so farfurth as
the laws, could any wise be construed or expounded, but also by special his
Majesty's letters missiue, has charged the same Commissioners upon great pain
in the same letters contained to redress and amend their own proper faults:
which Co^missio^s be now part in execution, and part ready to be executed, and
delayed only by the folly of the people, s^^^g their own redress unlawfully:
So that no subject can any more require of any prince, then by his Majesty his
said uncle and counsad has been devised, ordered and commanded. Yet
nevertheless his Majesty understands, that diverse of his subjects, neither
considering how they be ordained by God to be subjects and obey, neither
regardyng then sovereign lords most ernest good will and zeal, which he
bears and daily declares to his common wealth, neither having in
remembrance, what distruccion it is to themselfes, to trouble and disquiet the
state of the common wealth, thereby impouerishyng themselfes, weakenyng ye realm
and bredyng sedicion and continual co^tencion betwixt one subject and another,
do attempt and trauail, from time to time and from place to place, to make
assembles, riotes, conuencions, stirs, and vptores, and by them so
vnlawefully made, presume to do and attempt, that which ought only to be
done, by the authority of the king and his matesties laws: yea and in many
points according to the evil disposicion of their assembles, attempt with
violence and fury, such unlawful things as be extremely forbidden by all
justice and law, and to be abhorred of any good Christian. For the which
causes his Majesty neither of good justice and honor, neither for the estate
and sauegard of his highness royal^^ will or may induce his subjects, so to
offed with out preset punisheme^t and correction, But as a prince reignyng by
almighty gods providence, most mighty, and in justice trrible, by the advice
of his said dear uncle ye lord Protector and the rest of his majesty's priuey
co^unsayl, straightly charge, and with the thretynyng of his sword,
commands al manner his subjects of what degree, condition, kind or estate
