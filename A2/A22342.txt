By the King. A Proclamation for better furnishing the Navy, and Shipping of
the Realm, with able and skillful Mariners.
WHereas We, for the continuance and maintayning of the Navigations of this
Realm, and to the intent that skillful Mariners, and Seafaring men, might be
always in readiness to furnish, as well Our own Royal Navy, as the Shipping
of Our Subjects, by Our Proclamation dated the sixth day of August, in the
twentieth year of Our Reign, did straightly inhibite and forbid, That no
Mariner, or Seafaring man, Shipwright, or Shipcarpenter whatsoever, being Our
Subject, should without express license of Us, or of Our Admiral of England,
enter, or attempt, or go about to enter into the service of any foreign
Prince, or State, or be employed out of this Realm, in any service
whatsoever, unless it were in the service of Us, or of some of Our liege
Subjects:

And whereas by a later Proclamation, dated the seven and twentieth day of
February, then following, We did signify Our pleasure, That Our said former
Proclamation should be hereafter carefully observed, and put in exact
execution; willing, That all men should take knowledge, and that We should
esteem the offenders therein, as Fugitives, and Runagates, forgetting their
natural allegiance and duty to Us and Our Laws, and accordingly should
proceed against them with all severity:

And did furthermore thereby straightly charge and command, That no Mariner, or
Seafaring man, should absent, hide, or withdraw himself from Our service, or
Prests, and that all such persons having Our Pressed money given or tendered unto
them, should dutifully and reverently receive the same, and repair aboard Our
Ships, at the times to them limited and assigned, and thenceforth continue in
Our service, as to the duty of good Subjects appertains, and not withdraw
themselves, or depart therefrom, without special license, upon pain to
incur the uttermost severity of Our Laws to be inflicted upon them, as
malefactors in a very high degree, to the hazard of Our Royal Navy and
service.

Now, forasmuch as we have received Information, That, notwithstanding the
strictness of Our said Proclamations, there has followed no redress of these
enormious crimes, and contempts, We being resolved to meet with all
impediments, whereby such Our weighty service is hindered, and offenders
hardened and imboldened in their obstinacy, and wilful contempts, do hereby
straightly inhibite and forbid, That no Owner or Master of any Ship, or vessel,
nor any other, setting forth any vessels of Trade, Fishing, or otherwise, do
presume to hire or entertain any Mariner, or Seafaring man, knowing him to
have offended against the said Proclamations, or either of them, by serving
foreign Prince or State without license, or by disobeying Our Prests, or
abandoning Our service: And if such Owner, Master, or other person, not knowing
of the said offenses, shall hire or entertain any such offender or offenders,
that forthwith upon notice of any the said offenses, they deliver such
offenders over unto the next Justice of Peace, Mayor, Baylife, Constable, or
other officer, to be imprisoned until the said offenders shall give
sufficient Bond and Caution for their forth coming and appearance, in such
Court, or place of Justice, unto which it may appertain, to be proceeded
against, and punished, according to their demerits; and withal, that the said
Masters, Owners, and other persons forbear to pay to the said offenders any
wages. And further, We do straightly charge and command all Our Lieutenants,
Deputie-Lieutenants, Justices of Peace, Majors, Bayliffes, Constables,
Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers and officers, as well of our Admiralty, as of
Our Ports, and also all and every person and persons, to whom any Commission,
Deputation, or Letters of Assistance shall be directed, for the presting of
Mariners, and Seafaring men for Our service, that they shall from time to time
use all possible diligence and endeavor, to apprehend, and cause to be
apprehended, as well all such Mariners and Seafaring men, offending, as
aforesaid, as also all such Owners, Masters, and others, as contrary to this
Our Royal commandment, shall entertain or hire them, or pay them any wages,
or otherwise help them to escape the hands of Justice; and such as they shall
apprehend, they shall with Certificate of their names and offenses, bind over
to appear before the Commissioners of Our Name, in London, to be by them
committed, and delivered over to the ordinary course of Our Justice, either in
our Court of Starrechamber, or of Our Admiralty, or otherwise, as the quality
of the offense shall require. And We likewise charge and command all
Prest-masters, and their Assistants, to publish the Names of all such as shall
be prested by them in Our Ports where they are taken, as also to deliver a note
of their names to the officers of Our Ports, and others who are fittest to
discover them: And We have also given order to the Commissioners of Our Navy,
to make certificate into all parts of this Realm, where they shall think it
convenient or useful, of the names of such as shall offend in any of the
premises. And considering that the service now in hand, for the setting forth
of Our Fleet, is of great consequence, both for the safety of Our Kingdoms,
and for the honor of Our Imperial Crown and Dignity, That all the eyes and
hearts of Our loving Subjects, are cast upon it, and expect the supplying
thereof to be made with extraordinary care; We have thought fit to recommend
the same in this extraordinary manner, intending hereafter to make such further
provision against all such offenders, as are not hereby made sensible of their
duties, and ranged to obedience, as the necessity and importance of Our
service at this time, and other times shall require.

Given at Our Court at Theobalds the twentieth day of March, in the two and
twentieth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
God save the King.

Excellent Majesty. 1624.
