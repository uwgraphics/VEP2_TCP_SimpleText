The wonders of England. 1559.
WHen date of (1553.) was expirde full,
And Gods wrath rypt, ready to fall:
His sword from sheath did ferce out pull,
And to the heavens began to call.
Saying: on England now I shall,
Plage Prince, Prophet, and People all,
For contemptes sake.
Go Death enclose their King in clay,
And Sun withdraw the light of day,
And darkness make.
No sooner said, but straight was done
The English King Edward God took.
Light of soul from England gone.
Darkness made them blyndely look.
Truth and Faith of People forsook.
Their Prophets taken from the book,
And prisoners made.
The Bats and Owls from holes out came
Wolves and Bears, and cruel Caim,
Did England invade.
When darkness thus echwhere was sen
And nightly Uermin ruled the roast,
No Birds might sing in that late even,
By land, by sea, or by the coast,
But straight were brought to fiery post,
Or else to Lolers tower tossed,
And kept in cage,
From meat and friend sometimes so bard
That lomy wales they fed on hard,
Hunger to swage.
This darkness so extremely bode,
That none from other scarce were known
On Noble, Sage, Learned and Good,
These worms of darkness spared none,
And pourde their poison abrod so flowne
On Prophet, People, and Prince their own,
Which is by name
Elizabeth, by God now Queen,
To Englands joy right well is seen,
They sought to shame.
The sun thus que^tch, and day made dark
And Cocks in coopes from croing kept,
The^ straight these Owls began to wark,
And to the Churches fearcely lept,
And with new broumes the^ clean out swept
From God, from King and Scripture set
Upon the wall,
And in their stead set ydols long,
And made people with praise and song,
On them to call.
Thus Uermin dark the mastry had,
Of Realm, of Prince, of Noble and all:
And yet not here with fully glad,
Away they sought to save their fall,
And counsel gave a Forayne to call,
To match our Queen and Crown royal
All for their Pope.
To have their kingdom raygne always,
And they them selves to hear the sway,
And blindly grope.
All this not yet their minds fyllyng,
Nor no regard to Natiu^ land,
Fearing again Gods light should spring
Brought Mershial law forthwt in hand,
Against al such as would withstand,
Their wicked raygne and cruel band,
And Gods part take.
Or else in priuye places found,
Praying to God prostrate on ground,
His wrath to slake.
Thus rulyng all in darkness blind,
Came miseries with heap on heap,
No lore was taught to fyl the mind,
Godly to live and good fruit reap,
But al for Church they cride and threape
Restore, restore even as good cheap,
As ye did take.
And be ye sure ye shall attain,
To heavens bliss without more pain
And so mendes make.
Losses of towns and Holds came on,
Ruin of people began each where:
Richmen made beggars, and Captains bond
Armor for war our enmyes took clear
When al this was seue in this realm here
Yet (said these Owls) we need not fear
For all was well.
No loss have we by Heritikes gone:
Ne for Calis for which ye move
Which here do dwell
Yet God as God still always one
Though angry yet began to stay:
Plaging the Realm and People echeone
At last with tears began to say:
Oh England, England sore do thou stray,
My Martirs blood shed out this day,
In woeful plyght.
The infantes young that fatherles be.
With wydowes poor crying to me,
wythdrawes my spyte.
With that ye skies their hue did change
And light out shone in darkness steed,
Up (said this God with voice not strange)
Elizabeth this Realm now guide,
My will in thee do not thou hyde,
And Uermine dark let not abide,
In this thy Land.
Straight way the people out did cry,
Praised be God and God save thee
Queen of England.
Finis.
