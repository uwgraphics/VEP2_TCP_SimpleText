JAMES, by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland,
defender of the faith, etc.
To all Our loving Subjects greeting.
Forasmuch as We are credibly informed that there is a very dangerous passage,
at, and near a place commonly called by the name of Dungennesse, upon Our
coast of Kent, being a low point of Land iutting far into the Sea, whereby
many persons, as well Mariners as others, through occasion of trading, and
sending into the Southern parts, have of late lost their lives and goods, and
the Shipping of this Realm, is subject unto sundry hidden dangers, passing in
and out of the aforesaid Dungennesse, for want of direction by lights in the
night to take knowledge of these dangers. We have therefore thought it very
expedient and necessary; And by these presents for Us, Our Heirs and
Successors: We do ordain and appoint, that some convenient Light-house, and
Beacon with a light be there made, erected and maintained, that thereby
Ships and Vessels may pass with safety, as well by night, as by day. And for
the defraying of the necessary charges, and continual maintenance of the
same, that there shall be collected and taken of, and for every Ship, Hoy,
and Bark, that shall pass that way, one penny upon every Tun outward
bound, and one penny upon every Tun homewards bound, that is to say, of the
Merchants a half penny, and of the Owners of the Ships Hoy, or Bark a half
penny, and of such Strangers as shall happen to pass thereby after the like
rate as they shall put into any Port or Harbor, although they do not unload
or discharge any goods there. And for that Our trusty and well-beloved Servant
Sir Edward Howard Knight, and one of Our Cup-bearers, at the request and desire
of sundry Sea-fairing men, and Merchants of the best note, trading into those
parts, whereof diverse have by subscription under their hands agreed to the said
contribution, in regard of the necessity of the said Light, and the great
dangers that have happened to Our Subjects for want thereof, has undertaken to
make, erect, set up, and maintane upon that part of the said Dungennesse a
convenient Light-house and Beacon, with a continual Light therein in the night
season, for such contribution in that behalf to be made as before, and here
in after in these presents is mentioned, Know ye, that We as well in
consideration of the premises, as for diverse other good causes and
considerations, Us hereunto moving, of Our especial grace, certain knowledge
and mere motion, have given and granted, and by these presents for Us, Our
Heirs and Successors, We do give and grant unto the said Sir Edward Howard
Knight, one of Our Cup-bearers, his Executors, Administrators and Assigns, and
unto all and every such other person and persons as shall have power and
authority in this behalf from him and them, or any Deputy or Deputies of his
and theirs free liberty, license, power and authority, that he and they, and
every of them, shall, and may make, build, erect, set, continue, renew and
maintain, and cause to be made, builded, erected, set up, continued, renewed
and maintained in such place or places of the Sea-shores, and Up and near the
Sea Coasts, or Forelands of the Sea, as to them shall seem most meet,
needful and requisite, of, or upon the said Dungennesse a convenient
Light-house and Beacon, with a Light to be continually burning therein in the
night season, whereby the said Sea-fayring men and Mariners, may take notice of
the said hidden dangers, and so avoid and escape them, and the Ships the
better come to their Port without peril. To have, hold, exercise and enjoy the
said liberties, licenses, powers and authorities before by these presents given
and granted, and every of them unto the said Sir Edward Howard Knight, his
Executors, Administrators and Assigns, by him and them, and every of his and
their Deputies, and Factors and Servants as is aforesaid, from henceforth for
during, and until the full end and term of fifty years, from thence next
ensuing, and fully to be complete and ended in as large and ample manner and
form, to all intents, constructions and purposes, as the Masters of Trinity
house at Deptford-strond in our County of Kent, or any other person or persons
any the like liberties, licenses, powers or authorities, now have, hold or
enjoy, or may, or might have, hold or enjoy in any other place or places within
this Our Realm. And forasmuch as other order cannot well be taken for the
leuying of the said contributions of one penny upon the Tun, as aforesaid,
for the effecting, establishing, and continuance of this good work then in the
Ports, Roades and Harbors, unto which the said Merchants and Mariners do, and
shall trade and ariue. We do by these presents, for Us, Our Heirs and
Successors, ordain and appoint, and also straightly charge, command and
authorize all, and every the Customers, Collectors and Comptrollers and all
other the Officers of the Customs to Us, Our Heirs and Successors now being,
and which for the time being, shall be in Our Port of London, and in all and
every other the Ports, Harbors, Roades and places within this Our Realm of
England, to whom and where it shall or may appertain, that they or some of
them from time to time, and at all times hereafter, during the said term of
fifty years, before such time as they or any of them do give any Cocket or
other discharge, do collect and receive the said contribution herein before
specified as well of all and every such Merchants and Strangers, or all and
every such Ship, Hoy or Bark, belonging to any Merchant or Stranger, as shall
ariue or anchor within Our Port of London, or any other the Ports, Harbors,
Roades and places within this Our Realm of England. And that they and every of
them do, and shall yield and make due accounts and payments of all and every
such contributions, sum and sums of money, as by them, every and any of
them shall be so collected or received from time to time, unto the said Sir
Edward Howard Knight, his Executors, Administrators or Assigns, to be by him
or them received and retained to their own proper use and behoof, for and in
respect of his and their charges, in erecting and maintaining the said
Light-house Beacon and Light, to the use and purpose herein before mentioned,
without any account or other thing therefore, or for any part thereof by him,
or them, or any of them, therefore to be yielded, made or given. And to the
end and intent that the said Sir Edward Howard Knight, his Executors,
administrators and Assigns, shall and may the better have and enjoy the full
force, benefit and effect of this Our present grant, We do also by these
presents for Us, Our Heirs and Successors require, charge and authorize
as well the Lords of Our Privy Counsel, as also all Majors, Sheriffs,
Justices of Peace, Bayliffes and other Officers and Ministers of Us, Our Heirs
and Successors, to whom it does or shall appertain, that they and every of
them be from time to time hereafter ayding and assisting to the said Sir Edward
Howard Knight, his Executors, Administrators and Assigns, in, and concerning
the premises, upon every complaint or request in that behalf to be made
according as to Justice shall be required by them or any of them without delay.

Witness Our self at Westminster, the eight and twentieth day of August. In
the year of Our Reign of England, France and Ireland the thirteenth, and of
Scotland the nine and fortieth.

TRusty and well-beloved, We greet you well.
Whereas Our late dear Father King JAMES of happy memory, out of His Princely
care for the safety of His Subjects, both in their persons and goods, by His
Letters Patents under the great Seal of England, did authorize and command
certain Moneys to be levied and collected for the maintenance of a Light at
Dungennesse, thereby to avoid that danger and hazard, which otherwise they
that pass that way would be subject unto; And did further appoint, that those
Moneys so collected, should be paid unto William Lamplugh, one of the Clerks
of his Kitchen, (and now Our Servant in the same place) in recompense of his
great travel and charge to erect and maintain the said Light. And whereas our
said dear Father, upon notice, that the said collection, by the practice of
some vnder-Minister in the Custom House, was detained, and our Servant
defrauded of the benefit intended unto him thereby, did, by His Letters
directed unto the then Farmers of the Customs, will and command them to assist
Our said Servant, or his deputy, that the said Moneys might be duly levied and
paid, as before they had been, which accordingly has been performed. We
being graciously pleased, that the benefit of those Moneys should be duly
continued and paid to Our said Servant, as well in regard of his pains and
expense, as also, out of Our special care of Our Subjects, lest through
default of that collection, Our said Servant should be discouraged, and so the
Light at Dungennesse neglected, to the great peril of those that pass
thereby, have thought fit, by these Our Letters, to require and command you, to
aid and assist Our said Servant, or his Deputy, to collect and receive the
said Moneys in such sort as formerly they were paid for Merchandises either
exported or imported, and that you deliver no Cocquet or discharge to any
Merchant, Master, or others, for any goods, until such time as the Moneys
aforesaid, be fully paid, in such manner as they have been heretofore
satisfied, according to the purpose and intent of the said Letters Patents.

Given under Our Signet at Out Palace of Westminster the fourteenth day of
March, in the second year of Our Reign.
To Our trusty and well-beloved the Farmers of Our Customs within the Port of
London, and to their Deputies in the out-Ports within Our Realm of England,
and to all other Our Officers and loving Subjects whom it shall or may in any
wise concern.
