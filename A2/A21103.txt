Happiness.
Honored Sir:
THe love of virtue, in all ages, has made some persons illustrious, whose
sublime spirits, and choice judgments, have prompted them to cherish the Arts:
whereby their names have been magnified in their life, and their memories
perpetuated after death. So in this our age, Fame has deservedly voted and
enstiled you, an eminent Mecaenas, for frequenting the Academies, and exercises
of science, and for countenance and benificence to Arts and Artists, which
renders you truly pious, prudent, and peerless. More particularly, you have
honored Music: of whose divine excellencies, all other Arts participate,
which may glory, to be as ancient as Time, and expect to live eternally. To
your transcendent Nobleness, and constant love to our Art, I humbly sacrifice
this poor Tribute of my service confessing, I am old, my fruit is in Autumn,
and falls at your feet, yet if you favorably reflect thereon, and your
obsequious followers grace me to gather it up, and present it to you, it may
prove more pleasing to your judicious taste, and delightful to the palate of
others. Your patronage and cognizance, will protect it from the venom of Envy
and Ignorance, which if you descend to vouchsafe, you shall highly oblige,

Honored Sir, Yours ever humbly devoted loyally to serve you, MICHAEL EAST.
