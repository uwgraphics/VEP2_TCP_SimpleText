By the Queen
THe Queen's Majesty certaynely understanding, that the French king has the
sixth of this present month caused to be published in France by sound of
Trompet in this sort, that all manner his Subjects of what estate soever they
be, should arm and equippe all manner of vessels at their pleasure, and with
them to invade, take, offend, and endomage all English men, and other her
Majesty's Subjects, either by Sea or Land, in their persons, goods, or
vessels, by taking them prisoners, and puttyng them to ransom, and that to
continue so long as the said English men should hold and occupye the Town of
Newehauen: declaryng further therewith, that from that time, all acts and
exploictes which should be done by his Subjects, and all pryzees, should be
good and auayleable, as things taken from thennemies. Upon which
proceadynges well considered, her Majesty upon good deliberation of counsel,
has thought it by this example, and the iniust provocation of the said king,
necessary, not only to warn her Subjects thereof, resydyng in all her ports:
but also to license them, and all others her Subjects, that for their defense
and sauegarde, they may do their vttermoste by Sea and Land, against any of
the said French kings Subjects, and so continue until her Majesty shall
have right and reason done to her, for the assurance of her Town of Callayce,
and all other her territories on that side the Seas, which is and has been
denied unto her, and for which purpose only, her Majesty has hitherto since
the end of the troubles in France, held the said Town of Newehauen, as in
good reason she has just cause to do. And where before this time, her Majesty
gave commandment, that none of her Subjects should spoil or rob any
French man by sea or land, which should seek to offend them, but should only
stay and preserve them and their goods in safety: Now her Majesty is
justly occasioned, and so does license all her Subjects, to take them and
their vessels, and ordeyneth by these presents, that the pryzees taken (even
as the French king has ordered) shall be judged for good and vailyable, as
things taken from enemies.

Given at Grenewich the.xiii. day of July.1563. The fyfth year of her Majesty's
reign.
GOD save the Queen.
