By the King.
A Proclamation for all Captains, Masters, and Officers of Ships, and
Mariners, which are to serve in the Kings Fleet, to make their present repair
to Portesmouth.
WHereas the Kings most Excellent MAJESTY, for many weighty and important
reasons, has prepared a Royal Fleet, which is now ready to set to Sea, and
is there to be employed on such designs, as His Majesty (by the advice of His
Counsel of War) has specially directed, for the honor and safety of this
Realm, and other His Majesty's Dominions, and the delay of time may be
dangerous to the good success of the whole Action: His Majesty therefore (by
the advice of His privy Counsel) does hereby straightly charge and command all
Captains, Masters, and Officers, and all Mariners, entertained or appointed to
serve in any of the Ships, Pynaces, or other vessels belonging to His Majesty's
said Fleet, now intended to be set to Sea, presently to make their repair to
Portesmouth, and there to apply themselves to their several Charges, upon
pain of His Majesty's highest indignation, and of the seuerest penalties and
punishments, which either by the Laws, or by His Majesty's Royal Prerogative,
may be inflicted on them.

And His Majesty does further straightly charge and command all Majors,
Sheriffs, Justices of Pear, and all other His Officers and loving Subjects,
to whom it may appertain, to cause diligent search to be made for the
discovering and apprehending of all such Officers and Mariners, which should
serve in any of those Ships, and shall withdraw or absent themselves from their
service, (if notice shall be given unto them, or any of them, of any such base
and unworthy persons) and that upon the apprehending of them, they give present
notice thereof to the Judge of the Admiralty, that due proceeding may be had
against all such offenders according to the Law.

Given at His Majesty's Court at White Hall the seven and twentieth day of
August, in the second year of His Majesty's Reign of Great Britain, France
and Ireland. God save the King.
