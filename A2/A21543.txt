By the Queen,
THe Queen our soueraygne Lady graciouslye considering the good wylles,
forwardnes, and hearty d^spositions of her true loving subjects, always
heretofore exhibited, to the aid and succoure of the common weal, with their
proper substance and goods, when the service, ye necessity, and honor of
the realm has so required, as well in the times and several reygnes of the
most excellent princes our late souereygne Lords, her dear Father, and dear
brother, King Henry the eight and King Edward the syxte, and specially
since the time of her vocation to the crown, in the defense of her royal
person, against the maliciouse force of the most arrande Traitor sir John
Dudley late Duke of Northumberlande, and his complyces. Notwithstanding it is
well known to the multitude of her said good subjects, how by the evil
gouernemente of the realm in these late years, specially since the said Duke
has borne rule, the treasure of the same is meruelouslye exhausted, and her
hyghnes now presentlye charged, with payment of notable great Sommes, being
the debte of her said brother the king, partly due to diverse of her said
servants and subjects, and partly to certain merchant strangers, and
others, which for her own honor, and the honor of the realm, her highness
determines by the help of God truly to discharge, content, and pay in times
conueniente and reasonable, yet having both a special mind to the weal of
her said subjects, and accomptynge their loving hearts and prosperity as her
own weal, and the chiefest treasure that she desires, next the favor and
grace of God, and having a full affiaunce in her said subjects, that if the
state, the cause, and honor of the realm shall so require, they will at all
times hereafter exhibit their semblable service. Notwithstanding in the
latter Session of the last parliament holden in the time of the said late
king Edward the syxte, toward the paymentes and discharges of the said
notable debtes, there was granted by act of parliament unto the said king
Edward two dismes, and two fyftenes, and one Subsedie of four shyllynges of
the pound, to be raised and leuyed of the Manours, Lands, and Tenementes, and
two shyllynges eyghte pence of the goods and catelles of her said Subjects,
which grauntes are now due unto her hyghnes by the said act, and would
discharge one great piece of the said debtes. Her majesty for the
considerations aforerehearsed, of her mere grace and great clemency, for the
releif and succor of her said good subjects, has freely for her and her
heirs, and successors, pardoned and remytted, and by these presents freely
and fully pardons and remitteth unto her said subjects, and their heirs and
executours, the said Subsidy of four shyllynges the pound, and two
shyllynges eight pence the pound, granted in the latter session, and last
parliament, trusting her said good subjects will have loving consideration
thereof for their parts, whom she requires heartily to bend them selves
wholly to serve God to his glory, with continual prayer unto the same for the
honor and auauncemente of her grace, and the common weal. Given at our
manor of Rychemonde, the first day of September. In the first year of our
most prosperous reygne.

God save the Queen.
