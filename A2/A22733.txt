A Copy of the Kings Majesty's Letters Pattents for the rating and assessing
the Prices of Horsemeat for Innes and Hosteries thorowout the Kingdom.
JAMES by the Grace of GOD, KING of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To Our trusty and well-beloved Sir Henry Mountague Knight, Chief Justice of the
Pleas before Us to be holden assigned: And to the Chief Justice of the said
Pleas for the time being, and to all other Our Justices of Assise, now and for
the time being, and to al other Our loving Subjects whom these presents shall or
may concern, greeting.
Whereas We have by Our Letters Patents bearing date at Westminster the third
day of March, in the fourteenth year of our Reign of England, France and
Ireland, and of Scotland the fiftieth, for the considerations therein mentioned:
Assigned and appointed Sir Gyles Mompesson of Bathe-hampton in the County of
VViltes, Knight, Gyles Bridges of Wilton, in the County of Hereford, Esquire,
and James Thurbarne of Grayes Inn in the County of Middlesex, Esquire, Our
Commissioners, giving them or any two of them, whereof the said Sir Gyles
Mompesson to be one, full power and authority to take a view and Survey of the
Innes of this Our Kingdom, and therein amongst other things, to inform
themselves of the due keeping of the assize and price of Horse-meat, by
Inneholders and Hostlers of this Realm, and therein from time to time to be
ayding and assisting to the Chief Justice of Our Bench, and to Our Justices of
Assise, for the better observing of Our true intent and meaning therein
expressed. And further to treat with such persons as desire to keep and
continue their Innes, or to have any Inn erected for the keeping, continuance
and erecting of Innes or Hostries. And to make such License in that behalf to
such persons as in Our said Letters Patents is declared.

In every of which Licenses We directed by Our said Letters Pattents, that
there should amongst other things be contained a Prouiso, that the party so
to be Licensed and his assigns, should keep the Assize of Bread and Ale, and
measure according to the Laws and Statutes of this Realm, and further observe
the prices of Horse-meate set down, or from time to time to be set down by
Our Justices of Assise in their several Circuits, or by the Chief Justice of
Our Bench, in places where Our Justices of Assise do not come, as by Our said
Letters Patents of Commission more fully may appear.

By the which Prouiso We intended as well the general benefit of Our
Subjects, by redressing the excessive prices and exactions unlawfully
encroached on them by Inne-holders and Hostlers, as also the relief of
Inne-holders and Hostlers themselves, by allowing them a more convenient gain,
then by certain ancient and almost absolute statutes made in the reigns of Our
most Noble Predecessors King Richard the second, and King Henry the fourth, is
prescribed unto them, which Statutes although they remain as yet in force, yet
considering the times wherein they were inacted, and the alteration of prises
incident to the Succession of so many ages, besides the difference of moneys
then and now current within this Our Kingdom, have by degrees so far
out-worne that original equity and proportion upon which they were first
grounded, as that at this day they cannot be observed, without the extreme
prejudice and almost utter undoing of Hostlers, who notwithstanding are by the
breach thereof continually subject to no less mischief by popular
informations. But now finding upon further advice, that these Our charitable
intentions cannot have so good effect as we expected, for that you Our said
Justices have neither by the said Letters Patents, nor otherwise by the Laws
of of this Our Realm, without Our especial Warant as we are informed,
sufficient power or authority to assesse or limite any prises, accordingly as
is conditioned with such as take any Licenses for keeping of Innes, by virtue
of our said Letters Patents.

We therefore willing to give Our Royal assistance in a case of so general
importance, and reposing especial trust and confidence in your fidelities,
wisdoms and provident circumspections, do hereby for Us, Our Heirs and
Successors, give full power and authority unto you Our said Justices of
Assise, respectively within your several circuites, and to all other the
Justices of Assise, of Us, Our Heirs and Successors, now and for the time
being.

And We do also hereby for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, will and command you
and every of your respectively, as aforesaid, from henceforth until Our
pleasure be further known to the contrary, at every general Assizes to be
holden for each County within your several Divisions, in the presence, and by
and with the assistance of any four Justices of the Peace of the same County,
or more, from whom you may receive fit information in that behalf, together
with the assistance of Our said Commissioners or any of them, if they or any of
them shall be there present, by order in writing under your hands, to assesse,
limit, rate, and appoint such reasonable prises for Horse-meate to be observed
by all Inne-holders and Ostlers within your said several circuits, so licensed
or to be licensed, as aforesaid.

And likewise from time to time at every of the said general Assizes in the
presence, and with the like assistance of any four or more Justices of the
Peace, and of our said Commissioners, as aforesaid by any other order or orders
in writing under your hands, to correct, renew, alter and amend the said
prises, as in your discretions shall seem fit and convenient, having due
respect unto the time, and the usual Rates of the adjoining Markets, and such
other considerable circumstances as shall be requisite in a business of that
nature.

Further willing and commanding you and every of you hereby, within twenty
days after the end of your several Circuits, to return and certify in
writing under your hands all and singular the said Orders, Rates, and
Assessements, together with the names of such Justices of the Peace as were
present at the rating and assessing thereof, unto the Office of the Receiver of
the Fines, Rents, and Profits for Licenses of Inne-keepers, erected and
established by Our said Letters Patents, to the end that the same may be there
registered and entered in the said Office.

And We do further hereby for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, charge and
command all and singular Justices of the Peace of every County at large within
this Our Kingdom, now, and for the time being respectively, with their best
means and endeauours to be ayding and assisting to Our said Justices of Assise,
for the rating and assessing of the prises aforesaid. And touching all exempt
Cities, Counties, Towns Corporate, Liberties, and other places privileged
within this Realm, where Our said Justices of Assise do not resort. We do
hereby for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, give full power and authority unto
you Our said Chief Justice of Our said Pleas, and to all other the Chief
Justices of the said Pleas of Us, Our Heirs and Successors for the time
being, and do also hereby for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, charge and
command you and every of you, twice in every year, that is to say, in the
Terms of Easter and Saint Michael the Arch-angell yearly, in the presence,
and by and with the assistance of the said Commissioners, or any two of them,
whereof the said Sir Gyles Mompesson to be one, by order in writing under your
hand, to assesse, limite, rate and appoint such reasonable prises for
Horse-meate to be observed by all Inne-holders and Hostlers licensed or to be
licensed as aforesaid, within any of the said exempted or privileged places:
and likewise from time to time yearly in the said Terms by any other order or
orders in writing under your hand, to correct alter, renew and amend the said
rates and prises according to your best discretion: and in the same Terms
likewise to return and certify your said orders, rates and prises into Our
said Office of Receiuor to be there registered and entered, as aforesaid,
willing and commanding hereby Our said Receiuor now, and for the time being, to
make and give under his hand true Copies of all and every the Orders, Rates,
and Assessements aforesaid, as well such as shall be made for the Counties at
large, as for the said exempt or privileged places to all persons requiring
the same, taking not above twelve pence for any one Coppie.

And for the further Indemnity of all such Inne-holders or Hostlers either in
the Counties at large, or other the places exempted, as aforesaid, as now are
or shall hereafter be licensed to erect, keep or continue any Inn or Hostery,
according to the tenor of Our former recited Letters Pattents, We do hereby of
Our especial Grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion, for Us, Our Heirs and
Successors, give full power and authority to al and every the said Inne-holders
or Hostlers so licensed, or to be licensed as aforesaid, and to no other, to
Receive and take from time to time, such Rates and prises for Horse-meate, as
by the said Justices of Assise, or Chief Justice aforesaid, respectively shall
be so limited, ordered, assessed, and certified unto the said Office, as
aforesaid, the said several Acts of Parliaments: or any other Law, Statute,
Proclamation, Ordinance, Usage or Custom whatsoever to the contrary thereof in
any wise notwithstanding. And to the end that Our care herein, chiefly tending
to the general welfare and profit of Our loving Subjects, be not hereafter
abused by the misapplying of Our Grace and Favor in the granting of any such
Licenses unto people of base quality and loose conversation.

And for as much as it is impossible that the said Sir Gyles Mompesson, Gyles
Bridges, and James Thurbarne, Our Commissioners appointed by the said Letters
Pattents, should of themselves be able to take sufficient notice what persons
throughout the whole Realm are unfit to be licensed to erect, keep, or
continue any Inn or Hostry as aforesaid: the rather for that men of ill
condition oftentimes procure favorable Certificats, from persons of good
credit in their behalf.

We therefore for the better Assistance and Supply of Our said Commissioners
herein, do hereby for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, will and command all and
singular Clerks of the Peace, now and for the time being of every County at
large within this Our Realm of England, where Our said Justices of Assise do
usually come. And all and singular Majors, Bayliffes, Constables, and other
head Officers, now and for the time being of the said exempted Cities,
Counties, Towns Corporate, Liberties, and places privileged, as aforesaid,
Respectively to make true Returns and Certificats in writing under their
hands, unto our said Office of Receiuor twice in the year, that is to say, in
the Terms of Easter, and Saint Michael the Arch-angell, of the names,
qualities and places of aboade of all such persons as before that time have
been, or hereafter shall be in public Sessions holden for any County at large,
or by public order made in any of the said exempted or privileged places
respectively for their evil behavior, or other personal insufficiency,
disallowed or prohibited to keep any Alehouse or Victualing-house, within the
Precincts of their several Jurisdictions, together with the true causes
wherefore they were so disallowed, To the end that the said Certificates may be
kept and registered in the said Office: and that Our said Commissioners thereby
taking notice of all such prohibited, and insufficient persons, may the more
warily proceed in granting the said Licenses.

Lastly, Our will and pleasure is, and We do hereby for Us, Our Heirs and
Successors, grant that these Presents, and the Inrolement thereof, shall be
firm, good, available, and effectual in the Law to all intents, constructions
and purposes, according to our meaning herein expressed: any Law, Statute,
Act, Ordinance, or Provision to the contrary thereof in any wise
notwithstanding.

In witness whereof, We have caused these Our Letters to be made Patents.
Witness Our Self at Westminster the fourth day of November, in the sixteenth
year of Our Reign of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the two and
fiftieth. Per ipsum Regem.
