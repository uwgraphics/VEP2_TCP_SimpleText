SHORT DISCOVERY OF THE STATE of MAN: Before The fall, in the fall, and out of
the fall again; wherein is also laid open the ignorance and error of Robert
Hall Preacher at Colebrooke in Buckingham-shire, and Edmund Board of the same
Town a Professor, who are contentious, obeying not the truth (which they be
erred from) but do oppose themselves against it, as may be seen with the single
eye in that which follows, -- by W:B:

The Lord frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad, he
turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish. Isa. 44:25: But
the secrets of the Lord are with them that fear him, Psa: 25:14:
IN the 4th: Month 59: At a meeting in Colebrooke, as I was moved of the Lord,
I spoke these words, verily, verily I say unto you, except a man be born again,
he can in no wise enter into the Kingdom of God, and I also declared that God
made man in his image, after his likeness, having dominion, and was blessed of
God, Gen: 1:26:28: also that this state was lost from Adam, (in which he was
blessed) ^y reason of sin and transgression, which brought the curse, (mark)
man was made ^n the image of God, and in that state was blessed, here was the
first word man (in the ^mage of God) that ever I read of in Scripture, Let us
make man in our image after ^ur likeness, and let him have dominion, Gen:
1:26: man in the image of God, like God, upright having dominion blessed of
God, (mark) this state was lost and erred from ^y transgression, transgression
lost the dominion, shuts out of the kingdom: therefore ex^ept a man be born
again, he cannot enter into the kingdom (or dominion) of Gods nor ^e blessed
of God, nor be in the likeness or image of God, these things I did and do
still ^ffirme and testify, and that as Adam lost the dominion, the peace, and
the blessing of ^od, goeing from God into transgression, so must all that ever
enter the kingdom again, which is righteousness, peace, and joy in the holy
spirit,) come to the light which Christ jesus has enlightened them withal,
(which shows them sin,) and believe in it, and ^^ey it, to be led out of
transgression by it up to God again, This is the work of the last ^dam, to
destroy the works of the Devil, to quicken up to God again, and to bring
again ^^^t which was driven away by transgression, (mark that) Ezekiel: 34:4: for
it is your ^^iquities that have separated between you and your God, and your
sins have hid his face from you, Isa: 59:3:4: for this purpose was the son of
God manifested, to destroy the works of the Devil, 1 John: 3:8: (mark) to
destroy that which the Devil has wrought, disobedience, transgression, all
unrighteousness and sin, this the Devil wrought, the old Serpent when he led
man out from God, (who is light) into darkness, the thick cloud, the
separation, Isa: 44:2^: which must be broken down and destroyed by the power of
God, before fallen man can be reconciled to God again.

Now such were the things which these men, Robert Hall, and Edmund Board
opposed, saying my doctrine tended to no other thing, then to bring people from
Christ, to be as the first Adam was, who said they was not in Christ, neither
had he the holy spirit said Robert Hall, in his first state, but was earthly,
And that the breath of life, which God breathed into man, (whereby he became a
living soul) was a created thing, these things was by them spoken, before many
people, bringing the Apostles words (in their dark minds) where he said the
first man is of the earth earthy, etc. now the Scripture is true, (the first
Adam was in two states, who will deny it) but I query, whether the first state
of the first man was earthly, seeing he was made in the image of God, in his
likeness, without sin, upright, and was blessed of God, having dominion, and
peace with God, I know the first Adam became earthy, when drove from God by
transgression, into the earth, after he had transgressed, and was afraid of
God, when he saw his nakedness, and hid himself, (mark) he had a self now
to hide after transgression, then 'twas I heard thy voice, and was afraid, here
was a division and separation, (I and thy, twain) after transgression, but not
before, (mark that) so here is the state of the whole world, in transgression
afraid of God, drove from God in the earth, hiding and covering self, and
loving and embracing that which God will destroy.

Now these men granted and confessed, that man in his first state had peace
with God, and was without sin, in the image, likeness, and dominion of God,
and was blessed of God, but said Robert Hall he had not then the holy spirit,
and said Edmund Board he was not in Christ in that state, now this is to be
considered with a sober mind in the light.

Christ Jesus is called the image of God, (who was without sin) 2 Cor. 4:4: and
man was made in the image of God, before sin and transgression was after the
likeness of God, and had dominion, and was blessed of God, and says the
scripture, Adam which was the son of God, Luke: 3:38: Then I thus query, could
Adam be in the image o^ God, without sin, in the likeness of God, the son of
God, at peace with God, and blessed of God, and yet not have the holy spirit,
n^r be in Christ, is not God holy? and can any be in his image like him, but
such as are holy? or be in peace with him, but who are holy* seeing the
scripture says, there is no peace to the wicked says my God, Isa: 57:21: and
without holiness no man shall see the Lord, Heb: 12:14: and be ye holy for I
the Lord your God am holy, Levit: 19:2. 1 Pet: 1:16. can any man be the son of
God, or like God* or blessed of God, and not b^ holy, let the just answer, or
can any be holy, like God, i^ the image of God, without the holy spirit, if
thou say no, none can be like God (wh^ is holy) but such as are holy, and that
none can be holy without the holy spirit, then whether man had not the holy
spirit, when he was in the image of God, the sone of God, in peace and blessed
of God, before sin and transgression was, or can any be the sons of God, at
peace, reconciled to God again, without Christ and the holy spirit, yea or nay?
or do God speak peace, to that which is not like him, or is his blessing to
two seeds, or but to one, Gal: 3:16: yea or nay:

Now if any other shall say, that man in his first state, in the image of God,
before sin and transgression was, when he was blessed of God, had not then the
holy spirit, neither was he in Christ, Then do I query, what and whose spirit
was it, which he had, when he was made in the image of God, and blessed, self
was not before transgression, and Christ being the image of God without sin, 2
Cor. 4:4: and man was made (in) the image of God, before sin and transgression
and self was, blessed of God, having dominion over the earth, and the
creatures, then what or who stood he in, if not in Christ, or what spirit was
he guided and upheld by, before transgression, if not by the holy spirit, or
what was his fall, and what fell he from when he transgressed, did he fall from
that which was earthly, or from that which was holy, pure and eternal of God,
yea or nay? consider it, But if any should say, that man's first state was
earthly, (as these men have said) then say I man fell from that which was
earthly, for he fell from his first state by transgression, (did he not fall
from that which he transgressed) or do any now fall from that which is
earthly, or from that which is heavenly, when they transgress and sin against
God? Let Gods witness in you answer,

Object. But do not the scripture say: the first man is of the earth, earthly,
and the second is the Lord from heaven, and as we have borne the image of the
earthly, so shall we bear the image of the heavenly. 1 Cor: 15:47.

Answ. Yea, it does so, and the scriptures is true, but he speaks of a mi^tery
verse 51. which the blind cannot see, and a leight mind in vanity, and lust,
and rebellion against God, cannot weigh the weight of holy men's words being
from the light in them the just balance, neither can men, by the wisdom of
this world, comprehend and discern spiritual things; Therefore must all
people upon earth, be brought to the light, which they be lighted withal,
which comes from Christ, the first and the la^t, the savior out of
transgression, before they can see, and know that state which was before sin
and transgression was, for in the dark thou cannot see things that differ,
(iniquity is darkness) but come to the light which condemns sin, and in it
wait, and thou will see a great difference, between a state before sin and
transgression was, and a state in transgression, between a state in peace, and
blessed of God, in the image of God, the son of God. And a state under
condemnation, wrath, and the curse of God, out of his image, out of his son, a
transgressor afraid of God, without peace and the blessing of God, for both
these states Adam was in, the first before he transgressed, the other after
transgression, so the wages of sin is the curse and death, which came by sin,
by transgression, in which state Adam was drove from God into the earth: Gen:
3:24: and this image all transgressors have borne, and the Apostle said ye
were sometimes darkness, etc. envying (...) living in malice, hateing and
hateful, Here was the image which they had borne, but were waiting to bear
another image, to put on Christ and walk in him, who is the image of God, 2
Cor: 4:4: the first and the last, Rev: 1:17:

Now if any can say that the Apostle or them to whom he thus spoke, had ever
borne that image, which Adam was in, before sin or transgression entered into
the world, then let me know when it was they bore it, if thou shall say, when
they were infants, having done neither good or evil, they were in that state,
then let me query, whether all men since transgression (in the natural state)
were not conceived in sin and borne in iniquity yea or nay? and whether the
Apostle and them he spoke to had any other birth before regeneration in Christ
the way to God again, the truth, the light, the life, the first and the last
the image of God.

Object. But how could Adam be in Christ, before Christ came into the world, or
was borne of the Virgin, seeing Adam was made in the image of God long before,
could he be made in Christ, or by Christ, before Christ was, how can these
things be?

Answ. The word Christ in letters CHRIST, was not known (neither was there any
occasion of them,) before man had transgressed, and lost that life in and by
which he was created, but the power which was in that man (or body) which
suffered without the gate of Jerusalem, was before the body, or creature was
made, and it was the power of the most high which overshaddowed the Virgin; and
said he, a body have thou prepared me (mark) this was the life and power in
the b^dy which spoke, in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwelt, and he spoke
and prayed to his father, which was in him: John: 14:11: so though he was not
known by them letters, or the name CHRIST, yet he was with the father
glorified, before the world began, and was the word in the beginning, John:
1:1: by whom the world was made, who said, before Abraham was I am, John: 8:58:
but the name or letters CHRIST, was not until many hundred years after, so
thou may see, that the Christ of God, the word by whom all things was made, was
before it was made, glorified with the father, before Abraham, and Adam, and
Moses, and the names or letters were, the image of God, the blessed seed: Then
why was not man (who was made in the image of God) and blessed of God, in that
seed, or power, or image, seeing the scripture says, he was made in Gods
image, and blessed of God, Gen: 1:26:28: or wheth^r there be any blessing to
more seeds then one, and whether God did not say to Abraham, in thy se^d shall
all Nations upon earth be blessed, Gen: 22:18: and they that are Chri^ts are
Abraham's seed, and heirs according to promise, Gal. 3:29: in Christ, in the
seed, in the heir, in the image of God, (which was before Abraham was) is the
promises (and the blessing) 2 Cor: 1:20: yea and amen: and not unto seeds, Gal.
3.16.

Again in those days before transgressi^n was, there was no need of a savior,
or words, or letters, or names, or preachings, or teachings to bring man to
God, until he had departed from him by transgression, until sin entered into
the world, and death by sin, and darkn^sse, ignorance, blindness, captivity,
and bondage was, there was no need to say believe in the light, and come to the
light, and follow and obey it which shows you sin, until sin was, and
darkness was, sin could not be discovered, where it was not or before it was,
there was no need to say know the Lord, and fear the Lord, and depart from
evil, and to tell of a redeemer, until ignorance, transgression and bondage
was, and to say obey the Lord, or his word, until disobedience was so there
was not need ^o mention the name Christ at that time, neither was it, though
that seed was a mystery hid from ages and generations, (the seed of the Woman,
which bruises the serpents head, which was borne of a virgin in due time) and
is yet hid to and in such as walk in darkness, and from all transgressors, who
love the evil and darkness, rather then the light.

Now when Moses and Israel was in the wilderness, and when they sinned in the
wilderness, there was a rock which followed them, [marke] (some thing that is
hard to them that sins) and the Apostle said, the rock which followed them
was Christ, (consider this well with a single eye) he that was given for a
leader and commander, and goes before his own sheep, follows them that
sinned, (read within) and he is the ^ight, which lights every man, that
comes into the world, which is to lead up to God ^gaine, out of the world, to
the beginning, before the transgression or hills was.

So that this one seed (which was a rock in Moses days to them that sinned,
and cal^ed a hard master by the sloathfull) has in process of time, many
names though one ^ower in nature, as he was called the word, a child, a son, a
stone, the elect, the foundation, the door, the vine, the lamb (of God and)
slain from the foundation of the world, (and all that is in the world, is the
lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of ^ife, 1 John: 2:16:
and) he is called the lion of the tribe of Judah, the savior, the redeemer,
the mediator, the way, the truth, the life, the seed, the wonderful
counselor, ^he mighty God, the prince of peace, the immanuell, God with us,
the Messiah, and Jesus which is called Christ, all these names and more, is
given to the one seed; now must people be pooring and imagining, and contending
about names, letters, and words, which was given since the fall, since
transgression, or be brought to the seed, the word, which was in the beginning
the substance, which was before the names, and ends the names, and the letters,
and the words, and the imaginations, strivings, and contending about words to
no profit, and before transgression was, who is the express image of the
invisible God, who now is come a light into the world, and preaches himself
the light of the world, John: 8:12: and his witness declares him to be the
true light, that lights every man, which comes into the world, full of grace
and truth: John: 1:9:14.

Now Reader if the blessed eye in thee be open, and thou stand single in it,
thou will see some^hing in what I have written for the simple sake, and for the
truth sake, and if thou can stand still, and but see the truth, then will thou
see Robert Hal^: teacher at Colebrooke, and Edmund Board in blindness and
error, and with a lie in their right hand, who said man in his first ^^ate,
before transgression, (who was the son of God, in the image of God, and blessed
of God) ^ad not the holy spirit, nor was in Christ, but bare the earthly image,
and that the breath of ^^fe, which God breathed into man, was a created thing,
let the sober minded with Gods wit^esse, (the light in them) judge, whether
that which made living be the created thing? or that which was made living by
it? or whether a created thing, can create and make living, or whether that
life, in which we live move and have our being, be the created, or the creator,
let understanding judge: Acts: 17:28: Deuteronomy: 30:20:

Now this was the great error which Robert Hall, charged against me, (viz.)
that I went to bring people from Christ, to that state, which Adam was in
before the fall; mark and consider, and see what state Adam was in, before the
fall, before transgression (that was his fall) and then see wherein I have
erred, if I had brought all people upon earth into that state, or wherein I
brings any from Christ as he has said, Adam before the fall, was without sin,
before the fall was in the image of God, in his state before the fall, had
dominion over the world, and was the son of God, in the likeness of God,
before the fall, was blessed of God: Gen: 1:

Now if I had, could, or do bring people to this state, (to be without sin, to
be in the image of God, to be the sons of God, to have dominion over the world,
to be blessed of God) wherein is my error, or what have I erred from herein, or
what are they erred from which are brought into this state; let truth judge.

Now if any shall say, we are erred from Christ, or from God in Christ, or from
the spirit, or from the doctrine of Christ, I answer nay? its he that
transgresses, that abides not in the doctrine of Christ, and such has not
God, 2 John: 1:9: and the father, son, and spirit ar^ one, and Christ is the
first and the last, without sin, before sin and transgression was, the desire
of all nations, the image and son of God, glorified with the father, before the
foundation of the world, to him, and into him, is our desire that people should
come, in which seed only the blessing is, Gen: 22:18: Gal: 3:16: 1 John: 3:9:
which all in transgression be erred from.

Then it was asked Robert Hall, what he went to bring people unto by his
preaching:

He answered, he went to bring them from that state, (mark that) Now if any
people were come into that state, to be without sin, in the image of God, the
sons of God, having dominion over the world, and blessed of God, as at the
first read Isa: 1:25:26:) is it no^ the work of the devil, of his ministers,
and messengers, and angels, to bring them out o^ this state? is not this the
same work which the devil, the old serpent did, when he brough^ man from that
state, in which he was without sin, and blessed of God) at the first, when h^
transgressed, and was driven out of paradise, (peace, rest, joy) into the
earth, where he becam^ earthly, unsavory, unrighteous, and unfruitful to God?
and was it a work of the serpent then to bring from that state which God
blessed, (whose blessing unchangeably, and promises are (...) the seed only,
and in the seed yea and amen: 2 Cor: 1:20:)

And is it not now the work of the devil, the old serpent in Robert Hall, and
the rest of h^^ mind, to bring people from that state, which of God is
blessed? let them that fear God judg^ and then see whose messenger and minister
he is, and whose will and work he does; and if he (...) found doing the same
work, which the devil did, when he brought man from his blessed sta^^ into
transgression, then whether the son of God, (the light of the world) will not
destroy h^^ work, seeing for this purpose he was manifested, even to destroy
the works of the dive^^ 1 John: 3:8: and whether he will not (...) ^^her the
wages of sin be not death, and whether it be not a sin to bring people into
sin, from that state which God does bless, yea or nay, and whether there be
any other state among men, but the blessed and the cursed, if not, then whether
he that brings from the bless d state, do not bring under the curse, and
whether he that brings to the state blessed, brings not from under the curse,
into peace with God, into the image of God again, into the resurrection and the
life which was before death, the curse, and the fall, so if it be not an error
to bring people from all error, into a blessed state out of transgression, into
the image of God, to be the sons of God, to have victory over the world,
through him, who is the second Adam, the light of the world, the quickening
spirit, the first and the last, then I am cleared of that, which Robert Hall
himself is in, and the blessing of God is to him, that brings into the blessed
state, and is in the blessed state which was before sin and transgression was,
the first and the last, Cant: 12:3: Rev: 22:13:14: Mat: 5:9:

Also this Edmund Board said, that he was through grace, in a more glorious
state, then Adam was in before the fa^l, (these are to high words for a liar)
and that he was sat down with Christ, in heavenly places, and bad peace with
God and was harmless, and innocent, and without spot, and that the blood of
Christ had cleansed him from all sin.

Something of this, I may leave to his neighbors, at Colebrook to judge, which
knows his words, and actions, and conversation, whether he be without spot,
or cleansed from (all) sin yea or nay? if so, then he have no sin, but if he
commit sin, then he is a liar, and of his father, whose works he does; now if
it were so, as he has said he is, cleansed from all sin, so was man without
sin, before the fall, (for sin, transgression was his fall and error,) and if
he were without sin, and had no sin, and blessed of God before the fall, then
how much do Edmund Boards state, exceed this in glory? who says the blood of
Christ, has cleansed him from all sin, (mark) to be cleansed from all sin,
and to have no sin, what difference is here, (if no sin had been committed,
there had been no need of being cleansed from it,) he said he is sat down with
Christ in heavenly places; now Christ is the image of God. 2 Co^: 4:4: and man
before the fall, was in the image of God, Gen: 1:26: he said he was innocent,
and without spot, and had peace with God, now if it were as he has said, was
not man in his first state before the fall innocent, and without spot (is not
sin the spot) and had he not peace with God before transgression, or was he
afraid or hid himself before transgression, or after (read within) or was he
blessed in peace and domin^on before or after he had transgressed? search the
scriptures, they testify of the truth; and are a true declaration: Gen: 1:28:
Luk: 1:1:

So that if any could believe that this professor, were in a more glorious
state, then man was in before transgression was, yet I would have them believe
the truth also, and search the scriptures, for they testify of him, which was
before sin, and transgression was, glorified with the father before the world
began, who is the alpha and omaga: the first and the last, he that have ears to
hear let him hear and understand a right, Rev: 22:13:

Now if this man were cleansed from all sin, without spot, innocent, sat down
with Christ in heavenly places, and had peace with God, (as he has said) yet
in the light search him out further, and see if we can find him in a [more]
glorious state, then man was in before the fall; before transgression was, who
was made in the image of God, the son of God, and blessed of God (then in
peace) having dominion over all before transgression and sin was, (then without
sin the spot, and innocent) so that if he be not in a [more] glorious state
then this, then say I, he is a liar, for he has said, he was in a more
glorious state th^n Adam was in before the fall, (as many other can witness)
and if he be a liar then of him which ^ed from (...) whose work (...) people
(...) ^tate, in which God blessed man, before transgression was; then he is no^
innocent, nor cleansed from (all) sin, for lying is sin, and the spot, so not
without spot, not in peace, n^^ blessed of God, then not in so glorious a
state, as Adam was in, before lying and transgression was; bu^ shut out,
without are dogs and all liars, Rev: 22:13:14:15:

Now consider all them that are in transgression are in the fall, in the
adulterated seed, to which the curse is, and not the blessing driven from God,
into the earth, vagabonds cast out, loosing the blessing, a^^ that are in
lying, swearing, pride, covetousness, wantonn^sse, drunkenness, envy, wrath,
frowardness, corrupt communication, lust, whoredom, idolatry, deceit,
wildness, profaneness, mocking, these are i^ the fall, lost, cast out,
driven, banished from God by transgression, in the seed of evil doers, which
shall never be renowned, but judged, cond^mned, plagued, and tormented day and
night for ever and ever, if they be not converted, and changed into another
seed and stock, Cain the envious, the vagabond, driven from God, Ishmaell, the
wild man, the mocker cast out, Esau the profane person, the cunning hunter
lost the blessing, hear this all professors, who are of that stock and seed,
whose deeds are evil hateing) the light, with which you be lighted, (and all
you ungodly ones every where) which lets you see all your ungodly deeds, and
hard speeches, and your perverse and crooked ways you have walked in, its your
condemnation in that state, even the light: John: 3:19: which would lead you
out of transgression, up to God again, (did you love it) out of the world, to
the beginning, before the world and transgression was, to Christ Jesus, by whom
the world was made, the word, which was before the words, and letters, and
before the many things, and names, and languages, and before the sects, and
opinions, heaps and imaginations were, the light leads out of all these, up to
him from whence it comes, who has a name above, (and before) every name under
heaven, the savior of the soul immortal, glorified with the father the
prince of peace, who brings out of transgression and sin, out of darkness, the
curse and fall again, all them that follow him in the regeneration, and I say
again, except a man be born again, he cannot inherit the kingdom of God,
(which is righteousness, peace, and joy in the holy spirit) so to whom this
may seem error, (as it has to some) my advice to such is; come to the light,
(which is true) in thy conscience, (and be not hasty to speak evil of things
thou know not, as many as has done, but first cast out the beam) and let it
search thy heart, and try thy reins, and ways, and words, and in it see, if
thou be not yet in the fall, transgression and error, for all that be from the
l^ght, are erred from the right way, Christ the light, the way, the truth, and
the life, who is the first and the last, the image of God; and so are in
darkness, not able to discern things that differ; because darkness has blinded
the eye 1 Ioh: 2:11:

These things are not published in envy to any man upon earth, but in true love
to the seed and truth of God, and for the sake of the simple, (who are tossed
up and down with every wind of doctrine) that they may come to the word, which
was in the beginning, which the true light comes from, and in it be established.
