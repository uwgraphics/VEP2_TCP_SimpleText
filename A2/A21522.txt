A Proclamation set forth by thee Kings Majesty, with thassent of his most

other things, that all wolpackers and wynders of wolles, should be sworn and
take a corporal oath before the Mayre and Constables of the Staple of
Westminster, for the time being, truly and Justly to wind and pack all the
wolles within this Realm, by force of which estatute and by the good
ordinances made in ye said estaple, the feloweshippe of wole wynders,
otherwise called wollmen have ever syns Justly and truly wound and packed all
such wolles as they have meddled with throughoute this Realm, unto now of
late diverse and many persons contrary to the said Estatute taking upon them
to be wollewynders in many places of this Realm, neither being sworn nor
expert in wyndyng and foldyng of wolles, of which some of them be Taillors,
weauers, Cordewayners, Barbors, Husbondemen, and other artifycers, have gone
about and daily do go about throughoute this Realm, in many places, and
practyse them selfs in wyndynge and foldynge of the said wolles by the
procurement and means of the owners and breders of the said wolles, and do
wind up and dysceytefully put in to the said Fleeys of wolle, Sand, stones,
Duste, Pitche, Tar, Claye, Iron, Leadd, double marks, shurlockes, dounge,
La^mswolle, and other deceyueable things, not only to the great slander of
this Realm, But also to the slander of the merchants of the said Estaple,
and likewise also to the great hynderaunce and disceite of the said merchants
as also to the great loss and preiudyce of the kings subjects using the
feate or craft of Clothmakynge within this realm: For reformacion and
redress whereof, the kings most Royal Majesty by thaduice of his most
honorable cou^sail, straightly charge and commands that no manner of person
or persons whatsoever he or they be at any time hereafter goo about, or take
upon him or them to wind or Fold any manner of wolles in any country where
any end wolles are acustomed to be wrought, had or used for the marchaunte of
the Staple, or the Clothier, before he or they shall be admytted and allowed by
the Masters and wardens of the company, and fellowship of the wolmen of the
City of London or one of them for the time being, to the^tent that he or they
shall be expert and have knoweledge in the said craft or mysterye, for the true
wyndyng and folding of wolles. And that every person, or persons so allowed and

admyttaunce under the Seal of the Mayre of the Staple of Westminster, for the
time being and that none of the said persons so allowed and admitted, or that

without deceyte, wind or ffolde all and synguler such wolle, or wolles as he
or they shall take upon him or them to wind or ffolde, without leaving, or
puttyng within any flece, or Fleces, any manner Clokketes, Locks,
Hyndershankes, Tails, wasshelockes, Stones, Sand, Dust, Cummer, or doble
marks, or any wolle, or wolles, of worse nature, or growing, then the same
Fleece is, or any other fylth to be left upon the breeche of any fleece, or
fleeces whereby any such fleece, or fleeces may be empayred, or made
weightyet, or mynyshe, or take away any part, or portion of the goodness of
any of the same fleeces to thentent to deceive the buyers, ne shall use any
other deceyte craft, fraud, or gyle therein upon pain of imprysonment by the

town with a fleece of wolle hangyng about his neck. And his Majesty by
thasse^t aforesaid, further straightly charge and commands that no grower,
breeder, brogar, or gatherer of any wolles within any of his graces counties

forasmuch as it is perceived and certainly known, that diverse covetous
persons now of late of their gready and insatiable minds, not being contented
ne satisfied with such increase of wolles of their sheep, as God has given
them, but contrary to al godlynes and honesty have abused thesaid gift of
god, in lettinge their said sheep remain unshorn and vnclipte by the space
of three weeks or a month, after their said wasshing and driyng again of
thee same, before they will sheere or clyppe them, to thentent their said
wolles might be the weightyer, partly by means of their Sweatyng and partly
also through other Fylth which does increase by reason of their long
dyfferryng the Shearyng and clippyng of the same, as well to thempairyng of the
same wolles, as also to the shameful deceyte of the said Merchants of the
said Estaple and the clothyers of this Realm biyng or workyng of the same.
Wherevpo^, for thaduoydyng and eschuyng as well of that craft and disceyte as
al other abouenamed in time to come, the kings most royal majesty with
thassent aforesaid, straightly charge and commands that fromhensforthe no

hundred of the same Sheep, so remainyng vnclipte as is above specifyed forty
shillinges, or under or above an hundred after the same rate, to be paid to
our sovereign Lord the king in his Exchequer at Westminster. And further
his majesty by thassent aforsayd straightly charge and commands al and
every Justice of peace, Maires, Sheryffes, Baylyffes and all other Officers and
