EPISTLE TO THE READER.
Benevolous Reader,
IN the Revolution of this little Volume, you will encounter several
intervening Causes of observation, and other accidents of such nature in these
times that may move thee even to admiration; as First, That these Papers have
layn so long Concealed before their appearance in Puqlick they being of such
value, so much desired and Expected, by all Ingenious men of all degrees,
Especially, those who had a knowledge of the Author, which scruple thus I
answer. First, That the Author Composed many of these things to gratify the
Commands of his Superiors, or the Request of his Friends or Acquaintance, as
Chevy-Chace for the R.R. the Bishop of London; and some for other Honoable
Persons, and some for his own humor, or his Familiar Friends, and these he
distributed according as they were related in the first fair Corrected Copy,
and left nothing in his own Custody but indigested, foul, torn, scattering
Papers, and those in such disorder, that, after they came to my hands, (though
kept together with all the care could be improved, yet) of some Songs it may be
one Canton came to my hand as this day, and peradventure (five Months after) I
might be so fortunate as to get the rest, or most part of it together, and some
utterly disjointed till reduced as they now are (I hope) not very lamely by my
weak Genius. Another obstacle my unacquainted and stranger Interest with many
who were of his Intimacy, so that I could not retrive many whole Copies that I
have only heard of, but never get the posession of them, Therefore it is
desired of all Gentlemen who have any of the Authors Latin Songs or Verses
which are not found in this Impression, that they will be pleased to bring or
send Copies of them to Mr. John Eglesfield Bookseller, at the Sign of the
Marigold in Fleet Street London, whereby to encourage another Edition, and it
shall be received as a great Favor and Civility by the Publisher, and a worthy
gratitude to the memory of the Deceased Author. Some again, were very hardly
recovered out of the hands of an illiterate welsh Cook wench, who had designed
to sacrifice them to the hoary Hen on the Spit, in which service two of these
(the one beginning Absit maetus phantasticus, and another beginning, Schismaticis
ex omnibus) lost all their English Tongue. Another attractive of Admiration is,
that you find a thing of this nature and value, (a work never seen Printed in
England, or (that I ever heard of) in any part of the World beside before this)
should pass the Press without the Patronage of some worthy Maecenas. To which I
answer, that among some of the Authors Papers, I found a preparative Dedication
(provided he had lived to Print them himself;) to a Person of Quality, who was
a most Constant Countenancer of the Authors Muse, while he was living. To this
Person I did address my self. And desired, that, for his dead Friends sake he
would be pleased to accept it, but he returned me with this modest Complement,
Detur Digniori, now since I had no pretentions to Entitle this Book mine own I
sought no farther into the Catologue of mine own Friends: Thus (kind Reader)
thou see it comes to thy hands in a blew Coat without a Badg, I hope thou will use it more Favorably then to reject it before thou know what it is,
but as thou find it let it suffer, without straining thy Judgment or
Censure.

Farewell.
To my Worthy Friend Captain William Bold, on his Collection of his Brothers
Latin Songs, etc.
HEaring you had undertaken to Collect
These scattered Papers, which none could Expect,
Should e're in bulk have viewed the World again
But like their Author in the Grave remain,
And wrapped in Flannel under Earth have lain.
A Task so difficult, I durst believe,
(But his own Genius,) none could e're retrive,
Yet those have seen them loose, in their first birth,
Do know they have nothing lost of native worth.
Therefore I could not choose but entertain
With Joyful welcome this your generous vain,
That raises Harry from the dead again.
'Twas such a kindness to forlorn thoughts,
(Past Expectation) none could e're have brought's,
But such industrious studdies yours have been,
You have in this revived both us and him.
When Songs and Verse, that in their kind were good
By times and fashions, as condemned stood,
For want of polite Phrase, and modern guise
Scarce 'scap'd the Execution, or the Assize.
Your Brother took them home, and by his Care,
Nursed them so well, that still they living are,
He taught them speak so Elegant and true,
Their language Carries them the World quite through,
His Charity in that was great, but now
We all receive the benefit from you.
Like Pilgrims, singly he abroad them sent,
But you have brought them into one Convent.
Where cloistered by your care they now shall live,
And when you are dead your memories revive.
Your Brothers, as their Founder and Instructor,
Yours, as their Quaestor and Chief Benefactor.
As pious works do speak their Founders stories,
These sheets are fixed your Monumental Glories.
G. H. hosp. Gray*

TO CAPT. WILLIAM BOLD ON HIS Collections* etc,
FUll of faint hopes, and fears the World has been,
That these sweet measures, were no sooner seen
In public sheets, which so long lost have lain
In private hands dispersed, and void of name,
Like Embrions which are stifled e're their birth
Are only pitty'd and returned to Earth,
Of fostring neither capable or worth.
And these loose Papers a like fortune had,
If by your Care and Industry not made
A Ripe and full grown birth; which sure must be
Of every spritely wit the Nursery,
The Bosom friend, and welcome pocket Guest,
Of all Ingenious Company a Feast;
Who is it that would his fancies recreate
With an old Song, by time worn out of date,
Yet 'cause he Loves the Humor, or the Tune,
Would not be laughed at by the boys of the Town,
Here, he may find a Remedy at hand,
And please himself, when few can understand
How neately he does put the change upon
Old Chevy-Chase, or new, Nay prithee John.
Being thus provided of quaint Phrase in Ryme,
Youth may improve their knowledge, mirth and time
If riper years will have a Round or Catch,
Here Is that which will their frolic humor match,
If frail conceit lie couched in any place,
Here Is language gives it modesty and grace.
How basely then, had these rich lines been left
An Embrio, of form and life bereft.
Had you not found a means to bring to light,
What had been swallowed in e'rlasting night.
For, Harry, careless of what he had done,
At's Friends request, to's Friend he left alone
And thought it was his Friends, and not his own.
Never reserving Copy well Corrected,
But some few scattered notions quite neglected,
Without concern, or thought of such a miss
H'has sent for Copies to that Friend of his,
Distant an hundred miles, so to retrive
Forgotten lines which he did make and give,
So that you surely found them halt and lame,
Some torn in wretched Rags and tatters came,
Some wanting Digits, some had lost a Foot,
But by your care and skill, you holp'd them to it;
And we ackowledg your Labors have been great,
Of such lame limbs to make a Corpse complete,
And now, devoting these your studies thus,
In raising these, you raise both him and us.
M. B. Oxon.

SONGS AND POEMS.
SONG I.
GOod your Worship, cast your Eye
Upon a Soldiers misery,
And let not these lean Cheeks (I pray)
Your Bounty from a Soldier fray.
But like a noble Friend,
Some Silver lend,
And Jove shall pay you in the End.
And I will pray to Fate
To make you Fortunate
In Heavenly and in Earthly State.
II.
I never was wont to beg (Good Sir)
Which makes me Blush to keep this Stir,
I never went from place to place,
For to make known my woeful Case:
Oh I am none of those,
A Roguing goes,
And Maundring show their Drunken-Blows,
Which they have only got,
By banging of the Pot,
And Quarelling to pay the Shot.
III.
But I who Limp thus Wars have seen,
And in brave Battles have I been;
Still where the Cannons Used to Roar,
My proper Sphere was Evermore.
Once at a Barricado,
In Bravado
Tossing of the Hand-Granado,
Death was very near,
For it took away mine Ear,
And yet (thank God) Ch'am here, Ch'am here.
IV.
I have at least a dozen times
Been blown up by these Roguish mines,
Thrice through the head I have been shot
My Brains have boiled up like a Pot,
And being left for Dead
When all were Fled,
They sent me back again to Bed.
Those dangers I have past
From First to Last
Would make your Worship sore aghast.
V.
At push of Pike I lost this Eye,
At Bergen Seig I broke my Thigh:
At Brussels, (though a very Lad)
I laid about as I were Mad.
Oh little would you Ween
That I have been
Such an old Soldier of the Queen;
But if Sr. Francis Vere
Were living now and here
He Would tell you how I Slashed them there.
VI.
The Zealanders my Fury know,
Lost with them have Changed a blow,
From whence we led a Warlike dance
Out of Spain and into France,
Where we have spent a Flood
Of very noble Blood,
And did but very little Good;
And now I am come Home
With Rags about my Bum,
To beg of you for this small Sum.
VII.
And now my case you Understand,
Good Sir lend me your helping Hand:
A little thing would pleasure me,
To keep in Ure your Charity,
Oh! it is not bread and cheese
Or Barley leese
Or any such like Scraps as these
That I do ask of you,
But Shillings one or two,
Therefore your purse-strings straight undo.
SONG II.
I.
DAme Fortune if thou want a guide,
I Will tell thee how thou may divide,
Distribute unto each his due,
Justice is Blind and so are you.
II.
To the Usurer this doom impart,
May's Scrivener break, and then his Heart*
His Debtors unto beggary fall,
Or what is as bad turn Courtiers all.
III.
Unto Tradesmen that sell too dear,
A long vacation all the Year!
Revenge us thus on their deceits,
And send them Wives, light, as their Weights.
IV.
And lest the Players should grow poor,
Send them Aglaura's more and more,
Unto the Puritans more Ears,
Then Ceres in her Garland wears.
V.
But Fortune how can recompense,
The French men's daily insolence?
For them I know no greater pain,
Then to be sent to France again.
VI.
To the Physician (if you please)
Send him another new disease,
And give to Scholars (if thou can do it)
A Benefice without a suit.
VII.
To Court Lords great Monopolies,
And to their Wives Communities,
So Fortune shall thou please them all,
When Lords do rise and Ladies fall.
VIII.
Unto the Lawyers (I beseech)
As much for silence as for speech*
To Ladies Ushers strength of Back
And to my self a cup of Sack.
SONG III.
I.
SIT thee down by me (mine own) Joy
Thou Wilt quite kill me should thou prove Coy,
Should be Coy, and have none of me,
Where should I have such another Lass as thee.
II.
I Have been at Wake, and I Have been at Fair,
Yet saw not one, with thee to Compare.
Long have I sought, but never could I find,
One like to thee, if thou prove kind.
III.
Thou shall have gay things to make the fine,
Thou shall have all things if thou wilt be mine;
Thy head with the choicest Flowers shall be crowned,
And thy pink-petty-coat shall be Laced round.
IV.
We Will go early to the brook side,
To catch Fishes as they do glide;
And every Fish thy Captive shall be,
Thou catching them as thou have caught me.
V.
When the scrip's full then what shall we do?
But gang to the little house on the hill brow.
There will we sit and eat up our Fish,
But sure it is thy self must make the best dish.
VI
Come let me kiss thy cherry lips, and trace
All over the wonders of thy sweet face;
Thy breasts, that so white, and roundly do rise,
Thy ruddy-Cheeks, and thy black Eyes.
VII.
I Will ly by thee, all the cold night,
Thou shall have all things for thy delight.
Thou shall have any thing, thou shall have me,
Sure I have some thing, that will please thee.
SONG IV.
I.
MY dearest Mistress, has an heart,
Kind, as those soft looks she gave me;
When with her resistless arts,
And her Eyes she did inslave me.
But her Constancy's so weak,
She Is so wild and apt to wander,
That my Jealous heart will break,
If that we live one Day asunder.
II.
Melting Joys about her move,
Killing Charms, and wounding blisses,
She can arm herself with love,
And her lips can Charm with kisses,
Angels listen when she speaks,
She Is my delight and mankinds wonder,
Yet my Jealous heart she breaks,
If that we lie one night asunder.
SONG V.
I.
DIana, Penelope, Lucrece,
Were sullen, and Idle Queans,
There is never a Countess or Duchess,
Like one that will use the means:
They give their minds unto't,
And ply you, Tooth and Nail,
And when you set in it they will do it
As Devil were in their Tail.
II.
They look for no tedious-Woing,
or whispering this and that,
without any further-a-Doing,
They know what you would be at*
To Dead-Lifts they will not fail,
And handle your matter so,
But wy-he. They Will wag the tail,
And buckle unto your bow.
III.
Then Pox o'that pitiful Sinner,
That whines at a Ladies door,
He Will find less of pleasantness in her,
Then in a Whetston-Whore:
There you must cring, and crouch,
To purchase a kiss o'th Hand,
When here, you may take a touch,
She Is ever at your Command.
SONG. VI.
I.
BY the Charms of his Phillis, lead with vigorous power,
The Shepherd arrived, and rushed in at the door.
All his hopes, and his fears, were Confirmed by this Chance,
For he found her at work with herself in a Trance.
II.
On her back she was laid, with her legs spread a sunder,
Nor had she omitted the Pillow laid under:
With only her hand, and her fancy oppressed,
She panted and heaved, you may guess at the rest.
III.
Before he cou'ld come to succor her Flame,
The Nymph was so quick, she had played out her Game:
With that she looked up, and saw him in the place,
Oh wretched! she cried, how comes this to pass?
IV.
It Is the fate of our Sex to lie under this Curse,
If we lie not with yours, we do what is Worse,
We languish in Love, look Pale, and Wan,
Whilst this is the Virtue, resists thee oh Man.
V.
With that the bold Shepherd began to draw near,
And the Nymph started back, with her usual fear.
He closely persu'd, oh! gently she Cried,
Oh! Fool that I was, that so long I Denied.
VI.
She gave him her hand which she sealed with a Kiss,
And swore 'till that minute she never knew bliss
She smiled, then Laughed out, and about him still hung,
And cried (my dear Damon) I hope you have not done.
VII.
The Shepherd then rallying to charge her again,
With a courage as feirce as at first he began,
By ill sat awaked, and then found it was all
But a Dream, though he looked upon it as a call.
VIII.
To the Nymph he adored, away straight he Ran,
And before an hour past, what he Fancied got done,
From that time he swore, he would believe Revelation
Since to him it had proved the best Baud in the Nation.
SONG. VII.
I.
WHy do thou say I am forsworn,
'Cause thine I vowed to be?
Thou se'st it is already morn,
And 'twas last night I promised thee,
That fond Impossibility.
II.
And I have loved thee much and long,
A tedious twelve hours space,
I should do other Beauties wrong,
And rob thee of a fresh embrace,
Should I still dote upon thy Face*
III.
Not but all Joys in thy brown hair,
By others may be found:
But I must have the black and Fair*
So for treasures some do sound,
In altogether unknown Ground*
IV.
But if, when I have ranged my Round,
Thou prov'st the pleasant'st she,
With spoils of other beauties Crowned,
I laden will return to thee,
Even sated with variety*
Another of the same. CANT. VII.
CVR me perjurum dicis esse,
Cum tuum me devovi?
Auroram vides nunc adesse,
Hesterna nocte id promovi,
Quod impossible jam novi.
II.
Non bis sex horoe tibi laetae,
Quam diu vis amarem?
Caeterae viderentur Spretae,
Novi amplexu deprivarem,
Si te Constanter honorarem.
III.
In te fatebo admiranda
Satis reperiuntur,
Sed Alba Nigra sunt scrutanda,
Terrae infossae evolvuntur,
Hin^ Mineralia Effodiuntur.
IV.
Cum sim per Circulum vagatus,
Si tu sis magis grata,
Minorum Spoliis Coronatus,
Anima redit onerata,
Copia suavi satiata.
SONG. VIII.
I.
Were thou far fairer than thou art,
Which lies not in the power of art;
Or had thou in thine Eyes more darts,
Than ever Cupid shot at Hearts,
Yet if they were not throw'n at me,
I would not cast one thought on thee.
II.
I Would rather marry a disease,
Than court a thing cannot please,
She that will cherish my Desires,
Must feed my Flames with equal Fires!
What sweetness is there in a kiss,
To him that doubts the Heart's not his?
III.
I love thee not 'cause thou art Fair,
Softer than Down, sweeter than Air,
Nor for these Cupids that do Lie,
In every Corner of thine Eye.
But would thou know what it may be,
It Is I love you, 'cause you love me.
SONG. IX.
I.
SWeet! let me now this evening dye!
Oh smile not to prevent it,
But use this oppertunity,
Lest that we both repent it;
Frown quickly then, and break my Heart,
That so my way of Dying
May, (though my life be full of smart,)
Be worth the World's Envying.
II.
Some striving knowledge to refine,
Consume themselves with thinking
Others who freindship seal in Wine,
Are kindly killed by Drinking,
And some are Wrecked on the Indian Coast,
Thither by gain invited,
Others in smoke of Battle lost,
Whom Drums not Lutes Delighted.
III
Alas! how poorly these Depart!
Their Graves still unattended,
Who Dye not with a broken Heart,
Are not in love Commended.
His memory is ever sweet,
All praise and pity moveing,
Who bravely at his mistress Feet,
Can Dye with over Loving.
IV.
And now thou frown'st and now I Dye,
My Corpse by lovers Followed,
Which straight shall by Dead lovers Lie,
For that ground's only Hallowed.
If Priests take it ill I have a Grave,
My Death not well approving,
The Poets mine Estate shall have,
To teach the art of Loving.
V.
Then every where they will ring the Bells,
For thy poor youth Departed,
Who every other else Excells
That is not broken Hearted:
Virgins on me their Flowers shall strew,
But if thy tears Fall near them,
They Will so excel in scent, and show,
Thy self will shortly wear them.
VI.
Such Flowers how much will Flora Prise,
Which near a Lover growing,
Will watered be by Mistres Eyes,
With Pity overflowing?
A Grave thus decked will (though thou art,
Yet fearful to come nigh me,)
Invite thee straight to break thine Heart,
And ly down boldly by me.
VII.
Then every where the Bells shall Ring,
Whilst all to black is Turning,
And every where all Quires shall Sing,
As natures self were Mourning.
Yet we hereafter shall be Found,
By Destinyes night Placeing,
Making (like Flowers) love under Ground,
Whose Roots are still Embracing.
SONG X.
I.
Prithee be blithe! sit not so Sadly,
Troth! this dull-humour makes thee look Badly,
Love thou thy Friend, take this Canary,
Sweet Dispositions seldom should Vary,
Poor Soul! alas!
He wants his Glass;
Here is it
That Sharpes the wit,
And makes us Cheary.
II.
One ounce of Myrth's worth ten of moaning,
There Is little joy or pleasure in groaning,
Have thou spent all the Cash in thy Pocket?
Or have a Member not well in Socket?
Thoughts of this kind
Put out of mind!
Do not ken,
Gentlemen
Must Bouze and Smoke it?
III.
It Is to the King! take off the Bowl-full,
And be thou rather Drunken than Doleful.
From a good Health let us never be shrinking,
We do not purpose pay it with thinking.
Pox on this Vein!
Let Us quaff amain!
Let not Wine
Fall and pine
For want of Drinking.
IV.
If Melancholy make aparition,
Oh! let the Vintner be thy Physician.
If thou perceive a troublesome motion,
Take off thy Sack, for that is the best Potion.
And when thou art in,
Never fear thy skin!
Rather than
Want a dram,
Gives an whole Ocean.
SONG XI.
I.
FOrtune is blind
And Beau^y unkind,
The Devil take them both!
One is a Witch,
And t'other's a Bitch,
In neither's Faith or Troth:
There Is hazard in hap,
Deceit in a Lap,
But no fraud in a Brimmer;
If truth in the bottom Lie,
Thence to redeem her,
We'll drain a whole Ocean dry.
II.
Honor's a Toy,
For Fools a Decoy,
Beset with care and fear;
And that (I wuss)
Kills many a Puss
Before her clymacht year:
But Freedom and Mirth,
Create a new Birth,
While Sack's the Aqua Vitae
That Vigor and Spirit gives
Liquor Almighty!
Whereby the poor Mortal lives.
III.
Let us be blyth
In spite of Death's Sithe!
And with an Heart and half
Drink to our Friends,
And think of no ends,
But keep us sound and safe;
While Healths do go round
No Malady's found,
The Maw sick in the Morning,
For want of it is wonted strain,
Is as a warning,
To double it over again.
IV.
Let us maintain
Our Traffic with Spain
And both the Indies slight;
Give us their Wines,
Let them keep theit Mines,
We Will pardon Eighty Eight;
There Is more certain Wealth
Secured from stealth
In one Pipe of Canary,
Than in an unfortunate Isle:
Let us be wary,
We do not our selves beguile.
SONG XII.
I.
LOve is a Bauble;
No man is able
To say, it is This, or it is That:
An idle Passion,
Of such a fashion,
It Is like I cannot tell what.
II.
Fair in the Cradle,
Foul in the Saddle,
Always too cold, or too hot;
An errant Liar,
Fed by desire;
It is, and yet it is not.
III.
Love is a Fellow
Clad all in yellow,
The Canker-worm of the mind;
A privy mischief,
And such a sly Thief,
No man knows where him to find.
IV.
Love is a Wonder;
It Is here, and it is yonder,
It Is common to all men, we know;
A very Cheater,
Every ones better;
Then hang him, and let him go.
SONG XIII.
I.
I Love my Love, she not me,
Because I am so poor:
But, poor or rich, she has my heart,
And shall have evermore.
II.
I went unto my true Loves Gate,
And knocked at the Ring;
So ready was my own, her self,
To rise, and let me in.
III.
I looked in my true Loves face,
(...) she seemed but wan;
I took (...) in mine arms so wide,
And carried her to bed again.
IV.
Where all the forepart of the night
Together close we lay,
And all the latter-part of the night
She slept in mine arms till day.
V.
But cursed be that little Tirry-Cock
That crow'd in the morning so soon;
I thought it had been the dawning of the day,
When 'twas but the light of the Moon.
VI.
Then up I rose, and donn'd my Clothes,
And walked it over the Plain;
Wishing my self on my true Loves Bed,
And her in mine arms again.
SONG XIV.
I.
I Am a cunning Constable,
And a bag of Warrants I have here,
To press sufficient Men, and able,
At Horn-Castle to appear;
But nowadays they are grown so cunning,
That hearing of this Martial strife,
They all away from hence are running;
Where I miss the Man, I Will press the Wife.
II.
Ho! who is at home? Lo! here am I!
Good morrow, Neighbor. Welcome, Sir.
Where is your Husband? Why truly
He Is gone abroad, a Journey far.
Do you not know when he comes back?
See how these Cowards fly for life!
The King for Soldiers must not lack;
If I miss the Man, I Will take the Wife.
III.
Show me by what Authority
You do it? Pray, Sir, let me know.
It is sufficient for to see,
The Warrant hangs in bag below.
Then pull it out, if it be strong,
With you I will not stand at strife.
My Warrant is as broad as long;
If I miss the Man, I Will press the Wife.
IV.
Now you have pressed me, and are gone,
Please you, but let me know your name,
That when my Husband he comes home,
I may declare to him the same.
My name is Captain Ward, I say,
I never feared man in all my life:
The King for Soldiers must not stay;
Missing the Man, I Will press the Wife.
SONG XV.
I.
COme, dear heart, and let us dally
Underneath the shady Tree:
Why should thou stand shall I? shall I?
When there is no man here to see?
II
He was full of amorous sporting,
Being in a lusty Vein:
She took it for his way of Courting,
And gave him kiss for kiss again.
III.
Ah! ah! ah! thou will undo me,
Oh! so vile and rude you are:
Yet I cannot choose but love thee,
'Cause thou came to me so far.
IV.
Love to me was but a stranger,
Fearing lest I might be slain:
But now, I see there is no danger,
Come and kiss me once again.
V.
Her Shoes were of the Spanish fashion,
Her Stockins of that Country Silk,
The like there were not in the Nation;
Her Smock was whiter than the Milk.
SONG XVI.
I.
THere was a London Gentlewoman
That loved a Country man, a;
And she did desire his company
A little now and than, a. Fa, la, etc.
II.
This man he was a Hemp-dresser,
And dressing was his Trade, a;
And he does kiss the Mistress, Sir,
And now and then the Maid, a. Fa, la, etc.
III.
He took up her Petty-coat,
And would take up her Smock, a;
And went unto the Parlor-door,
That he her Hemp might knock, a. Fa, la, etc.
IV.
He held up his Boitle then,
And she set down the Block, a;
And there he fell to work indeed,
With knick a knack, knick a knack, knock, a. Fa, la, etc.
SONG XVII.
I.
SItting beyond a Riverside,
Parthenia thus to Cloe cried,
While from the fair Nymphs eyes apace
Another stream o'r-clouds her beauteous Face,
Happy Nymph is she that can
So little trust to faithless man.
II.
Often the perfideous things would cry,
They love, they bleed, they burn, they die:
But if they are absent half a day,
Nay, if they stay but one poor hour away,
No more they die, no more complain,
But, like unconstant Wretches, live again.
SONG XVIII.
I.
WOuld God it were Holy Day,
Hey derry down, down derry;
That with my Love I might go play,
With oh! my heart is merry:
My whole delight
Is in her sight:
Would God I had her Company, her Company,
Hey down down, derry derry down.
II.
My Love is fine, my Love is fair,
Hey derry down, etc.
No Maid may well with her compare
In Kent or Canterbury;
From her my Love
Shall never remove:
Would God I had, etc.
III.
To see her laugh, to see her smile,
Hey derry down, etc.
Does all my sorrows quite beguile,
And makes my heart full merry;
No grief does grow
Where she does go:
Would God I had, etc.
IV.
When I do meet her on the Green,
Aey derry down, etc.
Methinks she looks like Beauties Queen,
Which makes my heart full merry;
Then I her greet
With kisses sweet:
Would God I had, etc.
V.
My Love comes not of churlish kind,
Hey derry down, etc.
But bears a loving courteous mind,
Which makes my heart full merry;
She is not coy,
She is my Joy:
Would God I had, etc.
VI.
Till Sunday comes, farewell, my Dear,
Hey derry down, etc.
When we do meet, we'll make good Cheer,
And then we will be merry.
If thou love me,
I will love Thee,
And still delight thy Company, thy Company,
Hey down down, derry derry down.
SONG XIX.
I.
A Pretty Jest I will you tell,
Of The guelding of the Devil of Hell.
There was a Baker of Mansfield Town,
To Nottingham Market he was bound;
And riding under a Willow there,
The Baker sung with a lusty cheer.
II.
The Baker's Horse was plump and sound,
And worth, in judgment, full five pound;
His skin was smooth, his flesh was fat,
His Master was well pleased thereat,
And therefore sings so merrily,
As he was riding on the way.
III.
But as he rode over the Hill,
There meeting with the Devil of Hell
Oh Baker, Baker! then cried he,
How came thy Horse so fat to be?
These be the words the Baker did say
Because his Stones are cut away.
IV.
Then, quoth the Devil, if it be so,
Thou shall gueld me before thou go:
First, tie thy Horse to yonder Tree,
And be thou ready to gueld me.
The Baker had a knife for the nones,
Wherewith to cut out th'Devils stones.
V.
The Baker, as it came to pass,
In have alighted from his Horse;
And as the Devil on's back did lay,
The Baker cut his Stones away;
Which put the Devil to great pain,
And made him to cry out amain.
VI.
Oh! quoth the Devil, beshrew thy heart!
Thou do not feel how I do smart;
And for the Deed that thou have done,
I will revenged be again;
And underneath this Green-wood-Tree
Next Market Day I will gueld thee.
VII.
The Baker then but little said,
But at his heart was sore afraid,
And longer there he would not stay,
But he rode home another way,
And coming to his Wife, did tell
How he had guelt the Devil of Hell.
VIII.
Moreover, to his Wife he told
A thing which made her heart full cold:
A grievous word as he did say,
That he would gueld me next Market Day:
To whom quoth Goodwife, without doubt,
I Would rather both your eyes were out.
IX.
For then all people far and near
That knows thee will both mock and jeer,
And good Wives they will sooff and brawl,
And stoneless Guelding will thee call:
Then hold content, and be thou wise,
And I Will some pretty trick devise.
X.
I Will make the Devil change his Note,
Do thou but lend to me thy Coat,
Thy Hose and Doublet eke also,
And I like to thy self will go,
And warrant thee next Market Day
To fright the Devil quite away.
XI.
The Bakers Wife thus being dressed,
With Market-Bread upon her Beast,
She goes to N^tti^^ham brave Town,
To sell her Bread, both white and brown;
And as she rode over the Hill,
She met there with two Devils of Hell.
XII.
A little Devil and another,
As they played both together:
Oh! quoth one of them, right fain,
Here comes the Baker on amain;
And be thou well, or be thou woe,
I will gueld thee before thou go.
XIII.
The Bakers Wife to the Devil did say,
Sir, I was guelded yesterday.
Oh! quoth the Devil, I mean to see,
Pulling her Coats up to the knee:
So looking upward from the ground,
Oh! there he spied a terrible wound.
XIV.
Ah! quoth the Devil, now I see
He was not cunning guelded thee;
For when he had cut out thy Stones,
He should have closed up the wounds:
But if thou wilt stay a little space,
I Will fetch some Salve to cure the place.
XV.
He had gone but a little way,
When up her Belly creept a Flea:
The little Devil seeing that,
He with his paw did giv't a pat:
Which made the Goodwife for to start,
And out she let a rowzing Fart.
XVI.
O! quoth the Devil, thy life's not long,
Thy breath it smells so wondrous strong;
Then go thy way, and make thy will,
This wound is past all humane skill:
Be gone, be gone, make no delay,
For here no longer shall thou stay.
XVII.
The Goodwife at this News was glad,
And left the Devil almost mad;
And when she to her Husband came,
She gladly told to him the same,
How she had cozened the Devil of Hell,
So for to make a Jest full well.
SONG XX.
I.
YOu Rural Goddesses,
That Woods and Fields possess,
Assist me with your skill,
That may direct my Quill
More jocundly to express
The mirth and delight,
Both morning and night,
On Mountain, or in Dale,
Of them who choose
This Trade to use,
And through cold Dews
Do never refuse
To carry the Milking Pail.
II.
The bravest Lasses gay,
Live not so merry as they;
In honest civil sort
They make each other sport,
As they trudge on the way:
Come fair or foul weather,
They Are fearful of neither,
Their Courages never quail:
In wet and dry,
Though winds be high,
And dark the Sky,
They never deny
To carry the Milking Pail.
III.
Their hearts are free from care;
They never do despair,
Whatever do befall,
They bravely bear out all,
And Fortunes frowns out-dare.
They pleasantly sing
To welcome the Spring,
Against Heaven they never rail.
If Grass will grow,
Their thanks they show,
And Frost or Snow,
They merrily go
Along with the Milking Pail.
IV.
Base idleness they do scorn,
They rise very early in the morn,
And walk into the Fields,
Where pretty Birds do yield
Brave Music on every Thorn:
The Linnet and Thrush
Do sing on each Bush,
And the dulcid Nightingale
Her Note does strain,
In a jocund vain
To entertain
That worthy Train
Which carry the Milking Pail.
V.
Their labor does health preserve,
No Doctors rules they observe,
While others too nice
In taking their advice,
Look always as if they would starve:
Their meat is digested,
They never are molested,
No sickness does them assail;
Their time is spent
In merriment,
While Limbs are lent
They are content,
To carry the Milking Pail.
VI.
Those Lasses nice and strange,
That keep shops in the Change,
Sit pricking of Clouts,
And giving of flouts,
They seldom abroad do range:
Then comes the Green Sickness,
And changes their likeness,
All this is for want of good sale;
But it is not so,
As proof does show,
By them that go
In Frost and Snow
To carry the Milking Pail.
VII.
If they any Sweethearts have
That do their affections crave,
Their privilege is this,
Which many others miss,
They can give them welcome brave:
With them they walk,
And pleasantly talk,
With a Bottle of Wine or Ale;
The gentle Cow
Does them allow,
As they know how,
God speed the Plough,
And bless the Milking Pail.
VIII.
Upon the first of May,
With Garland fresh and gay,
With Mirth and Music sweet,
For such a season meet,
They pass their time away:
They dance away sorrow,
And all the day through
Their legs do never fail;
Yet they nimbly
Their feet do ply,
And bravely try
The Victory,
In honor of the Milking Pail.
IX.
If any think that I
Do practice Flattery,
In seeking thus to raise
The merry Milk-maids praise,
I Will to them thus reply,
It is their Desert
Inviteth my Art
To study this pleasant Tale,
In their defense,
Whose Innocence
And Providence
Gets honest Pence
Out of the Milking Pail.
SONG XXI. CHEVY-CHASE. By Order of the Bishop of London.
I.
GOD prosper long our Noble King,
our lives and safeties all,
A woeful hunting once there did
in Chevy-Chase befall.
II.
To drive the Deer with Hound and Horn
Earl Piercy took his way;
The child may rue that is unborn
the hunting of that day.
III.
The stout Earl of Northumberland
a vow to God did make,
His pleasure in the Scottish Woods
three Summers days to take.
IV.
The chiefest Hearts in Chevy-Case
to kill and bear away;
These tidings to Earl Douglas came,
in Scotland, where he lay.
V.
Who sent Earl Piercy present word,
he would prevent his Sport:
The English Earl, not fearing this,
did to the Woods resort.
VI.
With fifteen hundred Bowe-men bold,
all chosen men of might,
Who knew full well in time of need
to aim their Shafts aright.
III.
The gallant Greyhounds swiftly ran,
to chase the fallow Deer;
On Monday they began to hunt,
when daylight did appear.
VIII.
And long before high-noon they had
an hundred fat Bucks slain:
Then having dined, the Drovers went
to rouse them up again.
IX.
The Bowe-men mustred on the Hills,
well able to endure;
Their back-sides all with special care
that day were guarded sure.
X.
The Hounds ran swiftly through the Woods,
the nimble Deer to take;
And with their cries the hills and dales
an Echo shrill did make.
XI.
Lord Piercy to the Quarry went,
to view the tender Deer:
Quoth he, Earl Douglas promised
this day to meet me here.
XII.
But if I thought he would not come,
no longer would I stay.
With that a brave young Gentleman
thus to the Earl did say.
XIII.
Lo, yonder does Earl Douglas come,
his men in Armor bright,
Full twenty hundred Scottish Spears,
all marching in our sight.
XIV.
All men of pleasant Tividale,
fast by the River Tweed.
Then cease your sport, E. Piercy said,
and take your Bows with speed.
XV.
And now with me, my Contrymen,
your courage forth advance;
For never was there Champion yet
in Scotland or in France,
XVI.
That ever did on Horseback come,
but if my hap it were,
I durst encounter man for man,
with him to break a Spear.
XVII.
Earl Douglas on a milk-white Steed,
most like a Baron bold,
Rode foremost of the Company,
whose Armor shone like Gold.
XVIII.
Show me, he said, whose men you be
that hunt so boldly here,
That without my consent do chase
and kill my fallow Deer.
XIXI.
The man that first did answer make
was Noble Piercy, he,
Who said, We list not to declare,
Nor show whose men we be.
XX.
Yet we will spend our dearest blood,
the chiefest Hearts to slay.
Then Douglas swore a solemn Oath,
and thus in rage did say;
XXI.
Ever thus I will out-braved be,
one of us two shall die:
I know thee well, an Earl thou art,
Lord Piercy, so am I.
XXII.
But, trust me Piercy, pity it were,
and great offense, to kill
Any of these our harmless men,
for they have done no ill.
XXIII.
Let thou and I the Battle try,
and set our men aside:
Accursed be he, Lord Piercy said,
by whom it is denied.
XXIV.
Then stepped a gallant 'Squire forth,
Witherington was his name,
Who said, he would not have it told
to Henry our King, for shame,
XXV.
That ever my Captain fought on foot,
and I stood looking on:
You be two Earls, said Witherington,
and I a'Squire alone.
XXVI.
I Will do the best that do I may,
while I have power to stand;
While I have power to weild my Sword
I Will fight with heart and hand.
XXVII.
Our English Archers bent their Bows,
their hearts were good and true;
At the first flight of Arrows sent,
full threescore Scots they slew.
XXVIII.
To drive the Deer with hound and horn
Earl Douglas bad the bent;
A Captain moved with mickle pride,
the Spears to shivers sent.
XXIX.
They closed full fast on every side,
no slackness there was found,
And many a gallant Gentleman
lay gasping on the ground.
XXX.
O Christ! it was great grief to see,
and likewise for to hear,
The cries of men lying in their gore,
and scattered here and there.
XXXI.
At last these two stout Earls did meet,
like Captains of great might;
Like Lions moved they laid on load,
and made a cruel fight.
XXXII.
They fought until they both did sweat
with Swords of tempered steel,
Until the blood, like drops of Rain,
they trickling down did feel.
XXXIII.
Yield thee, Lord Piercy, Douglas said,
in faith I will thee bring
Where thou shall high advanced be
by James our Scottish King.
XXXIV.
Thy Ransom I will freely give,
and thus report of thee,
Thou art the most courageous Knight
that ever I did see.
XXXV.
No, Douglas, quoth Earl Piercy then,
thy proffer I do scorn;
I will not yield to any Scot
that ever yet was born.
XXXVI.
With that there came an Arrow keen
out of an English Bow,
Which struck Earl Douglas to the heart,
a deep and deadly blow.
XXXVII.
Who never spoke more words than these
fight on my merry men all;
For why my life is at an end,
Lord Piercy sees my fall.
XXXVIII.
Then leaving life, Earl Piercy took
the dead man by the hand,
And said, Earl Douglas, for thy life
would I had lost my land.
XXXIX
O Christ! my very heart does bleed
with sorrow for thy sake;
For sure a more renowned Knight
Such mischance did ever take.
XL.
A Knight amongst the Scots there was,
which saw Earl Douglas die,
And in his wrath did vow revenge
upon the Earl Piercy.
XLI.
Sir Hugh Montgomery was he called,
who with a Spear most bright,
Well mounted on a gallant Steed,
ran fiercely through the fight:
XLII.
And past the English Archers all,
without all dread or fear,
And through Earl Piercy's body then
he thrust his hateful Spear,
XLIII.
With such a vehement force and might
he did his body gore,
The Spear went through the other side
a large Cloth-yard and more.
XLIV.
So thus did both these Nobles die,
whose courage none could stain.
An English Archer then perceived
the Noble Earl was slain:
XLV.
He had a Bow bent in his hand,
made of a trusty Tree;
An Arrow of a Cloth-yard long
up to the head drew he:
XLVI.
Against Sir Hugh Montgomery
so right his shaft he set,
The grey-goose-wing that was thereon
in his heart blood was wet.
XLVII.
This fight did last from break of day,
till setting of the Sun;
For when they rung the evening Bell,
the battle scarce was done.
XLVIII.
With the Earl Piercy there was slain
Sir John of Ogerton,
Sir Robert Ratcliff, and Sir John,
Sir James that bold Baron.
XLIX.
And with Sir George and good Sir James
both Knights of good account,
Good Sir Ralph Rabby there was slain,
whose prowess did surmount.
L.
For Witherington needs must I wail,
as one in doleful dumps;
For when his legs were smitten off,
he fought upon his stumps.
LI.
And with Earl Douglas there was slain
Sir Hugh Montgomery,
Sir Charles Currel, that from the field
one foot would never fly.
LII.
Sir Charles Murrel of Ratcliff too,
his Sisters Son was he;
Sir David Lamb so well esteemed,
Yet saved could not be.
LIII.
And the Lord Markwel in likewise
did with Earl Douglas die:
Of twenty hundred Scottish Spears,
scarce fifty five did fly.
LIVE
Of fifteen hundred English men,
went home but fifty three,
The rest were slain in Chevy-Chase
under the Green-Wood tree.
LV.
Next day did many widows come,
their Husbands to bewail,
They washed their wounds in brinish tears,
but all would not prevail.
LVI.
Their bodies bathed in purple blood,
they bore with them away,
They kissed them dead a thousand times,
when they were clad in clay.
LVII.
This news was brought to Edenburg,
Where Scotlands King did reign,
That brave Earl Douglas suddenly,
was with an Arrow slain,
LVIII.
O heavy news King James did say,
Scotland can witness be,
I have not any Captain more,
of such account as he.
LIX.
Like tidings to King Henry came,
within as short a space,
That Peircy of Northumberland,
was slain in Chevy-Chase.
LX.
Now God be with him said our King,
sith't will no better be,
I trust I have within my Realm,
five hundred as good as he.
LXI.
Yet shall not Scot nor Scotland say,
but I will vengeance take,
And be revenged on them all,
for brave Earl Pircies sake.
LXII.
This vow full well the K. performed,
after an Humble Down,
In one day fifty Knights were slain
with Lords of great renown.
LXIII.
And of the rest of small account
did many hundreds dye,
Thus ended the hunting of Chevy-Chase
made by the Earl Piercy.
LXIV.
God save the King and bless the Land
in plenty, joy, and Peace,
And grant henceforth that foul debate,
'twixt Noble men may cease.
SONG XXII.
I.
SIR Francis, Sir Francis his own Son,
Sir William, Sir Thomas, and all did run,
Then came my Lord of Southhampton,
And showed himself a gallant Man.
II.
Then came the Chamberlain with his Staff,
And all the People 'gan to Laugh,
At length the Queen began to speak,
You Are welcome home Sir Francis Drake.
III.
Ye Nobles all of British Blood,
Why Sail ye not over the Ocean Flood?
In truth you are not worth Filberd,
Compared to Sir Humphry Gilberd.
IV.
For he went out on a Rainy day,
To New Foundland he took his way,
Most Rare and Comely to be seen,
But never came back, (God save the Queen.
SONG XXIII.
I.
I Will tell you all, both great and small,
I tell you all truly,
That we have cause, and very great cause,
For to Lament and Cry,
Fie, Oh! fie, oh! fie, oh! fie!
Fie on thee Cruel Death!
For thou have taken away from us!
Our Queen Elizabeth.
II.
Thou may have taken other folks,
That better might be mist,
And have let our Queen alone,
Who loved no Popish Priest,
In Peace she ruled all this Land,
Beholding unto no Man,
And did the Pope of Rome withstand,
And yet was but a Woman.
III.
A Woman said I? nay that is more,
Then any one can tell,
So fair she was, so chaste she was,
That no one knew it well,
With that, from France came Monsier over,
A purpose for to woe her,
Yet still she lived, and Died a Maid,
Do what they could unto her.
IV.
She never acted any ill thing,
That made her Conscience prick her,
Nor never would submit to him,
That called is Christ's Vicar,
But rather chose courageously,
To Fight under Christ's Banner
Against Pope and Turk and King of Spain,
And all that durst withstand her.
V.
But if that I had Argus Eyes,
They were to few to weep,
For our Queen Elizabeth,
That now is fallen a sleep,
A sleep indeed where she shall rest,
Until the day of Doom,
And then shall rise unto the shame
Of the great Pope of Rome.
SONG XXIV. An Ode.
UNder 500 Kings three Kingdoms groan,
Go Finch dissolve them Charles is in the Throne,
And by th'Grace of God will Reign alone.
II.
What will the Commons have? The Royal line,
Heaven does dispose of. It Is not theirs or mine,
But his by whom Kings Rule, and are Divine.
III.
I represent the King of Kings who gave
The Crown, the Sword, the Scepter that I have,
I am Gods Servant, not the Peoples slave.
IV.
Their Frantic Votes, and mad Resolves I hate,
I know a better way to heal the State,
Then to Sin rashly and Repent too late.
SONG XXV.
I.
GReat Alexanders Horse, Bucephalus by name,
Brave Writers have inrol'd, within the books of fame,
But Poor Will Pickerings Mare,
So far she did excel,
She never run the Race,
But she bore away the Bell.
But for Tyhe, whyhee, hrk, prp, for Caper and Career,
All Holland could not show
You such another Mare.
II
But now the News is come,
His bonny Mare is Dead,
Whereat he stampts and swears,
He had rather have lost his head,
But for Tyhee, etc.
III.
Her foremost shoos she gave,
Unto some Popish Fool,
To carry him to Rome,
For a Pardon for his Soul
But for Tyhee, etc.
IV.
Her hinder shoos that had
Played many a Jadish trick
She gave unto cursed Wives,
Their Husbands used to kick.
But for Tyhee, etc,
SONG XXVI.
I.
FRom the fair Lavinian shore,
I your Market come to store
Muse not that so far off I dwell,
And come here my ware to sell,
Such is the sacred hunger of Gold!
Then come to my Pack
While I cry
What do ye lack,
Or what do you buy!
For here it is to be sold.
II.
Though thy Father thee before,
Neither arms, or Scutcheon bore,
Or thy Gentry been as young,
As the Rose that is newly blown;
Can thou find in thine heart to part with thy Gold!
Then come to me (Lad)
Thou shall have,
What thy Dad
Yet never gave,
For Heraldry's to be sold.
III.
Madam for your wrinckled face,
Here Is Complexion it to grace.
Which if your earnest be but small
It takes away the virtues all.
But if your Palms are anointed with Gold
Then you shall seem
Like a Queen
of fiftteen,
Though you are threescore years old.
SONG XXVII.
I.
THou art not fair for all thy red and white,
Nor all those Rosy Ornaments in thee,
Thou art not sweet, nor made for mere delight,
Nor sweet nor fair unless thou pity me,
I will not, I will not sooth thy fancies, thou shall prove
So ill a Creature, no Man thee shall love.
II.
Neither Love thou me, nor think thou to allure,
My thoughts with beauty were it more divine,
Thy smiles, and kisses I cannot endure,
I Will not be wrapped up in those Eyes of thine,
Now show, now show it, if thou art a Woman right,
Embrace and Kiss, and love me in despite.
SONG. XXVIII.
I.
WHY so pale and wand fond Lover?
Prithee why so pale?
If looking well thou can not move her,
Will looking ill prevail?
Prithee why so pale?
II.
Why so dull and mute, young Sinner?
Prithee why so mute?
If speaking well thou can not win her,
Can saying nothing do it,
Prithee why so mute?
III.
Quit, quit, for shame? this will not move her
This cannot take her,
If of her self she will not Love,
Nothing can make her,
The Devil take her.
SONG XXIX.
IF any so wise is,
That sack he despises.
Let him drink his small bear and be sober
While we drink Sack and sing,
As if it were spring,
He shall droop like the trees in October.
Be sure over night,
If this dog do you bit,
You take it henceforth for a warning.
soon as out of bed,
To settle your head,
Take an hair of his tail in the morning.
Then be not so silly,
To follow old Lilly,
For there is nothing but sack that can tune us.
Let his ne assuescas,
Be put in his Cap-Case,
And sing bibito vinum jejunus.
SONG XXX.
I.
COme Boys fill us a Bumper,
We Will make the Nation roar,
She Is grown sick of a Rumper,
That stick's on the old score,
Pox a Phanaticks we will rout 'em,
They do thirst for our blood.
We Will raise our taxes without'em,
And Drink for the Nations good.
II.
Charge the Pottles and Gallons,
And bring the Hoggshead in.
We Will begin with a tall one,
And Rummers to our King.
Round a round with a fresh one,
Let no man balke his Wine,
We Will drink to the next in Succession,
And keep in the right line.
SONG XXXI.
Dialogue. Strephon. COme my Daphne! come away!
We do wast the Crystal day:

Daphne. It Is Strephon call's, what would my love?

Strephon. Come follow to the myrtle Grove,
Where Venus shall prepare,
Fresh Chaplets for thine hair.

Daphne. Were I shut up within a tree,
I Would rend my bark to follow thee.

Strephon. My Shepardess make have,
The Minutes slide too fast.
In those Cooler shades will I,
Blind as Cupid kiss thine eye,
In thy bosom then I Will stray,
In such warm Snow who will not lose his way.
Chorus. We Will laugh and leave this world behind,
And God's themselves that see,
Shall Envy thee and me,
But never know such Joys,
When they Embrace a Deity.

SONG XXXII.
OH the merry Christ-Church Bells,
One, two, three four, five, six,
They are so woundy great,
So wondrous sweet
And they trowl so merrily, merrily.
Oh the first and second Bell
That every day at four and ten
Cries come come, come come, come to Prayers,
And the Verger troops before the Dean.
III.
Tingle, Tingle, Ting, goes the small bell at nine
To call the Beerers home,
But there is never a man
Will leave his can,
Till he hears the mighty Tom.
SONG XXXIII.
CAst away care and merrily sing,
There is a time for every thing,
He that plays at his work,
And works at his play,
Neither keeps working nor holyday;
Set business aside and let us be merry,
And drown these sad thoughts in Canary and Sherry
SONG XXXIV.
FIE nay prithee John
Do not quarrel Man,
Let Us be Merry and drink about
You Are a Rogue! you cheated me,
I Will prov't before this Company,
I care not a farthing Sr. for all you are so stout:
Sr. you lie I scorn the word,
From any man that wears a sword,
For all you huff I care not a turd,
Or who cares for you?
SONG XXXV.
THE name of Lord
Shall be abhord,
For every man's a brother,
No reason that
In Church or State,
One man should rule another.
When we have thrown,
The Bishops down,
And leveld each degree.
The Sisters soon
Shall be our own,
And Hey then up go we.
SONG. XXXVI.
I.
SInce all the Features of Love that adorn thee
And thy Curious face must fail,
And those that were thine admirers shall scorn thee,
Beauty less pleasant is the frail;
Thy blooming sweets will soon decay,
And never reflourish to a second May:
The lease thou had of Grace and Hue,
Nature will never, never more renew.
II.
Now that thy Beautyes, are ripened to Harvest,
And all the Fruits of love in their prime,
And midst of plentiful Dainties thou starvest,
And do refuse the presents of time;
In one free Kiss, thy self resign,
And I will render my Soul up to thine:
Thus (Fairest) shall we two make one,
Contracted by a Mistique Union.
SONG XXXVII. Dear Friend.
I.
THE King and the Prelates,
Will Cudgel the Zealots,
With Crosier, and Scepter,
Good Master Praeceptor.
And send them to whence came their Bible,
Those wights in the Gate House
(As Berkenhead Ga't us)
Who thought to besquiter ye
With the old Presbytery,
Will hang ere't be long, it is possible.
II.
They Will serve to help Squire
Dun, out of the mire.
Who be'gan as a Friend
To bring to an end,
Both Covenant and Covenanters,
He has but two ways
(As his Worship now says)
For those that come after
To Hang, or cross Water,
To Plant or Transplant, our Supplanters.
III.
I hoped from your letter,
To have had a better
Account of the man,
That again and again,
Does hit us in the teeth from the Pulpit,
Since Pelf from the Bore
Can make me no more
A man of the Law
Then was Jack Straw,
Qui legem ac Jura revulsit.
A recruit must quicken the dull wit.
SONG XXXVIII.
I.
MY Dearest sweet ly down by me,
With thine Enameled ckeek to mine,
While I my Soul breath into thee,
And every kiss returns me thine.
II.
Our Bodies we will in Pleasures lull,
And active Dalliances prove;
For why? the face is not more full,
Of Beauty than I am of Love.
III.
My willing Arms and Thighs shall clip,
And Ivy-like thy limbs entwine,
When from thy Balsom-mouth I Will sip
A sure restoring Medicine.
IV.
And in the Respites of our sport,
Thou shall be-pearl thy Diamond Eye
Cause Nature made her sweet so short,
And shame me to a fresh supply.
V.
My busy hand and lips shall rove,
Over all the sweets thy beauties wear
And in thine Hony-suckle-grove,
I Will distill what I gathered there,
VI.
Thy bold, and thy provoking touch,
Shall Loves Alimbeck so apply,
And show thy Chymick skill is such,
That I must melt in Love and Die.
VII
And being thus bereft of breath,
Lovers shall at my Tomb appear,
Wishing themselves no worse a Death,
Nor better life, then I had here.
VIII.
Ladies shall sighing drop a Tear,
As with pure Love and Pity moved,
That such a constant Servant (here,)
Should die because he over Loved.
POEM XXXIX. On the Market in St. Paul's Churchyard, set up by Tichborn, and
Removed by Sir Rich. Brown Knight. and B. Lord Mayor of London.
Sacer hic locus est, procul hinc procul ite prophani.
THe House of Prayer was made a Den of Thieves,
Heavens forgive us! lets amend our Lives!
A Scourge befall that Mony-changing Crew,
Where neither God, nor Caesar has his due!
Defiling sacred ground with Market stuff,
As if the Streets had not been broad enough,
To make a Burial-Place, a place of Trade,
It is a kind of Living by the Dead,
Me thinks the grave should open, and the sprights,
Of such as sinned by measure and by Weights,
Should fright these Sons of Traffic from their bound
Who with unhallowed feet profaned their ground,
It Is well their Spirits are laid: Tichburn's a Guest,
Like an ill Conscience, never would let them rest,
What could we hope for, when we could not have,
Quiet, within a solitary grave?
But oh! how just is Heaven! his doom is red,
No place among the Living, or the Dead;
Perch with thy Brethren in Iniquity!
A just Reward for all thy Simony!
Whilst Pious Brown deserves our thanks at least,
That when we are dead, our bones shall be at Rest.

SONNET XLII.
I.
REproach me not heretofore,
I only freedom did adore,
And bragged that none tho kind and fair,
My loss of heart could er'e repair
Since I most willingly do yield
To Cloris beauty all the field
II.
With greater joy I now resign,
My freedom then thou yet keep'st thine.
And am resolved constant to prove
Though thy neglect transcend my love.
Strange charms they are that make me burn,
Without the hope of a return.
III.
Thine eyes the greatest heart out braves,
And at once pleases and enslaves,
Thou would not sure else see in them,
An Act which now thou do Condemn.
Who then shall that assault abide,
When fate does strike on either side.
IV.
Thy Charming voice is much more free,
Then after it thy hearers be.
Nay thy voice is so firm and Clear
That it inspires love through the Ear.
Who then can hope for a defense,
Since thou have chrams for every sense.
V.
I must confess a while I strove
With reasons to resist my love.
As Saints sometimes against death do pray,
Though It be to heaven the only way.
It Is Cloris only has the skill,
To make me blessed against my will.
VI.
Nor will I so much as endure,
To think inconstancy a Cure.
For were I to that sin but bent,
Here would it prove my punishment.
Where to adore I must Confess,
Is better then elsewhere success.
VII.
To see thee and not be in love
A wonder like thy self would prove.
Thy charms by virtue and by Art,
Do each of them deserve an Heart,
So that my sorrow is not small,
I have but one to pay them all.
POEM LXIII. The new Year. To the ever Honored Mrs. M. H.
Madam
WHen I perceive the lease bund tenants prove,
Their vn-mal'd Fowls, fit Emblems of their love.
(Which they Coop up, like the Tyth-Pig I mean,
Not to approve in fat, but keep them lean.)
I fear, when I with Annual Tribute come
(A single offering, not an Hecatombe.)
And starvling verses on your Alter lay,
In lieu of what the Indyes cannot pay;
That in a just dislike, as of that Crew,
You will conclude that I Am ill guisted too.
But I assume the Complement they make.,
-- Madam, I wish 'twere better for your sake
But as it is --
Live long and Happy! that your Age may be,
As a Continual lasting Jubilee!
And be it made the business of your life,
To prove the Joys of a Beloved Wife.
Yet never know the same! and may all those,
Sorrows Contrived for you, befall your Foes!
And let your Marriage Computation run,
With even Feet, for every year a Sun,
And what we do in other Children call,
A Dutious-Love, in them be Natural!
Last having left a fair posterity,
To stock the Earth, ascend unto the Sky!
Where you shall reap the Joys of Heavens store,
When years shall cease, and time shall be no more.
SONG XLIV: Mock.
I.
FUll twenty times over and twenty to that,
I musing have wondered what it is you would be at,
You pine and look pale like the liquors that is flat.
For he is a cold Drinker,
That now will turn skinker.
Since thus runs the play,
Since thus runs the play,
If you sit up all night you are ready next day,
Since thus runs the play,
If you sit up all night you are ready next day.
II.
There Is a Pipe ready Broached that would not be shut,
With Legions of bottles prepared for the gut,
If you give but your mind to it you will swallow a But.
Then stand not so dully
But laver the Gully,
With beer-bowl in fist,
With beer-bowl in fist,
If you charge him but well you may hit whom you is it.
With beer-bowl in fist,
III.
Some idle Companions when with them you sit,
Will talk and fly high as if they had all the wit
But alas it appears there the Devil a bit.
Their Biscuit Jests after
They Have steept in their laughter,
With their pipes being broke,
With their pipes being broke.
And their Tobacco once out, they will vanish in smoke
With their pipes etc.
IV.
Some stately proud high Boys will rant it and call
As if they would tipple the devil and all,
But stand to them stiffly they will easily fall.
Then to it nere fear them
Set foot and come near them
By drinking about,
By drinking about.
Be their heads never so empty they can never hold it out,
By drinking about,
Be there heads never so empty they can nere hold it out.
V.
Some Punyes whose Cheeks are with blushes over laid
To fuddle a gallon will not be afraid,
Put them to it and but tell them they drink like a maid
Then cry but have at it,
Lads will you be at it.
If e're they refuse,
If e're they refuse,
To water as thou do or I let them choose,
If e're they refuse
To water as thou do or I let them choose.
SONG XLV. Mock.
I.
GOod Gaffer stand a loofe
With your tinder-box hoof,
That strikes fire at each stroke
With a fume that choke
One sooner then the vapor of matc^
Your stamps and your shrugs,
Your claps and your hugs,
Your salute with a stroke,
That would fell down an Oak;
With Zounds Rogue how do,
And such clouted accost.
You may keep for the Clods and the Thatch,
You Are a Creature below us to bondage accursed,
When the beasts unto Adam were subjected first.
II.
Titles are but a sign,
To that which is within
To let you Clounes know,
What duty you owe,
To their virtue and birth that do bear them,
Else would you gape wider
On the Horse then the Rider,
With admiration adore
Dick the Constable more.
When with state he does sit,
With Rug gown and no wit.
Then Robes or the nobles that wear them,
A tough back's the best Herald you peasants can have,
And the height of your title a lusty stout Knave.
No clothes can control,
A Gentleman's Soul
But still he will appear,
All glorious and Clear.
Through the Clouds of blew breeches and patching.
While you though daubed over,
With that you adore,
Gold lace cannot hide
Or change your inside,
But that we may know
Though glittering go,
You Have a Soul that is scarce worth the thatching.
A lord though in rags still looks like the Law,
Writ in worm eaten books that strikes terror and Awe.
IV.
We all are but dust
Yet differ we must.
For if you can say
Bacon broth and sour whey
With which the Veins of you Bores swollen be,
Is the same or as good
As that generous Blood,
Which flows from the Springs
Of Princes and Kings,
The way to be forgot,
Were to be Valiant and stout,
Since our deeds Live no longer then we,
Our Children the Gout and our Acres inherit,
And why not what is our own too, our Titles and Merit.
V.
Then in your thatch sit
And drink Ale as it is fit,
And if you aspire,
Be it but to drink higher,
Call for sack and let State things alone,
Or if you do look
Into a News Book,
Be it but to advise
How your Rents may arise,
And new Cesses and Rates,
To Genteelize your Estates,
And enable you by being undone,
So may you gain Honor while your no Cares afford
You leisure to tipple, and be as drunk's a Lord.
SONG XLV.
I.
Prithee Friend leave of thy thinking,
Cast thy Cares of Love away;
Sorrows still are drowned in Drinking,
Do not longer then delay;
Bacchus Swears it is his will,
That we should be drinking still.
II.
Do but View this Glass of Clarret,
How invitingly it looks,
Drink it quickly, or you will mar it,
Pox of Fighting, and of Books,
Fill us then good store of Wine,
And hang him up that does repine.
III.
Call the drawer bid him fill it
Full, as ever it can hold,
Oh take heed you do not spill it,
It Is more precious far then Gold,
Take it off, and then you will prove,
That Drinkings better sport then Love.
SONG XLVI. Mock.
I.
Prithee Friend leave of thy Drinking,
Cast thy Cups of Wine away,
Do not Muse, but let us be thinking
To get Whores, without delay.
Venus Swears it is her Will,
That, we should be wenching still.
II.
Do but view these pretty Lasses,
How invitingly they sit,
Tempting us to mind their Faces,
And to please their Appetit,
Then in kind Embraces prove,
Women only worth your Love.
III.
Call the Baw'd, and bid her fetch us,
Fresh young Wenches in a main;
Whilst betwixt each bout, we stretch us
Kiss, and then go to it again,
So when Natures sport is spent,
Drinking then may yield content.
SONG XLVII.
I.
FIre Fire,
Lo! Here I burn in Such desire,
That all the Tears that I can strain
Out of my Empty Love sick brain,
Cannot assuage my scorching pain,
Come Humber, Trent, and silver Thames,
Dread Ocean have with your Streams,
And if you cannot quench my Fire,
Drown both me and my desire.
II.
Fire Fire,
There is no help for my desire,
See how the Rivers backward fly,
The Ocean does its Tides deny,
For fear my heart should drink them dry.
Come Heavenly showers, come pouring down,
Come, you that once the World did drown,
And if you cannot quench my Fire,
O drown both me, and my desire.
SONG XLVII. Mock.
I.
FIre Fire,
Is there no help for thy desire?
Are Tears all spent? is Humber low?
Does Trent, stand still? does Thames not flow?
And does the Ocean backward go?
Though all these cannot thy Fever Cure,
Yet Tyburn is a Cooler lure,
And since thou can not quench thy Fire,
Go hang thy self, and thy desire.
II.
Fire Fire,
Here Is one left for thy desire,
Since that the Rainbow in the Sky,
Is bent a deluge to deny,
As loath for thee a God should Lie.
Let gentle Rope come dangling down,
One born to hang shall never drown,
And since thou can not quench the Fire,
Go hang thy self, and thy desire.
SONG XLIX.
I.
LOve! let me have my Mistress such
(If I must need have one,
Whose metal will endure the touch,
Whose touch will try the stone!
Let her have sense I ask no more
A Woman's reason I abhor!
II.
Her noon like Eyes should shine as clear;
And be so fixed on mine,
The Salamander babe there,
Should kindle and entwine,
Then look me dead, that men may swear
There is no Basilisk but her.
III.
If the upper manna-lips distill,
The sweets of every food,
To sauce the Appetite (not fill)
The Lover Limbeck's good:
To relish which* let Love invent,
Away to crane his Instrument.
IV.
The shrillows of the Siren noise,
Should charm an Adders Ear;
And where she Echoed all to voice,
I Would be in Love with her*
To be Clamaeleon'd who would Care,
So he might Juncat on such Air.
V.
I Would have her panther in her breath;
And Phaenix in her breast,
The valleys that are underneath,
The Spicery of the East.
I Would have her without much ado,
But lo! I Would have her naked too:
In spite of Fate, thus would I lie
Mandrake to all Eternity.
SONG XLIX.
I.
CLoris forbear a while,
do not o'rejoy me,
Urge not another smile
Lest it destroy me
That beauty pleases most,
And is best taking,
Which soon is won, soon lost
Kind, yet forsaking:
I Love a coming Lady faith! I do!
But now and then, I Would have her scornful too.
II.
Over cloud those Eyes of thine,
Bo-peepe thy Features,
Warm with an April shine,
Scortch not thy Creatures,
Still to display thy ware,
Still to be fooling,
Argues how rude you are,
In Cupids Schooling,
Disdains begets a suit, scorn draws us nigh,
It Is 'Cause I would, and cannot, make me try.
III.
Fairst, I Would have thee Wise,
When Gallants view thee,
And Court, do thou despise;
Fast moves an Appetite;
Fly, they will pursue thee;
Fast moves an Appetite,
Makes hunger greater,
Who Is stinted of Delights,
Falls to it the better,
Be kind and Coy by turns, be smooth and rough*
And buckle now and then, and that is enough.
SONG L.
I.
COme, come, away!
No delay,
To our wished delight!
Sweet quickly have, unto the greedy Lover!
Throw, throw aside
What may hide,
The inquisitive sight!
I Will be the only veil that shall the Cover,
And we,
Will both agree,
And then shall see
How we the time abuse,
To trifle it away, with Empty wishes;
Fond dreams,
Are Childish Themes,
Wherein the Creams
Of The sport, we always loose,
Ad do neglect the sweeter after Kisses
II.
Come do not frown!
Lay thee down!
It Is a thing must be done,
Take of thy hand-good faith! it is wondrous pretty?
Oh! what a quoyle?
And a spoil!
E're this fort could be won,
Nay, though thou sqeak, or cry I dare not pity.
And now,
I Will show thee how
Thy Dad did do,
And score up wealthy Sums
Of Kisses, on thy lips to highten Pleasures:
Again!
I cannot refrain,
I fear no pain,
Oh now it comes, it comes!
It Is all, thine own, thou shall have standing Measure.
On a Servant Maid who satisfied her Amors with a Mastiff Dog.
I.
OUt! out! you Bitch! what it is the Devil you ail?
How to a four-ledg Creature turn your tail
Strange Death of Female-mongers sure in town,
When Mauger law Woman to beast lies down
And takes a nasty Cur those legs between,
Where many a Christian had or ought to have been.
Oh! what an age we live in, when alack,
There Is found a gill, that could not find her Jack,
So that Sans fear of God in hugger mugger,
The Femal must seduce the Male to bugger,
Spite of Dame Shipton we have Men enough,
Nor are they all bewitched, but Woman proo^,
The maid of the holder forth first gave this hint,
Or furor Cunni or the Devil was in it,
Or was it for that two-leg'd-lawful Creature,
In The Execution of the deed of Nature,
Made that Sport was so sweet to be so short*
(And little thanks is con'nd dame nature for it,)
That thou playd'st this Dog trick and would be Lym'd
Even for that Cause, thou might as well be Brim'd
But lets suppose each wight is not so stayward,
As Wallace was (of Yore) or yet blind Bayard,
Yet one would think, that in this knack of love,
Each Member should be fit as hand and glove.
And that a Porters Pego may be as stiff,
Dispraise to none as Utensill of Mastiff,
Every Dog has his day, but this I wot,
Before his Brethren's, came in, went to Pot.
Like will to like as in old Writ we find,
And why not Dog as well as Cat to kind.
But what is the issue come on it, but all
Bigenerous and Paternatural?
Of such a kind of Breed as this I guess
Luellins was in his Men miracles,
Where Aries head and face as said Man Daniel,
Was not unlike to that of Dog called Spaniel,
But how the Mulier formosa superne,
Shall the definit, that will concern ye,
Yet for Examples sake Serini's Monster,
Births of this or that nature cannot miscenter.
New-gate's black Dog, or Pistols Island Cur,
Was probably this Sires Progenitor,
But be they this or that or be they neither
Dead and alive it seemed they hanged together.
SONG LI.
I.
I Came, and looked, and liked loved,
And Frolick't in her Eye,
While, fair Florilla, approved
The harmless Courtesy:
When, though my hopes were drowned love blazed
And set on fire my heart,
While I still gazed
On that, which caused my smart,
Nor could my Tongue,
Declare the wrong,
Whereby, I sadly know,
No pain above,
The grief, they prove,
Who fall in Love,
And dare not say! they do.
II.
What privilege takes the nicer she?
To me the thing's all one,
Whether, of softer wax she be,
Or of the Parian stone:
The sport's the same, then tell me why,
Fancy, should be so rude,
For to deny
What is, perhaps as good,
From her that lends,
And freely spends,
What nature to her sent
As from that dame,
That counts it shame,
To play the Game,
Which lost, she may Repent.
On a Barber who became a great Master of Music
f.
IN former time 't has been upbrayded thus,
That Barbers Music was most Barbarous,
For that the Cittern was confined unto
The Ladies fall, or John come kiss me now,
Green sleeves and Pudding Pyes, the Punks delight,
Winning of Bolloigne, Essex's last good night.
But, since reduced to this Conformity,
And Company became Society,
Each Barber writes himself (in strictest Rules)
Master, or Bachelor in the Music Schools,
How they the mere Musicians do out-go,
These one, but they have two strings to their Bow,
Barber-Musitians! who are excellent.
As well at Chest, (as the Case) Instrument,
Henceforth each Steward shall invite his guest
Unto the Barbers and Musicians Feast.
Where sit ye merry, whilst we Joy to see
Art thus embraced by Ingenuity.
A Round.
COme smooth off your Liquor!
It makes the Wit quicker,
And he, that his water refuses,
Whilst we laugh and sing,
And quaff healths to the King;
Shall never have a Bout with the Muses.
II.
The next to the Queen,
Hold it up let us be seen;
For we came to laugh and be merry,
Call the Drawer with Wine,
And cry this is mine,
Be it Claret, Canary or Sherry.
II.
To the Duke swallow Franker,
Since we have the Spanker,
We Will every man drink out an od piece,
He that fails of his whole one,
Were he greater then Solon;
Shall have all the rest in his Codpiece.
On the Act of the Rump against Titles of Honor given by the King.
I.
DRaw the Wine,
Fill the Bowl,
Never repine
Or Condole
At the usage the States lay upon us*
Though they trample us down,
Under foot, from a Crown,
If we but hold up,
For a Penliful Cup,
We Will forgive all the mischief they have done us.
Let our Honors
And our Manors,
Be Confiscate to their Powers,
If we Sack
May not lack,
The whole World shall be ours,
And while their kindness, this fair boon affords,
Tho we cannot spend, we will be as drunk as Lords.
II.
Then about
Give the Glass,
Suck it out!
Let it pass!
And who tipples as long as he is able,
Though he is shrunk from Sir John,
To poor Jack all is one,
Let his Lady take snuff,
If he but drink enough,
We Will Instal him Knt. of the round table,
Other Titles,
Are but Trifles,
Not deserving our thinking,
Hence we will make
Laws, to take
Our degrees, from good drinking.
Honor's a Pageant, we disclaim the thing?
VVho'd be a Knt. where Charles is not a King?
III.
Drink away,
Have at all,
While we stay
Let us call,
And, as Lilburn would have us, be Freemen,
And who tope out their time,
Till the midnight shall shine,
Their Mistresses, they
Shall be Ladies of the May,
And themselves, of the bottles, the Yeomen?
The Commanders,
That were Ranters,
Shall Comence, now, to be Hectors,
And be still
As Gentile
As the Kingdoms Protectors,
And bear, (dispite of State or Heralds Rules)
In The Pockets, Argent in their Faces Gules.
At General Monk's coming to London.
NOw Lambert's sunk,
And mighty Monk
Succeeds the Tyrannous Cromwell,
And Arthurs Court,
'Cause time is short,
Do rage like Devils from Hell.
Let Us mark the Fate,
And Course of State,
Who rises, while the other is sinking,
And believe, when this is past,
'Twill be our turn at last;
By the good Old Cause of Drinking.
II.
First Sa' fleum Nol,
He swallowed all,
His smeller, showed he loved it,
But Dick his Son,
As he were none,
Gave't off, and had reproved it,
But that his Foes,
Made bridge of's nose,
And cried him down for a Protector,
Proving him, to be a fool,
That would undertake to Rule,
And not fight and drink like Hector.
III.
The Grecian lad,
He drank like mad,
Minding no work above it;
And ( Sans question)
Killed Ephestion,
Cause he would not approve it,
He got Command
Where God had Land,
And like a right maudlin Younker,
When he tippl'd all, and wept,
He laid him down and slept,
Having no more Worlds to Conquer.
IV.
Rump Parliament,
Would needs invent
An Oath of Abjuration,
But Obedience,
And Alegiance,
Now are all in Fashion;
Then here is a bowl,
With Heart and Soul
To Charles, and say amen to it,
Tho they brought the Father down
From a triple Kingdom Crown,
We Will drink the Son up again to it.
New-Years-Day, To my Dear Friend W. M. Esquire:
THough amongst the numerous throng I Am hither come,
With one poor Item, it is my total sum,
A Poets stock (tho no great matter it is,)
Is all that one can wish, and such is this.
Health that is the Joy of Life, and Soul of Mirth,
Bane of Despair, and Comfort of our birth,
May't with your Years, as clearly last and rise,
As 'twas e're winds had blasted Paradise*
Wealth! the support of Pleasure and the Crown
Of Worldly hope! the Glory and Renown,
Of Fortunes white Boys, the fond beggars grutch,
Envied of only those deserve not much,
May this (and each) year, yield to my Loved Moyle,
As a perpetual Triumph and a spoil!
Now, as who not enjoy, or covet more,
Are but their Riches Goalers, and still poor,
May the same equal temper, the same Fire,
(That never Flag too low, nor can mount higher,)
Inflame your Breast; whereto be ever sent,
That Which all seek (but find not) true content
May all your Aims atchieve their purposed end,
And never find what it is to want a Friend.
Unless the Kinder Heavens had me assigned
As much of Power to serve you, as of mind,
Then need you wish no more, for it should be known,
'How far I prize your Fortunes 'bove mine own,
Amongst other gifts, I Will give you this gift too,
I never found Friend, so much a Friend as you.
New Year, to W. M. Esquire
NOw when the honest Tenant gladly brings
His Eunuch't Gift, (to show that love has Wings)
Prompted by his Customs, (by nature) so,
My half hatched Muse becomes penfeather'd too,
For (tho I Am but at will and cannot renew,
Yet,) during Life I hold mine all from you,
You (my best Genius) whose Indulgent Care
Confirms me, there is none other Tutelar:
My Glory and my Comfort, All in All,
A narure truly supernatural.
Had Plutarch lived, and known you half so well,
You Had puzzled him to have found your Parallel.
May Heaven forestall your asking with such Bliss
As neither you, nor I should dare to wish.
Quiet in State and mind oh may you prove
Content in all things, as your Ladies love.
And may your mutual Embraces bind
Not only bodies but each others mind,
Which never any Power may untye,
Until that either one, or both shall dye.
May both your Sons be like you in the Extreme,
And then I Will swear none e're shall be like them,
May you still have your Will, and never want Powers,
And I never be my self but when I Am Yours.
On one Grace C. an Insatiate Whore.
GO shameful Model of a Cursed Whore!
Damned by Creation ever to be poor!
Though Clothed in Indian Silk, or what may be,
Consumed on thy matchless Venery.
Thou Eldest Daughter to the Prince of Night,
That can out-ly thy Father at first Sight.
Out-Scoff an Ishmaelite and attempt more,
Than all our Wicked Age has done before.
Nay where the Devil ends, thou can begin,
And teach both him and us, new ways to sin;
Making us to conclude that all bad Crimes
Are but thy pieces Coppy'd by the times.
Surely thou were born a Whore from the Womb
Of some Rank Baud, Unsavory's a Tomb.
That Carted from all Parishes did sell
Forbidden Fruit in the high way to Hell.
If 'twere not Sin to Curse, would they might have
Thee in Esteem, as an insatiate Grave!
And when with old age and diseases crossed,
(The patient Grissel of thy Nose being lost)
Let every Hospital grudg and repine,
To give thee one poor plaster for thy Groyne.
And never let any Man bemone the Case
That ever knew thee in the State of Grace Cook
On the Death of the late Tyrannical Usurper, Oliver Cromwell.
GOne with a Vengeance! had he twenty lives
He needs must go (they say) the Devil drives.
Nor went he hence away, like Lamb so mild
Or Falstaff-wise, like any Chrisome-Child.
In Arthur's Bosom, he is not hush, yet died
Just as he did, at turning of the Tide;
But with it such wind, the Sails did swell,
Charon never made a quicker pass to Hell.
Now, as there must be wonder to pretend
Every notorious Birth, or dismal end,
Just as when Hotspurs Grannams Cat (of Yore)
Did Kitten, or when Pokins lost a Bore,
So when this prodigy of Nature fell,
Her self seemed half unhinged, Tempest foretell
Direful Events, Boreas was out of Breath,
Till by his Soul inspired at his Death.
Then full of this same blustering Sir, he throws
Down sturdy Oaks and Elms, to kiss his Toes.
Himself was heart of Oak, so now they strive
To simpath with him, dead as when alive.
Trees now, as Men, like Trees reverted stood,
You Would think the Devil had been gone to wood.
All things were Topsy-turvy, thus he fell,
The wrath of Heaven, and the prey of Hell.

En Pistor venit propere,
Sis tristis, aut sis hilaris,
Statim a me castraberis.

Tum Pistrix, O Diabole,
Castrabar ego pridie:
Vt videam, ait Diabolus,
Prensis ad genu Vestibus;
Suspiciensque ab humo,
En vulnus grave a culo.
XIV.
Ah, Dis ait, tui castrator,
Iners erat Operator;
Nam ex testiculato te,
Debebat cutem suere;
Hic maneas modo paululum,
Ac petam pro te pharmacum.

Procul abhinc non aberat,
Quin ventrem Pulex scanderat;
Quem quando Demon viderat,

Id Faeminae fit trepidum,
Prae quo emisit crepitum.

Dis ait, En mors est prevalens,
Halitus and grave olens;
Da si quid est donabile,
Hoc non est medicabile.
Hinc, hinc, nil moroe dabitur,
Haud ultra crastinabitur.

Ac domum quando venerat,
Id viro notum fecerat,

Curae non molestant
Nec unquam desperant,

Non contemnunt
Transvehere Mulctrale.
VI.
Nugiparae Foeminae,
In Emporio sitoe,
Hae lina consuunt,

Ostiatim Mulctrale.
VII.
Si Procos habeant,

Et Vomer and Mulctrale.
VIII.
Ad Maii Calendas,
Sertis Coronatas,

Insuavis vilis si non Ames me:
Nolo te adulari, probabis

Haec sit in futurum Cautela,
Vt diluculo,
Pro Capitulo,
Caudae pilum sumat pro medela.

VII.
Ob Regem senatum pugnavit,
Ac si perflaret Borea-notus,
