TO Cut the Rigging:

AND PROPOSALS For the IMPROVEMENT OF Great Artillery.

By ROBERT ANDERSON.

LONDON:

Printed for Robert Morden, at the Atlas in Cornhill, 1691.

To all Ingenious Persons that are employed in, and love the Use of Great
Artillery.
HOW the French Engineers and Gunners come to be so skilful, to do such Service
with their Great Artillery by Sea and Land, may be seen at Prop. IV. hereof.

Our English Engineers and Gunners may learn to be more skilful with their
Artillery (at Sea, at Prop. I. hereof; and by Land, in a Treatise To Hit a
Mark, lately published) than the French.

If our English Engineers say, That it is so much of Art that they cannot use
it, the Answer is, Then they must be foiled by them that will learn Art and use
it. If they say they can do it without Art, it is true; but that will require
much more Time and Charge before they can come near the Mark, And because some
do not know Art, therefore others must not practice Art. Not to say what might
be said, but to bring Art into Practice: I freely offer, if it might please
those Generous and Noble Souls whom it concerns, to command the Gunners, and
the Gunners to be so kind to themselves and the Country that they serve, as to
go with me to Wimbleton-Heath, where I have Guns mounted, fit for extraordinary
Service, and have practiced my self near 20 Years; there will I endeavor to
teach them the Use of the Mortar and Long Gun, according to Art, which is much
better than that absurd way which they now use.

One thing I have for a long time wondered at, viz. That the Train of Artillery
under all its Circumstances, being so very chargeable, and its Execution of so
great importance, and yet the Practice thereof neglected in the greatest
Extreme.

I hope no Man will count those things difficult, or too much of Art, which
falls so necessary in his Way, to serve his King and Country. All ingenious
Persons know, that Art at first seems difficult, yet with some Study and
Practice becomes very easy.

For when that great Mathematician Torricellius came to strike a Mark upon
Ascents and Descents in the Parabola, he found it so difficult, that he himself
confesses, That he had no Science to resolve it. De Motu Project. page 220. But
being now resolved, is become wonderful easy to them that will consider it.

Certainly, it may be taken for a General Rule, The more any Person is
Mathematical, or knowing in the Mathematics, the fitter he is for all the
parts of Military Affairs; and likewise a Nation never receives greater Damage
and Disgrace, than when ignorant and unfaithful Persons are put in Places of
Trust, which I wish never to see in England

Whilst I am ROB. ANDERSON.

To Cut the Rigging.
LET A be one Ship, and B the other, and B C the Rigging to be Cut in the Point
E.

PROPOSITION I.
The greatest Range of the Piece in the Parabola, the Line of Impulse, the
Ascent, or Height of the Rigging to be Cut, and the Angle of Elevation being
given. To find the Horizontal Distance, or the Distance from one Ship to the
other.



Then, In the Right Angled Triangle ABC, the Angle BAC, the double of the
greatest Range in the Parabola G, of the Culverin; the Line of Impulse AD, and
the Perpendicular Ascent BE, or the Height of the Rigging to be cut with this
Qualification, as G:DC::DC:CE being given. To find AB the Distance of the two
Ships.

Then R: r + Z::S:BC, that is rS + Zs / R = BC in Diag. and Z2/G = CE in Diag.
then Z2 + PG / G = BC in Diag. that is Z2 + PG / G = ZS + rS / R that is
Z2R=ZGS + G rS - GPR.

G= 9374 the double of the greatest Range of the Culverin.

BE=P= 5 Paces, 5 foot to a Pace.

AD= r= 106

Sine of 8d=S= 13917

Rad. =R= 100000

DC=Z= 1371.31

The Equation in Numb. Z2=Z1304.57958 + 91415.43548

A Method to extract the Roots of square Equations.
Take half the Number of the Coeficient. To the square of that half, add or
subtract the absolute Number, according to the Sign + or -, then extract the
square Root of that Sum or Difference, which Root added to or subtracted from
the half Coeficient, the Sum or Difference will be the Root of the Equation.

Example. Half the Coeficient is 652.28979, its square is 425481.9701382441, to
which add the absolute Number 91415.43548, the Sum is 516897.4056182441, whose
square Root is 718.95, which added to the half Coeficient makes 1371.24 the
desired =Z. Geometrically thus,



In Fig. Z, If OD be made the Ascent, and DE the double of the greatest Range
in the Parabola, DC will be a mean Proportion. In Fig. Y, If AC be made Radius,
and CB the Sine of the Angle of Elevation, and AD the Line of Impulse, then DE
will be a fourth Proportion. In Fig. Z, If RC be made equal to DE in Fig. Y,
and CD in Fig. Z, be made equal to the double of the greatest Range, then CA
will be a mean Proportion. Further in Fig. Y, if AC be Radius, and CB the Sine
of the Angle of Elevation, and AD be made equal to the greatest Range in the
Parabola, then DE will be a fourth Proportion. Let DF in Fig. Z, be made equal
to DE in Fig. Y, then AL will be the Line desired.

GP = square of DC, and GrS / R = square of AC, also because the sine of GP is
-, and GrS / R is +, therefore the square of AD is the difference of those
Squares, 47. I. Euclid. and GS / 2R = the Line DF, therefore the Square of DE +
the square of AD is = the square of AF, which Line AF + DF = ALL the Line
desired.

In the Column A the Degrees. of Elevation, to hit an Object at the Horizontal
Distances in the Column B, at the Ascent of 5 Paces with a Culverin.

Two Ships lying at the distance of 1135 Paces, the Culverin requires 6 degrees. of
Elevation, charged with 10 Pound of Powder, to hit the other Ship at 5 Paces
above the plain Parallel to the Horizon where the Gun is mounted.

Here note, The Distance between the two Ships is to be taken by Instrument, or
by good Estimation.

Of a MUSKET. PROP. II.
A Musquet-Barrel made a little wider toward the Britch than forward, the
Britch-pin easily to screw in and out, to take aim at the Mark by the inside of
the Piece, fixed fast with Timber and Screws, with a Ball fitting the Muzzle of
the Piece, charged with half an Ounce of Powder, put to a Mark, Ranged the Ball
in a right Line 200 Yards, or 120 Paces (wonderful exactly) if not farther.
Wimbleton-Heath in the Year 1690.

By this we find the greatest Range of the Musket thus,

The Line of Impulse of the Saker 124 2.093422 The greatest Range of the Saker
5654 3.752356 The Line of Impulse of the Musket 120 2.079181 The great. Range
of the Musq. proxime that is, more than 5 English Miles. 5472 3.738115

By this, and what is said at Prop. VIII. To Hit a Mark, the Futura of a
Musket is known.

There are Fowling-Pieces whose Length of their Chases are 8 Foot, the Diameter
of their Bores Bastard-Musquet, that is 7/10 of an Inch; such a Piece
(certainly) will Range its Ball 10 Miles (the Air excepted). What Use may be
made of this, I leave to ingenious Persons that delight in these Matters.

Here some cry aloud against these great Ranges, but what my Hands act, and my
Feet measure, and my Eyes see, I shall freely assert, and endeavor to maintain.

Of GRENADES commonly called blind. PROP. III.
SUch are those Grenades which have no Fusce burning in the flight, but has a
Steel and Flint or Firestone placed within the Granado, to fire the Powder when
it arrives to the Earth; the Description of which is set down in Casimire in
his great Art of Artillery, Part I. Book IV. Chap. 3. in Plate marked M, Fig.
K, Numb. 121; as also the Cylindrical Fireshot, the Spheriode with a Dovetail
to be screwed in, to direct it in its flight, Boxes to be filled with small
Grenades and other things of consequence, to be shot either out of the
Mortar-piece or Long-Gun, are treated on in the forecited place, and therefore
saves the labor here.

These, with many other things belonging to great Artillery lie fair from
Improvement.

PROP. IV.
IN the Year 1673. I published my Genuine Use of the Gun, upon the Principles
of Galileus without any accidental Impediment, that is, that the Transit of the
Bullet to be in the Curve of a Parabola, and from that to Hit a Mark at demand
within the reach of the Piece Analitically, as well upon Ascents as Descents,
as upon the Plain of the Horizon. In the Year 75, Mons. Blundell in his de
jeter les Bombes, page 283. propounded that Problem to the Royal Academy of
Sciences of France, to be resolved Geometrically, Mons. Buot, Romer the Sweed,
and Mons. de la Hire set upon the Mathematical Part, from Page 285. to Page
312. of the said de jeter les Bombes; whilst Mons. Marriott and Perault made
many Experiments several times repeated before the Royal Academy, Mons. the
Dauphin being present, viz. with Water, with a Bow, with a Cross-Bow, a
Stone-Bow, an Engine in imitation of the ancient Balistes, with a Pistol, and
with Quicksilver, all agreeing precisely with that of Galileus de jeter les
Bombes, page 490. For which Service the French King made Mons. Blondell Master
de Camp and gave him about 200l. sterling. a Year, as I am credibly informed.
Whilst the French Mathematicians and Philosophers were a trying the Truth of
this noble Invention of the famous Galileus, for the carrying on of their
Warlike Designs; here in England some Persons made Experiments upon
Black Heath, and near Newington-Butts, but what they amounted to I know not.

By these means the French Engineers sling their Shot as exactly as the
Benjamites, and ours in England remain as at first.

But as I have been at some Pains and Charge to bring the Use of Great
Artillery to a greater perfection than formerly, in my Genuine Use of the Gun,
and in a Treatise To Hit a Mark, so now, I move forward, that ingenious Persons
may be instructed in that Art, so they may be capable to serve, and to be an
Honor to their King and Country.

In order to which: For the Improvement and Practice of the MORTAR.
LET there be a firm Platform, and a Mortar-piece about 6 Inches diameter, with
a fit Ball, mounted in a Carriage to move from an Horizontal to a Vertical
Line, and to be firmly fixed to any degree and Minute at demand, and even ground
for two Mile in length; such a Platform, Mortar-piece, and level Ground, is fit
for extraordinary Service, and to instruct the Gunners, that so they may see
and understand the Ranges of their Piece, and learn to strike any Mark at
demand within the reach of the said Piece.

The Gunners to be instructed one day in a Week throughout the Year, and upon
public days to shoot for a Piece of Plate given by the King, tho to the value
of 5 s. in doing which, His Majesty will be no Loser if Wars continue.

For the Improvement and Practice of LONG-GUNS.
LET there be a firm Platform to mount the Guns upon, and 2 or 3 Mile of Ground
to Range the Shot, and a moveable Butt to be set up perpendicular to the
Horizon, the Gunners to be practiced one day in a Week, and to shoot for a
Piece of Plate on general days; such a Method will make them expert Gunners,
and that Prince that will not use some such Method to exercise his Gunners,
will lose a great deal more than that Charge comes to when he puts them to
Service.

If any make Objections, and say, That the Gunners cannot practice that of the
Parabola.

To which I Answer.
I Will take a Gunner of the Capacity of a Youth of 14 years of Age, and teach
him Arithmetic, and so much of Geometry that is requisite for Practice, and
learn him the Use of the Mortar, that he shall be capable to strike any Mark at
demand within the reach of the Piece when it is demanded of him, and to teach
the rest of the Gunners to do the like.

But,

If the Gunners say they can strike any Mark at demand within the reach of the
Piece according to that of the Parab.

Then, To conclude my Endeavors.
Concerning the Improvement of Great Artillery, I freely offer to be at the
Charge of Platform, Mortar-piece mounted, Powder, Ball, and all things
necessary for extraordinary Service, and a Medal of Silver, if they whom it
chiefly concerns will command the Gunners to endeavor to strike a Mark at any
place within the reach of the Piece, and he that comes nearest the Mark with
the most rational Rules of Art, shall have the Medal of Silver.

Not to omit the Example of two eminent Soldiers.
When the Lord Fairfax besieged Worcester, he had a Scotch Man for his
Engineer; Nathaniel Nigh, a very young Man, went to the L. Fairfax, and desired
that he and the Scotch Engineer might have a fair Trial with their Mortar-piece
against the Town, and he that did the best Service, should be the L. Fairfax's
Engineer; to which the L. Fairfax readily answered, All the reason in the
world. The said Not. Nigh blew up the Magazine, which forced them to surrender,
for which he was made the L. Fairfax's Engineer, and Master Gunner of
Worcester. From an eminent Person now living that was an Eye and Ear Witness.

Oliver Cromwell sent for Mr. Wright, a Joyner by Profession, and took care of
his Family, sent him to the Siege of Dunkirk, with 2 Eighteen Inch
Mortar-pieces, which were so well managed by the said Wright and one Stint,
that the first Granado they threw into the Town fell near the Townhouse, and
made such a prodigious Breach, that the Governur of the Town set up the white
Flag immediately, and capitulated.

But, when unworthy Persons and Relations were preferred the Government
dwindled to

FINIS.
