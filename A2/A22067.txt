By the King.
WHereas by an Act of Parliament made in the two and twentieth year of the
Reign of Our most noble Progenitour King Edward the fourth; It was (amongst
other things) ordained, that all Merchants which should carry or bring any
merchandise out of Scotland, or the Isles of the same into this Realm of
England or Wales, first should bring the same merchandise to the Town of
Berwicke: And that none of the Kings liege people, nor none other person under
the Kings obeisance should carry any merchandise, or cause it to be carried
into this Realm of England, or any other place under the Kings obeisance: But
that the same merchandise should be customed at the same Town of Berwicke,
except to the City of Carlisle, and the Ports or Creekes pertaining to the West
Marches: And that no merchandise should be shipped in any Creek, or other
place betwixt Tinmouth and the said Town of Berwicke; but only in the Port or
Haven of the said Town of Berwicke: And that if any person or persons should
offend, or do with any manner merchandise aforesaid, contrary to any of the said
ordinances, the same person or persons should forfeit all the said merchandise,
and that it should be lawful to any of the Kings liege Subjects to seize all
such merchandise so forfeited, or else to pursue in his own name an Action of
debt against the same person or persons which so should forfeit, containing the
sum of the value of the said goods, and the King to have as well the one half
of all such merchandise forfeited and seized, as the one half of all such
sums of money, which should be recovered by the Action in the form
aforesaid, to be pursued for the value of any such goods so forfeit, and the
person or persons which should seize, and pursue in the form aforesaid, to
have the other half of the same, as by the same Act of Parliament (amongst
other things) more at large appears.

And whereas We were given to understand in the first year of our Reign of
our Realm of England, that since our entry into this Kingdom, many of our
subjects of our Realm of Scotland, and some also of England did not observe
the same Act of Parliament, but to the intent to defraud us of our said
Customs, did go with their goods and merchandises over the Felles, and other
by-passages, whereby great damage was then done to us:

And whereas We, for that cause at that time did by our Proclamation straightly
charge and command all Our Subjects, as well of the one Realm as of the other,
that none of them should presume after that time to pass any goods from each
Realm to other, but either shipped at some known Port, or else through Our
said city of Carlisle, or Town of Berwicke, as by the same Proclamation may
also appear.

And whereas We have been pleased of long time to forbear to take any
Customs, or other Duties, of any of Our Subjects of Scotland, for any goods
passing betwixt Our said Kingdoms, until now of late: During which time, Our
Subjects did observe as well the said Act of Parliament, as the said
Proclamation: And forasmuch, as We are now again informed, that Our said
Subjects, since We have given order to Our Officers to receive Our Customs,
for goods so carried between both Our said Kingdoms, do now again go with
their goods and merchandise over the said fels, and other by-passages, and ship
the same at secret, obscure, and unknown places, as well to the great damage
and loss unto Us, in Our Customs and Subsidies, as unto Our Subjects, both of
this Our Realm of England, and also of Our Realm of Scotland, both by carrying
of goods prohibited to be carried out of this Our Realm into Our said Realm of
Scotland, and from thence into the foreign parts: and also by bringing of
goods prohibited to be carried out of Our said Realm of Scotland, into this Our
Realm of England, and from hence carrying the same into other foreign parts.

We minding to take away all such excuses as may be made in that behalf, do
therefore by these presents make it known to all Our loving Subjects, that We
do intend to have the same Act of Parliament, and all others of like effect
put in strait execution in all things above mentioned, for and concerning land
carriages, and such goods as shall be shipped at such secret, obscure, and
unknown places, and to have the same very carefully observed, performed,
fulfilled, and kept, to the only end, that We, or Our Fermours may be truly
answered of Our due customs, Subsidies, and other duties due for such goods.

And for that purpose, We do hereby authorize, and straightly charge, will and
require, as well Our Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, and other Our Officers,
in Our Ports and Custom houses; As also all Our Lieuetennants, Deputy
Lieuetenants, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Constables, and other Our Officers,
Ministers, and Subjects whatsoever, whom it shall concern, not only to see to
the due execution of the same Act of Parliament themselves, to their best
knowledge and skill: but also to be aiding and assisting to all others, that
shall endeavor to see the same put in execution, as is fit; as they will
answer the contrary at their uttermost perils.

Given at Our Palace of Wesminster the 17. day of May, in the ninth year of
Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.

Majesty. Anno Dom. 1611.
