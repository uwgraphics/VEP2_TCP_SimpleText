A Proclamation to restrain the planting of Tobacco in England and Wales.
IT is not unknown what dislike We have ever had of the use of Tobacco, as
tending to a general and new corruption, both of men's bodies and manners:
Nevertheless it is of the two, more tolerable, that the same should be imported
amongst many other vanities and superfluities which come from beyond the Seas,
then permitted to be planted here within this Realm, thereby to abuse and
misimploy the soil of this fruitful Kingdom: For which purpose by Our
direction, Letters of late have been addressed from our Council of State,
prohibiting the plantation thereof within a certain distance of Our City of
London: But entering into further consideration of the manifold inconveniences
of suffering this nourishment of vice (and nothing else) as a noisome and
running Weed, to multiply and ouerspread within this Our Kingdom, We are
resolved upon many and weighty reasons of State, to make the said Prohibition
general.

For first, We are informed, That whereas the use of foreign Tobacco was
chiefly vented, and received in Cities and great Towns, where riot and excess
uses to take place, it is now by the Inland plantation become promiscuous, and
begun to be taken in every mean Uillage, even amongst the basest people.

Secondly, We are given to understand from diverse persons of skill and
experience, That the English Tobacco, howsoever some do presume or imagine by
industry and experience to rectify it, and make it good (wherein it is easy
for opinion to do mischief) yet it is certainly in it self more crude,
poisonous and dangerous for the bodies and healths of Our Subjects then that
that comes from hotter Climates; So that the medicinal use of Tobacco (which
is that that is only good in it, and to be approved) is in this kind also
corrupted and infected.

Thirdly, Whereas Our Colonies and Plantations in Virginia and the Summer
Islands, (being proper and natural Climates for that plant, and the true temper
thereof) receive much comfort by the Importation thereof into this Kingdom,
(which is to be respected at least in the Interim, until Our said Colonies may
grow to yield better and more solid commodities) Now the said Trading from
thence is and will be by the Plantation within this Realm, choked and
overthrown.

Fourthly, We do find also, that the reason that moved Us to interdict the
planting thereof near the City of London, (which was in regard of the
conuersions of garden grounds, and rich soyled grounds from diverse Roots and
Herbs, fit for victual and sustenance, unto this harmefull vanity) extends
likewise unto all Cities, Towns and Uillages, and rather more, by how much the
poverty is greater there, then here above.

And lastly, for that it does manifestly tend to the diminution of Our
Customs, which is a thing, that although in case of good Manufactures, and
necessary commodities We do little esteem, Yet where it shall be taken from
Us, and no good but rather hurt thereby redound to Our people, We have reason
to preserve.

We therefore intending in time to provide a remedy for this spreading evil,
which has in a very few years dispersed it self into most parts of Our
Kingdoms, do hereby straightly charge and command all and every person and
persons of what degree or condition soever, That they or any of them, by
themselves, their servants, workmen or laborers, do not from and after the
second day of February next, presume to sow, set, or plant, or cause to be
sown, set or planted within this Our Realm of England, or Dominion of Wales,
any sort or kind of Tobacco whatsoever; And that they or any of them, shall
not, or do not hereafter maintain, or continue any old stocks, or plants of
Tobacco, formerly sown or planted, but shall forthwith utterly destroy and
root up the same, converting and employing the ground and soil thereof to
some other lawful uses and purposes, as to them shall seem best, upon pain
of contempt of Our Royal commandment, to be proceeded with according to Our
Laws, and Prerogative Royal with all severity.

And therefore, for the more due execution of the premises, We do further
will, require and command all Mayors, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, Bayliffes,
Constables, and other Officers and ministers, to whom it shall or may
appertain, That they and every of them, shall from time to time diligently and
carefully intend the due and exact observation of this Our Royal pleasure, And
that they permit not, nor suffer any thing to be done, contrary to the true
intent and meaning of this Our Proclamation, but withstand the same to their
uttermost power, as they tender Our service: And further that they take order
that such offenders, laborers, or workmen, as shall persist in the sowing or
planting of Tobacco, in this Our Realm or Dominion of Wales, or in the
maintaining or continuing any old stocks, or former plantations thereof
hereafter, may be called before them, and be bound in Recognizances of good
sums of Our use, to appear in Our Court of Starrechamber, there to be
prosecuted by Our Attorney general, as contemners of Our express
Commandment, Proclamation, and Prerogative Royal, wherein (especially in a
cause of this nature) We will expect, and require of all Our Subjects, their
due conformity and obedience.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster the thirtieth day of December, in the
seventeenth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. God save
the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, and John Bill, Printers to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty.
