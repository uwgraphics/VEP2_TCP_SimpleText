a great shot of ordinance / which descended the river before all ye barges /
and the bachelors barge formest / and so following in good array and order /

behold. Than at three of the clock the queen's grace came to her barge / and
incontinent all the cytezyns with that goodly company set forth toward London
in good array / as before is said. And to write what nombre of gonshot / what
with chambres and great pieces of ordinance were shot as she passed by in
diverse places / it passes my memory to write or to tell the nombre of them /
and specially at Ratlyf and at lyme house out of certain ships. And so ye
queen's grace in her rich barge among her nobles / the cytezyns accompanied
her to London unto the toure wharfe. Also or she came nere the toure there was
shot innumerable pieces of ordinance / as ever was there by any men's
reme^brau^ces / where the king received her grace with a noble loving
countenance / and to gave great thanks and praise to all the cytezyns for
their great kyndnesse and loving labor and pains in that behalf taken / to
the great joy and comfort of all the cytezyns. Also to behold the
wonderful nombre of people that ever was seen that stood on the shore on both
sides of the river / was never in one sight out of ye cite of London seen /
what in goodly lodgings and houses that be on ye river side between Grenwyche

grace passed forth into Poules chyrchyarde / and at the eest end of ye church
against ye schole was a great scaffolde / whereon stood ye nombre of two hundred
children well besene / who received her with poets verses to her noble honor /
wha^ they had fynisshed she said Amen with joyful smylyng countenance / and so
passed forth through the long chyrchyarde / and so to Ludgate which was costly
and sumptuously garnysshed with gold / colors / and asure / with sweet armony
of ballades to her great praise and honor / with diverse sweet instruments.
And thus her grace came through the cite with great honor and royaltye / and
passed through Fletestrete till she came to ye standarde and co^dyth where was
made a fair toure with four tourettes with fanes / there within great plenty
of sweet i^strumentes with children syngyng / the standarde of mason warke costly
made with images and angels / costly gylted with gold and asure / with other
colors / and diverse sorts of arms costly set out shall there continue and
remain / and within the standarde a vice with a chyme. Also there ran out of
certain small pypes great plenty of wine all that afternoon. And so her grace
passed through the cite to temple bar / and so to Charyng cross / and so
through Westmynster into westmynster hall / where that was well and rychly
hanged with cloth of Arras / with a meruaylous rich cupborde of plate / and
there was a void of spyce places and wine. And ye done the queen's grace
withdrewe her into ye white hall for that night / and so to York place by
water. The sunday in ye morning at.viij. of the clock ye queen's grace with
noble ladies in their robes of estate / with al ye nobles aparayled in parlyament
robes / as dukes / earls / archbysshops and bishops / with barons / and the
barons of ye five ports with the mayre of ye cite / the aldermen in their
robes as ma^tels of scarlet. The barons of ye five ports bare a rich canopy
of cloth of gold / with staves of gold and four belles of silver and gylt.
The abbot of westmynster with his rygals came in to ye hall in po^tificalibus with
his monks in their best copes / the kings chapel in their best copes / with
ye bishops rychely aourned in pontificalibus / and the ray cloth blewe spredde
from the high desses of ye kings benche unto the high altar of westmynster.
And so every man procedynge to the mynster in ye best order / every man after
their degree appointed to their order and office as aperteyneth came unto ye
place appointed / where her grace received her crown / with all ye serymonyes
thereof as there unto belongs. And so al ye serimonyes done with ye sole^pne
mass / they departed home in their best orders every man to the hal of
westmynster / where ye queen's grace withdrew her for a time in to her chamber
appointed / and so after a certain space her grace came in to ye hall. Than ye
should have seen every noble man doing their service to the^ appointed in ye
best manner yt has been seen in any such serimony. The queen's grace washed /
ye archbisshop of Canterbury said grace. Than ye nobles were set to the table /
therwt came ye queen's service with ye service of tharch bishop / a certain
space three me^ with the queen's grace service. Before ye said seruyte came ye
duke of Suffolk high constable ye day and steward of ye feast on horsbacke /
and meruaylously trapped in aparell with richesse. Than with him came ye lord
Wyllyam Hawarde / as depute to ye duke of Norfolk in ye rome of ye marshal of
England on horsbacke. The earl of essex caruer. Therle of Sussex sewer. Therle
of Darby cupberer. Therle of Aru^dell butteller. The visconte Lysle panter. The
lord Bray awmoner. These noble men did their service in such humble sort and
fassyon that it was wonder to se the pain and dylygence of them / being such
noble personages. The service borne by knights / which were to me to long to
tell in order / the goodly service of kinds of meat with their deuyses from
the highest unto the lowest / there have not ben seen more goodlyer nor
honorablyer done in no man's days.

There was four tables in ye great hall alonge the said hall.

The noble women one table / syttyng alon ye one side. The noble men an other
table. The mayre of London an other table with his brethren. The barons of the
ports with ye master of the chau^cery the fourth table.
And thus all things nobly and tryumphantly done at her coronacyon / her grace
returned to white hall with great joy and solempnyte / and the morrow was
great iustes at ye tylte / done by.xviij. lords and knights / where was
broken many spears valyauntly: but some of their horses would not come at
their pleasure nere unto the tylte / which was displeasure to some that there
did run.

Thus ends this tryumphe: Imprinted at London in Fletestrete by Wynkynde
Word / for Johan Goughe.

Cum priuilegio.
