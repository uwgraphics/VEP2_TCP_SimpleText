A Proclamation touching Tobacco.
WHereas Our most dear Father, of blessed memory, deceased, for many weighty
and important Reasons of State, and at the humble suit of His Commons in
Parliament, did lately publish two several Proclamations, the one dated the
nine and twentieth day of September, now last past, and the other the second of
March following, for the utter prohibiting of the importation, and use of all
Tobacco, which is not of the proper growth of the Colonies of Virginia and the
Summer Islands, or one of them, with such Cautious, and under such Pains and
Penalties, as are in those Proclamations at large expressed:

We, tendering the prosperity of those Colonies and Plantations, and holding it
to be a matter of great consequence unto Us, and to the honor of Our Crown,
not to desert, or neglect those Colonies, whereof the foundations, with
hopeful success, have been so happily laid by Our Father, being given to
understand, that diverse persons intending only their private gain, and
neglecting all considerations of the public, in this short time, whilst We
have been necessarily taken up in ordering of the great affairs of Our
Kingdoms and State, have taken the boldness, secretly, and by stealth, to
import and utter great quantities of Tobacco, which is not of the growth of the
Plantations aforesaid, to the utter destruction of those Plantations, as much
as in them lies; We have thought fit, for the preventing of those
inconveniences, which may otherwise ensue, to the irrecouerable damage of
those Plantations, and of Our service, to publish and declare Our Royal
pleasure for the present, touching the premises, until upon more mature
deliberation We shall see cause to alter, or add unto the same, in any part.

And We do therefore straightly charge and command, that no person whatsoever,
of what degree or quality soever, do at any time hereafter, either directly
or indirectly, import, buy, sell or utter, plant, cherish, or use, or cause to
be imported, sold, or uttered, cherished, planted, or used, in Our Realms of
England, or Ireland, or Dominion of Wales, or in any Isles or places thereunto
belonging any Tobacco, of any sort whatsoever, which is not of the proper
growth of the said Colonies, or one of them; And that no person whatsoever, by
any shift or device whatsoever, do receive, or conceal, or color the Tobacco
of any other, so imported, planted, bought, sold, uttered, or used within Our
said Realms, or Dominions, or the Isles or places aforesaid, or any part
thereof, upon pain of forteiture unto Us, of all such Tobacco so to be
imported, bought, sold, planted, uttered, or used, contrary to the true meaning
of these presents, in whose hands soever the same shall be found, and upon such
further pains and penalties, as by the Laws and Statutes of these Our Realms,
or by the Censure of Our Courts of Star Chamber, in either of Our said
Kingdoms respectively, can or may be inflicted upon the offenders, for
contempt of this Our Royal Command; and to be reputed and taken as enemies to
Our proceedings, and to those Plantations, which so much concern Our honor,
and the honor and profit of Our State.

And Our further will and command is, that all the foreign Tobacco, of what
sort soever, which is not of the proper growth of those Plantations or one of
them, shall before the fourth day of May, now next ensuing, be transported out
of Our Realms and Dominions, as by the said former Proclamations it was
directed and commanded, upon pain of forfeiture thereof, and upon the other
pains and penalties aforesaid to be inflicted upon the offenders.

And Our pleasure is, That all such foreign Tobacco may be freely exported
by any person whatsoever, without paying to Us, or to Our use, any Subsidy, or
other duty for the same.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, this ninth day of April, in the first year
of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland. God save the King.
