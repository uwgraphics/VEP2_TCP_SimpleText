THE PREFACE
THIS Book is entitled the Book of Job, it being indeed an History of Job, as
of his Integrity, and his Sore and Heavy Trials, and exemplary Patience; so of
the blessed End which the Lord at length made, his Sore Trials ending in
glorious Triumphs, and his Sorrows, in great Rejoicings.

It is indeed a most excellent Book, full of various and most excellent Matter,
which we should be well acquainted with, and much versed in.

1. We have in it many High and Lofty Discoveries of God, and of his glorious
Attributes, and Perfections, as of his Wisdom, Power, Glory, Majesty,
Greatness, Goodness, Righteousness, and Incomprehensibleness, etc.

2. We have a Description of his wonderful Works, and wonderful and gracious
Providence, providing for all sorts of Creatures, etc.

3. Here we have much held forth, not only of the Creator, but also of the
Creatures, which Manifest, and Declare the Glory of the Creator.

4. We have here an Example of the greatest Piety, most invincible Patience,
and sweet Submissiveness; under the sharpest Dispensations.

5. We have here held forth the Happy End, that God makes in afflicting his
People, and that he is very pitiful, and of tender Mercy, James 5. 11.

6. We are here instructed, as to several Things very observable, and of great
Importance. As,

1. That Persons may be very Great, and yet Gracious, and Good, very Rich and
yet Righteous, very Wealthy and yet Virtuous, as we see here in Job. And this
is a Blessed Conjunction indeed, but very Rare, Riches exposing so much to
Vice, and the Snares, and Temptations of such, being so many and great; hence
says our Savior to his Disciples (and he puts a Verily to it) A Rich Man shall
hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. All hardly, but they hardlier than
others, if Truth it self may be believed: But though with Men it is impossible,
but not with God, with whom all things are possible: He can withdraw the Heart,
from the inordinate Love of them, and from trusting in them, but how hard is
this, and hence (which is very observable) when Jesus Christ had explained
himself, Mark 10. 24. Children how hard is it for them that trust in Riches to
enter into the Kingdom of God, yet then it is said, they were astonished out of
measure, etc. Because it is so hard to have Riches, and not to trust, in them;
hence Paul bespeaks Timothy, To charge them that are Rich in this World, not to
trust in them, etc. 1. Tim. 6. 17, 18, 19. and therefore for such to be Good,
as Job here was, it is to be good indeed, and to be one of a Thousand. Read 1 Timothy 6. 9, 10.

2. We are taught here, that Persons of the greatest Integrity, may be
exercised with the greatest Calamities, whilst the Wicked Prosper in the World,
are Secure, and increase in Riches.

3. That the highest, and best founded Estate here, as to outward Things is
mutable.

4. That Afflictions are not by Chance, but are ordered by Divine Providence.

5. What undaunted Courage, and strong Consolation, Integrity gives in Times of
Trial.

6. We have here in a Word, a mixture and variety of all Learning and Religion,
of all Philosophy and Divinity, so that this Book may well be styled as one
Calls it, (...), a Book that contains all Excellencies in it.

And now the greatest Part of this Book being in the Original, in Verse, yea,
all but the two first Chapters, and Part of the Last; and it being a Book of so
great Excellency, and containing in it, so many great and excellent things, I
have spent some time, and no small Pains to turn many of them into Verse, and
have reduced them to certain Heads, that they might be the better known, and
the better made use of; I do not pretend to Poetry, neither do I much
Paraphrase upon the Words, but for the most Part keep close to them as they are
translated, which I judge meetest in turning Divine Things into Meeter. And now
as I looked upon this, as that which might be very advantageous, and
serviceable to my Self, so if through the Blessing of God, it shall but any
ways prove so to others, which is that I design therein, I shall think my Time
and Pains well bestowed, however let an attempt thereto, be accepted.

Job V. from verse 9. to the 17.
1.
GReat Things Jehovah does, and Things
Unsearchable that be,
Things that are mavelous, and those
Without number does He.
2.
He gives Rain upon the Earth,
A great though common thing:
And Waters sends on the Fields.
Which make them flourishing.
3.
To set up those on high, that be
Through want, brought very low:
Thereby, that Safety those that mourn,
may be exalted to.
4.
He disappointeth that which those
That Crafty are, devise:
So that their Hands, cannot per form,
The Thing they enterprise.
5.
In their own Craftiness, he does
Even take those that are wise:
And the frowards Counsel, headlong that,
Is carried likewise.
6.
They do with darkness meet even in
The Daytime, whilst it is Light:
And in the Noonday they do grope;
As if it was in the Night.
7.
But he the Poor, saves from the Sword,
From the Mouth, of the Crafty:
Yea he also does save them from,
The hand of the Mighty.
8.
And so the Poor great cause has he,
To hope, in Gods Mercy:
And wicked Men confounded are,
And their Mouths stopped thereby, etc.
Job 9. from ver. the 4th. to the 16th.
9.
IN Heart God he is Wise, yea and
Mighty in Strength is He:
Against him who has hardened
Himself, and prospered.
10.
The Mountains who removes, and
Of it they a'n't aware:
And by him in his Anger they,
Soon overturned are.
11.
He shakes the Earth out of her Place,
Made quake her Pillars are:
The Sun commands, and it don't rise,
And seals up the Stars.
12.
He does alone spread out the Heavens,
Treads on the Waves of the Sea:
He all the Motions of the Stars,
Does order as he please.
13.
He does great Things past finding out,
Yea wonders great, does he
So nomerous that in no wise
They numbered can be.
14.
Behold he takes away, who him
Can hinder, who will say
To him what do thou, as to what
He Is pleased to take away?
15.
If God his Anger will not withdraw,
Stoop the proud Helpers do:
How much less shall I Answer him?
And Words choose to do so.
16.
Whom though that I was Righteous,
Him Answer would not I:
But Supplication would make,
Unto my Judge humbly.
17.
Shall any Teach God Knowledge, how
The World should governed be:
Seeing the highest equally,
And lowest judges He.
Job 12. from verse 13th. to the end.
1.
WIth God is perfect Wisdom, and
With him is Strength also:
Counsel, and Understanding both,
Things for to guide, and kno^.
2.
Behold he breaks down, and it
Cannot be built again:
He shuts up Man, and all Attempts,
To open are in vain.
3.
Behold the Waters, he withholds
And all then up do dry:
He also sends them out, and then
The Earth's o'erturn'd thereby.
4.
He Counselors away leads spoiled,
And Judges, Fools makes He:
5.
The Bond of Kings does loose, their Loins
With Girdle girdeth He.
6.
He leads Princes spoiled away,
O'erthrows, who mighty be:
The Speech of the Trusty takes away,
And the Ageds Judgment He.
7.
He pours contempt on Princes, and
Weakens Men's Strength of might:
Discovers deep things out of the dark,
Deaths shade brings out to Light.
8.
He does increase the Nations,
And them destroys He:
He them inlargeth, and by him,
Again they strait'ned be.
9.
Of The chief of the People of the Earth,
The Heart he takes away:
And makes them in a Wilderness,
To wander, where is no way.
10.
They without Light grope in the dark,
And he makes them also:
Much like unto a drunken Man,
Even for to stagger so.
Job 25. throughout, to the Tune of the 25th. Psalm.
1.
DOminion and Fear,
Great God they are with Thee:
In thy high Places also thou,
There Peace do make to be.
2.
Is any able for,
To number thy Armies:
And who, or where are they on whom?
Thy Light does not arise.
3.
How then be justified,
With God can sorry Man?
Or how can he be counted clean,
That Is born of a Woman.
4.
Behold even to the Moon,
And its shines not, though bright:
Yea not the Stars so glistering,
And pure in his sight.
How much less pure then,
Can Man a poor Worm be:
Nor less the Son of Man who is,
A Worm no less then He.
Job 26. from verse 6. to the end.
1.
BEfore him Hell is Naked, and
Death has no covering:
Over the empty Place he spreads forth Heaven,
The Earth hangs on nothing.
2.
In his thick Clouds, though Aerie,
The Waters binds up He:
And though so ponderous, the Clouds
Not under them Rent be.
3.
He from our view holds back the Face
So glorious, of his Throne:
And least it should dazzle our Eyes,
His Cloud spreads thereon.
4.
The Waters of the Ocean,
So boisterous, has he:
Compassed with bounds, and that till Day,
And Night, no more shall be.
5.
Heavens Pillars tremble, and at his
Reproof astonished be:
The Sea his Power cleaves through, the Proud,
By Wisdom smites He.
6.
He by his Spirit has the Heavens,
Garnished as we see:
The Crooked Serpent by his Hand,
Formed also has He.
Lo of his Ways these parts are, but
How small a Portion:
Is heard of Him, but of his Power,
The Thunder knows none.
Job 36: from verse 22. to the end.
1.
BEhold God by his Power exalts,
Who teaches so as He?
Who has enjoined him his Way,
That he is unjust, can say?
2.
That we do magnify the work
Of God, remember we:
Which Men behold, which a far off
Even every Man may see.
3.
Behold God he is great, and we
Him do not know, nor can,
The number of his Days so great,
Be searched out by Man.
4.
For by his Power he does make,
The drops of Water small:
According to the Vapors thereof,
They pour down Rain withal.
5.
Which Clouds do drop, and do disti^,
On Man abundantly:
Also the spreadings of the Clouds,
Them understand cannot we.
6.
Or of his Tabernacle who,
The noise can understand:
The Thunder in the Clouds produced,
By his Almighty Hand.
7.
Behold he spreads the Light upon,
The Clouds, though dark they be:
That they seem all a flame and dark,
Again them makes He.
8.
And He by these does execute,
His Judgments on the bad:
But by them, to such as are good,
Abundant Food is had.
9.
With Clouds he covers the Light,
Commands it not to shine:
And that by interposing of,
The Cloud that comes between.
10.
The Thunder that is within the Clouds,
Gives notice of the Rain:
The Cattle also various ways,
Give notice of the same.
Gods Answer to Job out of the Whirlwind, as to the greatest Part thereof, Chapter
38. verse 2. to the 12th. verse 25. to 36, 37, 38, 41. Chapter 39. verse 13, 19, to
the end.
To the Tune of the Hundred Psalm.
I. Part.
1.
WHO is this that my Counsel dares,
To darken, and misrepresent?
And that by Reasonings so weak,
And without Knowledge, Words does vent.
2.
Come then, if thou will Cope with me,
Gird up thy Loins, and let me see:
Thy Manhood, for I will of Thee,
Demand, and do thou answer me.
3.
When the Foundations of the Earth,
I laid, and it is Proportions?
Where wast thou then, had I thy help?
No then besides me, there was none.
4.
Who has thereof the measure laid,
Who has the Line stretched it upon:
Whereon are the Foundations fixed?
Or who did lay the Cornerstone?
5.
When the Angels, which the Morning Stars
Are called, for Luster and Glory:
Did sing together, and those Sons
Of God for Joy did shout on high.
6.
Or who shut up the Sea with Doors?
When that its force, stay could no hand:
When I its Garment made the Cloud,
And darkness thick its swaddling band.
7.
And for it did break up the place,
Which I decreed had for it:
And did restraint unto it give,
And Bars and Doors did set to it.
8.
And my Commands I on it laid,
Not to exceed it is boundary:
So far, but further shall not thou come,
And here thy proud Waves stayed shall be.
II. Part.
9.
Who for the Waters when they flow,
Divided has a Watercourse?
Or who a way for the Lightning of
The Thunder, which is of such force.
10.
To cause it to Rain on the Earth,
Even there, where no Man does reside:
Also upon the Wilderness,
Wherein there does no Man abide.
11.
The wast ground, and the Desolate,
Thereby it for to satisfy:
To cause the Bud of the tender Herb,
For to Spring forth so pleasantly.
12.
A Father has the Rain, or who
Begotten has the drops of Dew?
Whence came the Ice, who gendred has
Heavens Frost, which hoary is to View.
13.
The Waters they are straightened,
And hid they are as with a Stone:
The Face of the Deep so frozen is,
That Men they may even walk thereon.
14.
Can thou the Seasons of the Year,
Alter, or can keep back the Spring?
Can thou their Influences stay,
Or them forth, as thou please bring.
15.
No in Man's Power they are not,
Them for to hinder, or to stay:
Them for to guide, to bind, or loose,
Who shall but God alone assay.
16.
Do thou Heavens Ordinances know?
No they are secrets unto Man:
And their Dominion on the Earth,
None but my self determine can.
III. Part.
17.
Can thou thy Voice lift up to the Clouds
To cause much Water for to flow?
Can thou the Lightnings send that they,
May go and say here we are lo.
18.
Who the Clouds in Wisdom number can?
Or can the Bottles of Heaven stay:
When the Dust does into hardness grow,
And Clods cleave fast together do.
19.
Who for the Raven does provide,
His Food, and give to them supply:
When unto God his young Ones cry,
Wandering in their Necessity.
Chap. 39. 13.
20.
Who to the Peacock gave these wings,
Which are so glorious and gay:
When that his Tail is spread abroad,
How goodly to the view are they.
Chap. 39. verse 19. to the end.
21.
Have thou given Strength unto the Horse,
Have thou with Thunder clothed his Neck?
Can as a Grasshopper him make,
Afraid? His snortings fear Create.
22.
He paweth in the Valley, in
His Strength he glories, furiously
With Pride and Courage he does march,
To meet the armed Enemy.
23.
He mocks at fear, nothing him daunts,
And from the Sword turns back not he:
Quivers against him rattle, and
The Shield and Spears that glittering be.
24.
The ground with fierceness and with Rage,
He swalloweth* yea and although:
The Trumpet sounds to Battle, yet
He makes as if it was not so.
25.
Ha, Ha, among the Trumpets he,
Does say, the Battle smells He:
Far off, the Captains thunder and,
The noises that tumultuous be.
IV. Part.
26.
Does by thy Wisdom the Hawk fly,
For warmth her Wings stretch Southernly:
Does the Eagle Mount at thy Command,
So as to make her Nest on high.
27.
She dwells, and she does abide,
Upon the Rock, yea dwell does she:
Upon the very crag of the Rock,
So strong that moved it cannot be.
28.
From thence she flees for to seek,
And fetch the Prey, which she does see:
Yea thorough her sharp sightedness,
She sees it, tho far of it be.
29.
Her young Ones also suck up Blood,
Which she has trained them up unto:
And where the slain are, there is she,
And there she does delight to be, etc.
How wonderful Lord are thy Works,
In Wisdom have thou made them all:
And they do thy Perfections,
Preach, and Display, both great and small.
Pleiades, Orion, Mazzaroth, and Arcturus, and his Sons spoken of, Chap. 38.
ver. 31, 32. are four famous Co^stellations; and have respect to the four
Seasons of the Year, Pleiades to the Spring, Orion to the Winter, Mazzaroth to
the Summer, Arcturus with his Sons to the Autumn, and the Virtues, Influences,
and Effects which these produce are wonderful, and ^ery ben^^cial, and many
unseen, and unknown Benefits, we have by them.

Job 37. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 22, 23, 24.
To the Tune 100. Psalm.
1.
HEar we the loud noise of God's Voice,
Attentively, and tremble we:
The sound that goes out of his Mouth,
Of it observant let us be.
2.
Under the Cope of the whole Heaven,
The noise thereof directs He:
And even unto the ends of the Earth,
His Lightenings dispersed be.
4.
Then after them a Voice does roar,
With Voice of his Excellency,
He thundereth, and soon the Rain,
And Storms follow immediately.
5.
God marvelously with his Voice
Does Thunder, and him dread should we:
Great Things and wonderful does He,
Which cannot comprehended be.
6.
For he says to the Snow be thou,
Upon the Earth likewise unto;
The small and great Rain of his Strength,
Be ye upon the Earth also.
7.
He seals up the Hands of all,
That all thereby his Work may know:
The Beasts do go then into Dens,
And remain in their Places do.
8.
Out of the South the Whirlwind comes,
And out of the North comes Cold also:
Frost by the Breath of God is given,
And the Waters breadth is straightened so.
9.
Also by watering, the Cloud
Though thick, weary and waste does He:
And here, and there, as he sees good,
The bright Clouds scattered they be.
10.
And by his Counsels, of the Clouds,
The Motions all they ordered be:
To do throughout the World on Earth,
Whatsoever commands He.
11.
He on his Errand sends them that,
Wherever he pleases they may go:
Either to Punish and Correct,
Or for Mercy the Land unto.
12.
Now hearken we to this, stand still
And pass not by it overly:
Also the wondrous Works of God,
Let us consider seriously.
13.
Fair Weather comes out of the North,
Which for its Radiant Splendency:
Does seem as Gold unto the ^^ye,
With God is dreadful Majesty.
14.
As touching the Almighty, Him
Perfectly find out cannot we:
In Power, Judgment, also in
Plenty of Justice excels He.
15.
Not without Cause will he afflict
Not any one who ever he be:
Men therefore justly do him fear
Who wise in Heart, respects not he.
Job 42. 2. --
16.
We know thou can do every thing,
Even whatsoever pleases Thee:
Neither can what thou purposest,
By any one once hindered be.
Concerning Behemoth.
Job 40. 15, 18, 19, 23.
1.
BEhold now Behemoth, in him
How great my Power appears to be:
Thy Fellow Creature, and who is,
My handiwork, as well as thee.
2.
He of the Ways of God is chief,
And yet though terrible he be:
He that him made can him subdue,
Yea and destroy him easily.
3.
His Bones are strong, as if of Brass,
Yea they as Bars of Iron be:
Lo he Drinks up a River and,
Away for fear hastes not he.
4.
He trusts he can into his Mouth,
Jordan draw up, conceits so he:
Through Snares his Nose does pierce, and they
Are vain, where ever, laid they be.
Concerning Leviathan.
Job 41. 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 24, etc.
1.
BEhold also Leviathan,
How vast and huge a Creatures he:
As other Fishes taken are,
He no such ways can taken be.
2.
Can thou with barbed Irons fill,
His Skin or Head, with Fish-spears keen:
If thou attempt it, don't no more,
The Battle weigh, be glad its over.
3.
Behold the hope of him's in vain,
That would him take, shall not one be:
Cast down even at the sight of him?
So dreadful is it him to see.
4.
None is there that dares stir him up,
No not how fierce so ever he be:
And who then able is to stand,
Before me, or contend with me?
5.
That I should him repay again,
Who is there has prevented me?
What ever is under the whole Heaven,
All Is mine, and does belong to me.
6.
As for Leviathan, his Parts,
So admirable and so strong:
And Power, I will not conceal,
Nor his comely Proportion.
7.
His Heart is firm, even as a Stone,
As the nether Millstone hard and strong:
His Courage is invincible,
He void of Fear he dreadeth none.
8.
When that himself he raises up,
The Mighty then they are afraid:
They fall to their Devotions,
Such breakings of the Waves are made.
9.
The Sword that lays at him cannot hold,
Not Spear, Dart, nor Habergeon:
As Straw, he Iron does esteem,
And Brass as Rotten Wood does Deem.
10.
The Arrow cannot make him flee,
Sling Stones as stubble counted be:
Yea Darts as stubble counted are,
At shaking of the Spear laughs he.
11.
Sharp Pointed Stones are under him,
And yet with ease them lies upon:
And by his weight sharp pointed Things,
Abroad the Mire spreads upon.
12.
Boil like a Pot he makes the Deep,
Like to a Pot of Ointment he:
The Sea, shines after him a Path,
Hoary the Deep it seems to be.
13.
Upon Earth there is not the like,
He fears no Enemy, not he:
He looks on the highest with Contempt,
He Is King over all that proudest be.
Job 13. 11.
And shall not then God's Majesty,
And his Excellency withal:
Make us to be afraid, and shall not
His dread so great upon us fall.
God Invisible.
Job 9. 11. Job 23. 8, 9.
1.
LO in his Works of Providence,
He still me goes by:
And him I see not, passes on
But him perceive not I.
2.
Behold I do go forward but
There God I can not see:
And I go backward, but not there,
By me perceived is he.
3.
On the left Hand where he does Work,
But him behold cannot I:
On the Right Hand, he hides himself,
That him I cannot Spy.
God Omniscient.
Job 34. 21, 22. Job 22. 13, 14.
1.
THe Eyes 'f the Lord, they are upon,
Even all the Ways of Man:
And all their goings he does see,
From him none hide them can.
2.
There is no Darkness (all is clear)
Nor Shade of Death is there:
Wherein who Work Iniquity,
May hide, and not appear.
3.
There are that say, how does God know,
Can he the Clouds Judge through?
Which dark are, but the thickest Clouds,
No covering him are to.
4.
Does he not see my Ways, and all
My goings ponders He?
Yea all my goings and my steps,
By him they counted be.
God Just and Righteous, to the Tune of the 100. Psalm.
Job 34. 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23.
1.
GIve Ear and hearken unto me,
Ye who of Understanding be:
Far be it from the Righteous God,
That he should do unrighteously.
2.
And from the Almighty be it far,
That he should Act Iniquity:
Which to his Holy Nature is,
So much against, and contrary.
3.
For unto Man render shall He,
According as his Works shall be:
And every Man as are his Ways,
So cause him for to find will he.
4.
For surely God neither can,
Neither will he do wickedly:
Nor will he Judgment once pervert,
Who is the Lord God Almighty.
5.
Who has a Charge given him o'r the Earth,
That he accountable should be:
And who the whole World has disposed,
And still does it dispose, but He?
6.
If Understanding now thou have,
Hear this and hearken unto me:
Unto the Voice now of my Words,
That I shall further say to Thee.
7.
Shall He govern that hates right,
And does in doing wrong Delight?
Shall he even govern, and will thou,
Condemn him, who is most Just and Right?
8.
Is It fit unto a King to say,
Thou Wicked art, also unto
Princes yea are Ungodly, though
No other they may be than so?
9.
How much less unto him that don't,
Persons accept, who Princes be:
Nor Rich Regards more then the Poor,
For all of them formed has He.
10.
They shall even in a Moment Die,
And that when most secure they:
And pass away, and without Hand,
The mighty shall be took away.
11.
Behold God will not lay on Man,
More than what is Just and Right, that he
In Judgment enter should with God,
As if he punished causelessly.
12.
Shall not the Judge of all the Earth,
Do right, else '^ unrighteous He:
How shall he Judge the World, and how
By him shall others judged be.
God Incomprehensible. To the Tune of the 100. Psalm.
Job 11. 7, 8, 9. and 36. 26.
1.
Can thou by searching find out God?
Can thou unto Perfection?
By searching find out him who is,
So Great, and the Almighty one.
2.
God's Wisdom, which is God himself,
It is as high as Heaven for height:
Then perfectly to find it out,
What can thou do withal thy might.
3.
Than Hell it is deeper, what can know?
The measure longer is also,
Than the Earth, and broader than the Sea,
What then to find it out can do?
4.
Behold God he is great, and him
Not know nor comprehend can we:
Nor can the number of his Years,
Once searched out by any be.
Gods magnifying of Man, and therein his great Condescension.
Job 7. 17, 18. 36. 5.
1.
LOrd what is Man that magnify,
Thou should such a one?
And that being so mean thou should,
Him thine Heart set upon?
2.
And that thou should visit him,
Each Morn successively:
And every Moment that thou should,
Vouchsafe him for to try.
Behold God he is great, and yet
He don't despise any:
In Strength and Wisdom, Mighty, and
He hates Tyranny.
Wisdom it is of God.
Job 38. 36. 32. 7, 8, 9.
WHo is it that Wisdom has put,
Within the inward Parts?
Or saving Understanding who,
Has given it to the Heart?
I said that Days should speak, and Years
When many Wisdom teach:
But great Men are not always Wise,
Nor the Aged Judgment reach.
But there is in Man a Spirit, and
The Inspiration:
That gives him Understanding it is,
Of the Almighty one.
Affliction from God.
Job 5. 6, 7, 8.
SUrely Affliction does not,
Come forth out of the Dust,
Nor Trouble Spring out of the Ground,
But higher look we must.
Yet Man is unto Trouble Born,
As upwards Sparks do fly:
I would seek unto God, to God
My Cause commit would I.
For He it is that does perform,
What is appointed me:
Of such Proceedings, and with Men
Many the like there be.
Gods Way with the Righteous.
Job 36. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
1.
GOd from the Righteous does not,
Withdraw his Eyes, no nor his Care,
But them on high he does exalt,
And they also established are.
2.
And if in Fetters they be bound,
And in Afflictions Cords, held be,
He then shows them their Work, and that
Their Sins exceeded, makes them see.
3.
He unto Discipline their Ears,
Also he opens unto,
And them commands, that return
They from Iniquity then do.
4.
If that they do obey him, and
Do serve him in Sincerity:
Their Years in Pleasures they shall spend,
And their Days in Prosperity.
5.
But if that they do not obey,
They shall the Sword then perish by:
And for their inadvertency,
Yea, and their Folly they shall Die.
There Is no contending with God.
Job 33. 13.
1.
BEhold God greater is then Man,
And who then shall against him strive:
For of his Matters an Account,
Not unto any does he give.
Job 40. 8, 9.
2.
Shall he that with the Almighty does,
Contend by him instructed be:
Who ever dares him to reprove,
It at his Peril answer he
3.
Will thou my Judgment disanul,
Will thou condemn and censure me:
As if that I unrighteous were,
That thou thy self may righteous be.
4.
Have thou an Arm like unto God?
With him in Power caust thou vie:
Or can thou Thunder like him with,
A Voice of such Excellency.
5.
Deck now thy self with Majesty,
And also with Excellency:
And do thy self also array,
With Glory, yea, and with Beauty.
6.
The rage of thy Wrath cast abroad,
And every one behold and see:
That proud and haughty is and him,
By Thee abased let him be.
7.
On every one look on thus so,
And do thou him also bring low:
And in their Place do thou tread down,
Even all that wickedly still do.
8.
Do thou then slay even every one,
And intoth' Grave together throw:
In secret bind their Faces so,
As unto the dead they use to do.
9.
Now if that thou these things can do,
Then I confess will unto Thee:
That thine own right Hand, can thee save
And then may thou contend with me.
As concerning Man. Man's sinfulness, vileness, unworthiness and worthlesness.
Job 4. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
1.
SHall Man, who Mortal is, then God
More Just, and Righteous be?
And shall a Man more pure be,
Then he whose make is he.
2.
Behold he in his Angels saw,
No Trust reposed to be:
His Angels though so Holy, yet
With Folly charge He.
3.
How much less then on them that dwell,
In Houses but of Clay:
Which founded are inth' Dust, before
The Moth crushed are they.
4.
From Morning, even unto the Even,
They still destroyed be:
For ever perish, and yet who
That it Regards is He?
5.
Does not their Excellency which,
Is in them go away.
And they do without Wisdom die,
And soon hence pass away.
Job 9. 20, 30, 31.
6.
If I my self do justify,
Even my own Mouth shall me
Condemn, if perfect, I do say,
Perverse it shall prove me.
7.
If with Snow-water I me wash,
And Hands clean make to be:
In The Ditch thou shall me plunge and my,
Own Clothes abhor shall me.
Job 15. 14, 15, 16.
8.
Oh what is Man, poor sorry Man?
So that clean should be he:
And who is of a Woman Born,
That Righteous he should be.
9.
Behold he puts no Trust in's Saints,
Who Angels are of Light:
Yea not the Heavens, nor Stars of Heaven,
Are pure in his sight.
10.
How much abominable more,
Is Man, and filthy he:
Who as the Fish does Water, so
Does drink Iniquity.
Job 40. 4, 5.
11.
Behold Lord. I am vile,
What shall I answer Thee:
I Will lay my Hand upon my Mouth,
And silent I will be.
12.
Indeed once have I spoke,
But answer will not I,
Yea twice, but further answer shall,
No more be made by me.
Job 42. 5, 6.
13.
By the hearing of the Ear,
Of Thee Lord heard have I:
But now mine Eye Thee sees, therefore
Abhor my Self do I.
14.
In Du^^ and Ashes, and
I do Repent, for I:
Have uttered things that are beyond,
Far my Capacity.
Job 9. 2, 3.
Before God how should Man be just,
None just with him can be:
Him of a Thousand if contend,
Not one can answer He.
Man's Frailty, and Mortality, the Brevity of his Life, and impossibility of his
Return hither again.
Job 7. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
1.
THe Weavers Shuttle that is swift,
But Man's Days swifter be:
And spent they are, and that without
Hope of Recovery.
2.
O God remember that my Life,
Is Wind, unsteady, vain:
And going hence, mine Eye no more,
Good here shall see again.
3.
As is consumed the Cloud, and does
Vanish away, even so:
He shall come up no more from thence,
That down to the Grave does go:
4.
He shall return no more unto,
His House, where once he were:
Neither for ever any more:
His Place shall know him there.
5.
The Eye of him that has him seen,
Here him no more shall see:
Thine Eyes they are upon him, and
No longer here is He.
Job 9. 25, 26.
6.
Man's Days are swifter then a Post,
They see no good, away
They flee, as the swift Ships they pass,
As the Eagle hasts toth' Prey.
Job 14. 1, 2, 3. 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
7.
Man of a Woman that is born,
He is of few Days here:
And those his Days, though few they be,
They full of trouble are.
8.
He like a Flower comes forth,
And soon down is he cut:
He also as a Shadow flees,
And here continues not.
9.
And do thou upon such a one,
So much as open thine Eyes:
And into Judgment with Thee bring,
Who fails so soon and Dies.
10.
Man's Days determined are, his Months,
They numbered are by Thee:
His Bounds thou have appointed, and
Those Bound pass cannot He.
11.
There Is hope of a Tree if cut down,
That it again will Sprout:
And that the tender Branch thereof,
Will not cease but put out.
12.
Tho'th' Root thereof, wax old inth' Earth,
And Stock in the Earth does Die:
Yet through the scent of the Water it,
Will Bud and multiply.
13.
But Man he dies and wastes away,
Yea Man gives up, we see
The Ghost, and when he gives up,
The Ghost, then where is he?
14.
As from the Sea, the Waters fail,
Floods dry up, and decay:
So Man he lies down, and not,
Rise up again shall they.
15.
Until the Heavens shall be no more,
Not once awake they shall:
Nor out of their long Sleep shall they,
Be raised up at all.
16.
Surely the Mountain falling comes
To naught, moulders away:
And the Rock Removed out of it is Place,
Where over thrown, does stay.
11.
The Waters wear the Stones, the things
That out of the Earth do grow,
Away thou wastrest and the hope,
Of Man destroyed is so.
12.
For ever thou against him do,
Prevail, and passes he:
His Countenance thou changest and,
Away he is sent by Thee.
13.
His Sons they unto Honor come,
And it he does not know:
Neither perceives he this of them;
When that they are brought low.
14.
But this is Man's Condition here,
His Flesh on him has Pain:
Also his Soul within him, that
Shall Mourn, Man's surely vain.
Job 21. 23, 24, 25, 26, 33.
21.
One Dies in his full Strength when he,
Finds not the least decay:
But is at ease, and Nature strong,
And vigorous every way.
22.
Another Dies in bitterness,
Of Soul and Agony:
And never does he eat but with
Grief and Anxiety.
23.
They both shall in the Dust lie down,
And both alike shall fare:
The Worms devouring both in the Grave,
No difference is there.
24.
And as innumerable are,
Those that before are gone:
So every Man shall after them
Draw, and escape shall none.
25.
If God against Man sets his Heart,
No longer here to be:
If that his Spirit to himself,
And Breath gather does He.
26.
All Flesh together perish shall,
Yea all then perish must:
And of Necessity they all,
Must turn again toth' Duft.
What is Man's Wisdom.
Job 28. 1, 2, 5, 6, 12, 28.
1.
SUrely for Silver there is a Vein,
A Place for Gold, which Men refine,
Out of the Earth is took Iron,
Brass molten is out of the Stone.
2.
From the Earth comes Bread, from under it
Is Fire turned up as it were:
It Is Stones the Place of Saphires are,
And Dust of Gold, it is found there, etc.
3.
Thus in great Measure Man indeed,
Has Skill and Wisdom to find out:
The Works of Nature, and of Art,
Contrivemnts for to bring about.
4.
But as for the Wisdom sublime,
With which the World God govern does:
That comprehend cannot any one,
It Is God's Prerogative alone.
5.
But though that Wisdom so sublime,
Unto himself Reserved has he:
There is a Wisdom God commends,
And of which capable are we.
6.
And this God has declared to Man,
The fear o'th* Lord behold that is:
Man's Wisdom and for to depart,
From Evil Understanding is.
The Godlies submissiveness under the afflicting Hand of God.
Job 1. 21, 22. 2. 10.
1.
NAked out of my Mothers Womb,
Into the World I came:
And Naked out of the World shall I,
Return to the Earth again,
2.
The Lord he gave, and the Lord has
Taken again away:
And the Name of the Lord, that has
Done both be, blessed for Aye.
Good at the Hand of God shall we,
Receive, and shall not we:
Evil also receive if that,
On us inflicteth He.
Job 5. 17, 18, 12.
Behold the Man is Happy, whom
The great God does Correct:
Therefore the Almighties chastening:
Despise not, nor reject.
For sore he mak'th, and the sore
He makes, binds up He:
Also he wounds, and his Hand
The Wound whole makes to be.
In Trouble, yea in Troubles Six,
He shall deliver Thee:
Yea, even in seven, that thou shall with,
No Evil touched be.
Job 34. 31, 32.
Surely if God Chastise, it is meet,
That say to him do we:
We have Chastisement Born, and we
No more offend will Thee.
That which I see not, teach thou me,
If I Iniquity
Have in Time past done, yet now it
No longer do will I.
The Godlies Hope and Happiness.
1.
I Know that my Redeemer lives,
Yea Lives for ever, and
That at the latter Day even He,
Upon the Earth shall stand.
2.
And though after my Skin, destroyed
By Worms this Body be:
Yet in my Flesh, yea in my Flesh,
I surely God shall see.
3.
Whom I shall see even for my self,
Yea mine own Eyes shall see:
And not another, though my Reins,
Consumed within me be.
Job 14. 14, 15.
4.
If Man once Die, shall he again
Yet live, then as for me:
All Days of my appointed Time,
I Will wait till my Change be.
5.
Thou shall me call out of the Grave,
And I will answer Thee:
And thou the Work wilt of thine Hands,
Have a desire to see.
Job 13. 15, 16.
Although he slay me, yet in him,
Repose my Trust will I:
But I before him will maintain,
My Ways Sincerity.
He also shall even he himself,
Be my Salvation:
For who is an Hypocrite, before
His Face he shall not come.
Job 8. 10, 11, 12.
1.
Behold God will not cast away,
A perfect Man, nor will:
His help afford to any such,
Who doers are of ill.
2.
Until with Laughing he shall please,
Thy Mouth even for to fill:
Yea with rejoicing also shall,
Thy Lips replenish still.
3.
They that Thee hate, they shall be clothed,
With shame, and come to naught:
The dwelling place of the Wicked shall,
Not be found though it is sought.
Job 35. 14.
Although thou say and do complain.
That him thou shall not see:
Yet Judgment him before, therefore
Thy Trust in him let be.
The Godly not secure.
1.
THe thing is come to me which I,
Did greatly fear would be:
And that which I afraid was of,
That is come unto me.
2.
Secure I was not, neither
Supinely did I rest:
Nor quiet was I, trouble yet
Came to me when at best.
Concerning the Godly, their Integrity.
Job 23. 10, 11, 12.
1.
THe way the Lord knows, that I take
When he has tried me:
As Gold when it is tried, such
My coming forth shall be.
2.
My Foot has held his Steps, his way
Have kept, declined not I:
From the Commandment of his Lips,
Neither gone back have I.
3.
More than my necessary Food,
The Words esteemed have I:
Which did proceed out of his Mouth,
So much by me set by.
Job 27. 3, 4, 5, 6.
4.
As God does live, even all the while,
That my Breath is in me:
And in my Nostrils, that of God,
The Spirit bides in me.
5.
My Lips shall not speak wickedness,
Nor Tongue utter Deceit:
Nor from me my Integrity,
Till Death from me depart.
6.
My Righteousness I do hold fast,
And will not let it go:
My Heart it shall not me Reproach,
So long as live I do.
Job 31. 1, 2, 3, 4, 23.
7.
I made a Covenant with mine Eye^,
And why then think should I:
Upon a Maid, my Heart with Lust,
For to inflame thereby.
8.
For from above what Portion,
Of God, is there said I:
And from on high what Heritage,
Is there of the Almighty.
9.
Is not Destruction unto,
The Wicked and also:
A Punishment that is strange to those,
Iniquity that do.
10.
Does not he see my ways, and all
My goings ponder he:
Yea even my Steps, yea all my Steps,
By him they counted be.
11.
Destruction from the great God,
That did me Terrify:
And by reason of his Highness,
Endure could not I*
Job 17. 8.
12.
Hold on his way the Righteous shall,
And not turn back shall he:
And he that has clean Hands he shall,
Stronger and stronger be.
Concerning the Hypocrite.
Job 8. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
1.
CAnth' Rush without Mire grow up,
Can without Water grow:
The Flag whiles green, before cut down,
They both soon wither do.
2.
So are the Paths, though flourishing,
Of all that God forget:
And the Hope of the Hypocrite,
Shall perish, who shall let?
3.
His Hope shall be cut off, his trust
A Spiders Web shall be:
Lean on his House he shall, but stand
It shall not, nor steadfast be.
Job 27. 8, 9, 10.
4.
What is the Hope of the Hypo^rite,
Though he has gained, when:
That God does take away his Soul,
Will God his Cry hear then?
When trouble comes, himself will he,
In the Almighty delight:
Will always he call upon God,
Constantly and aright?
Job 36. 13, 14, 15.
5.
The Hypocrites in Heart, that are
Void of true Piety:
They heap up Wrath, and when God them
Does bind, they do not cry.
6.
They Die in Youth, Prime of their Days
How often is it so:
And when they Die, they Die even as,
The worst of Sinners do.
7.
But such as Poor in Spirit are,
In their Affliction:
He does deliver, and their Ear,
Ope's in Oppression.
The Benefits of acquainting our selves with God, and when he gives Peace.
Job 22. from ver. 22. to the end.
1.
DO now acquaint thy self with God,
At Peace and with him be:
Thereby good, yea all good, so far
As good, shall come to thee.
2.
The Law which from his Mouth proceeds,
Do thou receive I Pray:
Also his Words within thy Heart,
See that thou lay up there.
3.
If toth' Almighty thou return,
Then built up thou shall be:
And from thy Tabernacles far,
Shall put Iniquity.
4.
Then thou shall lay up Gold as Dust.
And Gold of Ophir so:
As Stones of the Brook, so far as shall
Thy good conduce unto.
5.
Yea the Almighty he shall be
Thy Gold, and unto thee
Defense, and then thy Silver that,
Of Strength shall Silver be.
6.
For then thou shall have thy delight,
In the Almighty so:
As that thou shall then unto God,
Thy Face lift up unto.
7.
Thou shall thy Prayer make unto him,
And hear thee, then shall he:
And unto him the Vows thou made,
They shall performed be.
8.
Thou shall Decree a thing, and it
Established shall be:
And then the Light in all thy Ways,
Shall clearly shine on thee.
9.
When that Men are cast down, then thou
There Is lifting up shall say:
And God the humble Person shalf,
Save surely in that Day.
10.
Yea being innocent thou shall,
Thy self not only save:
But being pure, others shall,
By thee Deliverance have.
Job 34. v. 29.
11.
When that the Lord gives quietness,
Who can make trouble then:
And when that he does hide his Face,
Who can behold him then.
12.
Whether that it be done against,
Even a whole Nation:
Or whether it is only against,
A man, it is all one.
Job 12. 10.
13.
In the Hand of the Lord's the Soul,
Of every living thing:
And in his Hand of all Mankind,
The Breath and the Being.
Rest in the Grave.
Job 3. 17, 18, 19.
INth' Grave from troubling wicked cease,
At Rest the weary are:
There Prisoners Rest together, and
Oppressors Voice don't hear.
The small and great are th^re, for Death
Seizes on all Degrees:
And there who was a Servant here,
Is from his Master free.
The Misery of the Wicked.
Job 4. 8, 9.
1.
THey that Iniquity do Plow,
And Wickedness do Sow:
They certainly shall reap the same,
A just Reward thereto.
2.
They perish by the blast of God,
So them we perish see:
And of his Nostrils by the Breath,
They soon consumed be.
3.
Wrath it does kill the foolish Man,
Envy the silly one:
Though he take root, yet cursed is
His Habitation.
Job 11. 20.
4.
The Eyes of the Wicked they shall fail,
And not escape shall they:
And as the giving up of the Ghost,
Their Hope such shall it be.
Job 20. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. To the Tune 100. Psalm.
1.
KNow we not this, and that of old,
Since Man the Earth was placed upon:
That short the Wickeds Triumph is,
His Joy a Moment, and soon gone.
2.
Though his Excellency mounts up,
And to the Heavens advanced be:
And his Head reach unto the Clouds,
In Glory and Prosperity.
3.
Yet even like unto his own doing,
For evermore perish shall He:
And they who have him seen shall say,
Where is he to be found not he.
4.
He as a Dream shall flee away,
And he no more here found shall be:
Yea as a Vision of the Night,
Away so chased shall he be.
5.
The Eye also which did him see,
That Eye no more here him shall see:
Nor shall his Place here any more,
Behold him, where he used to be.
6.
Though Wickedness in's Mouth be sweet,
Under his Tongue, though hid it be:
Though it he spares, and don't forsake,
But still within his Mouth keeps he.
7.
Yet in his Bowels turned is,
His Meat it is in him also:
Even as the deadly Gall of Asps,
Even that which he would not forgo.
8.
In height of his Prosperity,
And fullness of Sufficiency:
He yet shall be in straits, on him
From the Wicked shall come Misery.
9.
When that he is about to fill,
His Belly then shall God on him,
Cast of his Wrath the Fury sore:
And Rain while eating, on him store.
10.
This and much more the Portion is,
Of him a Wicked Man that is:
And that from God, and the Heritage,
By him appointed it is this.
The Misery of the Wicked.
Job 18. 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21.
1.
THe Wicked's Light shall be extinct,
His Sparks to shine none long shall see:
The Light in's House it shall be dark,
His Lamp with him put out shall be.
2.
His Steps of Strength shall straightened be,
By his own Counsel fall shall he:
By his own Feet into a Net,
He Is cast, and on a Snare walks he.
3.
Terrors on every side shall him,
Affright to's Feet be driven shall he:
His Strength for Hunger shall decay,
At's side Ruin shall ready be.
4.
Out of his Tabernacle shall,
His Confidence rooted out be:
And unto Death of Terrors King,
With Terrors great be brought shall he.
5.
His Roots shall be dried up beneath,
Above his Branch cut of shall he:
His Memory quite perish shall,
No Name have in the Street shall he.
6.
From Light he into Darkness shall,
Be driven, and chased out hence shall be:
Who after him do come they shall,
Astonished and affrighted be.
7.
Surely such of the Wicked are,
The dwellings, and this is also:
The Place of such a one who ere,
He is that God aright don't know.
Job 21. 17, 18.
8.
How often of the Wicked is put out,
The Candle, yea also how often
Does their Destruction come on them,
Yea and they are soon brought to naught.
9.
God in his Anger, Sorrows gives,
Also as Stubble such are they:
Before the Wind, and as the Chaff,
Which soon the Storm carries away.
Some Caveats.
Job 36. 18, 19, 20.
1.
BEcause there is Wrath, beware least He,
By his stroke take away does Thee:
For then a Ransom though it be great,
Can by no means deliver Thee.
2.
Will he esteem thy Riches, no
Nor yet thy Gold esteem will He:
Nor yet of strength the forces all,
How great soever they may be.
3.
Do not the Night of Death desire,
Rashly, nor unadvisedly:
When Multitudes are in their Place,
Though settled, cut off suddenly.
4.
Take heed and see to it, that thou,
Do not regard Iniquity:
But rather than Iniquity,
Choose thou the greatest Misery.
The Benefit of Repentance upon Gods chastening of Man.
Job 33. 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
1.
WHen that Man chastned is with pain,
And his Flesh is consumed away:
Yea and his Soul, to the Grave draws near,
And's Life to who destroyers are.
2.
If then there be a Messenger,
With him, a choice Interpreter:
To show unto him what is right,
And what is pleasing in God's sight.
3.
Which is for to bewail his Sin,
And humbly it confess, and so:
As that he it forsakes also,
And unto God for Mercy goes.
4.
Then he is gracious unto him,
And says from the Pit deliver him:
That he to it do not go down,
For that a Ransom I have found.
5.
Then he recover shall, and Pray
To God, and he to him shall be:
Propitious, and he is Face
With Joy and Gladness then shall see.
6.
He looks upon Men, and if
Any does say, that sinned has he:
And have perverted what was right,
And it no ways did profit me.
7.
From going down into the Pit,
His Soul deliver then will he:
Yea and his Life shall with great Joy,
The Light which is so pleasant see.
8.
Lo all these Things often works God,
With Man, his Soul from the Pit to bring:
That he enlightened may be,
And that with the Light of the Living.
Job 11. from v. 12. to the 20.
9.
God knows vain Man, sees wickedness
And it consider will not he?
For vain Man would be wise, though Man
Like a wild Asses Colt born be.
10.
If that thou do prepare thine Heart,
And toward God stretch out thine Hand:
Put far away Iniquity,
And let it not still dwell with Thee.
11.
Then with an holy Confidence,
Into his Presence thou shall come;
And then established thou shall be,
Even in a safe Condition.
12.
Then thou thy Misery shall forget,
As Waters that do pass away:
And then shall shine forth, and thine Age,
Be clearer then is the Noonday.
13.
And then thou shall secure be,
Because in God thy Hope have thee:
Yea then as dig'd about shall be,
And shall thy rest take in Safety.
14.
Also thou shall lie down, and then
Afraid not any shall make thee:
Yea, for thy favor and good will,
Many to thee shall suitors be.
The Wicked's Prosperity, together with the Brevity and Uncertainty thereof.
Job 9. 24.
1.
THe Earth is given into the Hand,
Of such as Wicked are:
And such as are Ungodly have,
Of it the greatest share.
Job 21. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
2.
The Wicked live, grow Old, and they
In Power mighty be:
Their Seed also established is,
And that their Eyes do see.
3.
Their Houses they are safe from fear,
God's Rods not them upon:
Yea all about them prosper well,
Miscarry does not one.
4.
Their little ones like to a Flock,
For number send forth they:
Their Children Dance, and unto them,
The choicest Musicks Play.
5.
They spend their Days in Wealth, and who
Live merrier Lives than they:
And easy Deaths do Die for the^
Like Lambs do Die Men say.
6.
Therefore they say, to God from us
Depart, a dreadful say:
For we desire not, not we,
The Knowledge of thy Ways.
7.
What Is the Almighty that we him,
Should serve, and who is He:
And what gain is it, we should have
If Pray to him do we?
8.
Yet lo their Goods not in their Hand,
But in God's hand, and He:
Their Houses fills with Good therefore,
Their Counsel's far from me.
Job 24. v. 23, 24, 25.
9.
Though it be given them for to be,
In safety whereupon:
They rest and are secure, yet,
Their Ways Gods Eyes are on.
10.
They are exalted, but it is
But for a little while,
They soon are gone, and are brought low,
And hence away they go.
11.
They taken are out of the way,
Even so as others are:
And are cut off, as are of Corn,
Cut off the Tops of the Ears.
12.
And if that now it be not so,
A Liar who will make me:
And make that which I now have said,
Of no worth for to be.
The Spouses Description of her Beloved.
Cant. 1. 13, 14. Cant. 1. 3. Cant. 2. 1, 3.
1.
OF Myrrh like to a bundle is,
My well beloved to me:
Betwixt my Breasts even all the Night,
His lodging Place shall be.
2.
Most sweet and precious unto me,
Is my Beloved one:
Even as a Cluster of Camphire,
The pleasant^st Places on.
3.
His Names as Ointment poured forth,
Because of the sweet smell:
Of his good Ointments, therefore do
The Virgins love him well.
4.
Of Roses he the Rose is chief,
The Rose of Sharon's He:
And He of Lilies is the choice,
That in the Valleys be.
5.
As the Apple Tree among the Trees,
That in the Wood do grow:
Among the Sons, even all the Sons,
My well-belov'd is so.
6.
Under his Shadow I sat down,
With great delight also:
His Fruit sweet and delicious,
My Palate was unto.
7.
With flaggons stay me and support,
With Apples comfort me:
For I am ready even to faint,
So greats my Love to thee.
8.
Toth' Banqueting House he me brought,
Unto the House of Wine:
And there his Love was over me,
As Banner and Ensign.
9.
My well beloved is mine, and He.
Both Hands emploies for me:
His left Hand that's under my Head,
His Right embraces me.
10.
A Fountain even of Gardens is,
My well beloved one:
A Well of Living Waters, and
As Streams from Lebanon.
11.
My-Love is White, and Ruddy, chief*
Of Ten Thousand is he:
His Head's as Gold most fine, his Cheeks,
As Beds of Spices be.
12.
As Flowers sweet, dropping sweet Myrrh,
His Lips as Lilies be:
His Mouth's most sweet, yea and he is,
Wholly and all lovely.
13.
This is my well beloved one,
And this he is my Friend:
O Daughters of Jerusalem,
Whom I to you commend.
The Spouses sweet resolve.
Chap. 4. 6.
1.
UNtil the Day do break, and that
The Shadows, they away do flee:
And darknesses dispersed are,
Which do at present cover me.
2.
I will unto the Mountains get,
Of Myrrh, yea and unto the Hill:
Of Frankincense, I Will have recourse,
And there my self solace I will.
3.
My well beloved, he is mine,
His Life he has laid down for me:
And I am his to Love and serve,
And Praise to him for ever be.
4.
Worthy the Lamb is to receive,
Due Honor, Power and Glory:
For he was slain, and by his Blood,
To God he has redeemed us by.
The Requests of the Spouse to her Beloved.
Cant. 1. 2.
1.
LEt with the Kisses of his Mouth,
My well-belov'd kiss me:
For I far better do than Wine,
Thy Love esteem to be.
2.
O draw thou me, and readily
We will run after thee:
The King into his Chamber has,
Brought and conducted me:
3.
We will be glad, and great in thee,
Shall our rejoicing be:
Thy Love remember more than Wine,
The upright they Love Thee.
4.
Tell me, O thou whom my Soul loves,
Where thou do feed, and where:
At Noon thou make thy Flocks to rest,
With heat when scorched they are.
5.
For why should I be as is one,
Who turns aside unto:
The Assemblies of false Teachers, who
Corrupt true. Doctrine do.
6.
If thou know not, O thou who art,
The fairest of Women:
Follow the Footsteps of the flock,
Feed and abide there then.
7.
O set me as a Seal upon,
Thine Heart as a Seal on:
Thine Arm, for Love is strong as Death,
And Zeals flame, quench can none.
8.
Make have my well beloved who art,
The Spicy Mountains on:
And be like to a Roe, or a
Young Heart, O swiftly come.
Gods exceeding and incomprehensible Greatness and Majesty.
Out of Isaiah 40. 12, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23, 28.
1.
THe Waters in the hollow of
His Hand, measured has He:
With span Heaven meted out, Earth's Dust
Holds in a measure He.
2.
The Mountains He in Scales has weighed,
In Balances the Hills:
He takes up the Isles even as
A very little thing.
3.
Behold even as a Buckets drop,
The Nations are so:
And as the Balances small Dust,
Him they are counted to.
4.
And Lebanon though it is so full,
Of Wood, it don't suffice
To burn, nor are the Beasts thereof,
Enough for Sacrifice.
5.
All Nations before him are,
As nothing and they be:
As less than nothing, unto him
Counted and Vanity.
6.
He sits on the Circle of the Earth,
As Grasshoppers they be:
Who dwell therein, Heavens stretches out,
As Tents and Curtains He.
7.
The Princes, and the Potentates,
To nothing brings He:
The Judges also of the Earth,
He makes as Vanity.
8.
To whom then will ye liken God,
Or what likeness will ye:
Compare to him, who is so great,
And of such Majesty.
9.
And blessed be his glorious Name,
His glorious Name always:
Which is exalted far above,
All Blessing and all Praise.
The Mystery of Godliness, to be Sung on Sacrament Days.
1 Timothy 3. 16.
1.
THe Mystery of Godliness,
Without Controversy:
Is great, God he was manifest,
In our Humanity.
2.
And though he but as Man appeared,
And mean in the World's Eye,
He justified yet as God,
Was, by his Deity.
3.
In that he by the Power thereof,
Himself raised from the Dead:
And so from the guilt of our Sins charged,
On him, was acquitted.
4.
And he was of the Angels seen,
With deep Inspection:
Yea of them was he seen, with height,
Of Admiration.
5.
That he should condescend so low,
As on him for to take:
Our Humane Nature, and be made
Himself who all did make.
6.
And being so of Angels seen,
Preached also was he:
Yea to the Gentiles preached was he,
And that is a Mystery.
7.
And being Preached in the World,
Believed on was He:
And into Glory up was he,
Received triumphantly.
8.
We Captives were* yea under went,
The worst Captivity:
Himself and Life a Ransom he,
Gave for our Liberty.
An Hymn after the Sacrament.
Revel. 1. 5.
1.
NOw unto him that loved us,
To him that loved us so:
As from our Sins, to wash us in,
His Blood, and make us to.
2.
God and his Father, Kings and Priests,
To him ascribed be:
For ever and for evermore,
Dominion and Glory.
3.
Glory to God in the highest be,
That Men on Earth have Peace:
And for his great Good Will toward Men,
Let Praises never cease.
4.
Ye Cherubims and Seraphims,
Still Hallelujah Cry:
Yea Hallelujahs still again,
Sound forth perpetually.
5.
To him that sits upon the Throne,
And to the Lamb still be:
For ever, and for ever more,
Praise Honor and Glory.
Another Sacramental Hymn.
1.
FRom God the Father, and also,
From Jesus Christ the Lord:
May Grace and Mercy be to us,
We wish with one accord.
2.
Who did himself give for our Sins,
A Sacrifice to be:
That from this present evil World,
Might be delivered we.
3.
According to the Will of God,
Our Father, this did He:
To whom for ever Glory be,
Amen, Amen, say we.
4.
God his own Son, he did not spare
His only Son not He:
No not his well beloved Son,
A Sacrifice to be.
5.
That we might Live, him unto Death
For us give up did he:
Yea his whole Wrath, he poured on him,
Us from it for to Free.
Another Sacramental Hymn.
John 3. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
1.
AS Moses in the Wilderness,
The Serpent lifted up on high:
Even so the Son of Man he must,
Be lift up on the Cross, and why?
2.
That who so on him does believe,
And that whosoever he be:
He should not perish, but should live;
And that to all Eternity.
3.
For God so loved the World to which,
No Parallel can ever be:
That his only begotten Son,
To be a Sacrifice gave he:
4.
For God not to condemn the World,
Did send into the World his Son:
But did him send that so the World,
Through him might have Salvation.
5.
When that we were yet without Strength,
In due Time Jesus Christ did Die:
Which was the Time God did appoint,
And that even for the Ungodly:
6.
For scarcely for a Righteous Man,
Will one be willing for to Die:
Yet for a good Man some perhaps,
To suffer Death may not deny.
7.
But God commends his Love toward us,
Yea so his Love commends He:
That even whiles, yet Sinners we were,
Christ died that so live might we.
8.
Christ from the Curse of the Law has us,
Redeemed, yea Redeemed us so:
That to be made a Curse for us,
He did himself submit unto.
9.
And that for us a Curse he was,
Herein it does appear to be:
Because it is written every one,
Is Cursed that hangs on a Tree.
10.
That so the Blessing of Abraham,
Through Christ, the Gentiles might come on:
That we through Faith, the Promise of
The Spirit might receive each one.
An Hymn for the Spirit and Grace.
1.
US with thy loving Kindness Lord,
And with thy tender Mercies Crown:
And on us Lord be pleased thy Grace,
Abundantly for to pour down.
2.
Like to a watered Garden Lord,
Do thou our Souls make for to be:
Their Savor also like unto,
A Field that is blessed by thee.
3.
Like Rain upon the Mowen Grass,
Come down on us, yea and no less:
Than Sh^wers on the Earth that it
Do Water, yea and much refresh.
4.
Be thou unto us as the Dew,
That like the Lilly grow may we:
And that even like to Lebanon
Our Roots even so cast forth may be.
5.
As thou have promised Lord do thou,
Pour Water on him that is thirsty:
Also no less, O Lord do thou,
Pour Floods upon the Ground that is dry.
6.
Do thou thy Spirit pour on us,
And pour thou it on our Offspring:
And both on us, and also them,
Do thou O Lord, pour thy Blessing.
7.
So Spring and Flourish then shall we,
As Grass in Meadows green we see:
Yea, and as Willows, and such Trees,
As by the Waters planted be.
8.
And blessed be thy glorious Name,
Yea blessed for ever, let it be:
The whole Earth, let thy Glory fill,
Amen, Yea and Amen say we.
Numb. 6. 23, 24, 25, 26.
1.
OThou who art the blessed one,
Be pleased to bless us so:
As Aaron, Israel to bless,
Thou did give Order to.
2.
The Lord us bless, and do us keep,
This is our Suite to Thee:
The Lord, his Face make shine on us,
And gracious to us be.
3.
The Lord grant that his Countenance,
On us lift up may be:
And let also we pray thee Peace,
Be given to us by thee.
4.
Our Days the Lord Knows, and with what
Here exercised are we:
And as our Days are, so Lord please,
To make our Strength to be.
God's Majesty and Severity against his Enemies.
Na^um 1. 3, 5, 6, 7.
1.
THe Lord is slow to Anger and,
In Power also great is He:
And not at all, the Wicked shall,
By him whiles such acquitted be.
2.
The Lord in the Whirlwind has his way,
And in the Storm, his way is there:
Yea, and the Clouds so numerous,
Even they the Dust of his Feet are.
3.
The Mountains they do Quake at him,
Yea, and the Hills they melt also:
The Earth's burnt at his Presence and,
The World, and all that dwell there do.
4.
Who is there that is able to stand,
Before his Indignation:
And in the fierceness of his Wrath,
Who is there can abide not one.
5.
His Fury so dreadful, is
Like unto Fire poured out:
And by him also are thrown down,
The Rocks that are so strong and stout.
6.
And yet the Lord is good, he Strength,
Inth' Day of Trouble is, and those:
He knows, and has respect unto,
Who do on him their Trust repose.
Our great Unworthiness.
WE do acknowledge Lord, to thee,
Of all the Mercies we:
And Truth which thou have shown to us,
We most unworthy be.
Thy Mercies Lord, they many are,
Both great, there are and small:
But we our selves, even we are less,
Than the least of them all.
Lord cloth us with Humility,
That Cloth becomes us well:
Who clothed are with Sin in us,
As Flesh, dwells no good Thing.
God's wonderful Respect to the Contrite and Humble.
THus says the high and lofty one,
Inhabiting Eternity:
Whose Name is great and glorious,
Most Reverend and Thrice Holy.
I* in the high and holy Place,
Do dwell, with him also dwell I:
That of a Contrite Spirit is,
And Clothed with Humility.
And that with him I dwell, it is that
Revive the Spirit I may so:
Of him that is humble, and the Heart,
Of him that is Contrite also.
An Hymn upon the failing of Creature Comforts.
THese broken Cisterns Lord they fail,
And Brooks dry up no less:
And therefore unto Thee, O Lord!
My Soul makes its Address.
For thou of Living Waters art,
The Fountain; and in Thee
When Brooks and broken Cisterns fail,
Our fresh Springs still have we.
When Beams are scattered in the Sun,
They fully made up be:
And Streams in the Fountain, when cut off
Yea all is made up in thee.
Thou art enough, even for thy Self,
Though Infinite thou be:
And how much more enough art for,
Such Finite ones as we.
Psalm 1.
1.
THe Man in wicked Men's advice,
Who walks not, blessed is thrice:
Nor stands there, where Sinners are,
Nor sets in the scornful's Chair.
2.
But in the Law of God the Lord,
Still is his great Delight:
And in his Law does meditate,
And that both Day, and Night.
3.
And he shall be, like to a Tree,
The Rivers planted by:
That in his Season, brings forth,
His Fruit abundantly.
4.
Yea, even his very Leaf also,
Shall not so much as fade:
And look whatsoever he does,
To prosper shall be made.
5.
As for such as ungodly are,
Lo they are nothing so:
But which the Wind drives away,
The Ch^^^ are like unto.
Therefore in the Judgment shall not stand,
Such as ungodly be:
Nor Sinner, of the Righteous,
In the Society.
6.
For the way of the Righteous, the Lord
Knows and approve does he:
But the way of Ungodly ones,
Quite overthrown shall be.
Petitions for observing God's Precepts.
1.
THou have commanded us to keep,
Thy Precepts carefully:
O that my Ways directed were,
So that them keep may I.
2.
Do thou uphold my goings Lord,
In those Paths that are thine,
That so my footsteps may not slip,
Nor from thy ways decline.
3.
O with thy Servant do thou deal,
So bountifully, Lord,
That I may live, and living may,
Observe and keep thy Word.
4.
With my whole heart, I have thee sought,
And so do still seek thee,
O! for to wander from thy Word,
Do not thou suffer me.
5.
Blessed art thou, O Lord, and we,
Bless, and Praise give to thee,
And do thou me, thy Statutes teach,
And blessed then shall I be.
6.
In thy Word let my Steps, O Lord,
Be ordered by thee;
And no Iniquity, let have,
Dominion over me.
7.
This I do firmly purpose, that
Thy Statutes keep will I,
O do not thou, I pray thee, Lord,
Forsake me utterly.
Psalm 23.
1.
THe Lord's my Shepherd, I shall not want,
He makes me down for to lie
In Pastures green, and he me leads
The calm and quiet Waters by.
2.
He does restore my Soul, and he.
For to return, my Soul does make:
He in the Path of Righteousness
Leads me, even for his own Names sake.
3.
Yea, though I walk through the Valley of
Death's Shadow, I will fear none ill,
For thou art with me, and thy Rod
And Staff, they both me comfort still.
4.
A Table thou prepar'st for me,
And that mine Enemies before;
Mine Head with Oil thou do anoint,
Also my Cup it runs over.
5.
Goodness and Mercy all my Days,
They follow me shall surely;
Yea, and in the House of the Lord,
For evermore still dwell will I.
6.
And blessed be thy glorious Name,
And that to all Eternity;
The whole Earth let thy Glory fill,
Amen, yea and Amen, say I.
The Conclusion.
1.
OF the whole Matter, both the End
And the Conclusion let us hear,
It Is God to fear, and him obey,
Man's whole, yea and his all lies there.
2.
For into Judgment every work,
And that with every secret thing,
Whether that it be good or bad,
God shall most certainly it bring.
3.
Our Days to number let us be,
Therefore, O Lord, so taught by thee,
That unto saving Wisdom then
Our Hearts with Care apply may we.
4.
The Lord, the God of Israel,
For evermore blessed be;
^^t Men and Angels say Amen,
Amen, yea, and Amen* say we.
FINIS.
