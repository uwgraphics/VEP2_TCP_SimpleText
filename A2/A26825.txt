Motions of the Cornish Men, and those of the South parts of the PRINCIPALITY,

bin most barbarously cruel.

LONDON PRINTED, Anno Dom. 1646.

For the Right Honorable, LORDS the Peers, and Gentlemen of the Honorable
House of COMMONS.
THe Author, as to the first part of his Animadversions touching the late
motions of the State, in the visible pursuance of Arbytrary power, presents
them not as news to a Court of Parliament, the evidence whereof being obvious
to all the world, only he ranckes them here in a new fyle, for satisfaction
of the incredulous Malignant, not capable to owane his own friends, neither
will be sensible what your indefatigable labors have been, or take notice of
the pains you have taken, during these four years, for Preservation of the
common freedom and liberties of the Kingdom.

As to the second part, which is a narrative, touching the War under the
conduct of major General Laughorns, it is offered to all of discerning
Judgments, how mirakculously Gods special providence has evidently appeared
as well in that particular of the County of Pembrook as in the General
prosperity of the Kingdoms arms.

The conclusive part, is both humbly monotory and petitionary, that, that poor
dessolated County, with the parts adjacent may be timely taken into your
compassionate consideration, and such a speedy course taken therein as may best
suit with your present great and urgent affairs: The inveterate fewds and
dissentions of this County, has been a great hindrance to the public
service, and if not timely composd, may be of a more dangerous consequence
The distressed condition whereof (through Gerrards cruelties) is truly laid
open unto you; as also the way of this Counties repair (in some competent
measure) humbly presented in a few Propositions, which may both rectify the
many grievances and dissentions of this County, together, with the disorder of
the Soldier; without other charging the State, or farther troubling, your
important Consultations, otherwise, then in your timely designation of some
honest and able Gentlemen, (as your Commissioners, to examine all grievances,
especially in the behalf of such, as have suffered in the loss of their whole
estates in the public service, and are at present reduced to extreme want and
penury, the care whereof in all humbleness is desired and left to your pious
providence, least the constant party there should be utterly disheartened, and
at such time, as there may be present use of their farther service, since
probable it is, that the Irish Rebels (on their late victory) may thrust over
such Forces into that County and Milford -Haven, as may turn the Skales of your
Victories here (if not timely prevented, by garding those Coasts with a strong
Fleet,) both the Welsh Nation, and English Malignants in the general
(howsoever now mastered) retaining still their wonted hearts, may in all
likelihood on all occasions join with the strongest.

And thus in all humility has the Author taken the boldness to present unto
your wisdoms the whole scope of his poor endeavors, and humbly craves farther
leave to concludewith the Oracles of two great Princes, wishing, that they may
profit such, as they most concern.

The strength of a King is the preservation of the State, King James his Speech
in Parliament, 1609.
the foundation thereof, is the people, and woe unto them, which devides the
weal of a King from that of the Kingdom.

How guilty the Delinquent and malignant party have been in the fomentation of
the present devisions, the appeal is made to their own Consciences, which
have most unnaturally invaded the people in their representative, and have
endeavored to deprive both King and Kingdom of their great Council.

Aequius est me tot, (...)
and talium amicorum consilium,

Arbiters, and his own conscience the faithful umpier.

Malignant with, etc.
Humbly adrest to the High Court of Parliament.
AFter so long a time in the mysterious s^erages of Court and State, during the
last, and of this reign; It is now confessed and known to all the Kingdom,
that the late dissolved Parliament, was assembled to one and the self same
end, as that of Ireland, was (somewhat before) by the late Deputy Straff^rd;
only to raise money for the managing of a most unnecessary and injurious War,
and as unadvisedly undertaken, against the Scots without any respect to the
general Reformation here either in Church or State, (both then grown sick
even to the very highth of sundry and various distemperatures, and as we may
safely judge, through the defects, and want of the due effects, of most of our
latter Parliaments, Courts, which have ever bin the great and supreme
regulating Counsels of this glorious Monarchy; As also in pursuance of the
grand design to make conclusions on the natives, by stealing in upon them (by
degrees) some innovations in their Church discipline, as Trials, or
precursions, to future encroachments, to be introduced in their Civil
Administrations, all conducing to bring in absolute power, throughout the three
Kingdoms, in one complete conformity to inthraldome. This Kingdom with that
of Ireland (having by finenesse of wit and the contrivance of cur late Artizans
of State) bin aforehand readily trained, and inured to the impatient sufferance
of Ship taxations and other arbitrary levyes, whilst that of Scotland
(different to the others in sundry points, of their fundamentalls, and the
soveranty, there some what incongruous to either) stood as a Remora, and in the
way of our grand Masters, and Ingeneeres of Court; The Scotts, being a people,
quick-sighted and incompactible to endure all changes and Innovation in
Government, necessarily made the work where to begin, so much the more
difficult, in this, that to reduce them to the like conformity, might in the
issue prove a dangerous engagement of both Nations in a direful war: This
being providently foreseen by the late. The late Parliament distasting this
War, were resolved to give the King ten Subsidies for a peace, rather then one

the Cabb. Council.
Royal pacification granted reperswaded the King topursue the design, in a
second preparation of war, contrary to his Majesty's faith given to the Scotts
Nobility, that they should remain as they were, without infringment of their
National Covenant instituted by the late King 1580. It is as precisely true,
that this Parliament (so much in the eye and odium of his Majesty's aversation,
and of so terrible an aspect to the many Delinquents) was at such a time
assembled, as that the Kings hopes and designs, (on the coming in of the
Scotts at Newborn 1640. were at an instant turned about to an after Game, or

season, and in the close of so long a calm of Peace and tranquillity, as the
three Kingdoms never yet attained unto; both the late King, and his Majesty

or such as our of the voluptuousnes of the times, and wantonness of the great
privadoes of Court were as rashly undertaken as vainly prosecuted, without
either sufficient grounds, or foresight of their issues; hence it is, as wise

Parliament was [out of necessity] to be assembled, neither the King, nor those
his seemingly wise and over-bold instruments could possibly discern the way
whither they would go, or how to drive on their designs, with any warrantable
hopes answerable to their expectation: In this perplexity and amidst the
concussion of both Nations [before generally in good terms of brotherly
affection one with the other] this so formidable and persecuted Parliament,
with that of Scotland, were then thought fit to be assembled, as the only means
remaining, both to recover, and enlarge the King, and to quiet the Kingdoms;

whence it was apparent, that the work became the more unweldy, and the knot of
Arbitrary contrivements, then more hard to be untyed by this Parliament, then
others formerly had ever bin accustomed unto: We need not press this on the
common belief, that Parliaments at any time, were otherwise pleasing to the
late King, then as the exegencies of his wants urged, their summons to serve
the present; for replenishing of his empty Coffers; nor that His now Majesty
would ever have summoned this in being, much less to make it perpetual, but
merely out of the extremity of inforcement to disingage himself of an
incombrance, from which, without a Parliament, there appeared then no medium to
recede, or any by way, whether he might handsomely make his retreat, whereas had
it been his Majesty's good fortune, to have been faithfully councelled, and at
his first accession rightly instructed, [as it was his ill fate always to be

Prince and people, that they be cherished and backed by the Royal authority, as
Courts which are the invincible pillars of the Royalty, and only buttrises of

certain it is that (of all humane causes) the primum mobile, of all our
Tragical sufferings, was His Majesty's aversation to that, which is the
inheritance of the kingdom (Parliaments) and the same which God, men, and the
laws of the Land required, and would have at such a time to be summoned, when

terrible continuance, as evidently portending the assured ruin of many both of
their hopes and fortunes: When certain it was, that the party adjuvant and
delinquent might both stand up, and shun the perrill, then imminently hanging
over their heads; a course of necessity, must be found out both how to quash
this so furious a Parliament (as then it was apprehended it would be) and
consequently to annihilate all others, that in time to come might be summoned
as obstackls, which might in the future hinder the growth of absolute power;
Omiting perticularities, It was then and now more manifestly known that the
Court contrivances, whereby to effect this great work of annihilation, were
many contiguous dangerous in their a^tempt and more daring, then ever have bin
attempted on any of our Parliaments, and such as were beyond common
expectation, and the belief of all men of sober judgment, could have bin
enterprized, against the great Council of the Kingdom. The wonder being so
much the more, that the King himself, should build his hopes on such feeble,
and uncertain foundations, as to set up his rest, on an enterprise of so
unlikly and improbable an archievement, as to graple with the power of the
Kingdom, then contracted, and compacted in its representative. But we pass
over, the ennumeration of the many various and sundry practices, as in order of
their invention, from time to time and without intermission they were put on
the trial of their execution; though, hitherto by divine providence they have
proved, fruitless in their effect, yet most remarkable it is, that on his
Majesty's recesse and deserting the House, and the bulk of the Parliaments
strength, then much maimed, lessened, and weakened; both in defect of the head,
and by so great a desection of the parts, and tergiversation of the Members *

part should notwithstanding beat up, in the defense of the publik interest and
amidst so many and powerful Interjections slight and vilipend, that ridiculous

this, so legally assembled. It must be acknowledged that Almighty God stood
with the cause and infused them with the spirit of courage, and that his
special providence, had a high hand in the conduct of their preservation: But
we must now look back and shall only touch on the maine contrivances in their

for raising of an Army whereby [on all formet failancies] by force of Arms, to
overpower this Parliament and as after it was resolved, to erect the Royal

then been in preparation to invade the State, pre-invaded, and only by those,
which should have defended it. We shall but only mention those Commissions,
sent into the North and other those remote parts, [thought then most apt to
second his Majesty's intentions, and most out of the noise of the people and
hearing of the Parliament) ignorant in the right understanding both of the
cause and artifices of Court and shall chiefly insist on those sent into the
West, as Commissioned to the Marquess of Hartford* his Brother, the Lord St.
Maure and Sir Ralph Hopton. These three Lords about July 1642. coming out of
the North, came first to Marlborough, summoning the Major and his Brethren, to
repair to their Lordships, they showed them their Commission of Array, but
found them more round then they expected, the town wholly standing up for the
Parliament, thence they bent their course immediately toward Bath, Bristoll,
and Wells, where the Inhabitant; were as averse to their Commissions, as to
submit their head to the block, though all three of them were in those
Countries both powerful in Tenancye, and generally in the good opinion and
affection of the people, but no sooner, appearing in this strange and unheard
of errand, but they became of despicable account, as the sequel thereupon
proved it to be most true, for they were shortly after beaten* and chased away
from Mendippe and Wells, whence, withal the strength they could possibly
raise, they retreated to the Castle of Sherborne (his Lordship Cottington, as
one of their grand assistants, not liking the business, took an occasion to
leave them the night before.) The Lords, with the rest of their Associats,
being there besieged, shortly after made an eruption, and in a confused march
of flight, [finding those parts to hot for their abiding, and nothing
conformable to their commissions] haste to Myniard, the whole Country rising
upon them: whereupon dividing themselves, Hopton, tending toward the Cornish
men [a sort of people Robustious, and in the general utterly unacquainted with
the ways and subtilties of Court] neither understanding the true state of the
Cause] were easily seduced by him. The other Lords, instead of better
sanctuary-betooke themselves to Sea and came to Cardiffe, thence to,
Carmarthin, and in all their fruitless journey visited most of the Towns of
South Wales, working on the forwardness, and facillity of the natives partly
by their oratory, and power of their Commissions, [a people as easily to be
seduced] were for the Major number, all soon won, and led away with the name
of the King* and his Authority abused, without looking into the nature of the
controvercy, and how merely it concerned them all to mind their own
preservation, in that of the safeguard of the common conservatory. The whole

Countries, some few Gentlemen of the Country of Pembrooke, neither appeared or
complied with their Lordships, but stood on their defenses, neither were they
above eight or ten at the most, which from the first beginning of the War* to
the present stood firm to the Parliament, when the Lords by the aid and
assistance of the Earl of Carberry and his party [powerfull in those parts]
conceived, that they had then overcome the greatest part of their work, having
forwarded and sent away, considerable numbers of the natives, to the King
before the Battle at Edge Hill, shortly thereupon [with such Regiments, as by
my Lord of Carberys means were raised, near and about Carmarthin, the
Counties of Cardican and Brocknock) they marched up to His Majesty at Oxford,
when the command of the Counties of Carmarthin, Cardican, and Pembrooke, fell
in dispute, between their Lordships of Carbury and Glamorgan, His Majesty in
conclusion, was pleased to confer that honor on his Lordsh. of Carbery as
Commander in chief under his highness the Prince; And Glamorgan then
Commissioned, for the Counties of Hereford, Menmouth, as next adjacent to
Ragland, where he had raised a considerable Army, and lay down at Heynham two
miles distant from the City of Gloucester, and about ten days before Easter,
1642. were all beaten and taken by Sir William Waller: The course, which
henceforth we intend to hold in the way of our Annimadversions, is to present
the principal Incendiaries, with the active sticklers, of every County within
the circuit of South Wales, as also those of quality which have stood firm to

Francis Loyd, (both shortly after Knighted at Oxford) the Attorney Jews, one

Divines, [which would have a share in the businesse] all of the County of
Carmarthin, were then noted as the most active sticklers, and setters on of my
Lord of Carbery, both to embrace the employment, and to have been the most
vehement traducers of the Parliament, as for the rest of other Counties,
together, which such plundering Commanders, as have assisted in this unnatural
War, we shall impartially and in their due place aford them a room in our
annimadversions, with a mark on their foreheads to be known to posterity: Only
I crave leave first to declare the occasion of mine and some-others of my
acquaintance, coming in to these parts, and how we came to be eye witnesses
of much, which I shall here present in the way of our Observations: And it was
thus; certain Gentlemen of ancient samiliarity, chanced to meet at Newbery,
about the time that both Armies quartered on all the Roads, westerly from
London, shortly after the sight at Brainford in November 1642. where we fell
into discourse, where the safest place of the Kingdom might be, to secure our
selves from the fury of the War, and our conclusion was, that near about the
center of South Wales, either at Brecknock or Carmarthin, would be the place
of our safest residence, wherein (on the upshot of our account) we were much
mistaken, howsoever some of us about Easter following, heareing of the drayning
of Walls of Men and Arms, and that the Lords (fled thither as before) were
all gone up to the King at Oxford, we took our journey into those parts, and
liking not our stay at Brecknock, where then Col. Harbert, Price with one
Iefferyes his Nephew, Stedman and most of the Gentry of that County were in
Arms for the King: we determined to move to Carmarthin, being there arived we
found the town Garisond with 2. or 3. hundred Soldiers under the command of
one Capt. Gwilliam, thence we resolved to remove some what farther, and
accidentally took up our Lodging at an English Gentleman's house, who had there
planted himself near upon 20. years before and one, Mr. White of Castle
Tough, enforced to fly to Sea, the Gentlewoman his Wife, by the tyranicall
insolency of the Soldier, frighted to her Grave, his Eldest Son barbarously
imprisoned, his second Son cut and, mangled, some of his servants wounded to
death in their own houses, the rest with all his poor Tenants enforced to fly
the country, and his many children left utterly destitute of all means to keep
them alive.

our departure miserably plundered on all sides, and more by the Parliament
party then the Kings though, both a constant well-wisher to the Cause, and to
the uttermost of his power a known and willing Country but or thereunto, here
we had no sooner taken up our Quarters, but we understood that one Captain
Thomas Butler, a Gentleman decayed in his fortunes, and of the County of
Pembrooke, out of that vain and common immagination of advancing his estate,
by siding with the King, whether right or wrong, it was his, and the General
understanding of the Country, that the sure and safest side must be the Kings.

This silly and half witted Captain was one that would be notable and the
first in action, had some what before raised 120. loose fellows, of the very
scum and vermin of the County of Pembrooke, and had possessed himself of the
Town and Castle of Laherne in the County of Carmarthin, and within two miles of
our then residence: We now proceed and shall purposely omit all passages acted
by the Gentlemen of Pembrookeshire, concerning the former Commissions, both of
the Array and militia, with their several deputations both by the King and
Parliament, as not much more pertinent to our purpose then to make our
observations to, to Vrluminos, but shall only insist on those Commissions
brought down in the Lent following the battle at Edgehill by my Lord of
Carbery, as Commander in Chief of the Counties of Carmarthen, Cardican, and
Pembrook. These beginings in so remote parts where, then there was no fear of
other Enemies, then of themselves; and therefore, the less need to raise
forces, and to Garrison Towns, otherwise, then out of their own Levity to be
men of action, and in a Country where, (if they would) they might have bin most
secure, had they had the grace to have known their own happiness, or to have
harkened to the advice which was then given them, by us strangers: but they
were generally resolved to be active, It was further commonly spoken, by the
best sort of the Gentlemen that the welsh were the true Britains, and his
Majestyes best and only Orthodox subjects, and Pembrookshire men for the most
part Saxons and Bastards.
upon what grounds and reasons they would take up Arms; was the least part of
the dispute, It being in every man's mouth that such as would not appear for
the King against the rogues the Parliament, were Traitors to God and his
Majesty, and that such as would, we are sure to be well rewarded, and could not
expect a less compensation then to have good shares given them of the
Parliament Members Estates, and of their partakers, whence we made our
Judgments, and found it to be most true; that it was not the cause (which they
little heeded) but the hopes of gain and advancement, was the only Lodestone,
that drew their Iron into the Field, and to take part with the King, though to
the ruin of the Kingdom and destruction of themselves as the sequel, since
has proved it to be most true? The certain Intelligence of these beginnings
and preparations in the County of Carmarthin, together with my Lord of
Carberyes Commissions, as Commander in Chief of the three Counties, being then
publikly known, and signified, by his Lordships letters to the Gentlemen in
general of the County of Pembrooke, much startled those few which stood
immovable, in defense of the Militia, and in defiance of the Commissions of
Array. Whereupon, Sir Hugh Owins Sir Richard Phillips, old, Mr. John Laughorne,

verily believe that there were many more of the Gentlemen, which wou^d have
showed themselves, and we are right in their affections to the public but that
they shrunk in the wetting, and so soon as my Lord of Carberry, first by his
invitations and after by menaces, made them to stand aloof, and in the
conclusion to comply with his Lordship, and in the way of Subscription, and

danger, that attended them, and considering, that they had then no Commission,
directory from the Parliament* to warrant their undertakings, it was privately
resolved, between Mr. John Laughorne, Mr. Arthur Owen, and the now Major
General, to employ some trusty Messenger to my Lord General Essex, to
acquaint his Excellency of the true estate of their Country, and to this charge
one Captain Phillip Bowin was designed and privately sent away in the Lent
time, 1642. who, in the Easter week following returned with several
Commissions, authorizing Mr. Rowland Laughorne, as Colonel of a Regiment of
foot together with another Commission, to Sir Rich. Phillips Sir Hugh Ownis,
Mr. John Laughorne, Mr. Arthur Owins, and Mr. Jews Barlow, as assistants to
Colonel Laughorne, with a special charge, to defend their Towns, and
Milford, Haven, as a place of principal importance* to the uttermost of their
power, until some other ayds might be sent unto them from the Parliament,
whereupon, amongst themselves, they raised some 50. or 60. horse, and two or
three Companies of foot, mand, and fortified the Towns of Tinby and Pembrook,
John Poyer, Major of the place being very Active in the repaier of the walls,
then much demolished. In the mean time my Lord of Carberry summoned in the
principal Gentlemen of the County to repair to his Lordship as Carmarthin,
and to comply with him, as the Kings General of Carmarthin Pembrooke, and
Cardican shires, whither very few of the former Gentlemen, did or would
appear, whereupon diverse Letters, and Messages, were sent by his Lordship to
persuade them all to a General complyancy with his honor, and thereupon much
debate there was between his Lordship and the Gentlemen (discentors)
concerning the government of that County: my Lord General Carberry by virtue
of his Commission, minding to have the sole command thereof, in the behalf of
the King, as he had (without dispute) of the other two Counties of Crdican and
Carmarthin they to keep the County of Pembrooke in their own Command for King
and Parliament. And when as diverse and sundry treaties* Letters, and Messages
took not the effect* that each party affected: his Lordship in person, about
July following 1643. came attended with his friends and followers, accompanied
with that grave Gentlemen David It was conceived by some knowing men, that
Ienkins was set over his Lordship of Carberry to overlook his actions.
Ienkins as his assistant and Law-director, all in the way of a millitary
equipage, and amounting in number to a little army, to the Abbey of Whitland, on
the very confines of the County of Pembrooke, whither the Gentlemen in general
were before summoned to give his Lordship meeting, and some of the more
newtrall and tymorous of them punctualy observed their time the rest aforenamed
absenting themselves: In the conclusion and after a long debate, certain
writings and agreements were then signed between them, conducing to a
compliancy with his Lordship, This sum was 2000. l. and it was collected and
paid to his Lordship.
and for raising of a considerable sum of money to be presented to his
Majesty in token of their obedience to my Lords eommand, and shortly thereupon,
they again met his Honor, both at Haverford-VVest, and at Carmarthin where
other Writings were signed between them, the before absented Gentlemen, for
the Major part always refusing to give his Lordship any meeting at all; and
thereupon, they were particularly threatened by Judge Jenkins, and the Attorney
Lowes to be proclaimed Traitors, and shortly there upon, Baronet Owins was by
the Judges in Haverford arrested of High Treason: In the conclusion it was
there agreed that the Gentlemen Complyers, vid. Sir Richard Philips, Mr. Roger
Lort, Mr. Jews, Barlow, Mr. Thomas Bowin and Mr. John Elliot. with Sir Hugh
Owins (arreasted as aforesaid) should all attend his Lordship to Oxford, and in
testimony of their submission were by him brought before the King to kis his
Majestys hand. It is most true that my L. of Carbery, first used all the fair
means he possibly could rather to win them all to a compliance with him,
then by sorce to compel them, but upon the upshot of their return into their
Countries: Sir This Gent. has bin strangly used and hurried up and down, and
all to take him off from the Parliaments service.
Hugh Owins much resenting his former Arrest at Haverford, made suit to the
King for repair in honor for the indignity offered him by the Judges,
whereunto his Majesty replied, that right should be don him as he desired, for
you shall said the King be tried by your Country, according to law, and so was
he committed to the Custody of the Earl of Carberry as a Prisoner, to be
returned to Haverford, or as his Lordship should dispose of him, and the rest
of the Gentlemen taking their leaves, had License to return to their homes. In
the mean time, and during the space, that these contrivances were in agitation
at Oxford, His bastard Brethren.
and the summer well past over, the Major General, and his small party were
not Idle for howsoever, their strength, were not much considerable as being
forsaken, by so great a party of the Gentry, yet had they by this time well
fortified their Towns of Pembrook and Tinby and stood upon their defenses they
being then of so inconsiderable a number, in comparison of his Lordships power,
and the forces of the Counties of Cardican and Carmarthin* all at his devotion,
as also the County of Pembrooke divided in affection and in inveterate feuds,
and factions amongst themselves, and the High Sheriff, Mr. Albon Owins,
commanding the posse Commitatus, and his two active Brethren the Harrold, and
Doctor Owins both vehement sticklers, in the Country, and in Oxford, blasting
and branding the names and fames of the Major General and the Gentlemen
(incomplyants) as also, all South Wales wholly for the King. That it is one of
the wonders of the times, how they durst stand up as the did, but rather a
piece of a mirackle and to speak in terms of truth, the immediate hand of
the Almighty, that from such small beginnings, so great, and so many actions,
should in a nooke of a little County, surrounded with powerful enemies) be
performed by a poor handful of un armed men. I have hitherto only, presented
some passages, and Intimations of disputes and treaties, between his Lordship
of Carberry, and the Pembrookeshire Gentlemen, I now come to the active part,
and as my Lord General Carberry proceeded on the end of the Summet 1643. when,
his Lordship had drawn together out of those Counties, and the Garrisons a
very considerable strength both of horse and foot, and as we made computation
of their numbers on their march, could not be so few as 3000. ablemen. With
this Army, his Lordship marched up to Haverford-West, and open and spacious
Town, but incapable of any defensible fortification yet as it was, he raised
works on the approaches, and made such defenses as the site of the place would
permit, and alter some short residence in the Town, he repaired to the pill,
where viewing the whole Haven of Milford, he gave order for the raising of
Fort, which was exceedingly well chosen, and commanded a good part thereof,
having before sent for Cannon to Bristell, (then in his Majesty's possession)
which were timely sent him, and in good proportion. In this fort, his Lordship
placed Mr. John Barlow, a most Malignant Church Papist, and the same, who
[about the first sitting down of this Parliament] entertained Sir Sir Toby
Matthew a suspected Jesuit, but a dangerous and active Papist, about the
beginning of this Parliament, took survay of Milford-Haven, to what end let the
world Judge.
Toby Matthew when he took the survay of Milford Haven as Commander there of
having manned the same, and the Pill Town with 500. good foot, his Lordship
headquarters being then at Haverford, not above five miles distant from the
Fort. There was then but one small Ship of John Poyers the Major of Pembrook in
all the Haven which some what before he had surprised, by a very bold and
adventureus Stratagem, and had taken out all her Gunns into the Town and
Castle, [then utterly unprovided of Ordance] the Ship being shortly after
retaken by two men of War, which his Majesty had then sent in, for my Lord of
Carberries assistance, and sure keeping of the Haven, his Lordship next
endeavor was then how to gain in the Town of Tinby, a place of importance, a
Port Town, and accommodated with a very convenient and safe Harbor: To which
purpose many Invitations were sent thither, and many wyles used to persuade the
Major then one Mr. Tho. Wyat a rich and wealthy Merchant; to surrender the
place, but it would not be granted; whereupon the Gentlemen, grac^t, as before
at Oxford were employed in the business, to work the Major and Townsmen to
deliver up the Town to his Lordships hands, and to open the truth of the
matter, some of them proceeded therein, with no small sedulity though since,
they have been all made Committees they utterly denigh any such thing, It
being well known, that on the turn of the wheel, they were much befriended in
their re-integration with the Parliament, by reason of the consanguinity and
alliance, most of them had, with Master John White, a late Member of the House
of Commons, but thither they came and imparted their business to the Major and
Townsmen, with that writing, This writing bears date 17 of August at Carmarvin
as near as I can remember.
whereunto they had subscribed in compliance, with his Lordship, and their
declared unto them, that they must consent, and do as themselves had done
before them and to yield up the Town, unto his Lordships command, and in so
doing These Gentlemen, now utterly denigh their coming to Tinby, though
avouched by the testimony of ten of the chief of the town, Sir Rich. Philips
avouching that his name was or; might be put in by some of the rest, on his
Lordship of Carbery.
some of them engaged themselves, on the loss of their whole estates, that it
should be re-delivered to them to be kept for His Majesty's use and service:
Neither did others of them, so leave off their solissitation when they could
not prevayle, but threatened the Major to block up the Town, with Forts and
Bulworkes at Holleway water so to deprive the townsmen of their market, and
Judge Jenkins, spared not to send the Major this peremptory message that if he
did not speedily deliver up the place to his Lordship, he would have him
hanged at his own door, wondering at his refractorines, that since the whole
County and Haverford, They denigh that Haverford was first yielded up; which is
clearly false.
had submitted, he alone, and some few others ill affected to His Majesty's
service, should obstinately stand out against the Generals power: Moreover,
that the principal passages [of late so much contraverted and variously
asserted, on all sides] and that the manner of yielding up this Town, with the
lamentable (after) ruin thereof may be laid down in their naked truth, there
was a plot devised to raise a muteny in the Town, in which tumu^t the Major
himself was compelled [for safeguard of his life) to take his house, and to
lock up his doeres, so violent some there were, which since (in exsknse of
themselves) would lay all the blame of giving up this Town, on the deceased
Major, whom they untimely hurried to his grave, and since, as Committees which
would show, their power, have endeavored to sequester a dead man's estate (as a
malignant of their own making) (though right must be done to others of them,
Master Roger Lort, Mr. Geor. Adams, Master Geor. Howard and others.
which abhorted to consent or to have a hand in so an unjust a Vote) so it was,
and the plain truth is, their endeavor was that way to cut scores, and to
quit their debts they owed to the disceased Major; as also to bereave his poor
kindred with the poor of the place of their Legacies given them by the Majors
last Will and Testament, It being apparently known, that the distressed man,
(long since at rest, and at peace with God) upon an alarm in the Town, and the
ringing of the Bell, when all the Burgesses by their Oaths and custom of the
place, were to repair to the Majors assistance, he had not (after the said
mutiny) above three of the Townsmen, that would stand firm unto him, so cowed
and disheartened, they were through the threats and practices of the adverse
party; Insomuch, as being merely forsaken of the Townsmen, Haverford, and the
whole County [Pembrooke excepted] at his Lordships devotion, and himself in
utter despair, longer, to hold the Town: He, with some others of the Aldermen,
conceaved it, their safest way [as the cause then stood] to address themselves
to his Lordship then at Marrase within 5. miles of the Town with his Forces,
where they treated with his honor on these conditions, that after his
Lordships admittance with a convenient train, he should re-deliver the place
to the Majors Government: But no sooner had his honor the possession of the
town but he drew in the said Captain Butiers company, some companies of
Colonel David Guins Regiment, with some other Commanders, and made one Major
Guin Governor of the place, the poor Major being thus, and after this manner
dispossessed of all, and having with much suite obtained leave to repair to
Bristoll, [where the best part of his debts, and bills then lay indispaire of
loosing] continued their, and at the Bath a very weak and disconsolate man,
until on the first reduction of the whole County of Pembrooke, some of the old
complying Gentlemen, [made Committees on the reason aforesaid] and most of them
indebted unto him began to question his absence, and to make his former
yielding up of the Town to their ground work of voting him a Malignant, which
was attempted long after his descease when as (living) he could not be won by
all his Lordships fair inducements, neither overcome by threats, and the
subtlties of treaties, nor corrupted with a bribe of 700. l. neither yielded he
the Town at all until as foresaid he was both wrought upon by the Gentlemen
complyers threatened to be hanged at his own door, and a mutiney as aforesaid
raised against him by a party in the Town, adheering to his Lordship, I have
the longer insisted on this particular of the Major of Tinby, in respect of the
honor dew to the dead, that he was never in other esteem then that of a
Religious and honest man, and one whose Purse was continually and gratis open
to all the Gentlemen of his County on all their occasions, as also to show that
there are some of the Committees of this County, which are as others have bin
in other parts of the Kingdom, high prohd, Emperious and hauty, which
necessarily requires, a present refinement, for my own particular I consesse
that I have seen the man, but never changed word with him, and that we
strangers sometimes made our abode in the Town, sometime at Pembrook,
Haverford, and at Carmarthin as we thought most convenient for our safeties,
being loath to return into our own Country, where we understood that the heat
and seat of the War was then most violent, but lead on by I know not what
destiny to remain in those parts we came at length to be eye witnesses, and
sensible objects, of the most babarous, and wastfull War, that was in the
Kingdom or could possibly befall a Country so indigent in money and destitute
of men and means, whereby an Army might long subsist; General Gerrard, and
his ravenous Army the first Summer of their coming into the Country, dividing
the spoil of the whole County between them, and to the great in dammaging of
no small number of the Inhabitants of the Counties of Cardican and Cormarthin,
the Commanders having learned the way, how to make any one in the repute of a
rich man, a Roundhead at their pleasures, I am bold to avoueh it for truth,
that Gerrard, and his Commanders, the first year of their Incursion took not
so few as 20000. head of ruther Gattle, nor less then 60000. sheep, besides
Swine, Plate, Money, Household stuff, and other plunder out of that one little
County. It being all Fish that came to their Nets the Gerrarrds, Russell son
to Sir William Ruffell late of the Navy, Egerton VVhitly, Price, Son to Sir
John Price, a late Member of the house, Slawter, Rudde, younger Son to Sir
Rice Rudde, and Lacy the Player, with diverse more, (all excellent Commanders in
the dissipline of plunder) wear noted to be the principal purveyors, and
Actors in the destraction of the County of Pembrook Gehrard himself, always
reserving the Cream, and prime Cattle and plunder to his own use.

But leaving this digression the right course of our Relation, calls us back to
the latter end, and period of my Lord of Carberryes Command, we shall now
proceed and show that Major-Generall Laughorne (on the surrender of the Town
of Tinby) with his small retinue, seeing the distress and danger they were in,
[Mr. Roger Lort having then fortified his house at Stackepoole, whether for his
own defense, or for the King we cannot determine) Captain Smith then ariving
in the Haven, furnished him with a small proportion of powder and Ammunition
and presently departed for the Coast of Ireland, when shortly after came in the
Admiral Swanly, with two or three lusty Parliament Ships, He avouches that
they had not a man more then his own meniall servauts, and those only for
defense of him self.
his Majesty as aforesaid some what before having sent in two Ships for the
assistance of his Lordship, which perceiving what manner of Vessels were then
arived, the Kings Ships instantly ran under the Fort, whith^r Swanlys greater
Vessels could not come near them Stackpoole house as aforesaid being
fortified, on the back of Pembrooke, Trefloyne, and Tinby before it and the
Castle of Carew, Garisond, on the North side, and the Town wholly surrounded
with enemies and strong Garrisons; In this perplexity, the Major General on
consultation with the Admiral Swanly, thought it his first and safest work to
take in Stackpoole to which purpose, Stackpoole the first siege of the Major
General.
and that he might not leave any Garrison behind him having a supply of Sea men
from Swanly, to the number of 80. or there abouts, fell on the house, which
within a few Days he took in, and thereupon, to enlarge his quarters, fell
presently on Trefloyne, the Mansion of Master Trefloyne the second siedge he
did not for tifie his house, for it was taken by his Lordship of Carbery, Mr.
Bowen himself being at Pembrooke.
Thomas Bowen, and within a mile of Tinby, [whither his Lordship was then
arived) and having beleagured the place and planted one piece of Artillery
below the house to impeade the reskewes, which he expected his Lordship might
and would send out of Tinby, to the relief of the besieged, he battered the
place, with another Gun, and continued the assault, from morning to night;
Captain Martin a vain obscene and talking fellow, commanding the place,
seeing no relief to be sent him from his Lordship, within the night grew to
capitulation, which was presently agreed on, and that himself and some few
more, should have leave to retreat to Tinby, with their horses and Arms, the
rest of their foot, arms and horse, to remain to the discretion of the Major
General, which were 47. very good horse, and about eighty Soldiers; his
Lordship all the day being on the Works, and looking on, never came up to the
reskew, though within a mile of the place, and the tide spent at Holloway
river, between the house and Tinby, and having more in numbers in the Town by
much then the assaylants; The Major General having thus widned his quarter on
both sides of Pembrooke, he then undertook, as desperate an enterprise, as
ever Commander could have attempted: The Fort, and Pill town [as aforesaid]
being sufficiently mand and well fortified, and on the other side of the Haven,
The Fort and Pill-Village, his 3d siedge.
stored with exceeding good Ordnance, and a great quantity of Powder, and his
Lordships head quarters then at Haverford, but 5. miles distant, and on the
back of the Fort, notwithstanding the great peril, of passing over the River,
[neer upon half a League over in breadth and on the Enemies side of the Haven]
yet by the help of the Ships and boats, he put over two pieces of Ordnance,
and having past over his little Army early in the morning his horse not
exceeding 80. the foot skarse 400. he planted his two Guns on a high hill
over against the Fort, which played over the Pilford into the middell thereof,
having before his coming over given order that our Demi Cannon planted at
Popton, on Pembrooke side of the River should also play over the wast of the
Haven into the other side of the Fort, all which Guns, did very much annoy the
Enemy then lodged in an open, and desending Fortress, whilst himself in the
head of the Pill-Village, some 20. score above the Fort, placed all his horse
in full show and in open view of the Enemy, (then drawn out of Haverford, and
within two miles of the place, being 400. Horse at the least, and 1000. foot
all in two bodies looking on that poor handful of horse of the Major
Generals, set there, of purpose to face the enemy, whilst in his own person,
he fell in, with 200. Musketteers, on the Village, having within it equal
numbers, to those of his own, beat them at an instant out of their works,
took, 150. prisoners, and as mauy Arms, the rest running down into their Fort,
were instantly pursued, and within two hours both places taken, with all their
Ordnance, Powder, and Ammunition, together with 300. prisoners more; The
Enemies body of horse and foot then commanded by Sir Henry Vaughan (in his
Lordships absence) all the day long never advanced to their assistance; but in
the close of the evening, retreated to Haverford, in a very great amasement
John Barlow, Captain of the Fort the two Captains Bradshawes, with Leiutenant
Paersons, two of them old Soldiers were there taken with diverse other
Officers, Paersons an old stoutman, at the first entering of the Fort being
there mortally wounded was the next day sent to Haverford, where very nobly the
Major General gave special order for his cure, but shortly after dyed of his
wounds, the Fort thus taken, the Kings ships then lying dry on an ebb tide,
and under the command of the Fortas aforesaid, were there also taken by the
Major General, their Gunnes with those of the Fort amounting to the number of
sixty odd at the least, which plentifully furnished him with store of
Artillery, which he then exceedingly wanted. It is very remarkable, what happened
the following evening, (through the punick fear, that then possessed the
Enemy: the relation whereof may be of some recreation to the Reader: The night
being come on, and the Major General and his men then overwatcht and tired,
took up their quarters in the Pill-Village, having sufficiently performed more
then they expected they could possibly do in so short a time, and with so
weak forces and the enemy, though in Haverford, and within their works fresh
and of good numbers, yet extremely timorous, and doubtful that the Major
General would that night fall in on the place, and standing on the way toward,
the Pil, some half a mile distant from the Town, they heard a great noise of
running and cluttering, under the place where they had taken up their standing,
which was no other then the running down of a heard or drove of Cattle, out of
the adjoining mountain (being sensible by natures instinct of the storm that
immediately followed) to take shelter under the Walls of an ancient Rudra of
buildings standing in the bottom, a little below where the Skouts stood
sentinel, They being amazed in the night dark, and stormy took the Alarm
for good, ran into the Town, and crying out that the Major General with his
whole Army, was at hand: Whereupon in all post have, they all packt away in the
night toward CARMARTHIN, Sir Henry Vaughon in the heat of the fear, in a very
uncivil manner taking a long with him Sir Hugh Owins his Prisoner in his
stockins, not giving him time to pull on his Boots and calling him Traitor,
avouching that that disaster befell them, by reason of his non-complyance, the
good Lady his Wife not willing so to leave her Husband, could not be persuaded
to stay behind but in her night Gown road all the night behind him, the Enemy
having made sure work with their powder had cast it into the River, leaving
their Cannon and the Town to the discretion of the Major, General, who the
day following, entered with his Forces, and quartered in their places.

That part of the Country being then well cleared of the Enemy, the Major
General, (upon some small rest) drew up all the force he could possibly make
to the Town of Tinby a place finely seated on a Rock, or little premontory
environed on two sides with the sea, and on the land side, with very high
thick, and impregnable Wails, Towers, and platformes; The Major General having
the first day of his sitting down, planted a Demi-Culvering, 2200. yeards
distant from the North Gate of the Town, with another some what lower but more
wide and both on the declyning of the Wind-mi^l-hill, over against the Town;
the first played on the very Gate and entrance thereof, [the rest of the Gates
having been before barrocadoed and stopped up] the other Gun planted more wide,
played both into the Haven, and the Town, whilst the Ships being come about
from Milford, played all from seaward over the Town, without any other anoyance
to the besieged; more then the beating down of some of the rooftes of the
Inhabitants houses: only the Demi-Culvering planted at the distance aforesaid,
and that played on the Gate, being attended with a very expert Cannon-neere, the
3d. day follwoing made a very forrunate shot, and beat open the Wicket through
the Portcullis at which the Major Generals Foot, then quartering in the Norton
[even up to the Gate] which is a long street or suburb without the Walls;
taking the opportunity, desperately ran in and presently possessed themselves of
the place the Governor Guin being slightly hurt before and in his Chamber, not
doubting of any such accident and hearning, that the Soldiers were already
entered, ran into the Street, and incountring them, was there mortally wounded,
with some other of the defendants slain in the place, wherewith himself,
Colonel David Gwin, Captain Butler, Captain Jews, and Lieutenant Protherow
were taken with all the Soldiers, to the number of 300. or more, Guin the
Governor within four days after died of his wounds, and had an honorable
interment given him by Captain Phillip, Bowen, then commanding the Town under
the Governor, Captain Thomas Laughorne.

It is very remarkable, that a place of that strength, and manned with near as
many men as those [that had besieged it, should so Miraculously be taken in, so
short a time, where 200. good Soldiers [the Town Victuled] are able to defend
it against an Army of 5000. resolute men, yet thus much ought to be ascribed to
the Townsmen, that howsoever formerly they stood divided amongst themselves, as
terrified with his Lordships continual threats, yet on the emperiuos demeanonr
of Guin the Governor, and the insolency of Butlers Soldiers, they to late
found their error, and four days before the Major Generals sitting down
sent him word of their good affection, they had to do him any service which
might conduce to make him Master of the place, only this Intelligence was
subscribed ( Tinby) without any particular hands of the Inhabitants, which the
Major General calling to mind at the first entry of the Town, out of
noblenes, and the desire he had to preserve the place from ruin, offered the
Soldiers 200. l. out of his own purse to forbear the plunder thereof; but
such was the greediness of Captain Swanlyes sea men, with some others of
Capt. Poyers company, that he could not pervaile but the town, and many an
honest man were without mercy, and respect of more than three or four persons,
were generally plundered, and utterly undon.

The Major General thus miraculously prospering, and his small numbers
encouraged with good success, sent his summons to the Castle of Carew four
miles distant from Tinby, Carew yielded by composition.
where the Governor Capt. Edward Loyd, a very busy active and violent man,
against the Parliament, surrendered it upon conditions that he and his company
might safely retreat to Carmarthin, whereby all the County of Pembrooke, was
then totally cleared of the Enemy; the Major General after some pause and rest
given to his tired Forces then determined, to invade the County of Carmarthin,
which had so much indammaged that of Pembrooke through their pride, and the
contempt they had of so inconsiderable a party, which had opposed the Lord
General; And the Summer 1643. being well entered having disposed of his
prisoners in the Town, and Castle of PEMBROOKE the principalls as aforesaid,
were Colonel David Gwin, Butler, Lews, two of the Bradshaws, Edwards, and
Barlow all Captains, the last where of having been Commander of the Pill-fort
as aforesaid, on suit of the Major Generals wife, [a Gentlewoman of honorable
comportment] and on his own protestations, and oaths made to her, that thence
forth he could remain a quiet man and a true prisoner, [after some time of
close restraint] had the free liberty to walk the town but such was his, and
the perfidy of a Church Papist, that shortly after, taking his time, in the
night he got over the Walls and for some few days hyding himself at one of
his tenants houses, journed directly to Oxford, where with great earnestness,
he petitioned the King, that an Army under some more experienced Commander,
then his Lordship of Caerbery, might instantly be (sent down as well, to
prevent the Major Generals incursions into the heart of South Wales, as also
timely to reduce the County of Pembrooke to his Majesty's obedience, which the
King at first absolutely denied, as a suit, that then sorted not with the
condition of his Majesty's affairs; but Barlow as obstinately perverce, as
persidious, persisted so far in his solicitation of her Majesty, as that
within a very few days after, It was refolved by a Council of War, that an
Army should be sent down, and a way to be thought on, how to raise such
forces, as might both master and ruin the County of Pembrooke, to which
command Colonel Gerrard, was then designed as General and Commander in
chief, and the Earl of Caerbery [then in a Cloud] displaced: Whilst these
solicitations of Barlowes, with his consederates were in agitation at Oxford,
the Major General, moved from Colby-moore with all the Forces he could
possibly make, and marched up to Laherne, an old open Town, but a strong
Castle slighted somewhat before, by the drawing away of Cap. Butlers company to
Tinby, here the Major General, quartered for some few days, whilst he sent a
small party to Emblin Castle took it in and then drew off, to Saint Cleers, The
skirmish at Carmarvin and the Town taken by storm
six miles short of Carmarthin where attending the coming up of more men,
with his ammuition, he then marched up within two miles of the place, the height
of his Army, then strengthened with 160. English, Irish foot, as had somewhat
before fled out of Ireland, into Milford, as over powered there by the Rebels,
but good Soldiers which he entertained, with much alacrity; with these, those
of his own, and 80. more, taken in by the Major of Pembrooke, out of Captain
Butlers company taken as before at Tinby with some few sea men, amounting in
all near to 600. good foot, and 200. horse at the most, he in countred the
enemy, then drawn out of the Town, having then within it, 1000. foot at the
least, and near upon 400. horse, made up out of the several Counties
adjacent, and such as out of love to his Lordship and the desire of gain and
purchase to themselves, were come up to join with his honors forces; the
Enemy very Souldier-like, had a forehand lined the hedges on the highwayes, and
approaches to the Town, with store of Musketteers, which the Irish foot, with
other seconds, beat from hedge to hedge, firing in a new dexterity, with their
matches lighted in their hands, charging the Enemy twice for once. which they
performed with much agillity, getting still ground on their enemies, and
following them home, even to the out works of the Town, whilst the horse had
also a very hot encounter, Captain Lucas a Sea Captain, with some others being
there slain on the place of the Majer Generals party, but more of the Enemies
slain, and many more wounded on both sides, the rest fled, or in terms of
more honor rather retreated into the Town, the Major General following them
close at their heels, came up even to the gate of the entry of the Market
place, where for an hour or there abouts he Trea^ed with the Townsmen,
concerning the delivery of the place whilst Sir Henry Vaughan and the chief
Commanders promising the Townsmen, that they would march out at the Eastgate,
and so wheel about and fall on the rear of the Major Generals horse all then
in one body, in Lammas street, which is without the West gate, and whither all
the Generals foot were then come up, but nihil dictu facillius, the brave
wheelers about, took the safer way of running away, when the General made no
more words, but thrust in at the Gate with all his horse and foot, where at his
first entry, Captain John Powell with some others were dangerously shot out of
the Windows, and so being fully possessed of the Town he therequattered near
upon 40. days, paying for all he took, both in the Town and all the way of
his Quarters in that County, only on conditions between himself and the
Townsmen that 1000. l. should be collected amongst them as a benevolence to be
given to the Soldiers for redeeming the Town from plunder, and that in regard
that some of his Commanders were shot after they had entered the place, 600. l.
there of being only paid, the Generail and his Army spending that some double
and treble before they retreated.

In the mean time the Townsmen for the most part weary of their guests, and
some which before were fled when no man thought them harm, and were posted to
Oxford, and to the new General to hasten his coming to Carmarthin, where, by
lamentable experience, they soon found, and long after felt the difference of
their so journers. The Major General shortly thereupon received certain
Intelligence of the advance and near approach of the new and surious General,
and that he quartered at Brecknock* but 34. miles from Carmarthin, who besides
the horse which he brought out of England, all the way as he past the
principallity he had raised what forces he could possibly make in the Counties
of Brecknocke, Monmouth, Radnor, Glamorgan, and Carmarthin, Enforcing all men
of abillity to bear Arms, and to attend him, and about Midsummer following
was come up to La numdovery and Albermarlis, within 16. miles of the town of
CARMARTHIN. Hereupon the Major General held the place (with some better
fortification) tenable, [as that time would not then give him leave to
perfect,] yet in as much as he knew the Town and Coun^ry (generally) to be
false and rotten hearted as also that should he have resolved to hold the
Town, [as some are of opinion, and do charge it upon him that he might have
done] yet a more weaighty reason prevailed with him, timely to quit the place,
for that whilst he should have remained there, Gerrard might match by and
strike in between him and the whole Country of Pem. brook, whereby it would
necessarily follow, that his own County, the Towns and Milford-Haven would
all have bin exposed to assured loss and ruin, Gerrards numbers so much
over-powring those of his, not then exeeeding 800. horse and foor, therefore
whatsoever is objected by some of the malicious Committees in prejudice of the
Major Generals Counsels, that he might have stayed in an enemies Country
without quarting on that of Pembrooke, and have held the Town of Carmarthin in
spite of Gerrard, and only by such as are maliciously disposed to detract from
his worth, and utterly Ignari Belli yet loud and bold talkers, It was
doubtless; a good and well advised resolution timely to look to his own
towns and Milford-Haven upon these reasons he retreated to Laherne, where
leaving 100. good foot in the Castle, under the Command of Captain Jones a
resolute Soldier, within few days after made a fair retreat into his own
County, with all his Cannon and Ammunition, and giving order for the Guard of
Tinby, Carew, and Pembrook made his head quarters at Haverford, all which he
fortified and manned as well as time, and his small strength would permit

distant from Haverford) never attempted on other, then, then on some small

greater towns; but only attending the depopulation and utter destruction of
the whole County, till about Bartholmew tide following, wanting provisions for
his own quarters, he withdrew his Army backwards, toward Carmaerthin, to the
Abbey of Whitland aforementioned, where he encamped, and thence summoned the
Castle of Laherne which Captain Iohnes, yielded on conditions to march away,
with his men and Arms to Tinby, and presently thereupon summoned the Castle of
Emblin, which was likewise surrendered unto him, Colonel Russell then
fortifying his own Castle of Laherne, and his brother Colonel Gerrard doing
the like at Clogervrane, 4. miles distant each from the other, were both in
very short time made tenenable, and very strong pieces, the General then being
called to the relief of Monmouth marched thither with the best of his strength,
both of horse and Dragoones, leaving the body of his Army at Whitland, (as
aforesaid) where about Michelmas following, having eaten up all these Countries
provisions, they retreated to their winter quarters to Carmarthin, leaving only
behind them those two well fortified pieces, of Laherne, and Clogervrane on the
South, with the Castles of Cardican and Emblin on the North side of the County
of Pembrooke, all newly and well fortified having very soldier like made (as
he conceived) all things safe until in the spring following, he might
re-invade the Country, take Haverford, Tinby, and Pembrooke, and so utterly
destroy the whole County.

The Major General, being for that present, then freed from this rabious
Enemy, and having a desolated Country open before him, collects all the forces
he could possibly make, and fell in, and upon the Town and Castle of Laherne,
(much about the beginning of October, 1644.) wherein, Russell as aforesaid
commanded and in his march thither, with 100. horse in his own person, with an
intent to view this new fortified piece, upon an open heath, a mile short of
the place, he was desperately charged, with a party of Horse, commanded by our
Leiutenant Appleby, The hot skirmish on Candauke Mountain.
the Major General having a little before laid in Ambuscado the better part
of his horse which made Apleby the more bold to charge on a few, having
reskews, Najor Philips and Captain Rowland VVoogan with diverse others of the
Major Generals party sorely wounded in this encounter.

encounter was for the time, hot and fearce, and diverse of both sides shot and
wounded, until Apleby, engaged within the Ambuskado, was there slain with 15.
more all of Russells Horse troop, and all of them very stout and daring men;
the General, beating the rest down into the Town, in open sight of the
Castle took full veiw thereof, and retreated to his body quartered then 5.
miles behind him, and the next day, being the first Sunday, or 2d of October,
came up with his whole Army, and quartered at Lac^durnon, within half a mile
of the Castle; The Generals Forces being then augmented, with a briggade (a
little before arrived at Milford under the command of Colo- Beale and
Leiutenant Colonel Carter designed for Sir Thom. Middleton; with diverse
others Voluntaries, as Colonel Colmade, Colonel Sheffeild Leiutenant Colonel
Alen, Captain Alford, Captain Deverux, Captain Tindall, Captain Griffith,
Captain Stapleton, Captain Beale, Captain Slowman, with some other
Commanders, with the Irish foot, commanded by Captain Ades Slawman and
Captain Hughs all which the Monday and Tuesday following took up their
quarters in the Town of Laherne, consisting then of Horse and foot near upon
1600. where from the side of the Hill overlooking the Castle green, he planted
one Demi-Culverin which played into their forts and out Works of the Castle,
the rest of his Guns were planted in the adjacent houses, played also into
their Forts and Court of Guard, the Demi-Culvering [for 2. days together,
doing little execuction, when on better advice, it was drawn down the hill,
and planted in the Town gate, not above 100. yeards from the Drawbridge of
the Castle, over which in a spacious room the Eenemies maine Guard lodged, and
on which the Demi-culvering continually played for three days together, and by
Saturday night following had made a very wide breach, through and through-both
sides of the room over the draw bridge, when the whole rooste fell together,
the one half into the Castle green, the other outward filled up, the ditch
under the bridge as if of purpose it would make fair entrance for the
assaylants, when, about midnight the Major General gave order that 400.
Musketeers should attempt to enter, which with great resolution they performed
before the Defendants could have time to make the Gate defensible, and with the
only loss of 8. men, all the time of the siege, which was not above 6. or 7.
Days, all their Outworkes being thus taken, 20. or there abouts slain of the
Enemies party, the rest crying out for quarter had it granted, when Russell the
Governor within the Castle seeing no relief to come unto him from Carmarthin
as he expected, yielded the place by ten of the clock upon conditions that he
and his Souldlers 160. in number (excepting the prisoners) should have free
liberty to Retreat with their Arms to Carmarthin leaving their Cannon and
pillage to the Major General.

The other Garrison at Clogerverane being the night before assertained of the
breach, and likely hood of the surrender of the Castle of Laeherne by one that
had sent in the Intelligence to the Governor with advice, how little account
the Major General made of taking thereof, and that in time they should think
upon their Retreat, about ten of the clock the next morning, set fire to all
the Outhouses, burnt all their winter Provisions, blew up the maine house,
left their Guns, and in all have made their retreat by the Mountains to
Carmarthin distant from the place about ten miles.

The Major General after some rest, then drew toward the Castle of Cardican,
the seat of Sir John Jews, where one Major Slawter Commanded as Governor of
the place, a Soldier that stood much on the punctillios, of honor spoke big,
the Major General within 30. days after or thereabout took it in by storm,

together with the high talking Governor, and lodged him fafe at Pembrooke,
together with Captain Thomas Vaughane, and one Captain Kemboll an Oxford
Scholar and learned, but a vehement and obstinate Cavalier, and there left
Colonel Rice Powell, Governor of the place, when within few days, General
Gerrard (unexpected) returns, (Colonel POWELL, being skarse warm in his
command,) and being Master both of the Town and Country, laid close siege to
the Castle, then utterly unprovided of Victual, but Colonel Powell, resolute
to defend the place with 100. good Soldiers, fed on such meat as he found
therein, at the taking thereof (not above six days before) which was only
Oten-meale some few, Hearing, and Water, and with this food, he stood it out
full three weeks, notwithstanding all the storms that were daily made on the
place. The Enemy having broken down the middle Arch of the Great stone bridge,
that parts the County of Pembrooke from that of Cardican, and having strongly
Barrocadoed the Town, in several places, and blockt up all the fords on the
great River, that no possible relief could be sent into the Castle, from
Pembrookeshire side, yet the Major General continually assaying to relieve
him, having taken up his quarters at the bridge end on the other side of the
River, and waiting all opportunities to second the Governor, could not
possibly come over, until that with much labor and diligence, he made his way
by beating down of long pooles and Trees into the bottom of the River, for
the houlding in of such materials, as might fill up the Arch, being of great
wideness, and 30. foot deep to the bottom at full Sea, and where the tides
runs most forsibly at last, and with great difficulty he filled up the Arch with
brush Faggots within 12. foot of the top of the bridge, and having aforehand,
provided store of Ladders.

In the dead time of a most tempestuous night, he commanded 300. of his
Musketteers, with some Seamen, which made great scruple to defend the Arch 12.

the River: Having the evening before, shot in an Arrow into the Castle green,
with a little scrowle woond about it, signifying that the same night, The
Seamen loath to go on until the Generals foot foot were first gone over.
and at such an hour, he would attempt to come over to his relief; The
distance of both Armies divided by the River, being much about Carbine shot,
the Castle somewhat nearer to the Major Generals Quarters and between both:
This Arrow falling within the Castle green, was presently taken up by a
Soldier and brought to the Governor, who perceiving the contents of the
scrowle, with the word, and advise to sally so soon as he found them, to
charge the Enemies first Barracado; It was happily and punctualy observed on
both parties, that no sooner had the Major General, put over his Musketteers,
and were fallen on the first work next to the bridge, and had beaten the Guards
from their defenses, and gone to the second, but the Governor Powell instantly
sallyed with most of his foot, and some few Pickes (the Enemy being then
engaged, before and behind, were soon defeated, and within one hour all the
town taken, they which eskapt, running down, to the Church, where their maine
guard then lay, with most of their Ammunition, which perceaving how the game
went, ran all away leaving all their Arms and Ammunition to the discretion of
the Major General; two excellent Demy-Culvering cuts of Brass he found in
the Churchyard, and had not the Horse suddenly rallied, the next morning he
would have bin Master of all their greater Ordnance which were then at The
seat of Master James Philips.
Tregibby a mile from the town where the Generals own quarter then was: we may
not omit to present this of remarkable Observation, that for nine Orten tides
together, the work in the Arch, so filled up, as is truly discribed) for a
passage over of the Major Generals soldiers to the Governors relief, stood
immovable till the very time that it was finished, notwithstanding the fresh
floods by reason of extreme foul weather, were then very strong and forcible,
and the tide there running with great violence, insomuch as the Major Genesis at
first stood in much doubt that all his labor would prove fruitles, howsoever
it pleased the great providence so to Order it, that it only stood to pass
over his men; but the next tide carried all the work away, to the admiration of
the beholders: Gerrards Army thus routed, and lessened in the loss of 500 of
his best foot, slain and taken in the place, and five hundred more running
from him (as weary of the service) eight hundred Arms, fifteen of his horse,
with some of his best Commanders, either slain or taken, in great displeasure
wrote an emperious and threatening Letter from Carmarthin to the Major General,
which he slighted with silence, and after many and toylesom marches, and
watches in the dead time of a tempestuous Winter, having for twenty days
together little better quarter, then hedges and ditches to repose himself and
his wearied Soldiers, yet loath to loose time, or to give breath to a
revengfull and furious Enemy, after some short time of rest, (first
revictualled the Castle, and replaced therein Colo. Powell as Governor of the
place) lay down before Emblin, a little, Emblin the 7th siedge.
but a very strong place belonging to the Earl of Carb^ry which for 20. days
together he closly besieged, the house being very well both fortified, and
defended, yet at length came to capitulation; when General Gerrard having for
two months together traversed his ground, through many of the Kings Garrisons
and studying revenge, had recruited himself both with good numbers of Horse,
and in his return enforcing all South Wales Generally to rise with him, his new
Army, amounting to 1200. Horse, and three thousand foot at the least, came by
great and nightly marches within seven miles of Emblin, before the little Army
then before it, had any certain intelligence of their approach: The Major
General, being somewhat before gone to Haverford for the recruit of his
Ammunition, when in the interim, on falls Gerrard, on the besiegers [only
seconded with some four troops of wearied horse) which understanding of the
Enemies near advance, yet they resolutely charged them in the very head of
their Army, and upon the first and second charge, put them to the shocke, but
being so unequally matched, and over-powred with numbers and the maine body of
the Enemies foot in sight and marching up to the Rear of their Horse.

Those few Troops of the Major Generals horse, thought it a vain endeavor
any longer to stand them, but shifted for themselves, leaving their foot to
the mercy of the insulting Enemy, which notwithstanding stood it out long
until overborn with multitudes of the assaylants they were for the greater
part either slain or taken, those resolute and expeirt Soldiers of Ireland
being of that routed number.

Upon this most unfortunate defeat, some of the Committee of the County of
Pembrooke, (envious of the Major Generals achievements, and such as never did
or durst draw sword in the Cause,) have not forborne most unworthily tobrand
his reputation, maliciously laying the blame of this disaster on him, and only
for that he was not present in person, when the defeat was given, it being well
knewne that the necessity of a speedy recrewting his Ammunition, enforced his
absence, and that ^ll the forces he could then make, could not countervaile the
afifth part of the Enemies forces, but to proceed; on the news of this
unfortunate loss, let the most malicious of his enemies look upon his former
and after diligence and what he did on the instant of this loss, when hapily
some of them would have bin to seek what to have don, otherwise then as they
did, (take their heels and leave the burden on his shoulders, which never
budg'd nor forsook his charge, and the defense of his Country, let them
remember when most of the Committees shifted for themselves, whether at the
instant he dispatched not shipping, such as were most fitting for Cardican
River) with advice to Colonel Powell; with all the expedition he could to
embarke himself and his Soldiers, with all his Ammunition, and to slight the
Castle which with celerity and great circumspection was timely performed, and a
Commander of worth with his full company and arms all preserved beyond
expectation, and before General Gerrard could imagine what might become of
him, safely arrived at Milford, and came to the Major General at Pembrooke,
they may remember if they pleased what a dead li^t was then left on their
shouldiers, when most of the Gentlemen either fled their Country or stood off
at Sea in a safe ship, they alone with a handful of men both stood to the
work, and preserved what possibly could be secured, the one be taking himsefe
to the Government o^ Tinby, the other of Pembrook wherewith great and
insupportable care and diligence, they so ordered the Towns, that a royal
Army (on six Months siege) might very well have spent their pains and lost
their labor in attempting on either, as Gerrard himself before Pembrooke,
during his six weeks siege found that to be most true.

The Major General had then in the Town near upon 500. good foot, and some
3-Troops of wearied horse, the place well fortified, but not Victualled for
any long siege, though Gerrard conceived that he had then near finished the
work, but there was another account to be made with God, and a second
rekconning may be expected, that he must make with men, for his horrid and most
abominable cruelties.

Gerrards endeavor first was then to block up the River that runs up to the
Town, out of Milford-Haven, To which purpose he attempted to raise a Fort on
the entrance of the River, which being made known to the Admiral Swanley, he
refused to hazard his shipping to come up in the River, when Captain John,
Bwen accompanied with the Vice Admiral, Captain John Smith adventured to
thrust in to the point of Pennermouth, where, with their Ordinance beating the
Pioners from their Works they utterly dissapointed the Generals design,
whether upon made his appreaches, near, and round about most of the Town, and
after many and diverse assaults, had always the worst of the bargain, he
having then forcibly drawn to his assistance, two new Regiments of very good
foot; all raised in the County of Pembrooke* where amongst other accidents,
this is an infallible testimoney of the Major Generals, both valor and
Vigillancy*

The Enemy one night having a design to burn the Mills standing on the North
bridge and a little without the Walls of the Town, skanted then of men to
supply the largen esse of the Works and the Major Genesis unwilling to lessen,
and unman the Guards (the Enemy stormingsometimes in 3.4. or 5. places at once)
put on a resolution, to hazard his own person, and to pass through the Ports,
and over the Bridge, accompanied with Captain Smith; Cap. Bowen, and some other
Gentlemen then in the town, where in the dark, they fell on the party that
were making their approaches toward the mills and being together by the ears;
the Major Gen was laid hold of and disarmed by one of the enemies Commanders,
the on tuging the other, each of them striving to make the one or the other
their prisoner, when as the party not seconded with fresh men, the Major
General fortunately got clear, and recovered over the bridge. Captain Smith,
being there most unfortunatly slain in the place, Captain Bowen, Master
Griffeth Lort, with the rest, some of them recovering the ports over the
bridge, others adventuring to go through the River with great difficulty,
secured themselves within the gate; In the mean time, and during six weeks
siedge, with the slaughter of many of the assaylants, the news of the loss of
the Field at Naseby, came to the knowledge of Gerrard, with command from the
King, to come up speedily to his Majesty's assistance, who then loath so to
quit his hold, and to raise his siedge before the Town, instantly marched away
with about 2000. of his Horse and foot to Rugland; having still the whole
County at their devotion, with diverse Garrisons in the Country, as the Castles
of Picton, Carew, Manner-byer, and Lamphy; but on a second and more strict
command to march away with the rest of their Army, and to fire the Country,
having left behind him, some 1800. horse and foot, under the command of
Colonel Stradling, as a sufficient power [as he supposed] to master the Feeld,
who raising the siedge before Pemb. retreated, and quartered at Haverford:
intending before his departure utterly to lay wast the whole Country.

From whence this new Commander Col. Stradling sent out his peremptory
mandates, on pain of death) to all Constables of the several hundreds to
bring in all sorts of laborers mowers, and hookmen, throughout the County, to
cut down and destroy all such corn, as was not then come to maturity, and to
fire the rest then grown ripe and combustible, It being then much about the
beginning of August, 1645. when diverse of those sad warrants came to the Major
Generals hands, by such as fled to the Town of Pembrooke, and some poor men,
loath to be the instruments of their own destruction were called out, and in
most barbarous manner harg'd by Stradlings command, The Major General
thereupon called a Council of War, where it was presently determined that
withal the Horse and Dragoones, he had then at Pembrooke, he should instantly
poast to Tinby (the way thither lying between the Enemies two Garrisons of Carew
and Manner-byer) and there to consult with the Governor Colo* Powell, what was
to be done* in the case; and being come together, the Major General imparted
unto him the tenor of the said warrants, which were no news to him, who the
night before received diverse of them, by such as were fled to Tinby, but there
it was soon resolved, that both Garrisons should join all their Forces, and
instantly to take the field, and with what other Forces they could possibly
make to give the Enemy battle; wheresoever they could encounter him: To this
purpose the randezvous was appointed at Saint Florence much about the middle
way, between Tinby and Carew: This resolution (as I am informed, for we
strangers were then all gone out of the Country) was taken about the latter end
of July 1645. on a Saturday, and the Monday following; both the Major General,
and the Governor Powell happily met at the place appointed; where they were
informed that a brigade of the Enemies horse were then quartered, at
Martell-Twy, about eight miles distant from Saint Florence, he so contrived
it, that sending a party of horse and Dragoones in the close of the evening;
recovered the place before day, and took most of the Enemies horse, with many
prisoners, before they could imagine, that he had taken the field, and loosing
no time, upon Intelligence, that Captain Edward Loyd [that mouthy-Malignant
rayler against the Parliament) then quartered at Burton, on the other side of
the River of Milford, he carried the business, with such celerity and secrecy*
that with great difficulty* he transported a party of Musketteers, over in the
night, which surprised the Captain with all his company and Officers in their
beds [they not dreaming that the Major General could come over, or was able to
take the field;] and immediately thereupon marched away to seek out the Enemy,
whereupon those alarm, and the beating up of his quarters in several places,
they drew out, with all their strength into the field, doubting (as it seems)
of their safety in Haverford (then sufficiently fortified) or that the Major
General might have some further design, whereof they could not then make any
certain Judgment, the River lying between both their Armies, The Enemies on
Colby Moore* distant 4. miles from Haverford, and the Major Generals on the
other side unknown to the Enemy, where he would and could quarter otherwhere,
then eight or ten miles distant (...) from Stradlings quarter, in such
perplexity of his abode did the Major General keep the doubtful Enemy, when
on the Wednesday following* the Major being come over with all his little Army,
appeared in view of the Enemy, near unto stebadge where that gallant old
Gentleman Mr. John Laherne, the Major Generals Father was in the evening most
unfortunatly shot and slain in the place (as mistaken for an Enemy) by one of
the Generals own Scouts, which was a great dishartning to the Army and
disappoyntment of that nights design, howsoever, the Friday following their
Rendezvouse at St. Florence, the Major General viewing and facing the Enemy
all the morning, and observing their numbers of Horse and foot so much to
exceed his own, thought it not fit then to hazard his handful of men, not
above 300. horse at the most and eight hundred foot, the Enemies horse being
full five hundred and near upon double to his of their foot, But drawing
away, he found his Men so willing to fight, and to put it to the hazard, and
that the Enemy stood at the Gaze and moved not at all, he presently gave order
that 160. of his Troopers should charge home on Stradlings whole body of horse
which they did with such courage, that on the second charge they tottaly routed
a^l the enemies cavelry, and following their good fortune, continued to chase
them, six, or eight miles together and until the close of the evening, having
slain and taken near upon 100. they retreated to their Major General, whilst
in his own person, with his own reserve of horse and foot, he fell on the
enemies Body, where he killed of them on the place 120. and took of the
remainder 500. more of them Prisoners, with all their Arms, cariages, and
Ammunition, the residue both of their horse and foot fled toward Carmarthin,
20. miles distant from the place of the battle. The Major General having thus
by Gods great blessing obtained so miraculous a Victory, ascribed the glory to
him that gave it, and thereupon, took up his quarters at Haverford, where
treating with his Prisoners, and understanding in what distress the Town of
Youghall then stood, he found most of them very willing to go for Ireland, and
to renounce the retaking of Arms against the Parliament, whereupon, having
shipping ready in the Haven, he gave present order for the embarking of 400. of
them, to be Landed with all expedition at the Town of Youghall, whether it
was their good hap timely to arive to the releife of the place; and where
they behaved themselves very manfully, in sallying on the Rebels, and beating
them out of their Works.

In the mean time the Major General following this Victory, summoned the
Enemies Garrisons* of Picton, Carew, and Mannerbyer, then the only remainder of
Gerrards great and plundring Army, which by degrees, and within a very short
time were all surrendered unto him, and the whole County again totally cleared
of the Enemy.

The Major General then exceedingly tired; yet with as convenient speed as
possibly he could drew up again toward Carmarthin, (his own County being
then utterly unable to feed an Army) and on the same of his approach, and the
Enemy there of greater strength then his, and within a strong and well
fortified Town yet in Civility were well pleased to dislodge, and to give way
to the Major General to enter, at one end of the Town, whilst the Enemy
marched out at the other.

The Town, and the whole County of Carmarthin, then weary of the War, and
resenting their former forwardnes, but especially the insolency of Gerrard and
his rapatios followers, [when at first they might have been securely quiet,]
submitted themselves, to the Major Generals command, who notwithstanding he
had before taken the place by storm, never plundered it, nor any part of the
County, but only the hundred of The chief sufferers in all the County of
Carmarthin were. Mr. Evand Thomas, Mr. Cradock a very dillige^^ Preacher, Mr.
Tho. White, Mr. Arthur Stafford, Mr. Henry Lloyd, Mr. Gunter; all of the

by that reverend Judge Ienkins.
Durtlesse, a skirt of that County, destinated as it seemes] on both sides to
utter ruin, as a piece, lying between two dissenting Counties: I am bound by
the obligation of truth (which I have assumed without all partiality) to lay
down all passages in their naked verity, so near as my own knowledge and other
informations may warrant me, and amongst many others here to leave this
annimadversion, of special mark; Viz, That General Gerrard was the most
insolent and barbarous Commander, that ever was employed in his Majesty's
service and in both his expeditions into those parts, was accompanied, with
more dissolute and plundring Captains then were in any of the Kings Armies,
and with as desperate a crew of base and blaspemous Soldiers, and thieves then
any throughout the Kingdom; The E* of Carbery, his kindred* allies and
followers, which at their first taking up of Arms, were so sedulously forward
against the Parliament, have all of them very good cause to verify this
assertion, Gerrard sparing not, to put on his Lordship, and his kindred all the
skornes and insolent language, that could have been imagined to proceed from a
Gentleman professing the way of honor; telling Middleton the High-Sherriffe to
his face, [and on no just occasion] and one that was as forward in his
Majesty's service, as any; God-dam-me, thou art a Turd, and I will hang thee,
and such fellows as thou art, at your own doors: In short the welsh Nation,
have had enough and more then their bellies full* of their unnatural rising,
against their consernatory: yet thus much, we must acknowledge, as an
advertisment in the eye, of all men which were acquainted with the passages of
those parts, that my L. of Carbery in his own nature, (howsoever sufficiently
active himself, as at first set on by the The Marquess of Hartford and his
brother the L. St. Maure.
Lords, and annimated by others aforementioned) was notstithstanding, a
moderate Commander, and though timorous to be reputed a Traitor to the King,
should he not have complied in the way as he did) as that was, and is the
vulgar understanding of the times, and of men, which dived not into the nature
of the controversy was doubtless, a private well-wisher, to the cause, and if
all be true, as that unworthy fellow (...)
(and the first plunderer in the principality) openly averd, and at Oxford
accused his Lordship to have played fast and loose with the King, though there
he cleared himself of that imputation) yet in my own particular, I have very
good reason to believe that in his heart he wished well to the State, and was
well content that the kingdoms forces might prevail.

We have a little digrest, but we shall now go on in our relations, and show,
that so soon as the Major Gene* had quietted and settled the County of
Carmarthin, with that of Cardican (where only Colo. James Lews, Captain Thomas
Evans, Mr. James Philips, with some of the Lloyds (of any considerable qualty
and active in the cause) were most cordial, the rest of the Gentlmen generally
retrograde] The Gentlemen of the Countyof Brecknocke; then much desired to
associate with him, to which purpose a meeting was appointed at Lanumdovery;
where in manifestation of their hartinesse, they invited the Major General to
quarter part of his Forces within their County, (where Colo. Harbert Price,
Gefferies and diverse others were inveterate enemies to the Parliament, and
were constant associates both with his Lordship of Carbery, and the General
Gerrard] whereunto the Major General Laherne condiscended and shortly after
came accompanied with 400. Horse and Foot, and quartered at Brecknocke, where,
having intelligence, that, that Irish Rebel and Traitor, Col. Grady, (a
Commander, that never gave quarter to any of the Parliament party) then
quartered at Pembridge, in the County of Hereford, and near upon 30. miles
distance from Brecknocke, he gave present and private Order, that 100. horse
and Dragoones should in the evening begin to march, and so to compute the
design with the time as by the break of the next morning to fall upon Gradyes
quarters, which was so well performed, as that the Majors men, killed diverse
of them in the place, took 60. of the Enemies horse and dissipated the
remainder of Gradyes Regiment; upon their return to Brecknocke, the Major then
presently resolved to march, and [unexpectedly lay down on the uttermost parts
of the Countyof Cardican, before Aberrustwith, whither before he had given
order, that some Guns of Battery should be sent about unto him by Sea, out of
Milford-haven, which being opportunly arrived. he battered the Castle, for
certain days, but with little effect, the place being strong, and well
fortified, the enemy at his first arrival, leaving the town, retreated al into
the Castle, then under the command of Maj. Whitly, one of Ger^^ds prime
plunderers, and having received intelligence from Glamor ganshire of the rising
of Mr. Carne lately designed high Sheriff of that County by the Parliament,
and that he held intelligence with the Enemy, and finding that he could do
little good either by storm, or battery on the place; and having then received
a second intelligence from some well affected Gentlmen of Glamon ganshire, of
the proceedings of Carne, which had then raised 3000. good horse and foot* and
apprehending the consequence* that he meant to join with Ragland forces, and
all the Papists of the County of Monmouth, as also with Sir Jacob Ashley* this
plot of all others being of a most dangerous Consequence if not in speedily
nipt in the badde, and that It manifestly appeared that this Army would in a
short time be the most powerful and formidable, of any his Majesty has had on
foot, if considered with all circumstances, both in respect of the Commander in
chief, and the men then to be under his conduct, and on a second
consideration, that within a few days, they would or might have bin in the
very heart of the County of Pembrooke, and there ready to shake hands with the
Irish Army so long expected, and noysed, then to be in readiness for transport
but taken at the best, and as that Army then was and might have bin augmented
without the Irish assistance it could not have failed to have reduced the who^
County of Pembrook taken the Haven, and all the Towns, (then slenderly manned)
together with the reducing of all the principallity to the irreparable loss of
the State.

The Welsh Nation, being in the General, a people skarce patient in peace but
impatient to be left out of action in times of War, whenever prosperity,
and the name of the King and his anthority, shall offer opportunity, and
encouragement to their unconstant spirits to turn with the wheel, upon these
considerations, the Major General, thought it not then fit to protract time,
having first secured his Cannon, and re-sent them to Sea and leaving his old
Camerado Colonel Powell to block up Aberastwith with such Companies as might
suffice to Master, and keep the Enemy from excursions, he undertook the most
difficult march that could have been chosen throughout the Kingdom, leading
his little Army over as in accessible mountains, [as Hamball did when he past
the Alps into Italy, and through the whole length of the County of Cardican,
part of Carmarthin to Brecknock, where, recruting his forces he marched through
the rest of that county then into Glamorgan, and unto Cardiffe, in the very
center of that shire, 60. wel^h miles, all within 5. or 6. days at the most,
where, with his wearied forces for three days together he fought with the
enemy, kept them from uniting, routed and beat them in all places, and killed
of them near upon 1000. stout and resolute Soldiers, took many of their
horse, 2000. Arms, reduced the whole County, and retooke the strong Town of
Cardiffe, manned with 800. foot not without the loss of most of his own
Troop, with 130. of his old foot, yet to the utter overthrough and
disapointing of the Enemies design (this County, some few private men
expected, being totally falce to the Parliament,) and as we may justly say,
accomplished much, to the admiration of the times. Though now it is this
Gentleman's ill fate (as it has ever bin of all notable Commanders, to be the
subject of detraction, to be envied, and basely traduced, no rational man
knows for what cause, neither on what grounds, more then this, that by the
hand of the Almighty, he has been made the happy instrument of doing of that,
with little or no considerable assistance; and with a poor handful of men,
and through his patience, Industry, vigillancy, indefatigable labor of body,
and continual travel of mind for four years together has accomplished
that, which his shameless Enemies skarse ever durst to think on, bu^ never to
undergo the tenths of the burden, care and toil; which by the Blessing of
God, and to the shame of his enemies, with all his traducers, he has nobly
and faithfully performed, both in saving that little County of Pembrook from
utter destruction, and to the no small advance of all the Kingdoms affairs.

The premises considered: it is in all humble manner offered to this most
honorable Court, that some of the Committees, have borne to high, as
conceiving that the whole power of the Parliament rested in their hands (I
speak not of all, for some of them have moderately carried themselves others
so empeperious* as expecting that not only the Soldier, but the General
himself should, and ought to be wholly ordered by them, esteeming the expense
of some small proportion of their Provisions, and eating a little of their
Grass and Grain, an affront done to their Authority, as well as to their
persons, not considering that where Armies are on foot, liberty and the sword
will bear the sway, private Soldiers may happily obey their superior
Officers. But to be overawed with more masterly Committees, then their own
Commanders seemed, to them, which knew what did belong to the Discipline of
War, somewhat of a strange nature.

The difference extending to another kind of consequerce, when the Soldier
pressing for means were paid in the Coin of big looks, and with acerbity of
language [doe you know where you are, and to whom you speak? do you
understand whom a Committee represents? A soft answer appeaseth wrath, good
words would have done wonders, and have freed some of them, from unhorsing on
the way and to be told to their faces, that if they fought in their defense,
during their stay in the County, they expected pay or free quarter, until they
came where they might have both on cheaper terms. We are bound impartially to
deliver the truth of the most material passages, and are not ignorant, that
discipline is the life of an Army, but ill pay and foul language the death of
discipline and that soldiers, will live, wheresoever they are not provided
for, It is most true, that the Committees being many and of the chief Gentry
of the Country [for the greater part] held themselves; free from quarter, and
had the faculty to help themselves, to the prejudice of their pocre neighbors,
which commonly were charged with more troopers, then came to their shares on
equal quarter, whereas, out of mere parcimony, they preserved much of their
own store, of Corn and other provisions, for the mercylesse Enemies, which had
it bin timely disposed of, either to their Garrisons, on the public Faith, or
given freely to the soldier (who then was to fight and defend them as they
might have done Gerrards Army had bin to seek of subsistence, and o^ much which
he took, or fired, when most of the Committees fled to Sea* and left all to the
futy of the Enemy: we which were strangers* and eyewitnesses of these and
many other carriages before we left the Country, very well saw, that they
might have bin otherwise managed, then they were, had not a kind of high and
lofty bearing of some of the Committees, together with the private spleen,
^e^eds and factions amongst themselves bin the original causes of their
present differences the fault of their sufferings by the Enemy, being most
injuriously by some of them now laid to the charge of the Major General, we
ought not to omit, here to advertise that the little Army, which hitherto, has
bin under his command, never exceeded, 1800. horse and foot, sometimes not
above 1000. in the beginning not 500. and those made up principally of the
Yeomandry of that County, and of such Gentlmen and volunteers as out of zeal
to the Cause, and love to him and his family have faithfully stood to both,
whence we affirm that should the General) on every petty irregularity of the
Soldier) have used severity answerable to the discipline of an Army well paid,
he would have mist of many followers and happily failed in the performance of
much which by the blessing of God, he has accomplished* I speak not of the
common soldier, neither of those which, were under the command of Capt. Poyer,
which in the General, were of the very skum of the County of Pembrooke, and
raised as aforesaid by Captain Butler, both Poyers foot and horsemen, with
Swanleys Seamen, (in the Generalty) were none of the honestest men, and such as
more attended plundering without distinction, either of friends or foes, then
the public service, we would willingly forbear to remember, what the
Committees both in their Articles, and late printed Remonstrance have charged
upon him but that truth ought to appear, and that from a poor groom then a
Glover, after a searcher in the customs, and at best a constant taker, and
sure holder fast of what so ever fish, that came to his net: he behaved
himself like another, A most turbalent factious Brewer in Artivill, a great
pertaker with Edw: the 3d in his march in France, afterward slain in amutenie.
Jaques de Artivill, not sparing to affront the best Gentlemen of the County*
and many more his betters, when on the humor and his drinking mood, he would
find any occasion to pick a quarrel; I plead not against his many services,
neither would; that they should be forgotten, but am humbly bold to advertise
that neither some of the Committees ought to bear the sway which they have
assumed; no^ John Poyer, and his Soldiers any longer suffered to rob and
plunder as they have done without a Parliament mus-rowle to put on his nose and
an good Halter, on such of his Soldiers, as have often deserved it* Now to the
end that this poor distressed and desolated County o Pembrooke, with the
adjacent parts thereunto (all miserably destroyed by fire and plunder) may by
the blessing of God recover and flourish, as heretofore they have done and the
Inhabitants enabled to live in peace and unity, one with the other.

I have humbly taken leave to extend my advertisements* as a conclusion to the
rest of my observations, submitting the whole to the wisdom, and censure of
this most honorable Court, not expecting to give satisfaction to every humor,
concerned in our discourse, as having therein, tied up my self, to the line
and level of truth, which as near as possible, either my own knowledge, or
others informations could direct me, has been impartially presented; If in
the circumstances; of times, and places, mistakes of numbers or such like, (the
substance reserved) some what, either has bin omitted, [happily mistaken] as
particulars without the testimony of my own kenning. I ought nor wholly to be
charged therewith; since in all doubtful and Ambiguous passages. I have taken
pains, and have made means for punctual instructions, and from such persons
of worth, as better knew them then a stranger (who nether was there in the very
Principia of this horrid War, nor privy to Gerrards last years incursion and
cruelties into those parts, [otherwise then by inquiry] and could not obtain
so exact a delyneation, as I desired, and if their occasions would have
permitted, were willing to afford me, which might have more completed the
relation.

It may suffice that my aims, tends to the common good, without either respect
of private ends or self interests; whatothers may be, which here attend to
make friends, feweds, sides, and parties; and in a malicious sedulity strive to
compass particular revenge, under the umbrage of the public service, may be
better discerned in their own faces, and comportments, then otherwise drawn in
the forms, and porttray of Pen-manship That the Committees [complaynants] have
suffered much cannot be contraverted neither is it a part of the dispute in
difference, their losses being included in the Common callamity [my own
particular, being of a sadder story, then any of theirs] only in the way of
their complaint, it is most evident, that malice and envy, has shared with the
most in their pursuit, and happily may obstruct much of that compensation,
which they might have expected to receive from the Parliament, especially in
their traducing and blemishing of the Innocent, with the nocent, and those
which have merited better things from them then to have dirt cast in their
faces; herein J say I must leave them to themselves, as men overballanced in
their oppinions of their own worth; and since by the power of reason, they
have despised to be persuaded, there also J shall leave them to be invaded by
the power of their own abounding sense: sure J am that the Committees here
residing, have not taken the right way of their own repair; nor for the
service of the Country, neither in the manner of their adresse, nor in the
measure of their complaint. I wish them all peace and happiness, with that
great blessing of unity amongst themselves, without which neither families can
subsist, nor Kingoms stand, otherwise then in a tortering and concussive
condition. And since persuasions cannot prevail to atone them, when Almighty
God has sent the devouring and flaming sword amongst them, and yet, it availes
nothing, I crave the privilege for the public good, and the present service
of the Kingdom, to say that the estates ought to interpose and to take present
order therein.

1. That some speedy course may be thought upon, how to reduce the old fewds,
and new factions of the Gentry to unity and Concord amongst themselves, both
for the common good and the particuarl advance of the service in those
Countries.

2. That the insolences of John Poyer late Major of Pembrook with his
Soldiers, may be timely restrained from further plundring their friends
instead of their foes, and such of them as are able, compeld to restirution,
that so the Genlemen and Inhabitants of the three Counties, especially such as
have faithfully stood to the Parliament, may live peaceably in their own homes
and without molestation suffered to begin the World a new, on such relicts of
their estates, as has bin by some few preserved from the fury of the Enemy,
and plunder of the Parliament party, which as yet, and until a course be taken
therein, they dare not adventure to do or look upon their own homes and
distressed Families.

3. That to that purpose, some severe and exemplaty discipline may be timely
enjoined to the Chief Commanders, for suppressing the boldness of the
Soldiers, and of such as are known to be old Thieves, and new plundring
Robbers.

4. That the factious Agents here residing, may be sent home into their
Countries to assist in this good work and no longer suffered to foment
divisions, and under color of public employment spend on the Countries charge.

5. That the many sufferers throughout the three Counties of Cardican and
Carmarthine, but especially that of Pembrooke, and those which have constantly
stood to public cause may be timely provided for, before they starve, or
perish through the extremity of want, whereunto they are now reduced.

6. That no pretendors to lesses may by favor of friends in Parliament
preoccupate the estates, or Fines of any Delinquents within the said Counties,
but that in the first place, they may be preserved, for some competent amends
to be made to such, as have been destroyed, and their numerous families,
utterly left without subsistence and merely for the Parliaments sake.

7. That some worthy and discreet Commissioners, may be timely deputed to
examine particular greevances of all kinds; but principally to inquier of
such, as have from little or nothing much enriched themselves, by following of
Gerrards Army, and quarters, and only to make prey on the well-wishers, and
pertakers with the Parliament, utterly at present unable to come up and to
tender their sad estate to the house: There being many of this sort, throughout
the 3. Counties, which have made up their fortunes, by designing and pointing
out many an honest man Vide, Gerrards List of such Gentlemen as were by him
appointed to be questioned for their lives and estates.
and well willer to the Parliament, to utter destruction; which amongst the
greater Delinquents; would soon be found out, as fittest to make part of the
restitution to such, as have bin only damnified by their procurement.

That it may please this honorable Court to take notice of the miserable
condition of the County of Pembrooke; as also of the hundred of Durtlesse in
the County of Carmarthin, where the Inhabitants in the general are utterly
unable to put a Plow in the ground, it being lamentable to behold, 30. miles
together to lie in a manner utterly wast, and here and there two or 3. Cowes in
harnises, scraping up the earth to cast in a little corn, when 500 good Plows
have bin heretofore seen in the seed time merrily to till the ground in plenty.

We shall now in all humbleness period our Animadversions, with our hearty
prayers to Almighty God, that as in this monstrous unnatural and sanguinary
conflict, he has heitherto seconded your painful endeavors, and in a most
miraculous manner, extended his high hand, throughout the whole progress of
this horrid War; It may farther please him (on the prosperity of your Armies,
and on His Majesty's coming in, after so long a range, and fatal deviation,
so to conduct your future endeavors as in the first place Unity, and Concord
between both Nations may be inviolably preserved, and that the general
calamity may be timely closed up in a firm and well established Peace, to the
glory of God, the honor of the King, and good of the Kingdoms; As also that
the licentiousness of the times in seditious speakings and looseness of the
many disaffected to you and the public, and so long inured to rapine and
plunder, may be speedily restrained as in your great providence and wisdoms,
shall be thought most expedient either to employ some of them for Ireland, and
others of them, (not to be trusted) caused to quit the Kingdom, least a worse
thing happen unto us, and that as opportunity may fall out, they unhappily put
you and the Kingdoms to an after War, which that it may (by the same powerful
arm, (which has heitherto conducted your counsels) be prevented, shall be
the continual prayers of him, who has born a share, of your care, and to that
of his losses, offers both this and himself to yours and the public service.

FINIS.
