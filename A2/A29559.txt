THE BLAZING-STAR, North West South East


OR, NOLLS NOSE Newly Revived, and taken out of his TOMB,

By Colonel BAKER.

Wherein is set down, the Acts of all those
In Pluto's Black Court, that guarded Nolls Nose,
As Harrison, Hewson, and Cook that cursed Pigg,
With Cobbet, Vain, Scot and Nurse Haslerigg.
And next those Black Chaplains that preached up Nolls Nose,
Goodwin, Milton, and Peter's in the close.
Hells Counsel's agreed, and now do dispose
Of Nedham to write for Lucifers Nose,
He being a Vagrant that always did live ill,
Is thought a fit Member to write for the Devil.

NOLLS NOSE Revived
Reader,
GIve ear a while, and here with patience view
This old Cathedral Nose, which now is turned new,
By searching, digging, delving of the ground
Though's Body's lost his Nose is newly found.
It Is from his Grave again new come to light
Extinguished there, but now it burns so bright
That every eye may glistring see afar,
In all appearance like a Blazing-Star;
By the light of which Nose in the darkest Times
(Except you're stark-blind) you may read these Rimes,
LEwd Oliver, show but thy Nose,
Thou needst not fear ten thousand foes,
Brave Cavaliers true Loyal friends,
Thy Nose has brought them to their ends:
The Yorkish and Lancastrian Rose,
Are both usurped by thy vile Nose.
Thy Coper Nose and brazen Face,
Were fit conioyn'd with Joans fat A --
I have no mind to come too ^igh,
For fire and smoke from thence does fly,
And such a stink of Sulphur's there
Sure Aetna or Vesuvio's near.
Thou had been blind, but bor'st a Charm
Thy Nose should do thy Eyes no harm;
Troop not too near but be afeard
The sight of this will fire thy beard,
Jone has a Hole and they call it Hell
More fit for thy Nose then Whitehall to dwell.
Old Murreys Nose once laid an Egg,
Of that thy ramping Nose was b^ed
His Nose did many Trumpet mar
His Nose it did sound blood and war,
The Crocodale so full of guile,
Of such a thing was hatched ere while.
Thou needst no Standard but thy Nose,
For every one that Standard knows;
More terrible it is ith field,
then Arthurs or Rogero's shield:
Thy Nose does still for mischief wagg,
it is like to Tamerlanes black Flagg;
Fatal to us, and to the Scot,
Tredah the same black Omen got:
Thank Jove it is amongst the Alluding to his being in Ireland at that time
when this was made.
Bogs,
ere long it will exalt those Fogs,
And make them all firm land appear,
oh happy we that thou came there!
So many Murders have done here,
two hundred thousand pounds a year;
Then thou shall have to keep thy Court,
for making of the Devil sport.
If thy Nose had been there, it would not have run
at Hyspaniola away soon:
Then threescore Bul-killers could not have bragd
they would killd fifteen hundred, except they would been hagd:
Ill hap had we that thy Nose was not there,
to have put the foul rogues in a vile Panick fear.
When Coachman thou wast, to knave Thurlo thy Knight,
thy Nose in the Coach-box the Horses did fright;
Thou thrusts thy Nose into every ones britch,
made me to scratch where it did not itch;
From thy vile Nose I was forced to fly,
Like Grantham-Steeple it stands awry;
Against any ones nose that grows upright,
thy Bilb^w Nose is ready to fight;
When thou ridest in the Sun, thou needst have a Case,
thy Nose was made of a burning-Glasse:
Thy Nose some fiery Comet shows,
like Nebuchainezars Furnace glowes;
And the Ork thy Nose devours more meat,
then Bell and Dragon ere did eat:
Thou wip'st it like Justinian Nose,
and blood and murder still it blows:
Some Incubus thy Nose begot,
a snout like a Phinocerot:
An Elophants Trunk it is as strong,
it is full as big, and full as long.
Thy Nose it is a slashing Nose,
Where ere it comes it still gives blows,
More Noses it has made to bleed,
Then did the old Rams and Tom fools Head,
This Nose, has more flat Noses made
Then Ladies of Pleasure with their Trade,
And this Nose now is in Fashion most,
We all do feel it to our Cost:
The Scarlet Nose is wondrous high,
The Purple Nose comes somewhat high:
The Levelling Nose does lower lie,
But the snaffling Nose is quite put by:
That Nose was like a Mountain Ridge,
That Nose is now but made a Bridge:
The Roman Nose but weak to this,
And the ^oating Nose as faint I wis:
And all the Noses in the Song,
Must give way to the Nose most Strong:
The Alcheroman Nose is Hugie great,
The Italian Nose is jealous yet:
The Swisses Nose is blunt and rough,
And the Spanish Nose is proud and snuff:
The French Nose is a tottie Nose,
The Scotch Nose false for their Kirk late Roase:
The Presbiters Nose is sharp and tart,
And the Jesuits Nose is quick and smart:
The Dutch Nose does the Bottle bear,
And a running Nose the Irish wear:
The Polish Nose is brave and bold,
And the Russes Nose is often acold:
The German Nose is big and strong,
And the Swedish Nose is strange and long:
And all the Noses in the song,
Must give way to the Nose most Strong;
Thy Nose does shine like Rubies red,
And richer then Saint Denis Head,
It Is the Carbuncle that was left,
At Median to light Mahomet:
Thy Nose as great an Impostor was,
As many mischiefs brought to pass;
Thy Nose does like Belphegors show,
To Plutoe's Court ere long 't shall go;
And Corherus 'twil make to run,
As Aercules before had done,
And all black Guards 't will drive away,
If thou do but thy Nose display:
If Orpheus but this had wist,
His Euridice he had not mist;
He had not gone for's wife till now,
And thy brave Nose had brought them through:
The furies it would force to sly,
No Nemesis that dares come nie,
Until you are called t'account for all,
Thy blood for Vengeance loud does call.
Now we will petition the Rump for thee,
That thou their Champion there shall be;
They need not ride the Ass so poor,
In Hell they shall have treasure store;
Though Church and Royal Lands cannot
(Excise, and by Delinquents got,
Both Indies, France, and Spain beside,)
Suffice their Lucre, Lust, and Pride:
Yet Mammon has a mighty mess
Of wealth, will serve Saints more and less;
There Is gold enough if they can win it,
Can, or cannot, the Devil's in it:
But stay, and win all Scotland first,
The Kirk Hobgoblins do their worst:
Then down old Noll, and leave us here,
And conquer those vast Regions there;
So thou shall he a King ith close,
The Royal blood sticks on thy Nose;
And thou shall reign in Plutoes Hall,
Thy Name shall be NOSE-GENERAL;
And after ages shall thee call,
The Devils great NOSE-GENERAL.
The land of Darkness this we may call,
When the Devils Nose did govern all.
A POSTSCRIPT, On the second part of NOLS Nose, newly revived.
NOls Nose, the Cobblin that made us afraid,
Those that conjured him up, would fain have him laid:
To cou^in the Devil, he thought of a slight,
When he come for him and his Nose one night:
Noll gave him his Bond in a mighty great wind, Dennis Bond a very Rogue, and
Nols great Favorite, was used to call him his Bond. He died the windy day
before Noll.

He took one up before, and the other behind:
Saint Denis is gone, and we lost the great Nose,
Good land-ma^ks for rebel and traitors are those:
And since in Whitehall great groans has been heard,
(Till His Majesty came) it made them afeard.
Noll wants his old Chaplains were sit for his Nose,
Goodwin* and Milton, and Peter's ith close;
And Stirry that saw him so high intercede,
At Heavens right hand for all Sa^nts in their need.
His Messenger Pain, and Soliciter Cook,
For Huson, and Hulet ere long he does look;
Hasilrigge, Cobbet, and Harrison too,
In great Plutoes Court they will make much ado:
Lilly shall be chief Astrologer chose,
And Politicus write for Lucifers Nose;
With his bos in lingua, young Tarquin to bring,
And Hacker that was so harsh to the King:
Two brave Royal Kings most grossly abused
By Hocus, and Pocus, ought not be excused:
For the rest of the Rogues, by Hook or by Crook,
All Traitors and Rebels, the Devil does look;
King-killers, King-catchers, and all wicked Rabble.
The Parliament cleanse, that ugly foul Stable:
So Heaven protect, bless, prosper the King,
To him and his house, rich treasure still bring.
The Kirk may no more set's together by the ears,
In peace live without all jealousies and fears,
Pretense of Religeon, make no one to rise,
To set up such fellows, the land's grown more wise;
We have paid fort (I think) or else we are mista'en,
And many a brave man has here got his bane;
When he rises again, his Nose will be red,
And many years after heel walk when he is dead:
Nols Ambition is laid but yet his vile Nose
Walks up and down still, in Verse, and in Prose.
You great Ones, have care how your Noses do rise,
Against your Kings any more, No I Nose does advise:
Take this admonition, or else you're ^o blame,
The Rams-head and Goat do counsel the same;
Gave better advise then themselves would take,
For their souls, fa^^es, friends, reputations sake;
But now they repeat when it is too late,
Shun Envy, Ambition, Pride, ^ucr^, and Hate,
Rebellion, and Treason (pretend what they w^ll)
In obedience, good Sub^ects will keep themselves still:
All these hor^id crimes, and more they have done,
Ore the world have scandall'd the whole Nation:
Then lets do our best still, our Credites regain,
Few Rebels or Traitors are heard of in Spain:
To their Kings they bear such loyalty great,
The English (it is hoped) will transcend them yet:
For we are descended from people mere brave,
The rest from the Jew, the Moor, and the Knave:
It Is a shame that the Turk, the Moor, and the Knave,
Should be to their Kings more Loyal and brave;
But the matter's now mended (for ever) we hope,
All rebels and traitors I wish them a Rope:
No Cadmean brethren contend for a tomb,
Nor Esau and Jacob here strive in the womb:
Our civil Wars cease, and never no more
The Kirk and the Scot break through the backdoor:
Nor Mazarine no more have his finger ith Pie,
The Anabaptist and Brownist both let them go by:
No Phares or Pharisee make a new breach;
Instead of Religeon Rebellion up preach:
The are false Religeons brought in by the Sword,
The Gospel of truth is taught by the Word:
That Blood-hound old Noll, and his Nose quire trod down,
The Royal House flourish, and King Charles his CROWN.
FINIS.
