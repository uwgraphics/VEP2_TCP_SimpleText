By the King.
A Proclamation for the better discovery and apprehension of those Malefactors,
who were Actors in the late insolent Riots and Murders committed in
Fleetstreet, London, upon Friday, the tenth day of this instant month of July.
WHereas upon Friday, the tenth day of this instant Month, upon the occasion
of an Arrest then made by the Sheriffs Officers of the City of London, diverse
insolent Assaults and Tumults were made and raised upon the Constables and
Watches of the City, whereupon much bloodshed, and the barbarous murder of
diverse of Our loving Subjects has insued, and those insolences so long
continued, and at the last grew to such height, that there was an open and
violent resistance and opposition made against Our Lord Mayor of London, and
Our Sheriffs of Our City, assisted with some of the trained Bands necessarily
drawn forth to suppress those outrages, which were committed rather in
Rebellious then in a Riotous manner; We having taken these affronts to Justice,
and to Our public Officers and Ministers, into our Princely consideration,
and having already given a strict Charge and Command for the due examination of
these so bold and audacious attempts, and finding by the return of those,
whose pains We have employed in that Service, that very few of the principal
Actors can by their industry be yet taken or discovered, and, We bring
resolved, in a case of this extraordinary quality and consequence, to proceed
according to the strict rule of Justice, against all those who shall be found
to be the Offenders, that by their examples others may hereafter be warned not
to dare to run into the like:

To the end therefore that those malefactors may not be concealed, and so
escape their due punishments, These are to Will and Command, all and every Our
Loving Subjects whom it may concern, especially the Chirurgions, in, or near
Our City of London or Westminster, who have, or since that day had, any hurt or
wounded men in their Cure, that they and every of them upon their allegiance to
Us, and the duty they owe to the Public peace of Our State, and upon pain of
such punishments, as by Our Laws, or by Our Prerogative Royal ran be
inflicted upon them, for their neglect herein, do forthwith upon publication
of this Our Royal pleasure, discover to the Lord President of Our Privy
Council, or to one of Our principal Secretaries of State, the names of all
such persons as they know, or by probable conjecture, do suspect to have been
Actors in any of those late tumults, and the places of their abidings, and that
they, and all other persons whatsoever, do their best endeavors, to detain
or apprehend them, or cause them to be detained or apprehended without
expecting any further or other Warrant in that behalf, and by name that they
apprehend, or cause to be apprehended, wheresoever they shall be found,
Captain Vaughan, Henry Stamford, and one Ward, an Ensign, that so they and
every of them, may be ready to answer such matters, as on Our behalf shall
be objected against them; Hereof all and every persons, whom it may concern in
their several places, are to take notice, and carefully to observe the same,
at their uttermost perils.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the eighteenth day of July, in the fifth year
of Our Reign, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.

God save the King.

Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXIX.
