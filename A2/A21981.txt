By the King. A Proclamation for reformation of great abuses in Measures.
WHereas for the avoiding of variety and deceits of Weights and Measures,
diverse Statutes, Acts and good Ordinances have heretofore been made, That one
Weight, and one Measure should be used throughout the Realm, And where,
according to the Statutes made in the eleventh and twelfth years of the reign
of the late king of famous memory King Henry the seventh, there were made,
sent, and delivered into diverse Cities and Towns, specified in a Schedule unto
the said Act of 11. H. 7. annexed, Weights and Measures of Brass according to
the Standards thereof remaining in the Treasury of the Exchequer, to remain
in the keeping of the Mayor, Bayliffe, or other head Officer for the time
being, of every of the same City or Town, as the kings Standard of Weight and
Measure, with authority and power given by the same Statute, to the said
Mayor, Bailiffe, or other head Officer, having the said Weights and Measures,
to make, sign and print like Weights and Measures unto every of the kings
subjects, duly requiring the same, as by the said Statutes more at large
appears: And whereas also our late Sovereign Lady Elizabeth late Queen of
England, being informed that the said Standard measures remaining in those
Cities and Towns, for the most part were by long continuance of time, or for
want of good keeping, or other defects or abuses, differing and not agreeing
with the ancient Standard of Measures remaining in her Highness Exchequer at
Westminster, by occasion whereof the Measures commonly used within the Realm
were uncertain, and varying one from another, to the great slander of the same,
the disquieting of the Subjects, and the deceiving of many both buyers and
sellers, Did give order and commandment to the L. Treasurer and under
Treasurer, to cause all the ancient Standard measures of all those several
Cities and Towns to be brought in before them at the Exchequer at Westminster,
to be examined and tried by the Standard measure there remaining, according to
which her Majesty's commandment, the Lord Treasurer and under Treasurer have
caused all the ancient Standard measures of all those several Cities and
Towns to be brought before them into the said Exchequer, where diverse of them
upon diligent and due trial and examination have been found defective,
differing and disagreeing from the true and ancient Standard of the said
Exchequer.

Whereupon the said late Queen intending the common and public good of all
her loving Subjects, and to avoid all differences and deceipts of Measure
within her Highness Realm, upon good and deliberate advise, and due
consideration therein had, Did not only establish the foresaid true and
ancient Standard of Measures remaining in the said Exchequer, there to continue
and be, as her Majesty's Standard, to examine, try, and size all other
Measures of the Realm by, from time to time as occasion shall require: But
also did give commandment to the Lord Treasurer and under Treasurer to cause
all the other Measures which were brought before them (from the Cities and
Towns before said) found upon trial to be differing and disagreeing from the
true and ancient Standards of measures of the said Exchequer, to be broken.

And further her Majesty did give order and commandment unto the said Lord
Treasurer and under Treasurer, forthwith to cause new Standards of measures in
Brass to be made, tried, and approved by the said true and ancient Standard
of the Exchequer, and after true and just examination and trial thereof had
and made, to size and seal (with the letter E crowned) such and so many
Standard measures, for every of the said several Cities and Towns limited to
have the custody of weights and measures, according to the Queens Standard
for every Shire by the said schedule annexed unto the said Statute made in the
eleventh year of the Reign of King Henry the seventh, there to remain for
ever in the keeping of the Mayor, Bayliffe, or other head Officer for the time
being of the said City and Town as her Standard of measure, as to them should
seem necessary and convenient. And also as many as may serve and be convenient
for the Clarke of the Market of her Highness household (and through the Realm)
or his Deputies, according to the Statute of Anno 1^. R. 2. Cap 3. And also as
might or should serve for any other her Majesty's Officers or Subjects within
this Realm, as should make suite for the having and obtaining of the same.

And now our Sovereign Lord the Kings Majesty, minding likewise the quiet and
public good of all his loving Subjects of the same, And for the right and
just maintenance, and execution of all those good and godly Laws in that
behalf heretofore made by his most noble Progenitors, to be daily used and put
in execution amongst all his said Subjects of this his Highness Realm of
England, as well within Liberties as without; His Majesty's will and pleasure
is, That the Mayors, Bayliffes, Portreues, Wardens, and other head Officers of
every of the said Cities, Boroughes, Towns, Cinqueports, and places mentioned
in the schedule annexed to the said Statute of Anno 11. H 7. which have not
already received the said new Standard Measure from the said Exchequer, before
the feast of All Saints next coming, at the common charge of the same place,
shall send some sufficient person unto the said Exchequer, authorized to
receive such Standards as shall be delivered unto him, by the order and
appointment of the said Lord Treasurer and under Treasurer, for the said City,
Borough, Town, or place, And to pay such reasonable prices for the same, as
upon true valuation of the same shall be by the said Lord Treasurer and under
Treasurer rated or assessed: which Standards, every of the said Majors,
Bayliffes, and other head Officers unto whom it shall appertain, shall safely
keep or cause to be kept in some sure and convenient place in the same City,
Borough, or Town, and by them make or size, or cause to be made or sized,
other common Measures for the use of all manner of people in the same City,
Borough, Town, or place that shall have cause to use Measures. And shall also
make, sign, and prin(...) with the first letter of the name of the same City,
Borough, Town, or place where the same measure shall be so made, sized, and
printed, like Measures unto every of the Kings Subjects duly requiring the
same, taking such fees for the doing thereof as by the Statutes of the Realm
are allowed, and no more. And every of the said Majors, Bayliffes, and other
head Officers of Cities, Boroughes, Towns, and places within this Realm,
shall further do and cause to be done, all such other Act and Acts, thing and
things, for the providing, having, and using of the said Standards of
Measures, as be limited and appointed to their or any of their authority by
the said Statutes made in th(...) eleventh and twelfth years of the late King
Henry the seventh, or any other Statute or Ordinance whatsoever: So as all the
Measures through the Realm may be reformed and made agreeable according to
the Standard of the Exchequer, as by the said Statutes in such case is
required. And his Majesty further straightly charge and commands, That no
person or persons shall from the aforesaid feast of All Saints next coming,
use any other Measure or Measures, but such as shall be made or sized, and
respectively agreeing with the said Standards, and printed and marked with the
letter I crowned, with such marks and letters for every town as before is
limited, upon pain to be apprehended, committed to prison, fined and
punished, as contriuers and users of false Measures, according to the Statutes
in that case made and provided. And that this Proclamation for the better
instructing of al his Majesty's Subjects, shall before the feast of All Saints
now next coming, be proclaimed in every Market town through the Realm, and
be hanged up, and fastened in a Table in the Market place by an Officer, where
it may continue to be seen and read by any that will. And that the defaults
of Officers, of every town in this behalf, shall be enquired of and punished
by the Justices of Assise, and Justices of Peace in their Sessions, according
to their discretions, as contemners of his Majesty's commandment. And that all
the Standards and Measures whatsoever, not sized, marked and printed, and made
respectively agreeing to and with the foresaid Standard, and the true meaning
of this proclamation, shall from the said feast of All Saints next coming,
which shall be in the year of our Lord God 1603. be reputed and taken for untrue
measures, and shall be broken, defaced and destroyed by the owners of the same,
or by such officers as have or shall have authority to enquire of false weights
and measures.

And for the better execution hereof, his Highness express commandment is,
That all Majors, Bailiffes, and other head officers of every City, Shirt,
Town, Borough, or Market within this Realm, shall immediately after the said
Feast of All Saints, and so from time to time according to the said Statute, as
all other Corporate, Borough, or Market Towns within this Realm, cause to be
brought before them all the Measures, within the same Cities, Boroughs,
Corporate or Market Towns, to be duly viewed and examined, and such as they
shall find defective or disagreeing unto the foresaid Standard Measures,
either in greatness or smalnesse, to cause to be broken and defaced, and
further punishment to be done upon the offenders therein, according to the
Statute. And that the Justices of Peace, or two of them (whereof one of them to
be of the Quorum) shall with all diligence and from time to time, by
examination or inquiry hear and determine the defaults of all Majors,
Bayliffes, and other head Officers of Cities, Boroughs, Corporate or Market
Towns within their limits or authorities on that behalf, and to set Fines and
Amercements upon the offenders in that behalf by their discretions, and those
to estreate into the Court of Exchequer, and that upon pain of the punishment
due for such contempt.

And lastly, his Majesty straightly charge and commands all Justices of
Assize, Justices of Peace, his Highness Clerk of the Market, his deputy or
deputies, Majors, Bailiffes, Stewards of Liberties, and all other his Majesty's
Officers and Ministers whatsoever, to cause this present Proclamation, and all
Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances, for the having and using of true Measures, and
for the abolishing the use of false Measures, to be put in execution according
to their several authorities and Jurisdictions, as they herein tender the good
service of his Majesty, and the Common wealth of this Realm.

Given at his Majesty's Castle of Windsor the fifth day of July, 1603. in the
first year of our Reign of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the
six and thirtieth.
God save the King.

Majesty.
