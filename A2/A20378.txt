A lamentable Dittie composed upon the death of Robert Lord Deuereux late Earl
of Essex, who was beheaded in the Tower of London, upon Ashwednesday in the
morning. 1601.
To the tune of Welladay.


SWeet Englands pride is gone
welladay welladay,
Which makes her sigh and groan
evermore still:
He did her fame advance,
In Ireland Spain and France,
And now by dismal chance,
is from her taken.
He was a virtuous Peer,
welladay welladay,
And was esteemed dear
evermore still:
He always helped the poor,
Which makes them sigh full fore
his death they do deplore,
In every place.
Brave honor graced him still
gallantly gallantly,
He nere did deed of ill,
well is it known:
But envy that foul fiend
Whose malice never has end;
has brought true virtues friend
Unto his thrall.
At Tilt he did surpass
gallantly gallantly:
all men that is and was
evermore still:
One day as it was seen,
In honor of his Queen,
Such deeds has never been seen,
As he did do.
Abroad and eke at home,
gallantly, gallantly,
For valor there was none,
like him before:
In Ireland France and Spain,
(They feared great Essex name,
And England loved the same,
In every place.
But all would not prevail
welladay welladay:
His deeds did naught avail,
more was the pity:
He was condemned to die,
For treason certainly,
But God that sits on hie
Knows all things.
That Sunday in the morn,
welladay welladay:
That he to the City came,
with all his troop:
That first began the strife,
And caused him loose his life,
And others did the like,
As well as he.
Yet her Princely Majesty
graciously, graciously,
Has pardon given free
to many of them:
She has released them quite,
And given them their right,
they may pray both day and night
God to defend her.
Shrouetewesday in the night.
welladay, welladay,
With a heavy hearted spright
as it is said:
The leiftenant of the Tower
Who kept him in his power.
At ten a clock that hour.
To him did come.
And said unto him there,
mournefully, mournfully,
My Lord you must prepare,
to die to morrow:
Gods will be done quoth he,
Yet shall you strangely see,
God strong in me to be,
Though I am weak.
I pray you pray for me
well day, welladay,
That God may strengthen me,
against that hour:
Then straightway did he call,
The Guard under the wall,
And did entreat them all
For him to pray.
For to morrow is the day
welladay welladay,
That I the debt must pay,
which I do owe:
It is my life I mean,
Which I must pay my Queen,
Even so has justice given,
That I must do.
In the morning was he brought,
welladay welladay:
Whers a Scaffold was set up,
within the Tower:
Many Lords were present then,
With other Gentlemen,
Which were appointed then
(...) see him dye.
You noble Lords quoth he
welladay welladay,
That must the witness be,
of this my death:
Know I never loved Papistrye,
But did it still defye,
And Essex thus did dye,
Here in this place.
I have a sinner been
welladay welladay:
Yet never wronged my Queen
in all my life,
My God I did offend,
Which grieves me at my end,
May all the rest amend,
I do forgive them.
To the state I never meant ill
welladay, welladay,
Neither wished the commons ill
in all my life:
But loved all with my heart,
And always took their part,
VVh^ereas there was desert,
In any place.
Then mildely did he crave
mournefully mournefully,
He might that favor have
private to pray:
He then prayed heartely,
And with great feruency,
To God that sits on hie,
For to receive him.
And then he prayed again
mournefully mournefully,
God to preserve his Queen
from all her foes:
And send her long to reign,
True Justice to maintain,
And not to let proud Spain,
Once to offend her.
His gown he slipped off then
welladay welladay,
And put off his hat and band
and hung it by.
Praying still continually,
To God that sits on hie,
That he might patiently,
There suffer death.
My headesman that must be,
then said he cheerefullie,
Let him come here to me,
That I may him see:
Who kneeled to him then,
Art thou (quoth he) the man,
Which art appointed now,
my life to free.
Yes my Lord did he say
well a day, welladay,
Forgive me I you pray
for this your death:
I hear do there fore,
And may true justice live,
No foul crime to for give,
Within their place.
Then he kneeled down again,
mournefully mournefully:
And was required by some
there standing by:
To forgive his enemies,
Before death closde his eyes,
Which he did in hearty wise,
Thanking them for it:
That they would remember him
welladay, welladay:
That he might sorgiue all them,
that had him wronged:
Now my Lords I take my leave
Sweet Christ my soul receive,
Now when you will I prepare,
For I am ready.
He laid his head on the block,
welladay welladay:
But his doublet did let the stroke
some there did say:
What must be done (quoth he)
Shall be done presently,
Then his doublet off put he,
and lay down again.
Then his headesman did his part
cruelly, cruelly,
He was never seen to start,
For all the blows:
His soul it is at rest.
in heaven among the blessed,
Where God send us to rest,
When it shall please him.
God save the King.
FINIS.
