By the Queen.
A Proclamation forbidding the transportation and carriage of all manner of
grain and Beer out of the Realm, to endure until the next Michaelmas
hereafter following.
The viij. of October, 1590.
THe Queens Majesty understanding the likelihood of great de arth of all
manner of grain, to follow this present year within her Realm, if good
foresight be not had to restrain the carrying out of all sorts of grain to
foreign parts, where it is known there is scarcity, and thereby occasion
given for private lucre, to carry into foreign parts, such kinds of grain, as
(God be thanked) there is sufficient thereof in this Realm for her own people
and subjects: has by advise of her Counsel, determined to provide remedy for
such inconvenience. And therefore her Majesty does most straightly charge and
command, that no persons of what condition soever they be, shall carry or
cause to be carried out of the Realm, or bargain, grant or covenant with any
person, to the intent to be carried out of the Realm, any Wheat, Rye, Barley,
Malte, Beans, Otes, or Pease, upon pain of imprisonment during their lives,
and such fine, as shall be assessed by her Majesty's Counsel, upon their lands or
goods. And that all Owners and masters of Ships, and all mariners that shall be
privy to the lading and carrying of any such grain into any parts out of the
Realm, shall also be committed to prison for one whole year, and the ship that
shall be laden belonging to any owner being privy thereto, to be arrested, and
not to be suffered to make sail, during one whole year following. And because
her Majesty understands, that there is great abuse in carrying out of Beer,
by color of certain licenses, and in the name of victualling Beer, or
fowring Beer: Her Majesty commands and wills the Lord Treasorer of
England, to stay the carriage of any manner of Beer out of the Realm, by
virtue of any licenses remaining yet in force, which her Highness pleasure is,
to be suspended until Michaelmas next now following, And that no Beer be
either for victualling of ships to be occupied in trade of merchandise, or any
ships lawfully set forth as ships of war, or for a kind of victualling
of strangers ships, in the name of fowring Beer, shipped to the carried, but
that the same be limited and rated in every port, according to such good orders
as have been of late years prescribed for the same in the port of London, and
as shall be further prescribed to the Officers of every port within the Realm,
by the Lord Treasorer of England. And yet nevertheless, her Majesty thinks
it meet, that such reasonable quantity of wheat for bread corn, and Beer,
shall be carried out of the usual ports of her Realm, into the low countries,
for the sustentation of her soldiers serving in the same low countreies,
according to such a convenient proportion as has been of late limited to such
persons as have or shall have the charge thereof, and not otherwise. And to the
intent this her Majesty's straight commandment may take the better effect, Her
Majesty has commanded her privy Counsel to make choice of certain special
trusty persons in all the Maritime Counties of her Realm, where ports are
meet to lade any such grain, and them by special letters to authorize and
charge, to have regard from time to time, to all manner of shipping that shall
lade any grain to transport from port to port, that by color thereof no
grain be laden, but upon bonds first given with good sureties, to be
certified into her Exchequer, that the same shall not pass out of the Realm,
And to add to the same bonds such other needful conditions as shall seem
meet to restrain the same, the better thereby to perform the intent of this
her Majesty's commandment, which her Highness express pleasure is shall be
and continue in force, until Michaelmas next coming after the publication
hereof.

Given at her Majesty's Castle of Windsor the eight day of October 1590, in the
two and thirtieth year of her Majesty's reign.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty. 1590.
