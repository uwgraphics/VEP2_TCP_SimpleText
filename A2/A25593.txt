An Answer To the forcd Marrige: Or, the old man's vindication.
I Read a Song a Day or two ago,
Which says that Celia's now grown whorish too,
And makes a fine pretense because she is wed,
To one that is old, she need must wrong his bed:
I of her wantonness having suspicion,
Have searched, and found out the old man's condition;
And now I plainly see she wrongs him much,
She only had a mind to take a touch;
With some fond foolish youngster, not for need,
For her old man as well can do the deed:
As most men can, and this may satisfy,
That Celia does her husband much belie.
The Tune is, Celia's my Foe.




SInce Celia's a Whore,
I Will abide her no more,
Let her go,
Since I know,
A far better in store:
The ill luck was my own,
That a slut I have known,
Who scorns me,
And horns me,
And swears she will be gone.
Her Parents took care,
That my wealth she should share,
Crying Daughter,
Hereafter,
Be wise and beware.
Though your Husband be old,
Prithee be not too bold,
If unkind,
You will find,
That his Love will grow cold;
Methinks their advice,
Might have made her more wise;
Till death
Stopped my breath,
And had closed up my eyes.
I Would have left her much coin,
And her freedom too join:
With that Youth,
Who in truth,
now enjoys what is mine.






She swears I am a sot,
Deformed and what not,
But I swear
By the Beer,
That I have in this Pot,
I will cherish my blood,
With the best of all food,
Brisk Wine,
Shall be mine,
And all things that are good.
I care not a pin,
But let them laugh as win,
I Will delight
Day and Night,
And never count it a sin.
Pretty Phillis I know,
So much love does me owe.
She Would be willing,
To be billing,
And bend to my bow.
Though she says I am in age,
Yet I am free to engage,
With a beauty,
Where duty,
All hats does assuage.
Since Celia's unkind,
I Will be of the same mind,
Let her go,
Since I know,
Where a better to find.
She has taught me the way,
For to sport and to play,
She may leave me,
Not grieve me,
Nor my reason betray.
Being freed from a wife,
I shall live without strife;
Enjoying,
And toying,
All days of my Life.
Then think it not strange,
If like Celia I range;
If she
Love not me,
Why may not I change,
I Will get free from the Charms
Of those treacherous arms;
And i will yield
Up the field
To loves private alarms.
Be happy and poor,
Like a wanton young whore:
We Will part
With free heart,
And i will never see thee more.
Thy youngster at last,
Whom thou now hold'st so fast;
Will leave thee,
And deceive thee,
Then to Bridewel at last.
Then when it is too late,
Thou will praise thy old Mate:
And curse
Thy self worse,
That his Love thou did hate.
But without all redress,
For no love i will express,
To a woman
That Is common,
As her self does confess.
I Will not make my moan,
To the Trees, nor to stone,
Be it known,
When you are gone,
I will not lie alone.
To Phillis i will show,
What my courage can do;
She Will raise me,
And praise me,
Thus Celia adieu.
FINIS.
With Permission, To. L'Estrange.
