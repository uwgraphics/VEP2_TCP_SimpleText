BY THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF Of all the FORCES in SCOTLAND.
THe Commonwealth of England having used all means of tenderness and affection
toward the People of this Nation, by receiving them (after a chargeable and
bloody War) into Union with England, and investing them with all the Liberties
and Privileges thereof (purchased at the Expense of so much Blood and
Treasure) and by daily protecting them with their Army and Navy, at a great
charge (of which this Nation under-goeth no more than their equal proportion
with England) against their Enemies both abroad and at home, whereby all of
them might enjoy the fruits and benefits of Peace; Yet diverse lewd persons,
broken in their fortunes, and dissolute in their Lives, are run into Rebellion,
who being assisted and connived at by their Parents, Brethren, Tuitors,
Masters, and People among whom they live, who secretly conceal them in their
houses in the day time, and in the night suffer them to rob and plunder the
Country, whereby the Peaceable People of this Nation are many of them ruined,
and the rest disturbed, so that they cannot live in Peace. And to the end that
no Peaceable means might be left unattempted, for the prevention thereof, I, by
virtue of the Authority to me given by His Highness and His Council, do
Declare, That all such Persons that are now in Rebellion, (except such as are
excepted in the Acts of Grace) who shall within twenty days after the
Publication hereof, come in, and submit him or themselves, to the Governor of
the next English Garrison, and give good security for his or their future
Peaceable living, shall be, and is hereby in his and their persons, freely
pardoned, for any Offense, Spoil or Plunders committed by him or them in this
present Rebel on, (the killing of any person in cold blood only excepted.)
And I do Declare, That if any Parents, Brethren, or Tuitors, who have assisted
or connived at any their sons, Brothers, or Pupils, now in Rebellion, as
aforesaid, shall within twenty days after Publication hereof, cause their said
Sons, Brothers, or Pupils, to render themselves, and give security, as
aforesaid, That then the said Parents, Brethren and Tuitors, who have so
offended, are hereby freely pardoned; But if otherwise, then the said Parents,
Brethren, and Tuitors, who have so offended, shall be imprisoned during the
time the said Persons do remain in Rebellion. And in regard diverse Persons who
are now in ^ebellion, and who have lived remote from their friends, but could
not probably break out into Rebellion, without the knowledge or consent of some
of the Inhabitants of that Parish or Presbytery where he or they last lived,
before their breaking forth; I do therefore hereby Declare; That if the said
Parish or Presbytery where he or they last lived, procure the said person or
persons so broken forth, to render him or themselves, within twenty days after
Publication hereof, and give security, as aforesaid, That then the said Parish
or Presbytery so offending, is hereby pardoned; But if otherwise, I do hereby
impose upon the said Parish and Presbytery, Two shillings six pence a day for
each Horseman, and Ten pence a day for each Footman, so broken into
Rebellion, over and above their Ordinary Sess, out of the said Parish or
Presbytery, which the Governor of the next English Garrison is hereby
authorized to levy and receive monthly, during the time the said persons shall
so continue in Rebellion. And I do likewise hereby empower all the good People
of this Nation, to apprehend all such person and persons as are, or hereafter
shall break out into Rebellion, or attempt so to do, and safely to deliver him
or them to the Governor of the next English Garrison; and in case of
resistance, to take such Weapons as they can get, and to fight the said person
or persons; and if they shall kill any of the said persons so resisting, they
shall not be questioned for the same, but (on the contrary) shall receive as a
reward of their good service, all such Moneys, Goods, Horses, and Clothes, as
the said Rebellious Persons are then possessed of, besides full satisfaction
for their pains and travel therein. And in regard this present Rebellion has
been principally contrived, fomented, and is now obstinatly maintained by Major
General Middleton, the Earl of Athol, the Earl of Seaforth, Viscount Kenmure,
and Major General Dayell; I do hereby therefore Declare, That what person or
persons soever of this Nation, (except such as are before excepted) shall kill
any of the said principal Contrivers, or shall deliver any of them prisoner,
to any Governor of any English Garrison, the said person or persons so killing,
or bringing prisoner, as aforesaid, shall not only be pardoned for any thing he
or they have acted in this late Rebellion, but also shall receive as a Reward
of his good service, the sum of Two hundred pounds sterling for every person so
killed or brought prisoner, as aforesaid. And lastly, for the encouragement of
all Peaceable and well-affected People, both English and Scots, I do also
hereby Declare, That what damage shall be done to their Persons, Goods or Geer,
for their good affection to the Public, the same shall be again repaired out
of the Estates of such as have done the damage, or out of the Estates of the
Friends and harbourers of such wrong-doers, or out of the Parish, Presbytery,
or Shire where the wrong is done, in case they do not apprehend the said
Offenders, or give the English Forces such timely notice thereof, that the said
Offenders may be apprehended by them. And I do hereby require all Provosts,
Bailiffs, and Chief Officers of Head-Burghs, in their several Burghs, to cause
these presents to be duly Published and Posted up, according to the usual
form, and to certify their doings therein to me, in writing, under his or
their hands.

Given under my Hand at Dalkeith, this 4. day of May, 1654. GEORGE MONCK.
