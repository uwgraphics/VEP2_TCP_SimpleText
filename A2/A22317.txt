A Proclamation for Ambassadors and foreign Ministers.
THE Kings most Excellent Majesty, considering the great Privileges, which by
the Laws of GOD and Nations are attributed unto the persons of Ambassadors,
Agents, and public Ministers of foreign Princes and States, and the great
Reverence and Respect, which of right appertains unto them, and weighing the
manifold and important Reasons thereof, and how necerely every small neglect
and disrespect of them, touches not only those Princes and States by whom
they are employed, but all others in example and consequence, and as a
necessary dependant thereupon, the universal weal and tranquillity of all
Kingdoms and States, having intercourse, commerce, or correspondence together;
And willing that as great observance be used toward them within this His
Majesty's Realm, as in other the best governed Kingdoms and Nations, Has
thought fit hereby to forewarne all persons whatsoever, That they not only
forbear to use any insolency, misbehauiour, inciuilitie, disgrace, or
affront, unto any Ambassadors, Agents, or public Ministers of any foreign
Princes or States, and their followers, servants, and attendants, but also do
upon all occasions perform unto them, all such reverence, respect and
courtesy, both in speech, gesture and otherwise, as is most fitting to proceed
from persons of civil behavior, unto men of that eminency for place and
employment, upon pain of His Majesty's highest indignation and displeasure,
and such senere punishment as the offenders of this His Royal Command may
deserve. And His Majesty does hereby charge and command, not only the Lords
of His Majesty's Privy Council, but also all Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of
Peace, and all other His Majesty's Officers, Ministers and Subjects, That they,
and every of them in their several places, do not only use their best
endeavor to prevent and restrain all insolences, misbehauiours, and offenses
aforementioned, but also take order that all offenders therein may receive
speedy and condign punishment according to their demerits, to the terror and
example of others.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the eight day of March, in the one and
twentieth yeereof Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
