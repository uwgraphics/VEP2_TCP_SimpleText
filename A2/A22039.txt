A Proclamation for proroguing the Parliament.
WHereas at the rising of the late Session of our Parliament, we prorogued the
same until the sixteenth day of November now next ensuing, For as much as the
Infection of the plague is now in some parts of our City of London, So that it
is to be feared that if the Term and Parliament should meet together, and
thereby draw a double concourse of people from all parts of the Realm thither,
it might give occasion both to increase the said Sickness thereabouts (where
our most abode is) and to disperse it into other parts of the Realm, We have
therefore thought it fit to prorogue it further into the Winter, that is to
say, to the tenth day of February next, at which day our purpose is, God
willing, to hold the same; And do hereby give notice to all whom it
concerns, that they may frame their affairs accordingly, and attend at the
said tenth day of February to that service.

Given at our Honor of Hampton Court the last day of September, in the fifth
year of our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. ANNO DOM. 1607.
