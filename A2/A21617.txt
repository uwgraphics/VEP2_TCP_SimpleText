By the Queen.
THE Queen's Majesty understanding, that where of late the piece of gold
called the Pistolet, was made current at five shyllynges and ten pence, and not
above: Since that time, diverse of her Subjects of ignorance have and be daily
much deceived, taking and receauyng certain other pieces of strange Coins in
stead of Pistolettes for five shyllynges and ten pence, which in deed were
never taken ne used for Pistolettes, nor do hold in value so much as the very
Pistolettes do, whereby all persons receauyng the same in that value, are
deceived, and sustain evident loss: Does therefore by this Proclamation
notify to all manner of persons, that by the name or value of Pistolettes, none
shall be current within her dominions, but only four several pieces and coins
hereafter pourtracted and stamped. That is to say: The first and second being
of the king of Spaynes coin, the third of Venize, and the fourth of Florence.
Which several pieces of gold, being not counterfaicted, her Majesty does
only allow to be current as Pistolettes, and at the value of five shyllynges
and ten pence, and not above.

And for that many persons have received of late time diverse other strange
coins upon ignorance as Pistolettes: Her Majesty is pleased to give to every
person that shall bring any of the same into her myntes at London, the just
value that the same shall hold in gold.

Anno. 1560. 2. Nouembris. The second year of her Majesty's reign. God save
the Queen.
