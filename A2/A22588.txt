By the King.
A Proclamation to restrain the Kings Subjects from departing out of the
Realm without license.
WHereas it is one of the principal duties of all Our Subjects, to attend at
all times the service and defense of their King and native Country, either
within the Realm, or without, when they shall be thereunto required: And
foreseeing in Our Princely providence what danger might ensue to this State, if
Our Subjects might at their pleasure pass and depart out of this Realm, into
the Kingdoms, Countries, and Dominions of foreign Kings or States: For
prevention whereof, We have thought fit to publish Our Royal will and
commandment in that behalf; And do therefore hereby, straightly prohibit and
forbid all Our Subjects of this Our Realm, or of any of the Dominions of the
same, of what estate or degree soever they be, that they or any of them (other
then Soldiers, Mariners, Merchants, and their Factors, and Apprentices) shall
not at any time hereafter, without the special license of Us, or of six, or
more of Our Privy Council, under their hands (whereof one of Our principal
Secretaries to be one) pass or depart out of this Our Realm of England, or
any of the Dominions thereof, into the Kingdoms, Countries, Territories, or
Dominions of any foreign King, Prince, State, or Potentate, upon such
corporal, and other great and heavy pains and penalties, as by the Laws or
Statures of this Realm may be inflicted upon them. And We do hereby also
require and command all Our Officers and Ministers in Our several Ports of
this Realm; that hereafter they suffer none of our said Subjects to pass
without such license; And that no Owners, Masters, or Mariners of any ships or
vessels, do from henceforth carry, or transport beyond the Seas, any person or
persons whatsoever, without such license so obtained from Us, or such six, or
more of Our Privy Council; and the same first showed, and duly entered with
the Officer of the Port, from whence such person is to pass, upon pain of Our
high displeasure, and such forfeitures, and loss of Office, ship or vessel,
and other penalties, as by the Laws and Statues of this Our Realm are
ordained and provided in that behalf. Provided always, that if any such
Soldiers, Mariners, Merchants, or their Factors and Apprentices, as are herein
excepted and permitted to pass without license, do after their departure out
of this Realm, commit, attempt, or assent to any act, device, plot, or thing
against Us, or any Our Kingdoms or Dominions, or against any of Our Laws or
Statutes: That every such person so offending, shall lose the benefit of the
said exception, and shall to all intents and purposes be taken and adjudged to
be, as one that maliciously and contemptuously passes or departs out of this
Realm contrary to the tenor and effect of these presents.

Given at Our Court at Oatelands the one and twentieth day of July in the
eleventh year of Our Reign.
