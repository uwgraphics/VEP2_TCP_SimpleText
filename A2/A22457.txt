A Proclamation to prevent the Purloyning and Stealing of Arms, Powder, and
other Munition, and Habilliments of War.
THe Kings most Excellent MAJESTY being informed, that great quantities of
Armor, Munition, Shot, Powder, and other Habilliments of War, have heretofore
been, and are still daily purloined, stolen, imbezelled, and conveyed away by
the Soldiers, and Mariners of his Majesty's Army and Fleet, now returned from
the late expedition, to the great loss of His Majesty, and the infinite
prejudice of His Royal service: And His Majesty having taken this notorious
abuse into mature consideration, and being fully resolved severely to punish
all such Soldiers, Mariners, and other person and persons, who shall offend
herein, Has therefore though fit, with the Advice of his Privy Counsel, for
repressing and preventing the like attempts hereafter, to publish and declare
His Royal Commandment concerning the same; And hereby does strictly
prohibit, charge and command, all and every Soldiers, Mariners, and all other
persons whatsoever, that they, nor any of them do presume, attempt, or go
about to Steal, Purloyne, Imbezell, Sell, Buy or Receive any such Arms,
Munition, Shot, Powder, or Habilliments of War, upon pain of such severe and
condigue punishment for their offenses, as by the Laws and Statutes of this
Realm, or by His Majesty's Prerogative Royal, can or may be inflicted upon
the persons offending, either in the Stealing, Purloyning, Selling, or
otherwise in the Buying, Receiving or Concealing of the same. And because His
Majesty has bin also informed, that many such Arms, Munition, Shot, Powder,
and other Habilliments of War, have, since the arrival of his Majesty's
Fleet, been Purloyned and Sold in the Parts near about Plimmouth, His
Majesty does hereby strictly charge and command all person and persons
whatsoever, of what estate, condition or degree soever they be, to whom any
the said Arms, Munition, Shot, Powder, or other Habilliments of War have
been Sold, or in whose Custody the same or any of them are, that they and
every of them do forthwith bring, and deliver, or cause to be brought and
delivered the same, to the Mayor of the said Town of Plimmouth, or to the
Majors, Bayliffes, Constables, or thief Magistrate or Officer of the Towns,
Villages, or other places more remote from thence, to be by him or them safely
kept for His Majesty's use, and to certify the same to the Office of the
Ordnance, that upon notice thereof, the same may be disposed of for His
Majesty's Service; and this to be observed by all and every person and
persons, whom it may any ways concern, upon pain of being proceeded against
by the strictest course of Law which this fact shall deserve, for an example to
others to avoid the like offenses. And for the better execution of His
Majesty's honorable, just and necessary Commands herein, His Majesty strictly
charge and commands all Majors, Sherifs, Justices of Peace, Bayliffes,
Headboroughs, and other Officers, and all other His Majesty's good and loving
Subjects, to take care to prevent and repress all such offenses, as aforesaid,
and to give their assistance in the due execution of His Majesty's Command,
concerning the premises, as they tender their duty and Allegiance to His
Majesty, and will answer the contrary at their utmost perils.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the eighth day of December, in the third
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
