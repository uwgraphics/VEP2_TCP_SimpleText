By the King.
WHereas, sithence the late assembly in Parliament, We did for the raising of
necessary Sums of Money, to be employed in the defense of the Realm, direct
Our several Letters, and also sent sundry Privy Seals into diverse parts of
this Kingdom, of which We had cause to expect a better Return then has
followed, which notwith standing We impute not to any disaffection in Our
people, but to some miscarriage in that business, and the auersenesse of some
not so well affected: And now, for that Our intention is, not to trouble Our
Subjects many ways at once, whatsoever the present necessity of the common
defense requires; Our will and pleasure therefore is, and We do by this Our
Royal Proclamation signify and declare, that such Our Letters which required
the free gift of Our Subjects, and also the Printe Seals issued sithence the
last Parliament, shall be from hence forth remitted and discharged, without any
further demand, or payment to be had or made thereupon. And for such Our
loving Subjects, who have already given any money upon the said Letters, or
lent Us Money upon the said Privy Seals, issued since the last Parliament,
We have given order how the same shall be repayed unto them without delay.

Given at Our Honor of Hampton Court, the 22, day of September, in the second
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. God save the King.

Exellent Majesty. M.DC.XXVI.
