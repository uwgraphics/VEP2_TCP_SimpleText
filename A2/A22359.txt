By the King. A Proclamation for the maintenance and increase of the Mines of
Saltpeter, and the true making of Gunpowder, and reforming abuses concerning
the same.

own Royal Navy, and the shipping of His loving Subjects, as otherwise for the
strength, safety, and defense of His people and Kingdoms, and how great a
blessing it is of Almighty God to this Realm, That it naturally yields
sufficient Mines of Saltpeter for making of Gunpowder, for defense of it self,
without any necessity to depend upon the dangerous, chargeable, and casual
supply thereof from foreign parts; Has, (with the advice of His Privy
Council) concluded and set down certain Orders and Constitutions, to be from
henceforth inuiolably kept and observed, for the better maintaining of the
breed and increase of Saltpeter, and the true making of Gunpowder, and for

Saltpeter may be hindered or impaired, But shall suffer the floor or ground
thereof to lie open, with good and mellow earth, apt to breed increase of the
said Mine and Saltpeter, and so continue and keep the same. 2. That no
