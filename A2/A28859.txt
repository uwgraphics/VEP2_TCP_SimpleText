Note that these rules alone brings you to write any manner of discourse without
any more help and for the Simbolicall Characters you need not fear to get them
by heart; for do but write them and you have them; For I Affirm) they are so
far from burdening, that they teach the art of Memory more exact than the
Egyption Hyerogliphicks -- Note that your times of learning be first in morning
and the last work at night by which you will retain it fresh in your Memory
and that you learn but a little at one time and that perfectly never more than
one hour at a time to write, for when you take itt by little and little it
comes easily; learn to make fine Penns and small Characters you must write
constantly by rule never mix long hand with Short, but if at first you cannot
write all be shure you write Sentences and read them soon after you have writ
them; let your book be but 2 inches

The next thing and that wherein the curiosity of this Art consists in above
others, are the rules of Contractions, which lie to your Veiw, and you must
learn their places as you did the places of the Vowells the first Rule is
expressed by one tittle the second rule by two, the third rule by three tittles
the fourth rule by one tittle under another and the fifth is to express the word
(...) more by Ading a tittle more either to the 3d or 4th rules, as for Axample
to write to come to god your mark for god is thus (y) set a tittle on the left
hand thus (y) to depart from Christ (x) to dpart from the Nation (n)

1 The Rules of Contraction to write a Sentence as soon as a word
1 To come to To go or depart from 2 Men or sonns Saints Women or daughters
Servants children people 3 Laws Wajes love () works power Worship fear
Wisdom 4 Doctrine caled forenoug^ () Backslid Joined Beauty 5 More of the love

Examples for the second rule the people of god () a child of the devils (x.)
Examples for the 3 Rules the wisdom of god () Examples for the 4 Rules the
beauty of Christ () Examples for the 5th Rule more of the love of god (y....)
and Know that the tittles express that word in which place you put them some
Examples for the 12 Alphabeticall Rules which must begot by heart by which you
may express Thousands of sentences by placing the letters about the chief
substantive (as thus if you would write the humility of Christ your mark for
Christ is (x) then put your (h) under it in the place of humility thus () and
so of all the rest of the Alphabet in like manner: by which you may write 20
Thousand sentences more ye 7 and ye 8 arckes shows you to express the Negative
in any sentence.

5 A little under the Substantive-Signifyes to -- Understand
To Understand the love of God To Understand the Mercy of God To Understand the
laws of ye lord To Understand the power of faith A tittle over ye Adjective
Signifyes to lay hold on To lay hold on the Mercy of God To lay hold on the
love of God through Christ 6 A little underneath the Adjective is to undervalid
To Vndervalu the love of god To Vndervalu the mercy of god To Vndervalu the
fear of god To Vndervalu the people of god To Vndervalu the Children of god To
Vndervalu the laws of the lord 7 if the sentence begins with this you must
turn the Tittles on one side this
This is not the worship of god This is not the wisdom of god These are not
the people of god This is not to run to god These are not the men of the world
This is not the happiness of a Child of god 8 I Turned on one side signifyes god
will not give
God will not give his son God will not give his love God will not give his
mercy God will not give his spirit God will not give repentance God will not
give grace God will not give glory

Note these eight arches needs little more direction then what you find writ in
them (1) note if you put (o) in come to place) then he come to any thing, or if
itt be put on the other side then he departs from any Substantive (2) shows
(1) and (o) to be placed by the 2 Rule of contraction in the room of the
tittles (3) shows () and (q) to be used in the place of the tittles for the
words they stand for in the 3 Rule of contraction (4) shows your character for
(these) by making a little dash more to it is used for both yr 3d rule and as
it is for ye 2d(5) shows a double contracon by 2 letters of ye alphabeth (6)
shows a tittle between 2 substantives expreseth from (7) and (8) shows
themselves

1 how to Contract about the first rule
he comes to god then come to god then they that com to god they that depart
from god all that depart from god the congregation of Saints that com to god
when a man departs from god a soul that comes to lay hold on the mercyes of
God 2 your (8) and () must be placed about the 2 rule
To be the people of god to be the Servants of god to be the Children of god to
be the sants of god to be a daughter of god he his an eminent servant of god he
his an eminent Saint of god he is an eminent child of god 3 your mark for order
and question must be placed about ye 3d rule
in order to the worship of god in order to the wisdom of god in order to the
fear of god in order to the laws of god to question the fear of god to
question the worship of god to question the wajes of god to question the laws
of god to put in question the love of god 4 your mark for these is placed
about the 2d and 3d rules
These are the people of god this is the wisdom of god these are the saints
of god these are the wajes of god these are the children of god this is the
fear of the lord these are the daughters of god this is the worship of god
this is the love of god

Remember these Rules (begin with your alphabet and be very perfect in one
before you take another; let your lessons be little at a time and always make
a small character and that you may readely read what you write, beshure you
read itt as soon as you have written til you are well grounded in it, always
observe to make the letter which begins the word bigger then the other letter
which ends the word; (example) to write (fill) by this you know which is the
comanding letter and it will make you write it Carefully and read it plainly:
beshure you offer not to take aspeech or sermon till you have very well used
your hand to write out of books and never write long hand with ye short go slow
and go shure

joined to the servants of god to be joined in love to those that are not the

is to embrace
To embrace the people of god to embrace god to embrace the love of the son of
god to embrace the cross of Christ to embrace the cross of the world to embrace
those that are not the peopl of the world

Note that (5) shows the use of (d) and (5) shows if () be made large under
the subst^^tiue it denotes an admiracon, and in (5) you are to take notice that
all persons are included in the second rule, as People, Servants, Saints, Men,
or Sonns, Women or Daughters, or Children; and a single person is Expressed by a
single tittle, as Servant, Saint, Son, Daughter, Child. If therefore a person
or persons be plased by the chief substantive, while (d) is set on the right
