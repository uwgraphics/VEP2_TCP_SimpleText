By the Queen.
A Proclamation for the restreining and punishment of Forestallers, Regraters
and Ingrossers of Corn and Grain, and for the prohibition of making of any
manner of Search, within her Majesty's Realm and Dominions.
THe Queens most excellent Majesty calling to her princely mind the hie
prices and dearth of Corn, which for these late years have been, and may
again without good order increase, to the great impouerishment of her
Majesty's most loving Subjects, if some remedy for the preventing thereof be
not therein speedily taken: And her most excellent Majesty like a most
careful and gracious Princess, looking into the causes of the high prices and
dearth, and finding the same for the most part not so much to grow by the
means of the unseasonableness and unfruitfulness of these years (wherein
God be thanked this land has hitherto been blessed with plenty, as much as any
other Country of the world besides) but rather through the wicked and
insatiable greediness of sundry bad disposed persons, who preferring their
own private gain above the public good) do not only forestall, regrate,
and ingrosse all manner of Grain, and so raise high prices thereby, to the
great oppression of the poorer sort, but also do waste and consume an infinite
quantity of corn for the making of Starch, as well in all Cities, Towns, and
other places thorowout the Realm, as like wise even in private houses, not
only for their own uses, but to sell and make gain thereof besides: Which
uncharitable and unchristian waste is such and so great, as it would suffice to
feed a number of people that are like to perish by the increase of dearth that
is enforced thereby: For redress of all which growing and increasing
inconveniences, her Majesty by advice of her Highness privy council, did
about three years past publish a book of Orders in print, entitled, A new
charge given by the Queens commandment, etc. By which Orders, if the same had
been well observed, not only the unmerciful covetousness of Forestallers,
Regraters, Ingrossers, Maulsters, and such like greedy Cormorants, but also
the excessive and needless waste and expense of Corn in making the said
stuff called Starch, and in feeding of Dogs with Corn or Grain meet for
the sustenance of man had been repressed and prevented, as by the said Book
amongst diverse other godly and politic orders more at large appears: Her
Majesty therefore might for the manifest breach of the said Orders in great
contempt of her Princely and Royal commandment so published, as aforesaid,
for the common good of her loving Subjects (and specially of the poorer sort,
whose case her Highness does most graciously tender and pity) not only punish
the offenders therein, and specially such as so contemptuously and
unchristianly either have fed Dogs, or made Starch or such like vain
matter of or with Corn or Grain meet for the sustenance of her poor
Subjects, but also by their punishment might have reaped great fines and sums
of money for their offense and contempt in that behalf. Notwithstanding, her
Majesty, so long as there remains any hope of amendment, being most
inclinable to mercy, has of her abundant grace and pity thought it fit by her
Highness Proclamation, eftsoons to prohibit the inconveniences and disorders
abouesayd, signifying withal her Majesty's express will and pleasure, that if
all and every the said offenders shall not from henceforth desist from their
said contempts and disorders, that then her Majesty will severely chastise and
punish such of them hereafter offending, as well by fines as by corporal
punishment, as the quality of such and so high offenses shall deserve, and not
only for the time to come, but also for all the time past. And therefore her
Market, and all other Officers within their several rules, limits and
authorities, with all care and diligence to look to the due and straight
execution of all Laws, Statutes and Proclamations made, and now in force,
against Forestallers, Ingrossers, and Regraters, and against every of them, and
to see such Orders duly observed, as have been devised and set forth by her
Majesty's Privy Council, by her Highness commandment, for the serving of the
Markets, and avoiding of such forestalling, regrating and other vices tending
to raise the prices of Corn, and to see the offenders in that behalf
chastised with all severe punishment: And her Majesty does likewise straightly
charge and command that no person or persons within this her Highness Realm and
other her Dominions whatsoever, whether he be Stranger, Denizen, or subject
borne, shall from the xx. day of September next coming, employ, waste, or
expend upon feeding of Dogs, any Corn or Grain meet for the sustenance of
man, nor shall by any means directly or indirectly make or cause to be made
within this Realm or any other her Majesty's Dominions any manner of Starch of
Corn or grain for any use whatsoever, nor of any other matter or thing
whatsoever, to the end to sell or utter the same in gross or by retaile. And
her Highness does by virtue hereof likewise authorize and straightly charge and
command al Justices of Peace, Majors, Shirifs, Bailifs, Constables,
Headboroughs, and all other officers whatsoever, to whom it may in any wise
apperteine, from time to time at convenient times, and in lawful and due manner
to make diligent search in all places, where they shall have any just cause of
suspicion to find any such person or persons, as shall offend contrary to the
true meaning of this her Majesty's Proclamation, or any thing therein
contained, that due execution may be had against every such offender
accordingly, upon pain of her Majesty's displeasure, and as they will answer
to the contrary at their uttermost perils.

Given at her Majesty's Manor of Greenwich the xxiii. day of August 1598, in
the xl. year of her Majesty's reign.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty. 1598.
