A Proclamation declaring His Majesty's further pleasure for matter of
Buildings.
WHereas in the second year of Our Reign of great Britain, for diverse
reasons of State, and the general good and safety of this Our Commonwealth,
We did cause Our Proclamation to be published for restraint of new Buildings,
and for reedifying old Houses with brick, or brick and stone, within Our City
of London and two miles of the Gates thereof, which has been seconded by
diverse other Our Proclamations made and published, as well in the fifth and
sixte, as in the ninth and sixteenth years of Our Reign: all which, many
persons out of a private respect of their own gain, without regard of Our
Commandments, or the general and common good so often mentioned in the said
Proclamations, have taken the boldness to violate; so as contrary to Our
disposition, We have been enforced (for prevention of the growing evil) to
cause due proceedings to be held against some of the offenders against Our
Proclamation in Our High Court of Star Chamber, where order has been given
for demolishing the houses of diverse offenders in that kind, and of others who
have built upon new foundations; wherein We finding the number of offenders to
be so many, as if We should have proceeded against all of them in such
exemplary form of Justice, We should have caused great deuastation in Our
City of London and the places adjacent thereunto, Nevertheless the offenses
being alike, it could not stand with the rule of Our Justice to make some
examples of Our displeasure and let others pass with impunitie: We were
therefore graciously pleased to grant a commission lately to certain persons
of trust; giving them power to call before them such as had offended against
Our said Proclamations, and for Us and on Our behalf to compound with them for
their offenses, thereby to deter them and others for aduenturing the like in
time to come.

And whereas some Mechanical persons inhabiting in or about Our City of
London, who to work their own ends in point of profit, have been the
principal occasion of so great deformity in Buildings, by reason of so many
base Tenements and Cottages of late years erected within the Suburbs of Our
said City, which We are pleased to make Our Chamber, and whereunto so many
States and Nations have recourse by their daily repair unto Us: so the same
persons, or others of worse condition, finding themselves checked or restrained
by the directions given in Our last Proclamation for the building with brick,
do endeavor to possess by kind of infection spread into the minds of many Our
good and well disposed Subjects, that the end of such Our Royal commandment
should be extended to some pecuniary dispensation, or wholly to be released
upon suits to be made unto Us: We minding nothing* less, have thought fit to
declare Our selves and Our further pleasure herein, that We are so far from
giving any toleration or release in that kind, as we are resolved, as well out
of many reasons of State conducing to Our honor, and the honor of Our
Posterity, as for the public preservation of Our People from the danger of
fire, constantly to uphold and continue Our late prescript for Building with
brick or stone, and not otherwise, nor in any other form or manner then in
this present Proclamation is prescribed; which the better to manifest Our full
and absolute pleasure therein, we have caused to be again renewed and
remembered to Our People whom it may concern.

And We having been lately moved by some of Our Commissioners employed in
this Our service, for some further grace and favor to be extended to such of
Our Subjects as now are, or shall be willing to conform themselves, and to
reedifie their dwelling houses with Brick or Stone, and to wayue and avoid
that noisome pester of Bulkes, Stalls, Shedds, Cants, and Iuttyes, wherewith
Our Streets are in all places so much cumbred and annoied, that it takes away
the benefit of air, sweetness, and decency of the same; And that We would be
pleased to enlarge their authority for the setting forth of the foundation or
ground of every one that shall so conform in such sort, as may best beautify
the Street where such buildings are, and may encourage those that will new
build their houses, and hold uniformity through the whole Range of such Street
or Streets where such buildings are: whereunto We graciously inclyning, have
by Our Commission under Our great Seal of England, given them such power and
authority in that behalf, as shall seem good to their wisdoms and
discretions, and as may agree with the conueniencie and decency of the place,
and the wideness of the Street where such building or reedifying shall be.

Lastly, to the end that from henceforth no more or further toleration or
conniuencie be used toward them that shall contemptuously oppose Our royal
commandment in Buildings, or shall seek by devises and shifts to avoid the
direction thereof, only by making new the lower Story of any dwelling house
of Timber, or by leaving the lower Story standing, do new build the upper
part of their houses with Timber, or do enlarge any part of their houses
toward the street with Iuttyes, or Cant Windows, or otherwise: We hereby
command Our Attorney general, that he from time to time upon certificate of
such or any other case of offense in Building, contrary to Our said
Proclamations to be made from Our said Commissioners, or any four or more of
them, under their hands in writing, do proceed for Us, and in Our name against
such offenders and every of them, as well by way of Bill or information to be
exhibited into Our high Court of Star Chamber, as otherwise upon the
examination and confession of the said offenders or any of them, taken before
Our said Attorney, according to the course and Presidents of Our said Court in
like cases.

And We further will and command the Lord Mayor of the City of London, and
the Aldermen, and Recorder of the said City, for the time being, and also all
and every Our Justices of Peace, Bayliffes, Constables, Headboroughs, and all
other Our Officers, and loving Subjects, as well within Liberties as without,
within Our Counties of Middlesex, and Surrey, to be ayding, and assisting to
Our said Commissioners, and every of them, in the due execution of Our
pleasure herein, as they, and every of them will be accomptable for the same
when We shall require it. And to the end that Our Subjects, within the places
and limits aforesaid, may be the better forewarned and taught to perform
their obedience in the premises, which We straightly will and require at their
hands:

Our express will and pleasure is, That in erecting of new Buildings
hereafter, every whole Story of and in such houses, and Buildings, and all and
every the rooms of such whole Story, shall be of the height of ten foot of
assize at the least, and every half Story of and in such houses, and
Buildings, shall be of the height of seven foot, and a half at the least;
and that the forefront and outward Walls, and the Iambes, Heads, and Soyles of
the Windows shall be of Brick, or of Brick and Stone, and the Windows
(being of Timber) not to be put in until the Iambes and heads aforesaid be
finished and bear of themselves.

And if the said Buildings do not exceed two Stories in height, then the
Walls thereof shall be of the thickenes of one Brick, and half a Brickes
length, from the ground unto the uppermost part of the said Walls: And where
the Building shall be of the height of two Stories, the Walls of the first
Story shall be of the thickenes of two Brickes length, and from thence unto the
uppermost part of the Wall, of the thickenes of one Brick and half a Brickes
length.

And that in Building of the said houses, there shall be no Iutties or
Iutting, or Cant-windowes, either upon Timber Ioystes, or otherwise, but the
Walls to go direct and straight upwards, and at the setting off, a water
Table to be made; Also the lights of the Windows of every whole Story, to be
of more height then breadth, to the end the rooms may receive air for health,
and that there may be a sufficient peer of Brick, between the windows for
strength; And likewise the windows of every half Story to be made square
every way, or near thereabouts.

And lastly, that all Shops in every Principal Street of Trade, be made with
Pillasters of hard Stone, or Brick, and the heads of the Shop windows cut in
wedges Archwise, to sustain the Wall about it, and for ornament of the
Streets.

Given at Newmarket, the twelfth day of March, in the sixteenth year of our
Reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the two and fiftieth.
God save the King.
