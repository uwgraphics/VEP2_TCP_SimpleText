Late Protestant's Reconciliation TO THE Catholic Church. TOGETHER With a brief
Account of Augustine the Monk, and Conversion of the English. In a Letter to a
Friend.

LONDON, Printed by J. H. for Brabazon Aylmer, at the Three Pigeons over
against the Royal Exchange, in Cornhill. 1687.

AN ANSWER To a BOOK, Entitled, Reason and Authority, etc.
SIR,
I Have just now read over a late Book, entitled, Reason and Authority; I read
it with an excess of pleasure, being surprised and amazed to find Reason so
baffled, and a monstrous Authority advanced against all reason. Nonsense, I
perceive, is in fashion; and if I and You have as little sense, and are as
impertinent as others, I may be a Writer, and You a Reader.

I perceive by that Book, P. 2, and 3.
that a certain Man has left our Church without reason: He was advised to take
reason, and make the best use of it in the choice of his Religion, and the
settling of his life and practice in order to salvation; but he could find no
reason to serve him. P. 4, and 5.
He narrowly escaped being an Atheist with reason, and had almost denied the
Being of a God, or at least his Providence, with reason; and something that
looked like to a demonstration against the immortality of the Soul had so
confounded him, that he was up head and ears in the water all soused, and
plunged in the doubt, and whether he is yet out of it, we know not.

The Man goes on and considers the grounds of Religion, the Jewish and the
Christian; and finds little reason to think that the five Books commonly
ascribed to Moses, P. 5.
were ever written by him; he finds so many mistakes, and so many errors in
the beginning of Genesis, that he gives you to guess his meaning, though he
will not speak it, to be, that the Jewish Religion is little else than a
forgery, and that it has but small evidence of a Revelation from God Almighty.

Thus leaving the Jewish Religion, the Man in all haste goes to the Christian,
P. 6.
and considers the New Testament, as the Book which all Christians in all Ages
have owned, to be the Records of the Christian Doctrine: He does not say by
whom they were written, but at the reading of the first Chapter of St. Matthew
he was hair'd out of his wits; He met with such difficulties, that his reason
could not answer, if he brought any with him to the reading of it; for it is to
be suspected that he used none, because a little reason in such a case as this,
would at this time have lead him to have consulted his Authority. For if he,
whom this Man calls God's Vicegerent, and the great Elias, that is supposed to
solve all doubts, can say no more to this difficulty, than he himself could, he
might have kept his Reason still, as bad as it was, and have been content to be
ignorant with Reason, as well as under Authority.

But, Dear Friend, look about you now; Thus far our Author, booted, and
spurred, and whipping on, has gone without reason: just now reason comes in a
most unlucky time, I think for no other purpose but to fool the Man, and set
him to combat with an Adversary that will certainly be too strong for him; for
instead of fighting us, he now attacks Christianity it self, and does all the
mischief he can to that Common Faith, which he and we profess: To this end he
revives old Controversies, and starts new ones, and makes Schemes of Christian
Doctrine, and that to show to the World that Christianity has as weak a
Foundation as the Jewish Religion was declared before to have.

To this end, I suppose, he tells us the three next things. 1. P. 7.
That some of the Orthodox did not receive into the Canon of the Scripture,
some of the Books that are now in it, P. 7.
for near 200 years after the death of our Savior. 2. That every Christian is
not able, by reading of the Scripture, to compose such a Creed as that of
Athanasius. 3. P. 7.
That there are some obscure Doctrines hard to be understood amongst
Christians; and here he sets down the Trinity, Consubstantiality,
Transubstantiation, Predestination, and Freewill every one of these are
altogether impertinent to this Man's purpose; they may be of some use to an
Atheist, and serve him that is resolved to give a secret wound to Christianity;
but they signify nothing to a Roman Catholic, or to him that would plead for
Authority to determine Controversies in Christianity in opposition to Reason.

For, first, All the Churches in the World are now agreed about the Books of
the New Testament; and when the Orthodox in ancient times concurred in the
acceptance of the Books that are now in the Canon, they came to this conclusion
merely by the reason of the case, without the least interposition of any
Authority of Pope, or Council: the last Book doubted of was the Revelations;
and the reasons for receiving of that, Eusebius. lib. 7. cap. 27.
any man may read in Eusebius, lib. 7. cap. 27. as he sets them down in the
words of Dionysius of Alexandria.

Now I cannot imagine to what purpose this Gentleman puts us in mind of this
old Controversy; if he has Authority for what he does, it may be something for
his own satisfaction; I am sure he has no reason to offer in the case that can
be allowed by any man else; for the Church of Rome is as zealous to preserve
every one of these Books in their esteem and reverence, as Ours is: I guess
that possibly he may be tempted to show his skill in Controversy, and
therefore he sets down with an appearance of accuracy, that such Books were not
received into the Canon by the Orthodox for near 200 years after the death of
our Savior. But here the Man's skill fails him; for it is certain that
Irenaeus quotes the Revelations in several places, Irenaeus, lib. 4. cap. 37.
as a Book of like Authority with the rest of the New Testament; and he himself
tells us, that he wrote in the time of Eleutherius; and Bellarmine sets him
down as a Writer in the Year 180. after our Savior's birth, and that will
lessen the time mentioned of 200. after his death by fifty.

This mistake is not worth the noting, if it did not give us to see how ready
some men are to lay aside not only Reason, but the Sacred Records of the
Christian Faith, not considering the true consequences of their own Action;
since it is most certain, that if a full Authority be not allowed to the Books
of the New Testament, there can be no pretense to any, either in Pope or
Council, or in any thing that is called Church.

But our Author goes on to a second thing, and proceeds with more than
ordinary caution, and seems as wise as a certain Spanish Don: P. 7.
he treads out the ground, measures the length of his Weapon, makes a Speech,
and would tempt a man to think he is resolved to fight; but he withdraws
safely, and calls in two others to engage; a desire he has to see the Holy
Scriptures and Athanasius his Creed to combat one another for his
divertisement. Now which of these two he is for, he says not, nor yet seems to
guess which would have the better in case of a Contrast: But alas! this man
mistakes; those two are Friends; and if there were any difference between that
Creed and the Holy Scriptures, Athanasius (if he were now alive) would be the
first man to declare against that Creed: it is certain he learnt, and sounded
all his Doctrines upon those; no man read them with greater care and attention;
no man cites them oftener, or with greater veneration.

Whether our Author knew this or no, I cannot tell; but after all his
preparatory flourishes, he gives no more than this dry insipid request to the
Fathers of our Church, that they would not tell him that every Christian,
suppose every Baker, Shoemaker, or Cobbler, upon a sincere perusal of this Holy
Book, would certainly have composed the Creed of Athanasius. Now this is a
thing which never was spoken, either by Bishop, Presbyter, or Deacon, or Parish
Clerk. Can any Reverend Bishop be presumed to think, and say, that the great
Athanasius had not more wit and reason, more art, more skill in Consequences
than every Cobbler and Tinker, or than this Man's two Friends, Nailor and
Muggleton? it is prodigious to think how men dote, that undertake to write
Books against Reason.

But whatever this Man does, or can say, most certain it is, that if Athanasius
was the Composer of this Creed, he did it upon a sincere perusal of the Holy
Scriptures, by the power of a good Reason, and by the skill which he had in
Consequence. As for Authority of Pope or Council he had none for this
Composition; this Creed lay in obscurity, and was unknown in the Church long
after the days of Athanasius; and as it was composed at first, so it was
brought into the use of the Church afterward for some time without any
considerable Authority, morely by the private reason of some that were little
more than private Men.

Thirdly, In the next place our Author sets down some matters of Faith, great
and necessary Articles, P. 7.
as he calls them; and these are the Mystery of the Incarnation, the Doctrines
of the Trinity, Consubstantiality, Transubstantiation, Predestination and
Free Will. These he examined by his Reason, but he does not tell us what
account his Reason gave of them. It is possible after a sincere perusal of the
Holy Scriptures, that he might find great reason to believe the Incarnation of
our Lord, and the Doctrine of the Trinity, and by consequence that of
Consubstantiality, and something of a Predestination; and it is possible that
from thence he found no reason to believe the Doctrine of Transubstantiation,
for herein many other Men's Reasons would agree with His. This he does not tell
us, but yet this I will presume in favor to him; that he does not think that
the Fathers in the Council of Nice, and those in the after Councils, who fixed
the Doctrine of the Trinity and Consubstantiality; I say, he does not think,
but that they made their Determinations with highest reason; I will presume too
that he thinks that the Fathers in the Lateran and Tridentine Councils had
reason to determine the Doctrine of Transubstantiation; for though we think
that in these two later Councils, the generality acted by false reasons, by
prejudice, and by worldly interest; yet we do not doubt but they all, and every
one of them, pretended to act with reason; for certain it is, that the private
reason of any single man, is a much better guide than the private Spirit of a
Quaker, or any other: for a Reason may be urged, and is upon information to be
corrected, but the pretense to the Spirit is not. But if the majority of those
Fathers at the Council of Nice were able by Scripture and Reason to establish
those Doctrines of the Trinity and Consubstantiality to be Articles of the
Christian Faith; I know not why our Author, since he has the same Scripture
and like Reason, might not have done the same. Sure I am, that after this
Council, Athanasius pleaded much in the defense of the truth of these
Doctrines, and that not from the Authority of the Council, but from the true
sense and meaning of the several Texts; Sozom. lib. 7. cap. 12.
the same way of arguing was used in the first Constantinopolitan Council, and
so it continued, till Theodosius, by advice of Nectarius, which he received
from Sisinnius, took another method.

After these doughty performances, P. 8.
our Author comes in the next place a little more closely to Scripture, or the
sacred Records of Christian Religion; and sets his reason to search, and
examine them, and, if possible, to draw from thence a scheme of Christian
Doctrine. But here, it seems, his Reason was jaded, and tired out much more
than in all the rest of his Disquisitions; perhaps he found not there any thing
like to the Doctrines that make up the Apostles Creed: He does not tell this,
though he ought to have done it, if he had compared his scheme with it. But he
tells us that he disagreed from all Churches, the Church of England in her 39
Articles, P. 8.
and all the Catechisms of Catholics, Calvinists, Lutherans and Socinians: I
was pleased that in his opinion the Doctrine of the Church of Rome did no more
agree with Scripture than that of the Church of England.

But though I was pleased in this, yet I was not very confident of any
advantage from it, because our Author often queries, and seems to doubt, whether
his Reason does not much differ from other Men's. I know that God Almighty has
given different Talents to Men; for Heads, and Brains, and Wits, as well as
Hearts, are not alike in every Man. I am sure the Ancients, by virtue of plain
honest reason, were able to find the Christian Doctrine in the Holy Scriptures;
so did St. Irenaeus, St. Athanasius, St. Hierome, St. Chrysostom, St.
Augustine, and the rest. This was a light to their feet, and a lamp to their
paths, sufficient to satisfy those good men in matters of Faith; and as this
Man speaks, in the great and necessary Articles.

But though this Man could not find the Christian Doctrine there, yet it seems
that he thought that he found something there that pretty well agreed with the
dreams of Ebion and Cerinthus, and with those of his dear Friends, P. 8.
Nailor and Muggleton.

The first of these I am much inclined to believe; and if I were as impertinent
as He is, perhaps I might give some evidence of the second.

As for Ebion and Cerinthus this Gentleman is too close, and will not give us
the least intimation of their Dogm's, wherein his schemes did agree with
theirs; yet I think it very probable that he might light upon some of the same
thoughts with them, because I find a wonderful agreement between the Followers
of those two, and this Gentleman; For they had no reverence at all for
Scripture, and very small regard to Reason; sometimes they would throw away,
Ed. Erasmi Basil. 8vo. 1571.
and easily reject a great part of Scripture, Iren. lib. 3. cap. 11. and at
other times they would receive all; Iren. lib. 3. cap. 12 page 302. but upon
this condition, that they might interpret it; they made novel Inventions to be
great and necessary Articles of Faith; Id. lib. 3. cap. 11. p. 288. In tantum
processerunt audaciae, uti quod ab his non olim conscriptum est, veritatis
Evangelium titulent, in nihilo conveniens Apostolorum Evangeliis; they had a
profound veneration for Authority, and entirely submitted themselves to the
Doctrines of Ebion and Cerinthus; for they supposed that these men had a secret
or mystery derived down by Tradition to them, which alone was able to fix the
sense of Scriptures; and therefore whenever an Argument was directed against
them out of Scriptures, they still brought it to this Tradition: without this
they undervalued and slighted all the Scriptures, and were the Inventers of the
chiefest Arguments against them that our Author and his Friends at this day do
use. All this will appear, Irenaeus, lib. 3. cap. 2.
if we look upon Irenaeus, lib. 3. cap. 2. Cum ex Scripturis arguuntur, in
accusationem convertuntur ipsarum Scripturarum, quasi non recte habeant, neque
sunt ex Authoritate, and quia vary sunt dictae, and quia non possit ex his
inveniri veritas, ab his qui nesciunt Traditionem; non enim per literas
traditam illam, sed per vivam vocem: and then farther toward the latter end of
that Chapter, they challenge something, that speaks the great confidence they
had in their way, perhaps as much as the Infallibility of a Guide; se
indubitate, and incontaminate, and sincere absconditum scire Mysterium.

The proceedings of those men are so like to the method, of our Author, that I
do not in the least wonder, if he found in his Schemes something very agreeable
to their Doctrines. Some men's brains, for all what that learned Spaniard
teaches, may be exactly of the same temper, and consequently their wits of the
same height. I have heard of a fool, who by thinking the very same thoughts
with his Brother, could find him out, when all the wise men in the Town could
not do it.

Thus far therefore I will be obliging to our Author, and give him more credit,
than I will upon some other occasions: I will, though with some reluctance of
reason, believe that whilst he was reading the Scriptures, some thoughts might
come into his mind agreeable enough with some of those that Ebion and Cerinthus
had.

But after this high civility allowed him, I hope he will not impose upon my
Faith so far as to require me to believe that he found any thing in the Holy
Scriptures that agreed with the idle whimsies, and mad dreams and blasphemous
prate of his two other friends Nailor and Muggleton. This is such an impudence
as R. C's as well as Protestants must abhor; all Popes and Councils that have
ever been, with wrath and indignation would have detested any man that should
have dared to put so profane and vile a scandal upon those sacred writings.
What Anathema's would the Council of Trent have thundered out against Luther, if
ever he had wrote or spoken any thing so base as this? It is certain that there
is nothing in Scripture that can in the least seem to favor the blasphemies of
those two wretches; and I am unwilling to think that there was any thing in our
Author's schemes, that would deserve the punishment which they justly suffered.

It is possible that he might have been of their acquaintance, and have had
very particular respects for their persons, and so he might be over-easie to
think that some of his thoughts might be like unto theirs.

This I am willing to guess, because I can with confidence presume that he has
kept very ill Company, for though his natural temper carries him to speak soft
and smooth things, yet in spite of nature he is forced to be rude, and saucy.
For why cannot he write a Book without pointing his discourse at the breasts of
the Right Reverend Fathers of our Church; why does he treat them with contempt
and scorn? why does he presume to daule 'em, to twitch 'em by the Nose, and
pull 'em by the Beard, and stand over 'em with Fescue and Ferula; and tell 'em
that here they were out, and there they were out, and that here, and there, and
at every point he can instruct them? All this comes from want of manners and
good converse; Muggleton would have done the same, and so would Nailor, and
none but such as they.

For certainly a respect is due to them for their Character, and a respect is
due upon their Personal account; they are men of excellent worth, and great
learning, prudence, piety and integrity; and so conspicuously eminent in all
these, that our Author is not able to match them in any one Country, (though
he take as large a view of Bishops as he does of Conversions in his 14th. page)
through Europe, Asia, Africa and America.

But when Reason, and the Holy Scriptures are to be thrown down, it is no great
wonder, if the Bishops of the Church of England fall with them.

I begin to be warm, and you my Friend, may be offended at it; yet allow a
little to a just indignation; it may well move a man of a cold complexion to
see a pert unknown come up so briskly to the heads of our Reverend Fathers, and
Address to them in a formal speech, intimating thousands of mistakes,
miscarriages and errors in them; and yet in all that speech, the man says
nothing but what is old, and dull, and flat insipid stuff; all and every thing
in it has been answered five hundred times, since the Reformation, and at least
twenty within these two years. This looks like perverse stupidity, for men to
pretend to be writers, when they do not read; if our Author had read the late
Books, by this writing he gives plain proof, that his Reason serves as little
in drawing up Plea's for Authority, as it did before in making Schemes of
Christian Doctrine out of the Scriptures.

All that he says, is this, that he heartily wished that God would have pleased
to have left us some unerring Authority and Sovereign Guide, p. 6. and then,
that God has not left the World without Government, and given us Laws without
lawful Judges and Interpreters, p. 10. From thence he presumes that there is
such a thing, and resolves to go in quest after it; he comes to the Church of
England, and demands it there; they deny that they have any such Authority. Not
content with that, he puts himself to the trouble to prove it, p. 11. he goes
to the Church of Rome; they say, they have it, p. 12. and he presently believes
them; and after a few rubs removed out of his way, he reviews Bellarmine's
marks and signs of a true Catholic Church, and by them endeavors to show that
there is such an unerring Authority, and Sovereign Guide in the Church of Rome.

Now all this is nothing, but a plain begging of the Cause, or a discovery how
little he knows in this Controversy; for certain it is that the Church of
England, and all other Protestant Churches ever since the Reformation, have
demanded, and most earnestly required one plain positive proof, that ever God
Almighty, or our Blessed Lord did ever appoint any such Sovereign Guide, and
unerring Authority in the Church: But they could never receive any plausible
Answer to it; by all the ways whereby a Negative can be proved, they have
showed that there is no such order or appointment in it: Nay lately some
Writers have asserted with good reason, that such a thing is not agreeable to
the methods that God has used in the Government of the World, and that it would
not be of any considerable use to the advancement of piety, or any eminent
virtue amongst men; and that the pretense of it serves only to support an
unreasonable Usurpation over the Church of Christ. Great Volumes, and strong
Arguments remain unanswered; and yet at this time of the day, the dull and
stale old accounts of it, without any new ornaments or new force are sent
abroad without any ground or hope of victory, to vindicate the interests of it.

This deserves a sharper Censure than I will give, but yet I would have our
Author know, that a New Convert to his Old Friends the followers of Ebion and
Cerinthus, might have alleged in his behalf all that which our Author here
does, and that to as much purpose; he might have said that, he had wished that
God had left an unerring Authority in his Church; and that God had not left the
World without Government, and given us Laws without lawful Judges and
Interpreters; and that therefore he presumed that such an Authority was
somewhere to be sound. As for Irenaeus his Church and those in Communion with
it, they did not in the least pretend to it; but the followers of Ebion and
Cerinthus did fully and loudly challenge it; and therefore his Reverend
Fathers, Irenaeus and the rest of the Orthodox Bishops must have him excused;
for he will rather put himself under an unerring Authority, than trust to the
Guidance of Those, that confess themselves to be no more than fallible men.

But to let that pass, P. 13.
the next thing we find in our Author is Bellarmine's Notes of a true Church;
I suppose, he puts them down to increase the bulk of his Book: He could not but
know that they are of no Authority with us. And, Answers are given out to each
of them in their Order: He might have added strength and force to them whilst
they are so briskly attacked, but he has no pretense to build upon them, or
defend himself by them. But besides, he of all men living has the least right
to expect any advantage from them, because the chiefest of these Notes are
grounded on sayings of the Prophets; and he that has so far depreciated the
true value of the Five Books of Moses, p. 6. will hardly persuade another, that
he gives any great credit to the writings of the Prophets.

He there gives us an objection against the Pentateuch, P. 6.
from the supposed intermedlings of Esdras; but does not well reflect that he
derives that objection by several Medium's from the Samaritans, who were the
first, and are at this day the chiefest Adversaries, and greatest Calumniatours
of Esdras. Now these very men keep close to the Five Books of Moses, and for
this they offer some pretenses of reason; but our Author without any reason at
all would make advantage by the Prophets, and throw contempt upon Moses, and
all this, by virtue of the credit which he seems to give to the objections made
against Esdras by the Samaritans. But,

Most certainly in this he acts beyond his skill, and talks without book; for
be it what it will, Bellarmine's Notes are of no use to him, and can do him as
little service, as that formidable force of Pagans and Turks, and I know not
how many Nations, which he brings in to his assistance, p. 11. where he himself
says he has no Adversary. It is well for him, that that impertinency, and this
did not come together into his head at the same time; for if he had thought but
as much of the Pagan as he does of the Atheist, and Theist, perhaps his reason
might have been as favorable to them, as it was to those others, p. 4. and
then if Bellarmine's Notes had come into his way, who knows but that the man
might have turned Convert again, and wrote another Book of the motives for his
reconciliation to old Paganism? for methinks it is very probable, that our
Author might have found these amongst the Pagans: Universality and Visibility,
Uninterrupted continuance, and Succession, till the days of Constantine;
lastly, Unity and Uniformity: he might have seen there too that which they call
a High Priest and Holy Altar, and a Holy Sacrifice, Miracles, and Religious
Colleges, and Abstinence, P. 14.
and vowed chastity, and a great many Doctrines Authoritatively imposed, and
universally received throughout the World.

I will presume this Gentleman never read either Pausanias, or Zozimus, or the
Epistles of Symmachus; and it is happy for him that he did not. I will venture
the little skill that I have, that any impartial Reader shall find better
flourishes, sairer turns of the Pen, and more appearance of Argument in that
Speech which Symmachus makes to the Emperor Valentinian, Theodosius and
Arcadius in the Name of Rome Pagan, than our Author gives us here against the
Church of England to our Bishops; Now if these little thoughts governed him in
the change of one Religion, it is well for him, that he never engaged in the
consideration of the other.

But our Author has Bellarmine's Notes, and he will make something of them; by
virtue of them he says he sound what he was resolved to find before, the true
Catholic, or one Church, that may be said to be true, in opposition to all
others. Now upon this foundation he builds apace; P. 15.
1. That this being one Body, must have one Head upon Earth, and he after our
Savior's Death was St. Peter; and after St. Peter's, his Successors; and they
are the Bishops of Rome; and those are every one of them in their several times
not only Successors to St. Peter, P. 16.
but Christ's Vicegerents. This their Authority he says has been owned by
General Councils, and so by the Catholic Church; and they have been in
peaceable possession of it for many hundred of years; P. 16, 17.
and now they cannot be divested of it neither by themselves, nor by others;
neither in whole, nor in part.

All these things he sets down, I suppose, as his own opinations and
sentiments, and would have his Friends to judge him by them as Orthodox and a
true Convert. He is not concerned whether they be true or false; for he knows,
or may know, that every one of these pretenses has been proved by Dr. Barrow to
be gross falsities, and that almost to the evidence of Demonstration; and yet
our Author brings not the least proof for any one of them from any Old Author.

Indeed he tells us that we have the Succession of Bishops of Rome delivered to
us by St. Augustine, and that is true; P. 15.
but he was unlucky to put us in mind of that passage, and much more because he
never read it himself, for had he seen the 165. Epistle of St. Augustine where
that Succession is mentioned, and the very next to it; he might have found in
that great Father, a full contradiction to all his thoughts concerning the
Scriptures, and concerning Authority, and then perhaps he would have employed
his time to better purposes than in writing this Book.

St. Austine in that Epistle sets down the succession of the Bishops of Rome
from St. Peter, and that for no other purpose, but to show that none of all
those Bishops was a Donatist. Augustinus Epist. 165.
And that because a Donatist had set down the succession of their Bishops
before; not that he thought any one of them, after St. Peter, was a Sovereign
Guide, or had unerring authority in him, for he himself presently adds to this,
that if any of them had been a Donatist, or worse, yet the Christian Doctrine
would not have suffered the least by it. In illum ordinem Episcoporum qui
ducitur ab ipso Petro, usque ad Anastasium, qui nunc super eandem Cathedram
sedet, etiamsi quisquam traditor per illa tempora subrepsisset, nihil
praejudicaret Ecclesiae, and innocentibus Christianis. This I suppose our
Author is not willing to think, because he depends so much upon Authority, and
so little upon the Scriptures; but St. Augustine did, because he relied upon
the Scriptures, to teach us that Doctrine which Jesus Christ, and his Apostles
had revealed to the World; and therefore in the same Epistle he slights all his
other Arguments, and fixes entirely upon the Scriptures, as those alone which
could give us a full and solid evidence for the truth of a Christian Doctrine;
Augustinus Epist. 165.
these are his words. Quanquam nos, non tam de istis documentis praesumamus,
quam de Scripturis sanctis, and then he cites a Text. But in the next Epistle,
and that against the Donatists, after some other velitations, and general
topics, whereof Councils was one, as appears by those words, Faciant mill
concilia Episcopi, he comes to the holy Scriptures and triumphs in his
Arguments, and doubts not to defeat his adversaries by the force of them. He
begins with words frequent in his writings? Augustinus Epist. 166.
In Scripturis didicimus Christum, in Scripturis didicimus Ecclesiam, has
Scripturas communiter habemus, quare non in eis, and Christum, and Ecclesiam
communiter retinemus Then he throws out near twenty Texts one after another,
comments in short upon them, and never doubts, but that he and his Adversaries
did sufficiently understand them, without the assistance of a Sovereign Guide,
or an unerring Authority: if our Author had considered this, it might have
done him good; but because he is pleased to find the Succession of Roman
Bishops in St. Augustine, I will show him (what he seems not to know) two very
considerable uses, which that great Father made of that topic; the First was
to conciliate a most profound veneration to the Holy Scriptures; thus therefore
he writes, August. contra Faust. Manich. lib. 11. cap. 5.
contra Faustum Manichaeum, lib. 11. cap. 5. Distincta est a posteriorum
libris, excellentia canonicae Authoritatis veteris, and novi Testamenti, quae
Apostolorum confirmata temporibus, per successiones Episcoporum, and
propagationes Ecclesiarum, tanquam in sede quadam sublimiter constituta est,
cui serviat omnis fidelis and pius intellectus. A Second use that he made of
this consideration of the Succession of Bishops in their Sees, was (in case of
a dispute about a Text) to evidence what was the first, and so the true
Christian Doctrine. To this end he very frequently in his disputes with the
Donatists, requires them to search what was taught in the Churches of Corinth,
Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi, Thessalonica, all the Churches that had the honor
to receive Apostolical Epistles; Now if all these, having several Successions
of Bishops, should agree in any one point, that was controverted, St. Augustine
took their consent to be a good Argument, that such a Doctrine was original and
true; he sends them indeed to Rome too, but upon no other account, and no
higher reason, than he does to those other Apostolical Churches: Now I think I
may presume in kindness to our Author to give him one advice, and that is
this; to have a care when he refers to St. Augustine, that he knows his mind,
and that St. Augustine did write what he cites him for; for I can tell him,
that a certain person, who was of his opinion concerning a Sovereign Guide, and
unerring Authority to be sound in the Church of Rome, came at length to believe
(and that consequentially to his opinion) that the decretal Epistles of the
Popes, were of the same Authority with, and to be reckoned amongst the
Canonical Scriptures; and to confirm his opinion he cited St. Augustine for it,
and this his citation had got into Gratians Decretum; but the last
Roman-Correctours of Gratian found it to be either gross forgery, or a gross
mistake, and they have done St. Augustine right, and a favor to such Persons
as our Author is, to let them know, that St. Augustine is no great friend to
such fond and absurd opinions. You may see Gratiani Decreti prim. part. Distin.
19. Cap. 6. But because it may be some trouble to consult that Author, I will
give you the truth, and the forgery together. St. Augustine in his Book, De
Doctrina Christiana, lib. 2. cap. 8. had given us these words. In Canonicis
Scripturis Ecclesiarum Catholicarum quam plurium authoritatem sequatur, inter
quas sane illae sunt, quae Apostolicas seeds habere and Epistolas accipere,
meruerunt, etc. Now this was plain and good advice in the examination of Books,
that might be alleged to be Canonical Scriptures, to give a preference to the
testimony of those Churches that were called Apostolical Seats, and such as had
the honor to receive Epistles from the Apostles, as Rome, Corinth, Philippi,
etc. But now a transcriber of this, I suppose more knave than fool, changes the
words thus. In Canonicis Scripturis Ecclesiarum Catholicarum quamplurium
Divinarum Scripturarum solertissimus indagator autoritatem sequatur, inter quas
sane illae sint quas Apostolica seeds habere, and ab ea alii meruerunt accipere
Epistolas. This speaks quite a different thing, that the Epistles of the
Apostolical Seat are to be accounted Canonical Scriptures. This forgery or
mistake came abroad, I suppose, at the same time with the counterfeit ware of
Riculphus; and to this, with the false Epistles of the most early Bishops of
Rome, were put into Gratian; and there it remained as a great Authority in the
behalf of the Sacredness and Canonicalness of Papal Epistles, until the last
Correctours were pleased honestly to reject it, and prudently to tell the World
that they dare not own such follies or knaveries.

But farther, because our Author thinks to advantage himself of the Name of
St. Augustine, I will acquaint him that this Father had no very extraordinary
opinion of Rome, or the Bishops of it; when he was in quest of the true
Religion, he left Rome and went to Milan, and submitted himself to the guidance
of St. Ambrose, and received the true Christianity from him. He had all his
days the highest reverence for him, and would have yielded to his Authority,
when he would not have yielded to the Pope's: Augustinus Epist. 162.
He tells us that when Melchiades judged the cause of the Donatists, he was
joined with several other Bishops, in the same Commission by Constantine; Aug.
Epist. 163.
when he names those two great men, Julius Bishop of Rome, and Athanasius, as
orthodox Persons, and defenders of the right faith, he puts Athanasius in the
first place: It is he that gives those hard words, Quidam qui nomen habet
Falcidii, duce Stultitia, and Civitatis Romanae jactantia, Levitas
Sacerdotibus, August. quaesti mes ex utroque mixtim. p. 108. and 109. Edit.
Lugdun. An. 1561.
and Diaconos Presbyteris coaequare contendit, he tells us what it was that
raised his passion; the Deacons of Rome it seems would not yield to the
Presbyters of other places; upon that he says, Quia Romanae Ecclesiae ministri
sunt, idcirco honorabiliores putantur, quam apud caeteras Ecclesias, propter
magnificentiam urbis Romanae, quae caput esse videtur omnium civitatum: Si
itaque sic est, hoc debent, and Sacerdotibus suis vindicare. And a little after
he gives a fuller account of it, Vides quid pariat vana praesumptio, immemores
enim elatione mentis, eo quod videant Romanae Ecclesiae se esse ministros, non
considerant, quid illis a Deo decretum sit, and quid debeant custodire, sed
tollunt haec de memoria assiduae Stationes domesticae, and officialitas; quae
per suggestiones malas, seu bonas nunc plurimum potest; aut timentur enim ne
male suggerant, aut emuntur ut praestent.

But because this Book is accounted by several not to be St. Augustine's,
though sent abroad by the Monks, and published in his Name.

I will add farther that St. Augustine's thoughts of Rome, and the Bishops of
that See, were quite different from our Author's; for if he thought that the
Sovereign Guide, and the unerring Authority had been there; and that God
deposited those great supports and securities of the Christian Faith in the
Succession of the Roman Bishops; then in all likelihood when Rome was taken by
the Goths, he would have lamented and mourned, as a Jew formerly would have
done at the taking of Jerusalem, and the captivity of the High Priest.

But alas there was nothing like it, when this news was brought to St.
Augustine, all that he said of it was this, Ibi multos fratres non habuimus,
non adhuc habemus.

Indeed for this expression he seems to apologize in his next Sermon, but that
not as to the truth of his words, Sermon 29. de verbis Domini.
but as to the spirit of mind in which he spoke them; that it was not out of
any design to insult over the miseries of others. Besides, he that remembers
what labor he, and the rest of the African Bishops took, to get the
concurrence of the Bishops of Rome, Innocentius and Zosimus, to the
condemnation of the Pelagian Heresy, may well think, that St. Augustine could
have no great reverence for them; and if we read Erasmus his Censure upon
Innocent's Epistles which are printed with St. Augustine's, we may possibly be
tempted to entertain mean thoughts of the Bishop of so great a See.

These are Erasmus his words before the 96th. Ep. which is Innocents.
Innocentius superiori respondet suo more, saevus potius quam eruditus, and ad
damnandum quam docendum instructior. But I must leave this, and follow our
Author. He goes on p. the 18th. leaping and skipping from one thing to
another: He speaks first of Victor, what he did in casting out the Asiaticks,
and then what Gregory and others, whom he calls Christ's Vicegerents, did in
bringing in converts; and wonders that so many Proselytes should be made to so
little purpose. Then he fancies he had seen glorious and wonderful Privileges
in the Church of Rome; and knows not how they could be forfeited. After, he
falls to his wonted work of whipping our Bishops for telling him that new
Doctrines had been brought into the Church, which were not imposed upon the
faithful till the Council of Trent.

Now nothing of all this deserves an answer, because it has been so often
given before. But it may be expected by some.

As to Victor, he says he excommunicated the Bishops of Asia for keeping of
Easter, contrary to the Institutions of St. Peter and St. Paul, though
tolerated by St. John. Now this is fit to be said by a new Convert, who must
venture farther, than any man of skill dare do. For first the matter of fact is
doubted, and Valesius the last Editor of Eusebius, (who was all his days a
Roman Catholic, thinks that Victor went no farther, than to high words and
threatening. And then as to the right of the action, Eusebius. lib. 5 c. 24.
Irenaeus (who wrote to Victor himself about it) fully shows, that it would
have been unreasonable, and against all the methods of his Predecessors. But
then thirdly, the relation of our Author is altogether groundless, that St.
Peter and St. Paul did institute, and St. John only tolerate. For this is a
thing, that Polycrates the President of the Council of the Asiaticks never
knew, Victor himself never knew, Irenaeus never knew, Anicetus Bishop of Rome,
nor yet St. Polycarp, that contested this point with him, (who too was St.
John's own Disciple) never knew. Eusebius. lib. 5. c. 24. Certainly our Author
has some Pidgeon, that whispers to him Secrets and Mysteries, that no man
knows. I beg his leave a little to acquaint him with the sense of his friend
St. Augustine in a like case. The Romans challenged to have a command from St.
Peter for keeping the Saturday-Fast; and those of the Eastern Churches quite
contrarily asserted, that they were expressly forbidden, and that by St. John,
to fast upon that day. A Presbyter of the Church of Rome writes to his friend,
and most earnestly exhorts him, to do as they did, and pleads thus. Petrus
Apostolorum caput, coeli Janitor, and Ecclesiae fundamentum id ipsum Romanos
edocuit. Now St. Augustine being consulted in the case, slights all that
flaunting Plea of the Romans, allows the allegation of the Easterns to be as
good as those of the West; and concludes thus, that the Apostles St. Peter and
St. John did not vary. If they gave any rule, it was the same every where. And
seeing there is a present difference, it must be said, that either the Eastern
Church has varied from the rule of St. John; or else the Roman Church has
varied from the rule of St. Peter. Now which of these was the truth St.
Augustine knew not: He himself gives his sense in these words. Epistola 86
Casulano. Augustinus Ep. 86. Casulano.
After the Plea for Rome, E contrario refertur, occidentis potius aliqualoca,
in quibus Roma est, non servasse quod Apostoli tradiderunt: orientis vero
terras, unde coepit ipsum Evangelium ipsum praedicari, in eo quod ab omnibus
simul cum ipso Petro Apostolis traditum est, ne Sabbato jejunetur, sine aliqua
varietate mansisse. Upon this he concludes thus, interminabilis est ista
contentio, generans lites non finiens quaestiones.

Had this great Father known any thing of a Sovereign Guide, and unerring
Authority seated at Rome; he could never have doted so far, as to have made
this any matter of question. But he knew nothing of that, or of Peter
commanding, and John only tolerating, either in the one or the other case. And
I will presume for once, that he knew a great deal more than our Author does.

But the second skip our Author takes is to Conversions and here he says he
perceives, P. 18.
that according to the command, and institution of our Savior, his Vicegerent
did send out his Disciples. Here I want our Author's Spectacles, for I can
perceive nothing; I see no Vicegerent of our Blessed Lord: nor do I see any
command, that he ever gave to such a Person: nor do I know whether he means the
Disciples of the Vicegerent, or the Disciples of our Lord. It is certain our
Lord gave a command to the Apostles to teach all Nations; and they and their
Successors the Bishops, have acted according to that command. And if Gregory
Bishop of Rome, or any other have been industrious in that work, we heartily
thank and commend them.

But yet I wonder, that our Author has of a sudden, grown so extremely blind,
as not to see, that conversions may be made to what is bad, as well as to what
is good. Pagans and Mahometans have been industrious to make converts: So have
all Heretics, his friends Ebion and Cerinthus, Nailor and Muggleton. Nay this,
if he had not despised, and too long laid aside the Holy Scriptures, he might
have learned without the assistence of his unerring Authority from one saying
of our Blessed Lord, Math. 23.15. Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, etc.

After this gross piece of ignorance, P. 19.
which he is pleased to show to advantage, with flourishes of his pen,
comparing his reason with that of our Reverend Bishops; he may excuse me from
telling him how the great Privileges and Prerogatives of the Church of Rome
could be forfeited; until he has shown me in particular what they were, that
he insists upon. For until he has proved, that Rome did really enjoy such
Prerogatives, as he challenges on her behalf; I will not undertake to show,
when and how Rome forfeited that which Rome never had. Our Author may be a
Sophister, and how far he is beyond that himself best knows; and so he may
think no farther in this Paragraph, than the old trite Cavil, quod non
perdidisti habes. And his friends at Rome will con him but few thanks for that.

And now our Author begins to whip our Bishops, and woe be to them. He tells
them what he had been told, that there were some late Doctrines introduced into
the Church, and such as were not imposed upon the faithful, before the Council
of Trent. This he says he could answer by alleging, that the protesting
against those Doctrines was in the same time. But this he waves, and chooses
rather to show, that the Doctrines we oppose were established by Councils
before. And here he begins with

1. The Pope's Supremacy; P. 20.
which he says was confirmed in the Council of Chalcedon, (one of the first
four general Councils owned by Protestants) above 1200 years since, 630 Fathers
present. Quid dignum tanto feret hic promissor hiatu? As for my part I wonder,
who either licensed or allowed this Book to be printed. Will any man of skill
think to advance a Plea for the Pope's Supremacy from the Council of Chalcedon?
It is certain, that nothing was done there that might have any reference to
this Point, which was not disclaimed by the Legates of the Pope upon the place;
and afterward highly resented by Leo the I. who was then Pope. It is true that
Anatolius then Patriarch of Constantinople, carried on a design to advance his
Seat; and because he was Bishop of New Rome, would have the next place after
the Bishop of the Old; and so would have the Pre-eminence of the Patriarchs of
Alexandria and Antioch. Du Pin de antiaua Eccl. Discip p. 53.
In order to this, in the absence of the Pope's Legates, Anatolius and his
friends, got the 28 Canon of that Council to pass, which gives to the Patriarch
of Constantinople (...), that is, as a learned Roman Catholic comments, eadem
and aequalia privilegia tribuunt Episcopo novae Romae, ac veteris Romae
Episcopo. Now as soon as the Legates of the Pope had heard of this they declared
against it, and obtained another Session, wherein they might produce their Plea
against the validity of this Canon, both as to the form and matter. But their
objections were answered, and the Canon passed against their minds; though
Lucentius one of the Pope's Legates protested against it, and desired that his
Protestation might be entered into the Acts of the Council. And when Leo the
Great, who was then Pope, heard of this, he declared against it, and wrote
against it, with a great deal of vehemence and indignation, as any one may see,
who will consult these Epistles of his, the 56, 57, 58, 63, 66. And Leo could
never be brought to confirm that very Canon which our Author tells us did
confirm his Supremacy. Now in this case I will presume that Pope to be a better
guide, and to have more Authority than our Author. This is a blunder, and
shows us, that new Converts are not men of the greatest skill, and that some of
them have as little knowledge in Councils, as they have in the Scriptures. This
man deserves a greater lash than I will give him, for bringing in his Story
with that pomp and appearance of skill, telling us that this Council is owned
by Protestants, the time of its celebration, the number of Bishops who were in
it. And now at last it appears, that whatever we Protestants do, yet the Pope
himself will not allow what this man challenges in his behalf.

But perhaps his case is piteous. For more may be required of new Converts,
than they are able to perform. He that takes up a Religion by submitting to
Authority without reason; may easily be confounded, when he seeks to give
reasons for what he has done.

For once I will be kind, and make the best Apology for our Author I can, and
I think a good one, and that is this.

He is not the first man of the Church of Rome, who has quoted Councils to
little purpose. He follows great Examples, and the chiefest among them.

For thus did Paschasinus, one of the Pope's own Legates in this very Council at
Chalcedon, and that too in his opposition against this 28th Canon. After he had
declared it was the Pope's pleasure, that nothing should be determined there,
concerning his Power, or the Power of the other Patriarchs; he alleged in
behalf of the Pope's Supremacy, that it was fixed beyond exception or doubt, by
the sixth Canon of the great Council at Nice, wherein it was declared, that
Ecclesia Romana semper habuit primatum. The Bishops wondered they should know
nothing of this, and thereupon required the Canon to be read. Paschasinus
produced his Copy, and there those words were: But the Fathers not satisfied,
called for others, and more attested Copies: and in them there was not the
least word, intimating any such thing. Now this compare of the Copies made
Paschasinus blush, and the Fathers of that Council think what sort of men they
had to deal with.

A Roman Catholic tells us this Passage in these words, Primo refertur a
Paschasino Leonis in Concilia Chalcedonensi Legato, Act. 16. quod Ecclesia
Romana semper habuit primatum. At statim Chalcedonenses Patres eundem Canonem
ex codice suo, sine additione ista retulerunt. Quapropter consentiunt omnes
eruditi, verba haec non esse genuina sed assuta.

Thus too in the Council of Carthage, Du Pin, p. 325.
Faustinus, Legate of Zosimus, challenged a right for the Pope to receive
Appeals, and that by right of a Canon of the Council of Nice. The African
Fathers found no such thing in their Copy, brought thence by Caecilianus, one
of the Fathers of that Council. Synodi Carth. Acta Edit. a Beveregio, p. 5^9.
But because Faustinus insisted upon the skill, knowledge, or infallibility (if
you will) of Pope Zosimus, and had showed that the Pope himself, in his
Commonitory directed to him, and the other Legates, did expressly assert that
this was his right, and that according to the determination of the Council of
Nice; the African Fathers resolved to send Messengers to the three great Seats,
Alexandria, Antioch, and Constantinople, to get new Copies, one from each of
them, attested under the hands of those Patriarchs, Epist. ad Coelestinum in
fine Canonum Carthag. a Bevereg. Edit. p 675.
and compare them with their own and the Roman Copy. At the return of the
Messengers, it manifestly appeared that their own Copy entirely agreed with
every one of the others, and that the Council of Nice had not given the least
advantage to the Bishop of Rome in the case of Appeals.

Thus it seems that Councils are different things in Rome from what they are in
other places. A Pope or his Legate, can read that in them, which no man else
can. The Popes seem extraordinarily wise in challenging a power to confirm
Councils; but they had as good let it alone. For it will do their business as
well, if they follow these Examples, to take from them, and add to them what
they please. Brietii Annals in An. 418. p. 402.
Both these things (I know) are excused: and some tell how Paschasinus was led
into his mistake: others say it was a mere oversight of Pope Zosimus in quoting
the Nicene Council instead of the Sardican. To avoid other difficulties; some
are willing to allow, that a Pope may be deceived, and that too when he is
enlarging his Power over the Church Catholic with all art and subtilty. Nor do
I know what Article of Faith or Infidelity might not be established in the
Church by such mistakes and oversights as these. It Is well for succeeding
Christians, that the Fathers at Carthage and Chalcedon had eyes in their heads,
and did use them too; without giving trust to Pope, or Legate, or Roman Copy.
For had they been as much mistaken or overseen as others, there are enough at
this day, that would make advantage of it, and declaim sufficiently against us
pleading an oversight in the case. But these Senses of men are evil things, and
most mischievous to the Interests of Rome. These tempt men, in spite of all
their resolutions, do they what they can, to misdoubt the Doctrine of
Transubstantiation. These showed of old what was, and what was not in the
Council of Nice; and are every day telling tales, opening and disclosing some
fine intrigue or other: so that I cannot but wonder that Rome has not yet taken
a full revenge of them. For if they would oblige men to deny, or at least
misdoubt their Senses in every thing as well as one; and require the Learned
not to see what they do see in Councils and old Records, as well as they
require all not to see what they do see in the consecrated Elements; then
conversions would be easy, and they might soon find an entire submission, from
all the World, to all the Supremacy they can wish.

But to let that pass, it is said in the defense of Zosimus, that he was
overseen, and he easily might be; For the Canon that he quoted was a true
Canon, made at Sardica, and not at Nice; and the Council of Sardica, as to
Faith, entirely receiving and requiring all that which was concluded at Nice;
made only Canons concerning Discipline: and they were put into the same Book;
or upon the same Roll with those of Nice. Which the Pope finding in the Title
at the beginning, might easily refer all that followed to it.

This is said. But the Fathers at Carthage did not judge it an oversight; but
intrigue, and design: and to withstand it to the utmost, made the 31st Canon,
which ordains most stoutly and resolutely; that If any hereafter should appeal
to a Foreign Power, or Transmarine Judicatory; he should never be received into
Communion by any in Africa. Upon which Canon Zonaras says, (...), the huffing
insolence of the Roman Church is here thrown out: and he adds that the reasons
in the case, which were good in Africa, are good everywhere else.

But besides, Synod. Edit. a Beveregio, p. 675.
it appears more evidently, that those Fathers took this to be art and
contrivance. Because at the end of the Council they sent their new attested
Copies to Pope Coclestine, next Successor but one to Zosimus, with a Letter in
the name of the Council: and therein they tell him roundly, that they knew
their right, and that they would maintain it: that they had received wrong by
the intermedling of Faustinus in the name of Zosimus: that the Council of Nice
had committed Presbyters and Bishops to the regulation of the Metropolitans;
and according to wisdom and justice they had fixed, that all Controversies and
Pleas ought to be determined and adjusted in the Places and Countries wherein
they arose: that the grace of the Spirit is not wanting to the Priests of
Christ in every place, whereby they may judge what is right; and in case of
error or aggrievance, there might be an appeal to the next Synod. And as to
judgments to be revoked by Foreigners, and a new revision to be made in Places
beyond the Seas; they knew not how it could be well done. For in these
Revisions, many necessary Witnesses could not be produced in such distant
Places, by reason of sickness, weakness, and many casual, but yet reasonable
impediments. At last they conclude, that all this action, which gave them so
much trouble, tended to no good at all; but would bring into the Church of
Christ, (...). Whereupon they hope he will not follow the Example of his
Predecessor.

Thus said these great Fathers, and thereby sufficiently intimate, what they
thought of the Action of Zosimus.

And we, at this distance, may guess at some farther thoughts of theirs (which
they have concealed) by taking a short review of the History of those times.
Because that will show us something more than an oversight in this business.

The Council of Nice had done nothing for the aggrandizing of Rome.

Two and twenty years after, another Council was convened at Sardica. The
number of Bishops who came thither, (as Athanasius tells us) was an hundred and
seventy. At the first meeting there happens to be a breach amongst them. Upon
that the greatest part withdraw: some it may be to their own Dioceses; others
gathered together to Philippopolis, where they make Canons, and publish them
with authority from the Emperor; and that in the name of the Canons of the
Sardican Council. These for a time were the only Sardican Canons that were
known in other Countries. And because these favored Arianism, St. Augustine,
and St. Aug. Ep. 163. p 856.
Hilary declared highly against the Sardican Council, and the Canons of it. For
they knew of no other but these. But whilst the Eastern Bishops were busy at
Philippopolis, there remained at Sardica about eighty Bishops, as some guess.
Briet. Annals in an. 347.
Brietius the Jesuit says not above seventy. These, that they might seem to
do something, agree to make Canons about Discipline: And because there were
none left there, but good confiding Friends of Pope Julius and Athanasius;
Hosius leads, and they all without dispute or hesitancy follow. He says, Notae
Beveregii in Council. Sardicense, p. 199. Sardic Council. Canon. 3.
let us do something to honor the memory of St. Peter: and they all agree to
do what he would have them to do. Therefore he proposes, and they conclude to
give that to the Pope which he never had before, and yet that was not a power
of judging and determining in a cause upon an Appeal; but of requiring of a
review, or second judgment to be made in the Countries by the same Judges, with
the addition of some few others. As soon as these Canons were made, Julius
receives them, and tacks them to the end of the Canons of the Nicene Council,
where they lay close for seventy years, and were never heard to speak a word in
the Western Church for all that time. Nor yet dare they so much as show their
heads in the Eastern Church in any Judicatory to this day. But when Apiarius
made his complaints to Zosimus, he was so hardy as to make trial of them; and
in the name of the Canons of the Nicene Council, Du Pin, de Antiqua Eccl.
Discip. p. 113.
he sends them abroad to fight for him. De Marca, lib. 7. cap. 5. Du Pin, page
113.

Now in all this Narration from first to last, I see no manner of oversight;
but great appearance of prudence, design and craft. It was no oversight for the
Friends of Rome at Sardica, to make Canons of Discipline; when all the Eastern
Bishops, who might oppose, were out of the way.

It was no oversight in Hosius to preface his Canons in that glozing way of
doing honor to the memory of Saint Peter.

It was no oversight in Julius to tack these new Canons (that were to give him
and his Successors such new powers) to those of the Council of Nice.

It was no oversight in his Successors, to make no mention of these for
seventy years.

It was no oversight in Pope Zosimus, when he resolved to make advantage of
them; to bring them forth in the name and credit of Nicene Canons. (Thus did
Leo the First after him. De Marca, lib. 7. cap. 7. par. 6.) For had he called
them Sardican Canons, St. Augustine would have presently said, that they were
the Acts of Heretics, and in the next moment would have thundered against them,
as Falsarians and Counterfeits. For those Men who made the Sardican Canons,
which he had seen did condemn both Athanasius and Julius; August. Epist. 163.
and then how is it possible to think, that they would ever have given such new
and extraordinary powers to Julius? After that, the whole Council would have
declared, that whether the Canons were counterfeit or not, yet no Act of any
Sardican Council had any more authority in it (after the division of the
Fathers) than an Act of one of their Provincial Synods.

Upon the whole therefore, whatever men talk of an oversight in Zosimus, it is
certain he did what was fit and necessary to be donein the case. If he would
use those Canons to enlarge his power, he must call them Nicene Canons. For
those only could be presumed to have authority sufficient to do his business.
Thus his own next Predecessor Innocentius the First says in his Epistle, ad
Clerum Constantinopolitanum, of the Nicene Canons, that they, and they only
were the Canons, which the Roman Church stood to. Alios quippe Canones Romana
non admittit Ecclesia. Du Pin 113. Sozomen, lib. 8.26. De Marca, lib. 7. cap.
12. par. 1, and 2.

But, good Sir, pardon this digression. It has been too long. Our Author
forced me to it by his consident alleging the Council of Chalcedon, and the
Council of Nice for the Pope's Supremacy. In charity I was bound to pity him,
and tell him something which he did not know; and thereby (if possible) to move
him to take more care, if ever he writes again. I pitied the World too, to see
it in danger to be abused by such impertinencies at this time of day. Only
allow me the favor to acquaint you, that Petrus de Marca, speaking of those
Sardican Canons, lib. 7. Petrus de Marca de concord. Imper. and Sacerdot.
cap. 15. par. 4, and 5. expressly asserts that they were unknown in Africa, and
other Provinces till Zosimus his days, and withal he shows how the Africans at
last came to submit to them; and that was upon many, and those not commendable
reasons; the first of which is this, Cessere tandem ob pertinaciam sedis
Apostolicae Pontificum, qui nihil remittere voluerunt ex jure sibi legitime
quaesito in Concilio Generali Occidentis Sardicensi nimirum; praesertim cum
possessioni eorum consensissent Africani Episcopi, qui ad certum tempus morem
gesserant defideriis Summorum Pontificum. And the last is from the difficulties
which the incursions of the Vandals brought upon them, who being Arians made it
necessary for the Churches of Africa at any rate to purchase the savor and
assistence of the Romans. -- incursio Vandalorum, Ariani erant, and in Africa
dominabantur, Africanos necessitate adigebat ad arctissimam unionem cum
Ecclesia Romana.

It seems then that the Popes after long contests prevailed not by the merits
of their Cause, but by their stiffness, or pertinacious insisting upon demands
right or wrong; And by making advantages of the necessities of others, when
Vandals, and those too Arian Heretics, had mastered them, and lay hard upon
them; for then those Orthodox Christians were forced to yield up their rights
to the Popes, before they could obtain necessary reliefs from them. Thus said
that wise and learned Roman Catholic. And he himself in the writing of this
gives us cause to believe the truth of this remark, for he then found in his
own experience the same stiffness, and pertinacity, and therefore puts in words
to please them quite contrary to the design of his Discourse. For he shows
plainly that they had no right, and yet was forced to say they had, ex jure
legitime quaesito. He shows that the Sardican Fathers, who made this Canon,
after the secessionof the others, could not make up any show of a general
Council, yet says that right was obtained in Concilio generali, Sardicensi
nimirum.

Now, Sir, if you can think that the Roman Bishops have proceeded in these
methods, I hope you will hereafter less puzzle your self, and your Friends,
with your Queries concerning the prodigious Power of the Papacy; how it could
get up at first by such slender pretenses? and how it could hand with such weak
props? how men could be so bold as to challenge in behalf of the Roman Bishops
so illustrious a Supremacy, so unlimited Authority, so glorious a Vicegerency,
as the Vicariatship of Christ himself must speak? All these will be much easier
to you when you have considered these two things; first, the mighty effects of
a pertinacious stiffness in demands right or wrong; and secondly, what it is to
take all advantages upon the necessities of others, especially at such a time,
when those barbarous People, Goths, and Vandals, and Huns, and Saxons, had
overrun so many parts of the World.

2. A second point of Controversy between the Church of Rome, and the Church
of England, which according to our Author was determined by ancient Councils,
is that about the Apocryphal Books; P. 20.
which he says were taken into the Canon of the Old Testament in the Third
Council of Carthage, signed by St. Augustine, Baruch only not named, Canon 47.

Now to this it is sufficient to say, that the Subject is exhausted, and there
is nothing left for another Writer to add to it. The Learned Dr. Cosens in his
Discourse of the Canon of the Scripture, parag. 82. has said more than enough,
for the satisfaction of any learned Roman Catholic, as well as Protestant; and
if our Author would presume to reply, it will cost him more pains, than the
writing of a dozen such Books as these. But some small return may be expected;
He shall therefore have this: That the Canon he quotes out of the Council of
Carthage, Canon. 47. apud Binnum, and Canon. 27. in Synodico Bevereg.
does not provide for the taking of Books into the Canon of Scripture; but for
throwing of Books out of the Church. It says at first, that no Books should be
read in Churches, but these; and then it says in the close, that they had
received from the Fathers, that these were there to be read. Now our Author
knows, that though we call these Books Apocryphal, yet we read them in our
Churches; and that as much, and more than they do in the Church of Rome; and
that all of them, except the two Books of the Maccabees. Now as to these, Dr.
Cousin 's Scholast. Hist. p. 112, and 113.
they are nt mentioned in any of the Greek Copies of this Canon; nor yet in
Cresconius his Collection of the African Canons; and how they came to be
inserted, we must remit him to Dionysius Exiguus for his satisfaction.

But if our Author had any material doubt concerning the Church of England's
Doctrine about Canonical, and Apocryphal Books, he would have done well to have
considered the sentiments of the Doctors of the Roman Church, before he had
concluded against us. Now, I believe, that Cardinal Cajetan, where he
endeavors to reconcile the Council of Carthage with Saint Augustine, would
have given him reason enough never to have used this objection against the
Church of England. He says indeed against Protestants, but not those of the
English Communion, in fine Commentariorum ad Hist. V. and N. T. Ne turberis
Novitie, si alicubi reperias libros istos inter Canonicos supputatos; vel in
sacris Conciliis, vel in sacris Doctoribus; libri isti non sunt Canonici ad
confirmanda ea quae sunt fidei, possunt tamen dici Canonici ad aedificationem
fidelium, ut pote in Canone Biblii ad hoc recepti and autorati. Cum hac
distinctione discernere poteris scripta Augustini, and scripta in provinciali
Synodo Carthaginensi.

Now this agrees well enough with the Doctrine in the Articles, and practice
prescribed in the Rubric, of the Church of England.

And besides, Can. Apostol. 85.
this distinction has its foundation in a very venerable Authority, for the
Apostolic Canons make a great deal of difference, (and that upon the same
ground) between some, and other Books; calling some of these (...), venerable,
and holy; but then of the Book, called the Wisdom of Solomon, or the Son of
Sirach (and that most certainly is the best of the Apocrypha) say, it is to be
learnt by the Young Men, or the Catechumens, for the good rules and
instructions that are in it: and for this end it is read in the Church of
England.

It is something more, and to be hinted here; Council. Laod. Can. 60.
that the Laodicaean Council expressly requires that no Books be read in the
Church but those that we account in strict sense Canonical; Can. 60. And in the
Canon 59. of that Council it is absolutely forbidden, that any private Hymns or
Psalms (that is, such as have been made by private Persons, since the
consignation of the Canon of Scripture) should be used in Churches. Now if our
Author knows his Breviary, and allows any Authority to these Councils; He may
have more reason to object against the Church of Rome, for having so many
private Hymns in their Service, than against the Church of England, for having
so few Books in that which is properly called the Canonical Scriptures.

This bye-consideration might have given some stop to a man that was not
resolved to run too fast from his Church.

3. But he mentions a third Doctrine determined in ancient Councils against us;
P. 20.
and that is concerning the unbloudy Sacrifice; now this is for want of matter
to give words; it is certain that the Church of England, at the end of the
Communion-service, in the last Collect, teaches us to pray to God, that he
would accept this our Sacrifice; and our Author knows that it never owned any
Sacrifice, but an unbloudy Sacrifice to be offered there.

I wish our Author had told us whether the Sacrifice which the Church of Rome
pretends to offer, be bloody or unbloudy.

They tell us ordinarily that there is blood on the Patten, and blood in the
Cup, blood with the Body concomitanter, for the benefit of the Laity; and blood
in the Cup to the satisfaction of the Priest; I think both these are offered up
according to their Doctrine, as a Sacrifice propitiatory for the dead and the
living.

They that believe Transubstantiation, must believe that one part of the
Sacrifice is really blood, and nothing else but blood; and they may be
concerned to call it a bloody Sacrifice, but not at all to call it unbloudy.
Pope Urban the Fourth seems to have been of this mind when he instituted the
great Feast of the Body of Christ, commonly called, Festum Corporis Christi:
For he did it upon this occasion; that a certain Host being broken by the
Priest, either bled, or shed drops of blood; they say miraculously, but how, or
whether true or no, we know not. Now this, I presume, may be called a bloody
Host or Sacrifice; Brietius, Ann. 1264. in these words tells us the story.

Vrbanus quartus ex occasion miraculi de Eucharistia. Briet. Annal. in An.
1264.
Hostia a Sacerdote fracta reddente sanguinem, Festum Corporis Christi
instituit.

The institution of this Feast was to give honor to the Host, and that not as
unbloudy, but as bloody; and it was to insinuate this Doctrine, that all the
other Hosts have blood with them, as well as this; though the blood does not
always appear. But, as they say, then it did; and if so, it came in seasonably
to confirm the Doctrine of the Lateran Council about Transubstantiation; and
that which soon followed after it, the communicating of the Laity in one
Species. So happy was the Church of Rome then, to have a Miracle, or the story
of a Miracle to come in at the nick of time, to patronage that which old
Councils, and old Fathers, and sense, and reason, and all that is in man, must
have disclaimed and opposed.

But now, after all this, our Author is most unlucky, to put us in mind of the
true, ancient, Catholic Doctrine; and to summon up old Councils in the defense
of a word, which we accept, and use with submission, and that most properly; we
believe the holy Eucharist to be a Sacrifice, and that in plain and strict
sense, an unbloudy Sacrifice; and so as the ancient Councils, and Fathers did,
we call it. And though the Doctors of the Church of Rome use the same word,
yet when they reflect upon the Doctrine of their own Church, they must explain
themselves by a much harder figure, than we use when we interpret the words of
our Savior's Institution.

But yet our Author will have the Councils against us; and he tells us of a
Council at Constantinople, which, he says, was a thousand years ago, and that
it seems used these words, and so do we; those old Councils are better Friends
to the Protestant Doctrines, than he is aware of; for the Protestants studied
them, and learnt of them, and took their rules and measures, in the
Reformation, as near as they could, after the holy Scriptures, from them.

Then he cites the ninth Council of the Apostles; now I wish he had told us,
whether this was a thousand, or fifteen hundred, or two thousand years ago: I
thought at first he meant the 15th Chapter of the Acts of the Apostles; But our
Author has declared so much against the Scriptures, that we can never hope to
find his sense there; it is possible he means the ninth of the Apostolic
Canons.

And that is as little to his purpose, as the ninth Council of the Apostles: to
be sure it speaks nothing against the interest of the Church of England, and
nothing to the advantage of the Church of Rome.

Thus it is, and will be, as often as men adventure to write Books without
skill.

4. P. 20.
The fourth point our Author gives us as determined in Councils, is that of
the veneration and worship of Saints Relics, as also of Martyrs, and holy
Images; which, he says, was (according to Apostolical Tradition) established in
the second Council of Nice, with the general concurrences of ancient Fathers.

This Council indeed speaks to the point, for which it is alleged; but because
our Author is pleased to fortify it with concurrences; I Will give him account
of some other Councils, that as to time, do almost concur with this; they treat
upon the same subject, and determine as resolutely; and when he has balanced
all the concurrences together, perhaps he may find as little pleasure in this
allegation, as in all the rest.

The first Council that ever determined any thing about the worship of Images
was at Constantinople, Anno 754. See the Acts of the second Nicene Council in
Binnius, p. 621. Col. Edit. Ann. 1618.
This called it self the seventh general Council, and so it was esteemed for
thirty years after.

This condemned the worship of Images, and declared that it was abominable,
that Images were Idols, and the Worshippers of them Idolaters; and that all and
every Image was to be thrown out of Christian Churches; and they spoke as high
in this way, as any have done since the Reformation. See Binnius his
Collection, as before; and Balsamus and Zonaras on the 7th and 9th Canons of
the second Nicene Council.
This appears by the Acts and Canons of the second Nicene Council where those
Fathers speak against it.

A little more than thirty years after, another Council was convened at Nice;
This cancelled the Acts of the former, and called it self the seventh general
Council. This declared the worship of Images to be lawful, but gave no
requisite bounds and measures to it, nor yet taught the expediency of it.

This was done when Irene, an Imperious Woman, in the behalf of her young Son,
swayed the Empire. But seven years after this, Charles the Great gets another
Council to meet at Francfort; there met three hundred Bishops, who unanimously
as much damned the second Council at Nice, as that had damned the former:
Walafridus Strabo, and Ado Viennensis, and Regino Prumiensis tell us, that in
this Francfort Council; Pseudosynodus Graeca pro adorandis Imaginibus habita,
and falso septima vocata, ab Episcopis damnata est. And Hincmarus Rhemensis
tells us: Tempore Caroli magni Imperatoris, jussione Apostolicae sedis,
generalis Synodus in Francia convocante praefato Imperatore, celebrata est, and
secundum Scripturarum tramitem, traditionemque majorum, ipsa Graecorum Synodus
destructa and penitus abdicata est. And a little after he tells, that by the
Authority of this Synod, the veneration of Images was somewhat repressed: But
yet Pope Adrian was of another mind, and his Successors, after the death of
Charles, Pupparum suarum cultum vehementius promoverunt, stirred much to
advance this worship; to which he gives a name which I shall not English:
insomuch, that Lewis, the Son of Charles, was forced to write sharper against
the worship of Images, than his Father had done. Now this is material, and it
might in reason have stopped our Author from laying any great stress upon the
second Nicene Council. And all this he knew, or might have known; for Dr.
Beveredge, -- Notae Beveregii in Concilium Nicenum secundum.
in his learned Notes upon that Council, had laid all this before him.

But to add a little more; in the year 825. Ludovicus Pius called another
Council at Paris, and this declared as much against the worship of Images, and
the second Council at Nice, as that at Francfort had done before. The Acts of
this Council lay in obscurity, unknown a great while; but they were printed in
the year 1596. and since that time the Friends of the present Church of Rome
have nothing to say against them, and nothing for themselves; but that Jonas
Aurelianensis disputed in that Council for Images against Claudius Taurinensis.
-- Bellarminus de Script. Ecclesiast. An. 820. de Jona. Aurelianensi.
But yet for all his Arguments, the unanimous determinations of the rest of the
Fathers was against them. And besides, this very Jonas, though he had something
to say against Claudius, yet he said not enough to serve the Interest of the
present Church of Rome; For Bellarmine, de scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis, tells
us, that he wrote three Books pro defensione sacrarum Imaginum; But he advises
men to read them with caution; because (he says) that he, and Agabardus, and
all the chief Writers of the French Nation in that age, are in one and the same
error; who, though they will allow some worship for Images, yet they deny that
any religious worship is to be given to them.

Thus our Author might have seen, that we have against them three Councils for
one; One in the East before that of Nice, most high and positive against
Imageworship: and two in the West: and those not only declaring against that
Worship, but as positively cassating and annulling the Acts of that second
Nicene Council which allowed it; and these two convened by the direction of two
great Princes, Charles the Great, and Lewis the Pious, who were the best
Friends that ever the Church of Rome had. And with these Councils agree, or
very near agree, all the chief Men of skill and learning, who were Writers in
that age in the West: And then in the East, it is most certain that the second
Nicene Council had no Credit, or Reputation, or Authority a great while after;
for all the Historians that write of the Times after the Deposition of Irene
the Empress, tell us of three or four Emperors immediately succeeding, who
fully declared against Images, and their worship; threw them out of Churches,
and severely punished all those that pleaded in defense of them. And nothing is
so common amongst them, as severe and bitter complaints against the Persecution
of the Iconoclasts.

All this is true matter of fact, and it is enough to depreciate the credit of
the second Nicene Council, and that perhaps with our Author himself.

But yet, for all this, it may puzzle some others, to find that this second
Nicene Council appears in the World, as the seventh General Council; and that
in ancient as well as modern Collections; and not only in the West, but in the
East.

The consideration of this is beside my business; but yet it is strange, and
surprising, and would tempt a man to venture at a guess, which perhaps may move
others to speak something in the case that is more material.

I have heard of a Proverb, or proverbial saying; that three things joined
together will do wonders; and they are these, A little good luck, and some
Art, and a great deal of Face.

Now the second Nicene Council has had on its side all these three most
remarkably. First, as to good luck, about the time of this Council, whilst
Irene was Empress, there happened a most prodigious strange Miracle at Berytus in
Phoenicia.

An Image of our Savior being wounded by a Jew in the breast gave out, as my
Author says, so much blood, -- Brietii Annals in An. 765.
as being divided, would be sufficient to be kept, and shown in all the
Churches of the East and West: This was soon carried abroad; and a little of
it, as most sacred and venerable, was reposited in most of the famed Churches:
Some of this we find was shown at Mantua; and great noise and talk there was
about it; perhaps some were for the Miracle, and some against it: And it is
likely that Charles the Great had not faith enough to believe it; for in the
year 804. he got Pope Leo the Third to determine the Controversy, whether that
blood came from the Image at Berytus, or no; and at that time he gave his
judgment against the Image; but when he added, that the blood there shown came
out of the side of our Savior, an honest Jesuit dare not credit him.

Brietius says, de hoc viderint eruditi. -- Briet. Annals, An. 804.
Now when this blood was shown in Churches far and near, in the East and West,
it could not but conciliate great veneration to sacred Images in the People.
For they saw the blood, and it was shown with a great deal of devotion; and the
Priests and Monks told the story no doubt with confidence enough; and it being
told in so many places, and so often, and after the same manner, How the Jew
blasphemed our Savior, and how he scoffed at his sacred Image; and then how
impudently he pierced it; and then, how that very blood came from it; the
People could not but believe the story; and believing that they could not but
have a high opinion of their Images, and a great readiness to receive the
Doctrine and Practice of giving worship to them.

This Miracle happening in Irene's time, or, as Sigebert says, a little before;
but yet after the Constantinopolitan Council, that had condemned Image Worship,
came in as seasonably to the assistence of Images, and Image-worshippers, as
heart could wish; if it had been contrived with craft, and slight, it could
not have happened in a more convenient time.

This may be said to be good luck; most certainly this Miracle, or story of a
Miracle, did great service to the second Nicene Council; it was a most
powerful mover to gain credit and authority for it.

2. But secondly, there was Art used to give credit to this Council; and that
much more than it had, or could deserve; and yet not more than it wanted: For
seeing that in the West the illustrious names of Charles the Great, and Lewis
the Pious, were openly alleged, and everywhere known against it. And the name
of Irene, after her Deposition, would rather have blemished than honored it.
And no Emperor for a good while after her could be named a friend or favourer
of it; therefore Justinian was fetched from his grave to ratify it.

Within less than a hundred years after this Council, a notorious piece of
forgery was contrived to cheat them that were not unwilling to be couzened.

Justinian's Novel, wherein he confirmed the first four General Councils, was
sent abroad, enlarged with the additions of three Councils more, whereof this
was the last, and it was done for the sake of this.

But now, though this was a very impudent cheat, for Justinian was dead two
hundred years before this Council; yet Photius and Balsamon (whether willingly
or unwillingly, who knows) were catched with it. See Dr. Beveredge's Notes upon
the first Canon of the second Nicene Council; where this trick is discovered,
and a broad intimation given, that many more like unto it might be added.

Now such Arts as these, with success attending them, and so great, as to
deceive such men as Photius, and Balsamon, may easily be thought able enough to
support the worst Cause in the World; and we need not wonder to see the second
Nicene Council in credit, and authority, since it had such mighty forces,
Miracles, and Forgery to fight for it. And both these unaccountably
successful; the one in amazing the Vulgar, and the other in blundering Men of
the best skill: All the effect, which I know, that such a Story as this can
have upon an indifferent Person, and such as has not totally laid aside his
Bible, is to move him to read twice or thrice that Passage of St. Paul, 2 Thessalonians. 2.9, 10.

3. A third advantage that the second Nicene Council has had, is Face. Now
perhaps our Author may at first be at a little puzzle to find this word here;
and willing to spell the meaning of it; but he may soon ease himself of farther
thought, if he reflects but on himself, and his own carriage in this Book,
toward the Reverend Fathers of our Church; How he heads, and beards them, and
talks saucily to them: and seems to triumph in a conquest over them; when he
has neither Sense, nor Reason, nor Scripture, nor Council for him. It Is well he
has Face; for if he had not that, all things else would sail him: to that he
must owe all the agreeable effects of this Book, if perchance he finds any: But
yet it must be said, that the same steps our Author takes, others have trodden
before him. For what Petrus de Marca says of the receiving of the Sardican
Canons, Tom. 2. lib. 7. cap. 15. parag. 5. that it was done Ob pertinaciam
sedis Apostolicae Pontificum, qui nihil remittere voluerunt, is likewise true
in this case.

The Council was condemned, and all the Acts of it nulled and cassated, with
full authority in two Councils; so far as Image Worship was allowed and
approved in it. And then as to the matter of it, the worship of Images; no man
has yet taught any considerable good or expediency that can come to Christians
by it. The Objections against it are pressing and strong, a danger, at least,
of a great Sin; and that Sin suspected to be Idolatry, and so alleged to be by
the Councils at Constantinople, and Paris. All the seeming Answers made to
those Objections were retorted, and fully replied to with briskness and
smartness by Claudius Taurinensis in Ludovicus Pius his times: And the
rejoinder of Jonas Aurelianensis does not satisfy Bellarmine himself. Vide
Appendicem figur. 1.
And nothing has appeared since in the World but the same things over and over
again; or a hasty rallying up of the broken and shattered remains of those
Ancient Controvertists.

This, I think, is enough to persuade an indifferent Byestander, that Face, or
Confidence, or Pertinacity has had a great influence in giving that Authority
to the Second Nicene Council which is challenged for it at this day.

I beg pardon for this digression; it may seem impertinent to some, and not
altogether so to others. It may perhaps give occasion to the more Learned to
examine more strictly the Authority that is commonly allowed with no very good
reason to some other Councils.

I will only add this one thing, for the consideration of my Contrymen;
that when the Decree of this Council was first brought into Britain, it gave
infinite displeasure and discontent to our Predecessors, the old Britains: The
Learned Dr. Beveregii Annotat. in Canones Council. Nicen secundi, p. 163.
Beveredge gives us this in his Notes upon this Council: Quanta offensione,
quantoque odio Ecclesia nostra Britannica Decretum praesentis Synodi de
adorandis imaginibus, tunc temporis, excipiebat, Historici nostri Rogerus
Hovedenus, Simeon Dunelmensis, aliique, ubertim tradiderunt.

5. P. 20.
The next thing that our Author gives us, as determined in Ancient Councils,
is that of Communion under one Kind; which, he says, was determined to be
sufficient by the Council of Constance: Now here I will dispatch in short by
telling this one thing to our Author; That in my opinion he might as well have
told me of a Council of Jews met together to condemn our Savior, as of a
Council of Christians, that have presumed to alter, and change the most sacred
Institution of our Lord.

The blessed Sacrament is most venerable, as it came from him; It receives its
being, nature, virtue, grace, from his good will and pleasure, from his
institution. Without this institution it is nothing: For there is no reason for
Christians to communicate in the Lord's Supper; to eat his Body, and to drink
his Blood; but only this, that it pleased the Lord to give that Rule and Order
to them.

Had he pleased, he might have given us the Bread without the Cup, or the Cup
without the Bread; and if he had pleased, he might have omitted both. But since
he has given the same order for both; Christians are under the same obligation,
and have the same right to both, as to one; and that all Christians, as well
Laity, as Priests, for there is but one order given; and a Council may as well
debar the Priests from the Cup, as the Laity; and they may as well null the
whole Sacrament, as halve it.

But since our Author has mentioned the Council of Constance, I will presume
to recommend unto him a late ingenious, and discreet Discourse, published by a
Person of quality, of the Authority of Councils, and Rule of Faith. He may
there find some remarks concerning this Council of Constance, that may do him
more good than all the Councils that ever he read.

6. The next thing our Author mentions is Purgatory, P. 21.
and the Council of Florence, establishing the truth of the Doctrine concerning
it. Now as to this enough has been written already, I Will be kind to our
Author, and for his sake say nothing against it. And that because I know not
what profit or advantage to himself a New Convert may expect from it: For it is
the trade of Indulgences and Masses that keeps up the talk of it; as it is a
point of speculation, Rome is no more concerned to defend it than we. The
Doctrine derives from Heathens, especially the Poets; and it may give fine
entertain to Wits, and idle Persons. He that has nothing to do, may transcribe
half a score Legends, which may possibly make our Author blush, and be wiser
than to allege Councils in defense of Purgatory.

7. P. 21.
The last Point which our Author gives us, is the Doctrine of
Transubstantiation, which he says was confirmed in the great Council of
Lateran; in which near thirteen hundred Fathers assisted: and in seven or eight
other Councils before that of Trent; and all the controverted Points
particularly, and by name, declared by some of your selves, to have been
brought into England by Augustine the Monk, above a thousand years since.

Here our Author is unhappy in every thing he says.

First, He calls the Lateran Council Great; He means General, for that is the
name which must guide its Authority, and make it considerable; and so some have
called it, but with the meanest appearance of reason that ever was offered; For
the Saracens then gave too much business to the Eastern Bishops, for them to
leave their Houses, and their Flocks, to come to Rome to make Speeches in
Councils there.

And then secondly, He says there were near thirteen hundred Fathers assisting
in this Council; now if he had looked upon Binnius, or Labbe, he would have
found not above four hundred Bishops there, and they are the only Persons that
were ever reckoned for Fathers in a Council.

Thirdly, To the end of this he tacks a Story of Augustine the Monk, as if he
thought, or would persuade others, that he brought into England the Doctrine of
Transubstantiation, and the Decree of the Lateran Council for it: Now
Transubstantiation, name, and thing, can derive no higher than this Lateran
Council; and this Council was not in being for more than six hundred years
after the Death of Augustine; Bid tells us, Lib. 2. cap. 5. that he was dead
before the year 613. and this Council met not till the year 1215. Thus
miserably unhappy is our Author in his impertinent Sallies. But he must hear
more of Augustine hereafter. At present our Author's business is to gain
credit and belief to the Doctrine of Transubstantiation from the Authority of
the fourth Lateran Council, under Innocent the Third. Now to this I answer,

First, That no Lateran Council can be presumed to have any considerable
Authority in it; especially not that which is challenged in the behalf of
Great, or General Councils: which is a submission of Judgment, and an entire
resignation of Faith to the Decrees of it.

Secondly, This particular fourth Lateran Council is liable to more Objections
than all the rest; and some of them such as are so sharp and pungent to the
sense of an Englishman, that he can scarce hear them without disgust and
hatred; and therefore it may be presumed, that whatever credit and authority
that Council can give to Transubstantiation abroad, yet it can give little or
none to it in England.

I. No Lateran Council can be presumed to have any considerable Authority in
it; and that for these reasons.

1. Because these Lateran Councils come too near to the indoctum seculum; that
is, to an Age wherein good Learning was hushed asleep; and Ignorance and
Darkness had overspread the World. This Romanists, Bellarm. in Chronologia in
An. 970.
as well as Protestants complain of, and tell us, that neither Learned Man, nor
Writer, was known to have lived in it. Now before Learning was got up and
dressed, Ambition and Interest had done a great deal of business in the World;
and when it is known that they have been acting, all Men usually are so
suspicious, as not to be over ready to give any great credit.

2. Those Lateran Councils came too thick, for we have five of them in less
than one hundred years: Since that under Paschal the Second generally omitted,
is certainly a Lateran Council, as Baluzius, in the Edition of Petrus de Marca,
has evidently shown, Tom. 2. page 431. To these might be added at least three
more, and all alike Ecumenical; for all the distinction that Labbe makes
without any reason, is but to salve the credit of the former Collectours.

3. The matter of some of them was of no great concern; this may be presumed,
because the best Copies of their Acts and Canons lay by the walls so long; For
they were not well understood, till the curiosity and industry of Baluzius, and
some others, lately brought them to light: Petrus de Marca de concordia
Sacerdotii, and imperii, Tom. 2. p. 431, and 435, and 437.
this appears by Baluzius in the Book of Petrus de Marca; and by comparing of
Binnius his Councils with those of Labbe.

4. Most of them were convened for ill purposes, to advance the Papal Power,
and to lessen the rights of Princes: To this end convened, or at least aimed
the Councils under Paschal II. Callistus II. Alexander III. and that under
Innocent III.

But the last is our business, where the Second thing is to be spoken to. I say
therefore

II. This Lateran Council, under Innocent III. is liable to so many objections,
that no man, especially an Englishman, can have any great regard for the
Doctrine of Transubstantiation upon the Authority of it. This will appear if we
consider,

1. That the 70 Acts or Canons of this Council were never heard of for full
three hundred years after the Council; and they were first brought to light by
Cochlaeus, Luther's Adversary; who, about 20 years after Luther's opposition
against the Church of Rome, either found them, or pretended to find them in
some German Library, and sent them to Peter Crabb, who printed them in the Year
1537. and annexed them to the rest of the Councils, as if they had been the
true Acts of that Lateran Council; for which he had no Authority, but what he
received from Cochlaeus.

2. They are so ill put together, that every man who reads them, must misdoubt
them. For some of them are in the style of Conciliary Acts, and others speak
after the manner of a Narrator, who tells what was done in a Council. Thus
speaks the 11th, 33d, 39th, 51st, 61st. In the 11th we find these words; In
Lateranensi Concilio pia fuit institutione provisum. 33. Evectionum and
personarum mediocritatem observent in Lateranensi Concilio definitum. 39. De
multa Providentia fuit in Lateranensi Concilio prohibitum. See the rest, and
you will find that these and those words there used, speak plainly that these
are not Canons of a Council. Hist. of the Irish Remonst. page 66.
From these and other Arguments Peter Walsh has well guessed, That the words of
Matthew Paris, who says that Innocent proposed 70 capitula to the Fathers of
this Council, which to some did seem easy, and to others burdensome, gave
occasion to some Collector to put together what he found in the Decretals under
the name of Innocentius in Concilio Lateranensi; and give to his Collection the
Name of the Acts of the Lateran Council; it is plain that Gregory IX. who put
out the Decretals, did allow the same Authority to the Acts of a Pope, and
especially his Uncle, this Innocent III. as if they had been the Acts of a
Council. And his Propositions in the Lateran Council, though never accepted or
agreed to by the Council, would have as much Authority as the rest of the
Decretals have.

III. But then thirdly it is to be observed farther; That whether these reputed
Canons were Propositions of Pope Innocent, or real Acts of the Council, yet no
great stress can be laid upon them, because all things were then done in
extraordinary haste. We cannot at this day learn from any man, that in this
Council there was any such thing as deliberation, or consulation; no argument
was used, either pro, or con; no reason offered, no objection removed; not a
word is mentioned what this, or that, or the other man said; All things past in
a huddle, after a quite different manner from what was used by the Apostles in
their Council, Acts 15. But more closely to our present business as to
Transubstantiation, the Doctrine of which our Author says was here confirmed;
Briet. Annals in An. 1215.
and Brietius says, that the Name of it was here admitted, in eo Nomen
Transubstantiationis admissum fuit; it is to be observed, that if we speak
strictly, the very Name of Transubstantiation is not to be found in all the
Council; and there is but one Passage in it that refers either to the Name, or
Doctrine. Cabassutius, a Roman Catholic, in his last Collection of Councils
found so little of it, that in his Notes upon this Council, he has not one
remark upon this Point. Nor yet has Labbe any thing considerable of it, though
he takes in the Notes of Binnius, and gives us the Errors of Almaric, which
gave occasion to this Doctrine: yet the truth is, something of it is in this
Council, in the first Canon of it: But it comes in so sneakingly, and so unlike
to a Conciliary Act determining a Doctrine de fide; that an easy Reader might
not observe it, and the more accurate would have no great regard for it. It
seems to be slurred upon the World, or designed to pass like a whisper thorough
artificial conveniences, where they that are near shall perceive little of it,
but at distance it will be noisie and loud. The words in the first Capitul. are
these. Vna vero est fidelium universalis Ecclesia, extra quam nullus omnino
salvatur. In qua idem ipse Sacerdos, and Sacrificium Jesus Christus: cujus
corpus and sanguis in Sacramento Altaris sub speciebus panis and vini veraciter
continentur, Transubstantiatis, pane in corpus, and vini in sanguinem potestate
divina, ut ad perficiendum mysterium unitatis accipiamus ipsi de suo, quod
accepit ipse de nostro. These are the words, and besides these we have nothing
that refers to this matter in the whole Council; and all that we have is no
more than one barbarous word hooked in by a Parenthesis, without any explicit
and determinate sense.

Now this is surprising, and amazing, that Christians should be obliged, and
that with peril of damnation, to believe a Doctrine so difficult, and so
incredible, as that of Transubstantiation, and that only by virtue of a word
that seems to be slurred upon them; must we for this deny our Senses, and our
Reasons, and forget our selves to be Men? must this be accounted Authority
sufficient to awe Consciences, and subjugate Faith, and captivate
Understandings? God Almighty never did this, and the Blessed Jesus spoke
plainly, and fully, whenever he required obedience under such severe penalties.

If Transubstantiation be de fide, necessary to be believed in order to
Salvation, certainly we ought to have better grounds for it, than the Lateran
Council can give. For any indifferent Person would require, in such a case as
this, that the Fathers of the Council should have used all application of mind,
care, and industry, and hearty humble prayer to God for his direction, before
they had determined such a Point, and laid such a burden upon Christians; but
of this kind there was nothing done there.

IV. I add farther, that as there appears but little ground for any man to
believe Transubstantiation by virtue of the Lateran Council, so there is much
less for an Englishman to receive either that, or any other Doctrine in the
Name, and by the Authority of it. An Englishman can scarce think of it without
wrath and indignation: For this was called in the Year 1215. about two years
after the great mortification of our King John by this Pope Innocent III. one
of the great reasons for it was to show to the World the Pope's Victory, and
England's Slavery. From thence it was that he wrote his Letter to tell the
Barons, In additionibus ad Concilium Lateran. quartum in Editione Labbeana.
Annals Monast. Burton. Edit. Oxon. page 263.
that England was his, and the King his Vassal. Here it was that he expanded
his Plumes, and showed his pride and his glory; Here he made known to the World
that Pandulphus did not go beyond commission, when he told King John that he
ought to obey his Lord the Pope, tam in terrenis quam in spiritualibus, as well
in earthly matter as in spiritual; nor yet acted beyond commission, when he
stressed this unhappy Prince so far, that he was forced to resign up his
Kingdoms to the Pope; and could not be resetled in his Rights, till he had
submitted to become tributary, Vassal and Liege-man to this Pope, and his
Successors, and until he had taken that slavish base Oath, Annals Monast.
Burton. p. 270.
which was framed in the same words wherewith Vassals and Villains were wont to
bind themselves to their proper Lords; which may be seen with many other
strange Clauses contained in it, in the Annals of Burton Monastery, p. 270.
Oxford Edition.

That all these things were done by command, appears by the Acts or
Propositions of Pope Innocent in this Lateran Council.

Here he breathes in the Spirit of a Conqueror, and speaks as Universal
Monarch of the World; he gives and takes away at pleasure, and makes Laws for
the keeping, or forfeiting Estates. He tells what Princes shall be deposed, and
when, and how far their Subjects shall be free to make head against them; Vide
Addit. ad Council. Lateran. quartum in Edit. Labb.
and upon occasion not only to depose, but to kill them. There he actually
determined of the Rights to the Empire in the Cause depending between Otho and
Frederick; and there he gave away the Estate, Lands and Possessions of
Raimundus Count of Tholouz to Simon Mountford.

And as he dealt with Princes, so he did with private Persons; for there be
adjudged the Estates of all Persons to be liable to forfeiture, and
confiscation, upon such faults committed; and not only theirs, but those of
their Abettors, Harbourers, or Receivers of them; as appears not only in the
Council, but in the Decretals, lib. 5. tit. 7. cap. 13. All this he did, and it
will be no wonder that he did all this, if we consider how much his mind was
elevated by his victory over King John; and to what a degree of pride and
haughtiness he was grown; indeed it was so much, that no words can express it,
except his own: In Bibliotheca Cottoniana sub Effigy Cleopatrae, E. 1.
And whoever consults that remarkable Rescript of his to King John, and his
Heirs, wherein he sets down his Title to England, in perpetuam rei memoriam;
may see a sufficient foundation to expect all the rest of those Actions which
insued afterward.

This may be said of him, that he was so far just, that he was not partial to
any, but he treated all alike; for as he trampled upon Princes, and Laity; so
he most tyrannically, and insolently treated the Clergy too. For in the Year
1216. as we see in the Chronicle de Mailros, Chronica de Mailros, p. 194. Edit.
Oxon.
page 194. Oxford Edition; we have a strange complaint of the Religious against
him, that he went beyond all Rule and Order, Law and Canon. Inauditam and
inusitatam Dominus Papa Legato concesserat autoritatem, faciendi videlicet, ut
ita dicam, quicquid animo ipsius sederet; in Clero, and Populo per Angliam,
Scotiam, and Wales, constituto, transponendi and deponendi, and alios ponendi,
suspendendi, and excommunicandi, and absolvendi, Episcopos and Abbates, and
alios Ecclesiarum Praelatos, and Clericos. This I presume made Matthew Paris
give him that Character, f. 245. as a thing well known by the experience of
Prince and People; Noverat Rex, and multiplici didicerat experientia, quod Papa
super omnes mortales ambitiosus erat, and superbus, pecuniaeque sititor
insatiabilis, and ad omnia scelera pro praemiis datis, vel promissis cereus and
proclivis.

Now such a Man, as this is, wants a great deal of advantage, which another in
his place might have had, in order to the giving credit or authority to his
Actions: And if a Council under him be entirely inslaved to him, and so much at
his dispose, that it does not ap pear to posterity that any one man in it, did
upon the place speak a word either for or against the presumed Acts of it; and
if yet it be at least probable, that all those Acts were not Conciliarily past,
but mere Propositions of the Pope: himself; without any consent, approbation,
or regular determination of the Council, I think no man living can look upon
himself as concluded by them, or under an obligation from them.

But an Englishman must have an inward reluctance and abhorrence to see his
Faith increased, and his Creed enlarged; and himself put into a new danger of
being adjudged a Heretic, by a slight and trick of that Man, who with
intolerable pride and insolence trampled upon the Crown and Dignity of a King
of England; and as soon as he had done that, with an unheard of confidence
challenges to make Laws about Kingdoms, Estates, and Patrimonies, wherein he
subjects them to forfeiture and confiscation upon the account of Heresy. And
at the same time he slurs in a word to a pretended Canon, that requires a
Doctrine to be believed against all sense and reason, and such as will endanger
all men that are willing to act rationally, and discreetly, according to their
best wits that God has given them, to be adjudged and condemned for Heretics.
This certainly must appear hard to Englishmen to have their Estates brought
into such perils and hazards, especially since they learn from one of their own
Country, Mat. Paris, who was a Monk, and so bound to great regards for a Pope;
and wrote in the Year 1254. that this Innocent was not only intolerably
ambitious, but infinitely covetous, and so may be presumed really to design and
aim at forfeitures, and not near so much to regard the clearing and settling the
Christian Faith, as to make a gin and a trap to catch People, and seize upon
their Estates under the name of Heretics: He that observes how sneakingly that
Word comes into the first Capitulum of the reputed Lateran Council, may easily
persuade himself of the likelihood of some of these thoughts. And if any one
shall rub up his memory, and add to these the fineness, and great management of
Rome, when they made the Canons of the Sardican Council to pass in the World
under the name of the Nicene; And in opposition to a plain manifest discovery
of the Error, yet to this day to bear up so high, as to challenge some great
Authority unto them; whereas in their own nature they can deserve but very
little, being made by the broken remains of a Council, when the greatest
numbers were gone, and none remained, but the fast Friends and Dependants upon
Rome: And to this let him add the Remarks that Father Paul gives upon the first
Act of the Council of Trent, wherein those words, Proponentibus Legatis, were
so closely couched, and so supinely passed, that few heard them, and fewer
apprehended the consequences of them, yet all the ensuing Determinations of
that Council were entirely guided and governed, by the fatal Powers of them.

He that thinks of these, and many other such like things, may apprehend, that
there is such a thing as art and slight in the World: and if he does that, he
will not be over forward to give any extraordinary Authority to such a Lateran
Council, entirely governed by such a Man, as Pope Innocent III. especially in
such a Doctrine, which it self durst scarcely speak out, but imposes upon you
in it, by giving you only one Word, and that a barbarous one, in all the
presumed Acts of it. And that comes in, as it were, by surprise, and most
amazing, without any deliberation, or consultation; but you have it there,
before you in the reading of it can be aware; and perhaps too before the
Fathers, who were convened in that Council, themselves could be.

These Considerations I think sufficient to persuade any man to think himself
under no great obligation to believe Transubstantiation by virtue of the
Authority of this Council, and I presume it will least of all affect the Faith
of an Englishman.

I shall only add one thing more concerning this Lateran Council, which some
perhaps may think worthy of a remark; and that is this:

This Lateran Council was not only famous for new Doctrine, Addit. ad Council.
Later. quartum, Edit. Labb.
but new Doctors. For here we find not only Transubstantiation, but St.
Dominick. He was at this Council; And he and that Doctrine were in one and the
same condition there, in a like obscurity; something perhaps, but not much
taken notice of; but he and that went on from thence to be most conspicuous and
remarkable: They for some time after gave the great noise and talk to the
World; wherever Transubstantiation came, the Fathers of the Inquisition, who
were the Order of Dominicans, soon followed after; and those Persons that were
not subdued under the power of that Doctrine, were sufficiently awed by the
Terror of these Fathers. For whereas the Senses of Men were obstinate and
refractary against their espoused Doctrine; those Men made use of one Sense to
oppose all the rest; for by Rods, and Scourges, and Burnings, they so affected
the Sense of feeling, that this in a most compendious way stilled and silenced
all the others. Thus Transubstantiation grew great; And he that would argue for
it from the Authority of the Lateran Council, does but trifle; it is, and must,
and can be no otherwise prevalent, than by the Authority of these Dominican
Fathers.

The Order of these was confirmed the year after this Lateran Council, and that
by Innocent III. Thus effectually did this Pope do his business, when he made
a new Doctrine, and a new Law, he provided a new Order of Men, and a new Office
to promote it; and it is no wonder if by so doing he brought a new face of
Christianity into the World: Briet. Annals in An. 1216.
This Monsieur Briet says in his Annals in his remark upon the Order of
Dominicans and the Franciscans, An. 1216. Aliam Christianitati faciem induxit.
And I easily believe him, that the Christianity which began to appear, and was
most visible in the World soon after this Lateran Council, was as different
from the Primitive Christianity, as St. Dominick was distant in time from St.
Peter; or as his Rules were different from those in St. Peter's Epistles.

Now I have done with our Author's Allegations from Councils. And here
according to fashion I might be tempted to talk a little of victory, and tell
my Reader what I think I have done. But here I am stopped, for our Author has
possessed himself of this Post: He has given us in the next Paragraph, p. 21.
such a Jargon of words that are designed to speak a victory, but most certainly
show an intolerable vanity, that I cannot imitate him.

For after he had reflected upon his doughty performances; How he had found the
Pope's Supremacy in the Council of Chalcedon: and the Books called Apocrypha,
put into a higher rank than we place them, as he thought by the Council of
Carthage; And the unbloudy Sacrifice decreed by the ninth Council of the
Apostles; And the adoration of Images established in the second Council at
Nice, with the general concurrences of Ancient Fathers; And Transubstantiation
owned and confirmed by 1300 Fathers in the great Lateran Council; and he might
as well have said 13000, and all to like purpose; whilst never a man amongst
them spoke one word, either to prove, or disprove, or approve that, or any
other Doctrine in the Council, as far as it appears. And after that he had
remarked, that all these Doctrines, and I presume he means the Lateran Council
too, were brought into England by Augustine the Monk, which Council was not in
being till more than six hundred years were past after the death of Augustine.

When, I say, our Author had seen that he had done all this, he smiled, and
cockt his Beaver, and admired his Achievements, and then forthwith speaks his
glories in these words, which I will set down here in perpetuam rei memoriam,
that all such Conquerors, as he is, may never want words wherein to express
their glories, or their follies: Thus he says.

Indeed, P. 21.
Fathers, when I had diligently examined this truth, and found it most evident;
beyond the possibility of any just, or reasonable contradiction; I was much
scandalized at the disingenuity of your Writers; who whilst they accuse others
of fallacy, imposture, and impudence, dare advance so great, and demonstrable a
falsehood in matter of fact, that nothing but ignorance can excuse them; so they
expose themselves to the greatest censure of rashness and indiscretion, as
uncharitable, and unjust to those whom they call their Enemies, as also unsafe,
and abusing the credulity of their Friends.

I admired to see these words in this place, and am yet puzzled to think, what
could just now inspire him with all this puffiness; He knew that he had never
read one of these Councils; and that he had transcribed from others, without
skill, or care: and he could not but know that some of his Allegations are most
trite, and common, and answered most sully, and largely, by numberless numbers.
Why then does he seem here thus to admire his Acts, and put down such an
extravagant rant? I cannot but think that the spirit of his old Friends, Nailor
and Muggleton, came in to his assistence at the Writing of this. Perhaps it is
a Flower borrowed from some of that sort of Persons, to adorn and imbellish a
Book. It is here, I am sure, out of its place; altogether groundless, and
senseless; and gives us one Argument more of the mighty powers of Face; and
what great expectances there are from it; I do much believe that our Author
may hope for more success from that one Paragraph, than from all his
Allegations out of Councils.

Our Author in the next Paragraph tells us he designs to be brief, and
therefore laying aside other Controversies, he will insist only upon two, and
they are these.

I. P. 22.
The Authority and Infallibility of the Roman Catholic Church.

II. The Doctrine of Transubstantiation.

The First of these I shall consider, and leave the Second to others, who both
have, and will give full satisfaction, in that Point, if he were but capable of
receiving it. And I presume I have given him more than he can answer in the
Reflections upon the Lateran Council.

I. The Authority and Infallibility of the Roman Catholic Church: P. 21.
This he undertakes to consider how far it may bear, and appear reasonable to
an impartial Reader. These words are not worth the notice, but that they tempt
out a little suspicion; that they are here set for a reserve, in case of
opposition; for if it be said, as most truly it may, that there is not one
plain proof, either of the supreme Authority, or Infallibility of the Roman
Church in all this Discourse; Our Author may reply that he never undertook to
give it: All that he engaged for was appearances, P. 23.
and that he has performed, by using the words often; tumbling and tossing them
as Hay-makers do their mown Grass; one while Authority is uppermost, and soon
after Infallibility; Authority must lead in Infallibility, and Infallibility
must vindicate Authority; but where either of these is to be found, the Man
neither proves, nor knows; and plainly says, that he is not concerned, whether
there be any such thing as Infallibility or no: p. 24. he says; Were there no
Infallibility (as I believe there is) I would still submit my Reason, and
regulate my Conscience, P. 24.
according to the Decrees of the supreme, lawful Ecclesiastical Authority;
This is my belief, pray blame me not. All this is nothing else but appearances;
for neither is the Church of England, nor the Church of Rome concerned in his
belief, or his fancy, or his opinion, for these may be wise, or may be foolish;
may be well, or may be ill grounded. But yet it is admirable to see what great
command he has over his Reason and his Conscience, that he can make them turn
which way he pleases; and if he does but suppose a Supreme lawful Authority to
be in Ebion, or Cerinthus, Nailor, or Muggleton, or the Church of Rome; He can
be a Convert to any of them, to day to this, and to morrow to the quite
contrary; and that with as much reason, and as good conscience, to the one, as
to the other: For which way soever he turns, he may still say, this is my
belief, pray blame me not.

His last Conversion was to the Church of Rome, and he intimates that he
changed upon this belief, that there was a Supreme lawful Ecclesiastical
Authority to be found there: but he has not the least reason to prove it;
though it must be confessed that he has some appearances; which I will
impartially consider in their order.

1. He gives us some Citations from Protestants, Page 22, 23. from Luther one,
and from Melancthon another, (whom he calls the Phoenix of Learning; a fine
word, I wonder from whence he borrowed it) another from Somaisius, or
Salmasius; Another he would give from Grotius; but what it is, he has forgot,
he thinks it is somewhere in his Annotations upon the New Testament. And then,
to make weight, he throws in the Names of Jacob Cartwright, Huss, and Beza. P.
23.
And from hence he argues in these words; These eminent Protestants were men of
great learning; and they had searched, and understood Scripture, and History,
and if my judgment concurs with theirs in this point (as I profess it does)
then have I found that lawful Supreme Authority.

Now these are dangerous words from the mouth of a new Convert; it is well for
him that he is not now in Spain; for if he should make such a declaration
there, That his judgment concurs with the judgment of Luther, Melancthon, Huss,
and Beza, in the Point of the Pope's Supremacy, or the Supremacy of the Church
of Rome; he might perhaps be in danger of the Inquisition. All the World knows
the judgment of those men in this point; and if he were before the Fathers of
the Inquisition, they would not be put off with a small Citation found they
know not where; and perhaps inserted by they know not whom: He had done much
better to have mistrusted his Copy, than to depend upon such an Allegation.

Sure I am, that if he made any use of those men's judgments, or laid any great
stress upon the words, which he cites under their Names, in his search or
presumed discovery of a Supreme Authority of the Church of Rome; he used both
his Reason and his Conscience very hardly.

It is certain that Luther did speak variously of the Pope's Power; sometimes
higher and sometimes lower, as appears to any one that reads either his Works,
or Cassander's Citations from him: And as to Melancthon the Phoenix of
Learning, I am not concerned to search what he wrote to the Cardinal Belay. And
it may be, I am civil in doing it. He was a Wit that once charged it as an
incivility upon his Acquaintance, that he should take so much pains to prove
him a Liar. It is certain that Melancthon in his Loci Communes, where he treats
professedly upon this Subject, declares fully and roundly against all this that
is cited from him: And therefore I presume that his judgment does not concur
with Melancthon's; for if it does, he is no new Convert; for he has found
nothing that can call for a submission of Reason, and Conscience: nothing like
to that Authority and Infallibility of the Roman Catholic Church, which a new
Convert is bound to defend.

But because our Author, in desence of the Authority and Infallibility of the
Roman Church, has given such Citations from Protestants, I Will endeavor to
requite him by one from a very good Roman Catholic; and that is Cassander. He
in his Book, de Officio pii hominis, speaks to this purpose; That there are
some, who because they see yet remaining amongst them not a few things, that
have descended down from Antiquity, or the first Christians, will keep up the
present state of the Church just as it is; though it be corrupt, and foully
stained by abuses, that have crept in by little and little. Nor will they
suffer any thing to be altered, though it may be done agreeable enough to the
Decrees or Canons of the Ancients. -- Pontificem vero Romanum, quem Papam
dicimus, tant um non Deum faciunt: ejusque Autoritatem non modo supra totam
Ecclesiam, sed supra ipsam Scripturam Divinam efferunt, and sententiam ejus
Divinis Oraculis parem, imo infallibilem fidei regulam constituunt: hos non
video cur minus Pseudocatholicos and Papistas appellare possis.
The Roman Bishop, whom we call Pope, they make little less than God. They set
up his Authority not only over the whole Church, but over the holy Scripture
it self; and make his determination equal to the Divine Oracles, and no less
than an infallible rule of faith. I see no cause but that you may give to these
the name of false Catholics and Papists.

Thus said that good man concerning the Sticklers for Roman Authority, and
Infallibility; and that in a time when he contended most earnestly to bring in
peace, and good temper amongst Christians; and had endeavored passionately to
persuade men to lay aside ill Language, and odious Names, such as one Party
threw at another; all which he says were cast up out of Hell: such as these;
Papists, Antichristians, Ministers of Satan; and on the other side, Heretics,
Schismatics, Apostates. Though he heartily wished these Names out of the
World, yet he could be content that two or three of them were always ready to
be thrown in the teeth of such Persons as our Author would seem to be.

This remark I give to show our Author that I do not set down the Sayings and
Opinions of others, without considering first what weight and stress is to be
laid upon them.

For I must consess that it is to me a scandal and matter of offense to find
this Set of Authorities, which our Author uses, in the same order, and in the
same words, in another late Book entitled Pax vobis; this seems to speak that
the Authors of both these transcribed, and never considered what force was in
their Citations. Is this fair dealing with a Man's own Conscience, or with his
Readers? when he is weighing of Religions, and offering motives of
Reconciliation, either to himself, or to others, to act thus supinely? This is
worse than to take a journey to Edinburgh upon the next Hackney, and never
consider whether he be a Jade or no. A journey to Heaven is long, to be sure of
greatest importance; He that takes up a new Religion to carry him thither, had
need use eyes, and ears, and heart, and head too; St. Paul had reason when he
advised us to work out our Salvation with fear and trembling; but all men will
not do this: they are in too much haste.

They that take satisfaction without reason, and in spite of reason change
their Religion, cannot act with that caution which the great Apostle requires.

If I am not much out in my guess (which I must leave to the Reader's judgment,
when he has compared this Set of Citations with those in Pax vobis, Page 70,
71.) we have here one of the most wretched Pleas that ever was used by a
Writer. It is not more than this. I have met with some sayings of Men, whom I
care not for; when or where, or to what end they were spoken, I never
considered; nor yet whether upon second thoughts they did not retract them; my
judgment concurs with them, therefore I have found that lawful Supreme
Authority I searched for; and where this Authority is, there is Infallibility.

That is the first Motive to persuade that the Roman Catholic Church has
Supreme Authority over all, and Infallibility in the exercise of it.

He should now proceed to a second.

But instead of that we have, Page 24, 25, 26, 27. a discourse upon a new
Subject; so far is our Author from making these Doctrines to appear
reasonable, that for so long together he will even let them shift for themselves:
his present business is to talk, and talk he will of Separation, or how the
Church of Rome can be said to have separated either from her self, or from the
Catholic Church, either whole, or part; and where that whole or part remained
from whence the Church of Rome separated? and then again where she remained,
and where she may be found; and here he is urgent and importunate, and will
have an answer, and that from the Bishops themselves; for he comes up closely
to the beards of them, and tells them, In good faith, Fathers, my Salvation is
highly concerned in this question, and I must be satisfied. He prevents them
from giving such and such answers, and swaggers it bravely out in these words.
I Will sooner suffer my self to be knocked down with a true Protestant Flayl, than
with such a Protestant Answer; and at last he adds, from this reasonable and
important request, you shall never beat me whilst I live.

The Man grows warm, and it is well for some, that they are out of his way; who
knows what he may do?

The occasion of all this noise and clamor he gives us, in the 24th Page, in
these words; You had often told me, that She (the Church of Rome) had fallen
from her primitive purity, and separated her self from the one holy Catholic
and Apostolic Church. Answer to Protestant Queries, p. 10. declared also to be
Antichristian; and the true Church latent and invisible, by that famous Napper
to King James, Brocard, Fulk, Sebast. Francus, Hospinian, and many others.

Now what is all this to the Bishops of the Church of England? must they answer
for every thing that has been said by Fulk, and Brocard, and Napper, or as you
call him, that famous Napper? I pray how famous is he? has any of the Bishops
of England cited him these forty years? does any of this Church read him, or
depend upon him? if your studies have been upon such Authors, the Church of
Rome have no great prize of you; and these Motives, as bad as they are, were
good enough to make you a Convert.

But yet there remains one Expression cited out of a little Book, which it may
be few of the Bishops of England ever saw; but yet they must give an account of
it, and all the consequences he can gather from it; for he says, p. 26. his
Salvation is highly concerned in it; And it is a reasonable and important
request.

And must the Bishops of England be accomptable for every little writing, which
they know nothing of? would the Bishops of Rome think it fair, that all the
impertinences of our Author should be charged upon them? certainly no.

But he argues, that if the Church of Rome was once a pure and uncorrupted
Church, she remains so still, for she can neither separate from her self, nor
from the Catholic Church.

Now if this Argument be good, he himself is bound to answer for all the
consequences that can come from a presumed separation, either from it self, or
from the Catholic Church; for we have often proved, and are always ready to
prove that the Church of Rome is not the same, as to purity and incorruption,
which it was. It is changed, it is altered, multitudes of Innovations have
overspread it, and great numbers of Errors by little and little (as Cassander
says) have crept in, and prevailed over it.

But yet for all that, we own and assert that there is a Church of Rome, as
well as a Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch, and that, though this,
as well as they have erred, not only in their living, and manner of
Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith. So speaks the Church of England in
her 19th Article. And if she be a Church, she must be a Member of the Catholic
Church, for every part must be contained in the whole.

None of us doubt but that the Church of Rome receives all the Canonical
Scriptures, that we do, and has the same Creed, and the same Sacraments that we
have: And so she must be a Church. But yet she is corrupt, and foully stained,
by the many additions that have been made to her Faith, to her Sacraments, to
her Worship, to her Government, and to her primitive rule of Faith; and all
this in virtue of an usurped Authority, and vainly pretended Infallibility.

All these things we charge upon Rome, and we think the Charge high enough; and
if our Author could have distinguished betwixt Error and Schism, he might
have spared all his impertinent Queries concerning Separation from her self, or
Separation from the Catholic Church; and where that Catholic Church is to be
found; for all this is but trifling in an over eager pursuit of Consequences
from a possible sense of a word. If Rome has thus erred, she may be said to
have left, and gone from, or be separated from that first, holy, Catholic and
Apostolic Church, without the making of an open Schism, or Schismatical
Separation. For seeing particular Churches are called Catholic, as the
Catholic Church in Smyrna, Eusebius. lib. 4. cap. 15. and the Catholic Church of
Alexandria upon the account of their continuance in the true Faith with the
rest of the Church of God, or from their coherence with that Church, which was
properly and originally called so; upon which account Clemens Alexandrinus,
Stro. 7. joins those two words together, (...), the Ancient and Catholic
Church. So far then as any Church now in being shall depart from the Doctrine
of that Ancient Catholic Church, and profess great and many Errors, and
broach new Doctrines unknown to the Primitive Churches, and lay mighty stresses
upon them, so as to make them necessary for Communion here, and to Salvation
hereafter: Such a Church may be said to depart or separate it self, from that
ancient, one, holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church.

And now our Author may have that satisfaction, which he says he must have,
and I agree with him that his Salvation is highly concerned in it. He would
know where that Catholic Church, from which she (Rome) separated, remained,
and where she may be found; I am sorry he knows it not, but he may easily be
taught that she was, and is in Heaven.

There are all the glorious Company of the Apostles, the goodly fellowship of
the Prophets, the noble Army of Martyrs; There are all the Servants and Saints
of Jesus Christ, who have lived and died in the true faith of him; and thither
all the faithful Members of the true, holy Catholic Church now living, hope
by the grace of Jesus Christ, in the methods of the Gospel, by keeping close to
the Faith that was once delivered to the Saints, in their due times to come,
and be received into that most happy and everlasting Communion. This is my
opinion, and for once I will pray our Author not to blame me for it.

I know he may bring against me Supreme lawful Authority, in the name of Pope
John XXII. who really designed, and heartily endeavored to make the contrary
Doctrine to pass for an Article of Faith; and if he had lived a little longer,
would have declared ex Cathedra, that the Souls of the Saints do not come to
bliss and happiness until the general Resurrection. I beseech him not to
meddle with this; but if he does, I Will promise to defend my Opinion from
Scripture, and Fathers, and Councils, and doubt not by my little Reason
sufficiently to repel him and his Authority too.

But if he can think with me, that the Members of the first Churches, the holy
Apostles and blessed Servants of our Lord, are in bliss and happiness, and is
willing to find them, and be with them; He ought then to think again of the
change of his Religion, and of this account that he has given of the Motives to
it; for if he seriously reflects upon his own Salvation, and is heartily
concerned for it, he will be ashamed, and repent of all his rude and unseemly
treatment of the Reverend Fathers of this Church. It is not huffing and braving
that speaks a religious Mind; it is not saying, In good faith, Fathers, my
Salvation is concerned in it, that speaks a pious and hearty sense of that
great blessing of God. He that with humility and reverence studies the mind and
good pleasure of his Savior, cannot rant; where he is ignorant, despise his
betters; trample upon those whom he calls Reverend Fathers: Such actions may be
agreeable to a Man that has no sense of Salvation. He that has thrown off one
Religion, and forgot to take up another; He that can easily say, and so good
night to Christianity, may do this: But a Convert to any Sect or Party of
Christians (or such as are willing to be reputed Christians) should not do it.
Because such actions speak a Man to be proud and ambitious, and designing upon
this World, and something worse than I am willing to say.

I must stop, only in requital for some Texts of Scripture, which, p. 25. he
advises us to consider: I request him to read these. Rev. 2.5. Remember from
whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works. Ephesians. 4.14. That we
henceforth be no more Children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every
wind of Doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they
lie in wait to deceive. 2 Cor. 2.17. We are not as many, which corrupt the word
of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the fight of God speak we in
Christ. Our Author goes on, p. 27. But I must not follow him in all his
Impertinencies, P. 27.
I shall speak of Augustine the Monk afterward. And shall at present only
teach him one thing, which he there says he does not understand. And that he
gives us in these words. How you should rise a pure Church after you had been
buried so many hundred years in a corrupt Church, I do not easily understand.

Thus he says, but yet certainly he may understand it; for the same way that I
advise him to take, that he may become a good man, was taken by our
Predecessors, and by virtue of that proceeding they ceased to be a corrupt
Church, and became a pure one; and that was by remembering from whence they were
fallen, and by repentance, and by reformation; they saw the Errors which Rome
had taught, and proudly imposed; they were sorry to have been so long abused;
they withdrew themselves from slavery, and knocked off the chains and fetters,
that an unjust Power had laid upon them; they studied and learnt their true
Rites and Liberties, their duties to God, and to their Savior, and to their
Prince; and when they knew these, they practiced them. And so they did their
first works; that which Christ and his Apostles taught, and so became a pure
Church.

This was then done, but such an answer as this will not satisfy our Author;
for he inquires in the next Paragraph by what Authority this could be done, and
would not have us to pretend to derive Authority from the Church of Rome, when
she was in her purity and perfection.

Now this is wonderfully wise, to inquire by what Authority we presume to obey
God, to amend our ways, to throw off Errors, to follow Truth.

Let him be assured, that we shall not pretend to have derived Authority from
Rome, neither in her corruption, nor in her purity to do this. And our Author
in the next Paragraph owns that we need not, in case the one be an Error, and
the other be a Truth. But he adds, we are now seeking for that Authority which
shall declare this Truth, and set forth this Error.

Now this is honestly said, that he is seeking for that Authority. I am sure he
has made no discovery of it as yet. He undertook, page 21, 22. to show that and
the Infallibility of the Church of Rome; and has talked out eight Pages, and has
not given us the least Argument for either of them, now, he says, he is seeking
for it; and he may seek all his days at this rate; for he seeks, just as one
did for the Hare, in the top of the Steeple.

If there were any such Authority and Infallibility as he pretends, it must be
as apparent, and as visible, as the Church it self, there would need no long
seeking for it.

He must be blind, or fool, or mad, that did not see it, or know it.

I rather think that our Author is seeking for Arguments to prove it; and in
this he is unhappy, for he finds none.

But Page 28, 29, 30. he endeavors for one, and that is to this purpose; that
there are Errors and Heresies in the World. He tells us of Socinians, of
Luther, and Calvin, and Beza, and I know not how many more of late days. And
from thence, P. 30.
p. 30. he talks in these words; Fathers, if these instances be not sufficient
to require a Supreme Judge to determine the right Faith, and silence the wrong,
then, and then, and I know not what; but at last, then pray excuse me, if my
reason, and piety, and the reverent notion which I have of a Just God, and a
merciful Savior, totally force my Judgment, and Conscience to dissent from
you in this particular.

Now this is no Argument, that there is such an Authority in the Church,
(either Eastern or Western, Roman or Grecian) but a wheedling Discourse to
persuade weak Persons, that there may be such an one; because in our Author's
Opinion it would be fit or requisite, or proper for God Almighty, in this
method to direct the interests of his Church. And to bring People on to this
belief, here is an audacious and presumptuous intimation, that God would
neither be wise, nor good, in case he did it not.

Here we beg our Author's pardon; we will believe God to be wise, and good,
and merciful, whether he sets up such an Authority or no: He knows what is
fit, and requisite, and proper, much better than such pert confident men. He
permits sins great, and most enormous in the World, though he could as easily
give a stop to them as to Errors and Heresies.

There are Errors amongst Protestants, and there are Errors amongst
Romanists; and if the Temporal Authority did not do more than the Spiritual,
they themselves would complain of many more, than now they do.

There are Errors and Heresies of late days, and there were so from the first
beginnings of Christianity, in all times and places; St. Paul tells of some in
his days, and Ignatius of others, and Irenaeus of others, and those most gross,
and vile, and filthy.

Now if God had made provision of the pretended Authority and Infallibility to
give stop to them; it were most improbable, if not impossible that ever these
should have been.

Their existence therefore is plain argument and demonstration, that there are
no such powerful means set up, and appoionted by God, to prevent, hinder,
stop, or silence them. He has done enough against them, as he has done against
all sins; it is presumption not to acquiesce in his Wisdom, or to challenge
that he must do that which we cannot prove that he has done.

But our Author leaves this, and says he must proceed, P. 30.
p. 30. and that he does, yet not to evidence the Authority and Infallibility
of the Roman Church by better Arguments; but to plead the interest of it, in
general, from the performances of Augustine the Monk.

This is an Argument that pleases him; he had been nibling at it three times
before, p. 18. p. 21. p. 27. There he intimates that this Augustine first
taught the English Nation Christianity; and that he taught them those very
Doctrines as Christian Truths which we at this day oppose: He says, p. 21. That
all the Controverted Points, particularly, and by name, were declared by some
of your selves to have been brought into England by Augustine the Monk above a
thousand years since.

I suppose he means that his Friend the famous Napper, or some of his
Apocalyptical Acquaintance, had declared this. But after all, he comes to treat
more closely upon this Argument, page 30, 31, 32. I shall consider what he
says, and then give a full account of the whole matter. But, before I begin, I
must complain, (for it is a grief) that I have an Adversary so weak, and yet so
consident.

For those two learned Men, their Mr. Cressey, and our Reverend Dean of St.
Paul's have accurately considered and weighed all the particulars of this
Dispute, and made the best advantages of it. But the man knows nothing of their
Writings. Pope Gregory he names, and Bid he names, but gives us not any ground
to think that ever he has read over Bede's History, or consulted Pope Gregory's
Epistles; and both these ought to have been well studied by a Writer upon this
Subject, if he had due regard for Truth, or his own Credit.

1. First, he says, If you tell me a Story of the Abbat of Bangor; I answer,
that the particular ground of it is evidently false and forged. Now Bid is the
man that tells us a Story of the Abbat of Bangor, and the numbers of Monks in
that Abbey. Bid, l. 2. c. 2.
And the Story, as it lies in Bid, gives all the advantage to Protestants that
they can wish, lib. 2. cap. 2. And if there be something added to that Story
from an Ancient Record found and published by Sir Henry Spelman; the skill and
integrity of that excellent Person would persuade an indifferent man not
presently to damn it for a forgery; for he was not likely, either to contrive
one, or to be cheated with one. But be this what it will, the Story that Bid
gives is sufficient for our uses, and that, I hope, he will not say is false or
forged.

2. P. 30.
He says, that the Britains received the Christian Faith in the Apostles days;
but being persecuted by Romans, Picts and Saxons, Religion fled to the
Mountains, and bordering parts of Wales, at the same time the Church of Rome
was no less afflicted by the Heathen Emperors. This is gross ignorance to talk
of Saxons persecuting the Britains, and Religion flying into Wales in the time
of the Heathen Emperors. Did the Man never hear of the name of Constantine,
and of the names of those glorious Christian Emperors that succeeded him in
the East and West for more than two hundred years before the flying into Wales?
I hope he will not call them persecuting Heathen Emperors, who brought the
Empire into the Church.

The famous Council at Nice was celebrated in the Year 325. and the coming of
the Saxons under Hengist into Britain was not till the Year 450, and it was
near a hundred years after that, before the Britains were dispossessed of the
rest of their Country, and forced to secure themselves amongst the Mountains
of Wales.

This our Author might easily have known, if he had read Bid, but he knew it
not; therefore he adds, No wonder if in these days and circumstances there was
but little correspondence between Rome and Wales.

This now is worse and worse; what! a little correspondence between Rome and
Britain, when Constantius was in Britain, and Constantine, and Theodosius, and
Maximus, and the most of the chief Roman Commanders, in their distinct times.
What! little correspondence between them; though three of the British Bishops
were at the Council of Arles; and as many very probably at Nice; and as many
certainly at the Council of Ariminum; and of Sardica. Did this Man never hear
of the names of Pelagius, and Coelestius; or of Palladius, and Patricius, and
hundreds of others who came from Rome to Britain, or went from Britain to Rome
in all this long tract of time?

I would be willing to think that I mistake a little, rather than judge that he
mistakes so grossly.

But he will not allow it, for he will have all the World to see how ignorant
he is: He adds to this these words; But when the Church (brought from her
subterraneous refuges, and set upon a Hill) began to enlarge her self, P. 31.
and propagate the Gospel, Gregory the Great sent Augustine the Monk into
England to see how matters went there in this long interval of silence.

Certainly he does think that Gregory the Great was the first Roman Bishop that
ever saw good days; and that all his Predecessors were under the persecuting
Heathen Emperors; for now he says that the Church was brought from her
subterraneous refuges, and now she was set upon the Hill, and now began to
enlarge her self. I wonder where he learnt this, I hope it was from his Friend
the famous Napper. What is become of two and thirty Bishops of Rome, so many
there were between Sylvester (who is said to have baptized the Emperor
Constantine) and this Gregory the Great, did they all sleep? did they do
nothing for the Church, that she must be said now to enlarge her self? There
was near three hundred years past from Constantine's possession of the Empire,
to this mission of Augustine the Monk; and was the Church all that time in
subterraneous refuges?

Where were these subterraneous refuges, from whence the Church came? and where
was the Hill, upon which the Church was set, in this Gregory's days? I know
that John of Constantinople was then most ambitious, and endeavored to mount
up his Seat to higher power and dignity, than that of Rome it self. He
challenged all the proud Titles that the Popes afterward usurpt; and designed
to set his Church upon the Hill. But Gregory the First wrote against him, and
charged him with pride and arrogance; and said plainly, that whatever Bishop
(whether Roman or Constantinopolitan) should assume those Titles, he would be
Antichristian, or at least the Forerunner of Antichrist. It is certain that
Gregory the Great was content to keep things as he found them; he did not set
the Church upon a Hill, or enlarge its power. The Romanists can scarce pardon
him for the great submission and deference which he yielded to the Emperor,
and the large expressions which he used in his Contest against John of
Constantinople; for the Protestants strongly argue from them against the
pretenses of the Popes themselves.

But our Author adds, that Gregory sent Augustine the Monk into England to see
how matters went here in this long interval of silence.

He seems to think that Augustine came as a Spy, or to make a discovery of an
unknown Land; but in this he is like himself, still mistaken.

For Gregory knew how matters went here; He knew that Bertha, Queen to King
Ethelbert, was a Christian; and that Luidhardus, Bishop of Senlis, was her
Chaplain; and that he performed to her, and her Attendants, all Christian
Offices in the Church of St. Martin's, Bid, lib. 1. cap. 26.
near Canterbury, which was formerly built by the Romans.

And Gregory himself says in a Letter, which he sent by this Augustine to the
King of France, and was delivered by him in his passage hither, That the
English Nation were desirous to become Christians. His words are these;

Pervenit ad nos, Greg. Epist. lib. 5. Ep. 58.
Anglorum gentem ad fidem Christianam desideranter velle converti, sed
Sacerdotes vestros e vicino negligere, and desideria eorum cessare sua
adhortatione succendere. Ob hoc igitur Augustinum Servum Dei praesentium
portitorem, cujus zelus and studium been nobis est cognitum, cum aliis servis
Dei praevidimus illuc dirigendum. Quibus etiam injunximus, ut aliquos secum e
vicino debeant Presbyteros ducere, cum quibus eorum possint mentes agnoscere,
and voluntatem admonitione sua, quantum Deus donaverit adjuvare; and to the
same purpose he writes in the next Epistle.

If our Author had seen this, Greg. Ep. 59.
he would not have said that Gregory sent Augustine to see how matters went
here in this long interval of silence.

But he goes on, and tells us, that the Britains knew him not (that is
Augustine) until he had confirmed his Commission by Miracles.

Now what had he to do with them, or they with him? his Commission was to
convert the Saxons, or the English from their Paganism to Christianity, as
Gregory says in the forementioned Epistle, Bid, lib. 1. cap. 23.
and Bid in these words. Misit Servum Dei Augustinum, and alios complures
praedicare Verbum Dei genti Anglorum. Bid calls him Anglorum Apostolus, to
them he was sent, to them he came; and he had more work to do amongst them
than he was able to perform: The Britains were not in the least concerned in
his Commission; for they were Christians, and very good Christians, according
to our Author's account. For he tells us, that the great Errors, which
Augustine found among them, were chiefly two; Their Asiatick Error, concerning
the keeping of Easter; and dissent from the Roman Church in the administering of
Baptism.

As to the first of these, their Asiatick Error, about keeping of Easter: The
Britains observed the Rule which they had received with their Christianity; and
they received that, as our Author says, in the days of the Apostles. The
Asiaticks received the same Rule, and the famous Martyr Polycarp defended it
stoutly as an Apostolical Tradition; a whole Council under Polycrates, in the
Year 197. declared it to be the Rule of St. John, taught and practiced by him.
Upon this account, if we suppose it an Error, it can be no great one. For
there is no Traditional Doctrine (either in Rome, or any other Church) which
solely stands upon the credit of Tradition, and has no support from Scripture,
that can be better evidenced to come from an Apostle, and with the first
Christianity, than this Tradition which the Britains, Scots, Asiaticks, Greeks,
alleged in very early times to have received in one and the same way. For if
this be so great an Error, though it be so well attested, and so strongly
urged to be an Apostolical Tradition; what security can we have for the truth
of any other Tradition whatsoever?

The great St. Augustine shows us in his Epistle Casulano, S. August. Ep. 86.
that the name of St. Peter can give no more Authority to a Tradition, than the
name of St. John; nor has any Tradition more grounds of credit, because it
comes to us by the way of Rome, than if it came by the way of Ephesus; the
Eastern Church is as creditable a Conveyancer of Tradition, as the Western.
Therefore if the Britains must be accused of any great error for following of
this Tradition, the Roman Church must be highly condemned for requiring the
observance of so many things, by virtue of Tradition, when they have not the
least appearance of such Arguments, as the Britains had, to prove their
Traditions Apostolical. The Britains kept close to their first Rule, never in
the least varied from it. The Roman Church often changed and altered; and that
before this Augustine the Monk's days, as the Learned Dean of St. Paul's has
accurately shown in his Discourse against Mr. Cressey. And when those of the
Roman Communion argued against the Asiaticks, and Britains, they could not
disprove the Tradition, or show that this practice was an Innovation; but they
alleged Reasons, and external Arguments, to show the inconveniency of it, from
the mischiefs that might come by such a compliance with the Jews. Thus the
Tables were changed, Romanists were for Reason against Tradition; and so they
ever will be, when it is for their Interest.

2. The second Error charged upon the Britains, is dissent from the Church of
Rome in the administering of Baptism. Now this, I suppose, is put in to make
weight in the Accusation: for though Bid has those words, yet he tells not
wherein their practice differed from the Romans, nor yet wherein they were to
be blamed; and has not one word in all his History besides, wherein he blames
either the Britains, or the Irish, whom he calls (in the language of those
times) Scots, for any error in the administration of Baptism. He says, lib. 2.
cap. 4. of the Scots that they had the same ways and methods that the Britains
had, Bid, lib. 2. cap. 4.
similem vitam ac professionem egisse; and there having been, according to
Bid, several Disputes between the Romanists, and the Scots, in lesser matters;
had this been their fault, this would have been charged too upon them.

Our Author adds, P. 31.
Although in some other matters they differed from the Church of Rome, yet
Augustine promised to tolerate them, provided they would rectify these, which
the British Bishops consented to.

This is the worst Passage in all our Author's Book: for it is manifestly
false, point blank against Bede's words, who expressly says, that they would not
consent; and then in the manner of citing the Passage, there is that shuffling
and juggle, that plainly shows he designed falsehood. Bid, lib. 2. cap. 2.
The words in Bid are these; Si in tribus his mihi obtemperare vultis, ut
Pascha suo tempore celebretis, ut ministerium Baptizandi, quo Deo renascimur,
juxta morem Romanae sanctae Ecclesiae, and Apostolicae Ecclesiae compleatis; ut
genti Anglorum una nobiscum praedicetis verbum Domini, caetera quae agitis,
quamvis moribus nostris contraria aequanimiter cuncta tolerabimus. At illi
nihil horum se facturos, neque illum pro Archiepiscopo habituros esse
respondebant. There cannot be a more plain denial than this. How then comes our
Author to say that they consented; The truth is, he seems resolved to say it,
true, or false, and therefore he leaves the last words, wherein Bid declares
the Britains dissent; Bid, lib. 2. cap. 2. P. 31.
and adds to them these. Cum. Britones confitentur intellexisse se veram esse
viam justitiae, quam praedicaret Augustinus; Bid, lib. 2. cap. 2. And from
thence would infer, that the Britains did consent. But these words belong to
another matter; they are part of Bede's Narration of the first meeting that
Augustine had with the Britains; then it seems Augustine did a Miracle, and the
Britains had a great sense of it, and did confess that Augustine's way was the
right way: But yet for all this stound, and hasty words, they immediately
recollected themselves, and in the next moment tell him, as Bede says; Bid,
lib. 2. cap. 2.
Non se posse, absque suorum consensu, ac licentia, priscis abdicare moribus.
That without the leave and consent of their own Clergy and Laity, or a Synod,
(which was upon it forthwith called) they could not depart from their ancient
Customs.

Thus we see that the Britains who confessed, as our Author says, yet would
not consent, till they had the Opinion, and Judgment of a Synod: and when
Augustine proposed his Matters to the Synod, they flatly denied either to
receive his Doctrine, or himself as their Archbishop. So then it is plainly
false, that the Britains consented. But yet our Author puts down that
Confession first in English, and after another quite different discourse he
puts it down in Latin; and that on purpose to prove a consent. Now this must
be designed to cheat, and cousen some; I hope he meant it for the Roman
Catholics; I do not fear that any Protestant can be gulled by such a slight.

But from this Discourse our Author observes that it may be inferred that
Augustine, and the Britains agreed in Substantials: this may be allowed, if he
means only those things which are necessarily to be held by every one that is
a Member of the true, Catholic, Apostolic Church. They agreed in the same
Savior, in the same Scriptures, in the same Creeds, and in all the Doctrine
that was maintained and declared in the first four General Councils.

But this will not suffice, for our Author imagines that they agreed in all
the Doctrines which the Church of Rome at this day endeavors to impose upon
others. In order to this, page 32. he discourses: After all this, can we
believe that the Britains, who earnestly contradicted Augustine in these
smaller matters, and were so tenacious of their own Customs, would have
silently received so many, and incomparably greater points of Faith, had they
in like manner disagreed from him therein? credat Judaeus Apella.

Here our Author is much to be blamed, because he will not permit us to give
him civil Language; he does not only betray his ignorance, but what is much
worse; in this Paragraph he challenges to have skill in Bid, and Bid is the
man that contradicts him in every thing he says. Forbid tells us, that the
Britains neither received greater points of Faith, nor lesser, from Augustine
the Monk, nor his Companions. But for more than one hundred years after
Augustine's arrival, they esteemed all his teachings to be vain, and trifling,
and little better than Paganism. He concluded his History in the Year 725. as
appears, lib. 5. cap. 24. and he himself tells us in his Epitome, that
Augustine came into England in the Year 597.

Yet he says, Lib. 2. cap. 20.
Cum usque hodie moris sit Britonum, Fidem Religionemque Anglorum pro nihilo
habere; neque in aliquo eis magis communicare, quam Paganis. That the Britains,
according to their usual way, had no esteem at all for the Faith and Religion
of the English; and that they would no more communicate with them, than with
the Pagans.

And Bid does not only say that the Britains had so mean an opinion of the
Romans, Lib. 2. cap. 4.
and their Disciples; but likewise that the Scots (or Irish) had the same. For
where he gives us part of the Letter that Laurentius, Mellitus, and Justus sent
to the Scots; He says, that when they had tried the Britains, they thought the
Scots might be better. Cognoscentes Brittones, Scottos meliores putavimus, but
yet they found both alike. For Dagamus their Bishop would neither eat at the
same Table, nor in the same House with them. Dagamus Episcopus ad nos veniens
non solum cibum nobiscum, sed nec in eodem Hospitio, quo vescebamur, sumere
voluit.

In the same page he says that Laurentius, and the rest, wrote to the Britains
too; Sed quantum haec agendo profecerit adhuc praesentia tempora declarant.
That is, that the present opposition, which the Britains made against the
Romanists in Bede's days, sufficiently shows that Laurentius his Letter had
no effect upon them: and that is the same thing which we had before, usque
hodie, that from Augustine the Monk down to Bede's days, the Britains had no
regard for the Romans teaching of Faith, or Religion, so far as it differed
from their own.

From these two Passages Henry of Huntingdon made the remark which he has, lib.
3. Hist. Nec Britannos, Henr. Huntingd. Hist. lib. 3.
nec Scotos velle communicare cum Anglis, and eorum Episcopo sancto Augustino,
magis quam Paganis.

This is sufficient to show our Author's presumption in alleging Bid to
patronize his vain Opinations concerning the Britains; if we give credit to
him, the Britains did not receive, either so many, or so great points of Faith
from Augustine the Monk; for they received none at all. And therefore his
Consequence which he draws from thence, is like his Premises, good for naught.
That is this; That the Doctrines (these two Points excepted, their Asiatick
Error, and the difference about Baptism) which Augustine taught the Saxons,
had been delivered to the Britains from the Apostles.

For seeing we have an acknowledged difference in these two Points in
Augustin's days, and other differences (as I shall show) brake out afterward,
and we find no manner of agreement between Augustine and the Britains; and no
communication between his Followers and them for an hundred years after, but an
extreme aversion and abhorrence of them, and their ways; he can no more argue
for the truth of Augustine's Doctrines from the consent of the Britains, than
he may for the truth of all the Doctrines which the present Church of Rome
teaches, from the consent of the present Church of England; we oppose them, and
so did they; we, and they too, reject their Novelties, their unjust
Usurpations, their unreasonable Impositions; And though the terms of Communion
which they would lay upon us, are much harder than those which Augustine
offered to the Britains, yet we thank God our charity continues toward them;
we call them Christians, and treat them as Christians, (which the old Britains
would not do) and with meekness and humility we endeavor to show them their
Errors.

This is enough to the Case of Augustine, and of Bede's Relation of it. And
enough to the First Part of this Author.

July 26. 1687. Sir, I am Yours.

A brief Account of Augustine, and the Conversion of the English, taken out of
Bid 's Ecclesiastical History.
AVgustine after he had been received graciously by King Ethelbert, knew not
what he had to do. He was sent to preach plain Christianity to those that were
willing to learn it: But he had a mind to do something else, Bid, lib. 1.
cap. 27.
and therefore soon sent to Pope Gregory for his resolution of certain
Questions; most of which our modern Historians censure as Legal and Levitical;
and think them all, excepting three, to be of little use. Two of these are
remarkable, the first concerning his own power, which he would have extended
not only over Britain, but to France; in this latter he was repressed, and
told that the Pope could not, nor ought to grant it, because his Predecessors
had before settled it on the Bishop of Arles; yet over the Bishops of Britain he
gives him all the power which he could wish. Omnes Episcopos Britanniarum tuae
fraternitati committimus, Bid, lib. 1. cap 27. Resp. 9.
ut indocti doceantur, infirmi persuasione roborentur, perversi autoritate
corrigantur. Now it was unreasonable in Augustine to ask this, and injustice in
Gregory to grant it: For both must needs know, that this was an invasion of the
Rights of Bishops against the Canons of the Church; against the Sixth of the
Nicene Council, and the Eighth of the Ephesine, which says expressly, that if
the Rites of Churches are taken away, and that by any Patriarch whatsoever,
that Fact should be null and invalid. Barnesius, Cath-Rom. Pacif. p. 60.
This (Father Barn says) gave just cause and reason to the British Bishops to
withstand Austin; quia videbatur Augustinus (...) agere cum iis, cogendo eos ut
reciperent eum pro Archiepiscopo, and mandatis exterorum se subderent. Cum
antiqui mores Ecclesiae suae postularent, ut omnia inter se Synodice agerent,
tum pro Episcoporum ordinationibus, tum pro aliis negotiis Ecclesiasticis.

The second considerable Query of Augustine was concerning Rituals, Bid, lib.
1. cap. 27. Inter. 3.
Forms of Worship, Missals or Liturgies; in this he proposed how it comes to
pass, seeing the Faith is the same everywhere, that there is a difference in
Missals, one form or usage in Rome, and another in France. Now to this, the
Pope gave him a wise and good answer, if he made use of it; That he should
gather from every place, whatever he found best, and most pleasing to Almighty
God; not having respect to places, but to things; and if the Forms and Usages
of France were better than those of Rome, he might freely take them, without
giving any partial respect to the place where he had been bred; Bid, lib. 1.
cap. 27. in Resp. 3.
Non enim pro locis res, sed pro bonis rebus, loca sunt amanda. This was a most
worthy direction of Gregory the Great; and if Augustine had followed it, no
doubt his Rules and Orders had been venerable and good: But it is more probable
he did it not. Because he was over busy in faulting the British Churches; He
charges them with some things as intolerable; and other things, which he
intimates to be many, as contrary to Roman Usages. Caetera quae agitis, quamvis
moribus nostris contraria equanimiter cuncta tolerabimus. Bid, lib. 2. cap. 2.
Now the British and French Churches, as they had the same Faith, so they had
much the same Rituals, Missals and Liturgies. They had frequent Communications
one with another; and in difficulties about Religion, they were most friendly,
and ready to give mutual aids and assistances; Three British Bishops were at
the Council at Arles in France; Bid, lib. 1. cap. 17.
and two French Bishops, St. German, and St. Lupus, by order of a Council, at
the request of the Britains, came into Britain to stop the Pelagian Heresy, to
reform Errors, and compose Differences there. Agilbertus who was afterward
Bishop of Paris, came from France into Ireland, and staid a considerable time
there to study Divinity, and improve his skill in the Holy Scriptures. Bid,
lib. 3. cap. 7.
Agilbertus natione Gallus legendarum gratia Scripturarum in Hybernia non parvo
tempore demoratus; And others went from Britain into France upon the same
account.

From hence we may easily presume, that the British, Irish and French Churches
had in most things the same Rules and Orders amongst them; St. Jerome says,
Epist. 58. Jerome, Ep. 58.
Galliae and Britanniae Ecclesiae unum Christum, unam observant regulam Fidei.
Upon this account it seems not unlikely, that Augustine might think he had as
many exceptions against the French Churches, as against the British. As he
faults the ways and methods of the Britains, because they were different from
the Customs of the Romans, moribus nostris contraria. So he offers it to the
Pope, Bid, lib. 2. cap. 2.
as a thing worthy of consideration, that the French Missals were not the same
with the Romish.

In both cases he seems to govern himself by one and the same reason, and that
is this; that the Forms, Vsages and Missals of Rome were the best, and
therefore all other Churches ought to be brought into the same methods with
that. From hence it appears that there was a difference amongst the Romans
themselves. Pope Gregory was of one mind, and Augustine of another. Pope
Gregory thought there were pious and useful Institutions in other Places, as
well as at Rome; some as good, and some better. And therefore he gave advice to
Augustine to pick and choose in every Country whatever he thought to be best,
or most suitable to the People, whom he should convert to the Christian Faith.
Ex singulis ergo quibusque Ecclesiis, quae pia, quae Religiosa, Bid, lib. 1.
cap. 27.
quae recta sunt elige, and haec quasi in fasciculum collecta, apud Anglorum
mentes in consuetudinem depone. Whatever you find in any Church wheresoever,
that is pious, religious and right, take it, and teach it to the English, and
bring it into use and custom amongst them. Herein he showed himself to be
great, and wise, as well as Christian; but Augustine was altogether Roman, he
would take nothing, and scarcely allow of any thing, that he himself had not
been used to at Rome. He acted quite contrary to the Pope's directions. He gave
himself up to that fondness and partiality, which Gregory above all things
hated. He was for Places, and not for Things; and instead of teaching the plain
Christianity to Saxons, he busied himself to bring the Fashions of Rome into
Wales: hereby he lost the advantages which the prudence of Gregory had laid out
for him. He exasperated and disgusted both the British, and Scottish (or Irish
Churches) and had but small success amongst the English; for the Christianity
he planted amongst them was but short lived. As soon as Ethelbert was dead,
Augustine's new Converts turned Renegadoes to their old Paganism; his
Companions, Mellitus and Justus, Bid, lib. 2. cap. 5.
were forced to fly; and Laurentius (who miraculously was stopped, as Bede
says) began a new work, and with much pains and labor, after the return of
Mellitus and Justus, effected but little.

Paulinus, and other Missionaries, came after, and did something. But if we
believe Bid, the Saxons were as much obliged for their Conversion to the
Scots, and to the French, as to the Romans; He commends the Labors of Columba,
of Aidan, of Ced, and Ceadda, and Finan, and Colman, and Trumhere, and
Agilbertus, and Felix, as highly as any of the Romans. By the unwearied labors
of these Men, Christianity found a resurrection, and after death was restored
to life again; it lived and flourished, and spread it self to most parts of
this Island.

Here it must be observed, that in the times of these Men, Christianity had one
advantage which it wanted before; and that is this. That a Man of a quite
different temper from Augustine was then Archbishop of Canterbury: For
Honorius, who was third Successor to Augustine, did as industriously avoid all
needless Contests, as Augustine did precipitately run upon them. He seems to be
a Man entirely of Gregory's spirit and temper; He was for goodness, and piety,
and sincere Christianity, and would not stand upon Rituals, and Vsages of Rome;
upon nicety and punctilio; so as for their sakes to give disturbance to such as
were faithful in teaching plain Christian Doctrines. That which Augustine
accounted intolerable, and did what he could to extirpate, and must be thought
to be too much imbittered against the Professors of it, if he outlived the
slaughter of the Monks of Bangor, Honorius could tolerate; for he kept
communion and fair correspondence with Aidan and the Scots, though they
continued in the Asiatick Error, as our Author calls it; or observed their
Easter Feast at a different time from what the Romans would have them to keep
it; and that according to the same rule which Augustine so highly faulted in
the British Church, Bid tells us. Lib. 3. cap. 25.


Haec dissonantia Paschalis vivente Aidano patienter ab omnibus tolerabatur;
quia etsi Pascha contra morem eorum, qui ipsum miserant, facere non potuit:
opera tamen fidei, pietatis, and dilectionis juxta morem omnibus Sanctis
consuetum diligenter exequi curavit; unde ab omnibus, etiam his qui de Pascha
aliter sentiebant, merito diligebatur, nec solum a mediocribus verum ab ipsis
quoque Episcopis, Honorio Cantuariorum, and Felice Orientalium Anglorum,
venerationi habitus est.

By this it appears, that Honorius, and Felix too, the Bishop of the East
Angles, were Men of a different temper from Augustine, of a higher and more
enlarged Spirit; they looked upon Christianity as a thing much different, and
infinitely preferable before Roman Usages, Customs and Determinations.

Whilst this Spirit governed, much was done in the propagation of Christianity
amongst the Saxons, by Aidan, Finan, and Colman, all Scots, and successively
Bishops of Lindisfarn. Finan ordained Diuma Bishop of the Mercians, Bid, lib.
3. cap. 21.
and Ced Bishop of the East Saxons, by whose Labors they received again the
Christian Faith, which they had cast off ever since the Expulsion of Mellitus,
Bid, lib. 3. cap. 22.
that is for near fifty years.

And he went on with great success in his Diocese, raising up Churches, and
ordaining Priests and Deacons; majore auctoritate inceptum opus explens. Fecit
per loca Ecclesias, Presbyteros and Diaconos ordinavit, Bid, ut prius.
qui sibi in verbo fidei, and ministerio baptizandi adjuvarent.

And Bid tells us, that at the death of Deusdedit, Archbishop of Canterbury,
there was in all Britain but one Bishop ordained by the Romans; which he calls
Canonically ordained, and that was Wini; and that he was so little concerned
for Augustine's opinion in the Paschal Controversy, that he joined to himself
two British Bishops in the Ordination of Ceadda, Bid, lib. 3. cap. 28.
to be Archbishop of York. Wini assumptis in societatem Ordinationis, duobus de
Britonum gente Episcopis, qui Dominicum Paschae diem secus morem Canonicum
celebrant. Non enim erat tunc ullus, excepto illo Wini in tota Britannia
Canonice Ordinatus.

Thus things went on easily, with great success, and great delight; the Gospel
was preached among the Saxons by these Scots, till Wilfrid his return from
Rome; He it seems was a sprightfull Young Man, and desirous to raise himself to
some greater eminency than others, upon that account he traveled abroad to
France, and Rome: and made it his business to inform himself of the Usages and
Practices that were there. At Rome he studied the Controversy about Easter,
and there under Boniface he learnt the new Circle, and many other things that
concerned Ecclesiastical Discipline, as Bede says. Bid, lib. 5. cap. 20.
Computum Paschae rationabilem, and alia multa, quae in patria nequiverat,
Ecclesiasticis Disciplinis accommoda, eodem Magistro tradente percepit; at his
return from thence, he stayed in France with Dalsinus, Bishop of Lions; and
there had his Crown shaven, Ab eo attonsus est, or as it is, Bid, lib. 5. cap.
20.
lib. 3.25. a quo Tonsurae Ecclesiasticae coronam susceperat; and was designed
to be the Bishop's Heir; and in tanto habitus amore, ut haeredem sibi illum
facere cogitaret. So Bid says, though we know not how he comes to join those
two together, unless he thought that Dalsinus, and Wilfrid too had a great deal
more of designs upon the World, than the Scottish Bishops and Monks had.

He returns home, and young Alchfrid was committed to his tuition; him he
entertains with Discourses about Rome, and France, about Ecclesiastical
Discipline, Bid, lib. 3. cap. 25.
Easter and Tonsure; and gains so far upon his Pupil, that he thought Wilfrid's
skill in Ecclesiastical Affairs infinitely beyond that of the Scots. Hujus
Doctrinam omnibus Scotorum traditionibus jure praeferendam sciebat. Bid, ut
prius.
And now began the old Question to stir again, Bid says; Defuncto Finano, cum
Colmannus in Episcopatu succederet, and ipse missus a Scotia, Gravior de
observatione Paschae, necnon and de aliis Ecclesiasticae vitae disciplinis,
controversia nata est. Colman, Bishop of Lindisfarn, was for keeping up the
Customs of his Ancestors, and Wilfrid was for bringing in the Vsages of Rome.

The particular matters in question were about Easter and Tonsure, or the time
when that Feast was to be kept, and the right way of shaving Priests Crowns.
Bid, lib. 3. cap. 25.
Mota ergo questione de Pascha vel Tonsura, vel aliis rebus Ecclesiasticis.
Upon these a Synod was called, King Oswi and his Son Alfrid was there, and the
King made a Speech at first, wherein he talks, as if he thought the most
important Affairs of Christian Religion were then to be determined; quod
oporteret eos qui uni Deo servirent, unam vivendi regulam tenere, nec
discrepare in celebratione Sacramentorum Caelestium; Bid, ut prius.
That they who served the same God, should have the same rule of living, and
have no difference in the use of the Heavenly Sacraments.

In this Synod Colman and Wilfrid disputed in the behalf of their several ways
of calculating the time of Easter; the one alleging a Tradition from St. John,
and the other from St. Peter: And King Oswi at last, who little understood the
force of either Argument, determined for Wilfrid's Opinion; and that because he
would not lose the favor of St. Peter: for seeing both the Disputants agreed
that Christ had said unto St. Peter; I will give unto thee the Keys of the
Kingdom of Heaven; The King said, If he be the Doorkeeper, I will not offend
him, lest there be none to open when I come there; so Bid tells us in the end
of the 25th Chapter, Lib. 3.

Immediately after this, Colman finding himself and his Doctrine in contempt,
leaves his Bishopric, and goes over into Ireland, tractaturus cum suis, quid
de his facere debebat; and there went along with him all such as would not
receive this new Reform in the Points of Easter and Tonsure. Assumptis his qui
sequi voluerunt, Bid, lib 3. cap. 26.
id est qui Pascha Catholicum, and Tonsuram coronae (Nam and de hoc quaestio
non minima erat) recipere nolebant. And a very little while after, all the rest
of the Scots throughout all England, either submitted to the new Orders, or
returned to their own Country: ut Scotti omnes, Bid, lib. 3. cap. 28.
qui inter Anglos morabantur, aut his manus darent, aut redirent in patriam.

Here the English Christians suffered a great loss, who of a-suddain were
deprived of the Ministeries of so many excellent Persons, (who had taught them,
converted them, baptized them, and often communicated the Holy Sacrament to them)
and that only for the sake of two Usages brought from Rome; the one of which
is certainly impertinent, and such as deserves not in the least to be
contested; and the other was thought tolerable by Honorius and Felix, and the
best of those that were busied in the conversion of the English. It is
deplorable to think, that for the sake of these, the English Christians should
lose their Teachers; who, if we believe Bede's account, were most extraordinary
Persons, of great piety, severe virtue, and most sincere goodness. Bid, lib 3.
cap. 26.
Bid says: Quantae parcimoniae, cujusque continentiae fuerit ipse (Colmannus)
cum Praedecessoribus suis, testabatur etiam locus ille, quem regebat; ubi
abeuntibus eis excepta Ecclesia paucissimae domus repertae sunt, etc. They were
Men of great self-denial, they had a good Church for the service of God, but
very few Houses for themselves, and those only such, as necessity of living
did require; they had no money or stock but in Beasts: what money the rich gave
unto them, they presently distributed to the poor; and they had no need of any,
for the great ones, who came to their Church, came thither for no other cause
but to say their Prayers, and to hear the Word of God; and if the King himself
came thither, he said his Prayers, and away he went; or if he wanted a
refection, he and his Attendants were content to partake of the daily Provision
for the fraternity of their House. The whole care of these Teachers was to
serve God, and not the World; to provide for the Heart, and not for the Belly:
from whence it came to pass, that Religion was then in great veneration;
wherever a Clerk or a Monk came, he was received by the People as the Servant
of God. If they saw him on the road, they ran to him, and rejoiced in the
humblest posture to receive his blessing. They attended to his Instructions,
and Exhortations; and every Lord's Day they came in crowds, either to the
Church, or to their Monastery, to learn the Word of God. If a Priest came by
chance into a Village, the People gathered together, and took care that they
might hear the Word of Life from him: For upon no other account did the Priests
or. Clerks go abroad, but to preach, to baptize, to visit the Sick, and to take
care of Souls; and so far were they from designs of worldly greatness, that
they would not accept of Estates, and Lands, to build Monasteries upon them,
where they were not constrained by more than ordinary instance from the Secular
Powers.

This account Bid, no Friend to them, but to the adverse Party, gives of them;
and therefore it must be presumed to be true. Those Scots (or Irish) then were
most admirable Persons, great Examples of Virtue and Piety, a blessing of God,
and an honor to a Nation. But such was the weakness, or the humor of those
times, that all these were to be thrown out, to make way for the reception of a
few Romish Usages. Wilfrid had the ascendant, Bid, lib. 5. cap. 20.
and he would have it so. And good St. Chad amongst the rest was forced to
leave the Bishopric of York, that Wilfrid, by virtue of the Power and
Authority of that Seat, might be better enabled to carry on his Reformation
according to his new Designs and Projects.

This Story deserves some Remarks and Considerations; and if the present
Romanists would reflect upon it, they will find cause to cease their boasts of
the performances of their Predecessors in the conversion of the English Nation.

I will add one thing, that as Augustine had no great success in his business,
so neither had Wilfrid in his; For he was twice thrown out of his Bishopric;
and twice went to Rome to make Complaints; and though he was a Man of Parts,
and had a zeal for that which he thought good, yet the effects of his
tumultuousness followed him; and he that gave troubles to others, had troubles
himself.

One Passage farther there is in Bid that must not be omitted, that is,
concerning Theodore, his election to be Archbishop of Canterbury, and his
mission hither; it seems Egbert, King of Kent, and Oswi, King of the
North-Humbrians, had agreed, after the death of Deusdedit, to send Wighart to
Rome to be consecrated there; and that some considerable time after the
Bishopric had been void. Bid, lib. 4. cap. 1.
Cessante non pauco tempore Episcopatu: Wighart dyed of the Plague at Rome.
Vitalian, then Pope, considers whom to send over in his stead; he thought first
of one Adrian, who refused the Archbishopric, and commended one Andrew, who
likewise refused; then Theodore was thought of, and approved, yet Theodore
could not be consecrated till he had received a new Tonsure. Bid says he was
born at Tharsus in Cilicia, and had the Tonsure of St. Paul, after the manner
of the Orientals; Habuerat Tonsuram more Orientalium Sancti Pauli Apostoli. And
therefore he was stayed at Rome (though the English Nation much wanted their
Archbishop) four months, till his Hair was grown, that the Crown of St. Peter
might be rightly shorn on his Head, quatuor expectavit menses, donec illi coma
cresceret; quo in coronam tonderi posset. It seems the same temper that Wilfrid
brought into England was then regnant at Rome; and a great stress was laid upon
the right Cut, and wonderfully accurate they were in distinguishing the Tonsure
of St. Peter from that of St. Paul, and of Simon Magus, as Bede shows. And Mr.
Cressey in his Church History, Bid, lib. 5. cap. 22. Cressy 's Hist. lib. 16.
cap. 18. n. 17.
after a punctual relation of the state of this worthy Controversy, expressly
says, That the Popes of this age took care, that St. Peter 's Tonsure should
only be received in Britain.

This speaks how vain and trifling the Romans then were; and it is amazing to
compare the thoughts and designs of these, with the account that Bid gives of
those excellent Scots, who were forced to leave England for their sakes.

But Theodore, as he had been used himself, so he was forced to treat others;
his first great business was to secure the two Points of Easter and Tonsure,
and he durst not but do it; for he had a Spy over him, to watch his motions;
and to urge him to keep close to the present humor of Rome. Bid tells us that
Adrian came over with him, ut ei Doctrinae Cooperator existens diligenter
attenderet, Bid, lib. 4. cap. 1.
ne quid ille contrarium veritati fidei, Graecorum more, in Ecclesiam cui
praeesset introduceret. Here we may observe the vast difference between the
Counsels and Designments of Gregory the Great, and those of Pope Vitalian.
Gregory encourages and exhorts his Missionary Augustine, to gather and take up
in every Country any Usage, or Practice, or Mode, or Form, that is pious, and
religious, and to the glory of God; and to have no regard for Places, but
Things; no more for the Usages of Rome, than for those of France. But Vitalian
ties his Missionary Theodore to keep close to all the ways and methods of Rome.
He would have him show Rome in every thing he did, and to be entirely of the
Roman cut. He was altogether for place, and not for thing: He had no concern
for what was pious, and what religious, and what of good use in other Places.
He was for that only which was done at home. And though Christianity was once
most pure, and most gloriously had flourished in the Eastern Churches, yet he
particularly cautioned and provided, that Theodore should lay aside his first
Works, and the Institutions of his Fathers, and the Traditions of the East, and
entirely govern himself according to the Usages of Rome.

Now the effect of this is most remarkable; though Theodore submitted to all
this, and came with resolution to please them, whose Creatures he was; yet
being a learned, stout, and most reverend Prelate, he was forced in a little
time to run into open opposition against Rome. For Wilfrid, the great Stickler
for Roman Fashions, endeavored to outdoe him, and would always be one step
beyond him in the way of Romanizing. He could not consecrate a Bishop, but
Wilfrid had something to say against it; nor make a Synodal Constitution, but
he had much to fault in it. And so troublesome he was, that Theodore was forced
to throw him out of his Bishopric: upon this Wilfrid appealed to Rome, and got
the Pope's Bull for his resettlement; yet Theodore would not reverse his
Sentence; and King Egbert added a second of Banishment against him: And neither
would obey, although the Pope threatened deprivation and excommunication to all
those that would not receive him.

Indeed in the second year of Alfrid he returned again, but soon was banished
again; and then again he appealed to Rome: and though he had favor there, yet
he received no benefit from it here. For Wilfrid himself being summoned to
appear at a Synod, upbraided the English Bishops; That they had opposed the
Pope's Command for two and twenty years; and wondered that they durst prefer
the Constitutions of Theodore, before the Bull of the Pope.

But for all his talk, the Synod had no more regard for the Bull, than the
King, or the Archbishop had; for they added a third Sentence of Excommunication
against him and his Adherents. And as long as Theodore lived, this Papal Bull
was not in the least regarded; but Wilfrid the great Romanizer, Innovator and
Reformer, who had vanquished the good and truly Christian Scots (or Irish) and
thought he merited much in his Contests about Easter and Tonsure, found himself
sufficiently beaten by one who was a mere Creature of Rome.

All this may be seen in Bid, Bid, lib. 5. cap. 20.
and in the Life of Wilfrid, written by Stephen Heddius.

This short Narration may deserve some few thoughts from any candid Reader;
whether he be Papist or Protestant, Romanizer or Catholic, and what is more
than all those names, plain Christian. Here any one may see something of the
first Christianity, and something of that which was superadded to it; the first
most venerable and good, the other vain and trifling. In the Advices of Gregory
to Augustine, and in the Lives and Practices of Aidan, Finan and Colman; we
have a most generous sense of Piety and Religion, and noble Designments most
agreeable to those of our Savior and his Apostles. In the Aims of Augustine,
Wilfrid and Vitalian, we have that which is low and mean; great values put upon
little things; The Name of St. Peter often used, and nothing else; the Soul and
Temper of him seems totally to be laid aside. Great noise, and stir, and
confidence employed to advance that which was of no use: and the same Arts
engaged in the Service which the great St. Augustine and St. Aug. Ep. 86.
Casulano.
Ambrose despised and trampled upon, when they found them formerly appearing in
like cases.

Besides, we may here see what mischiefs have come from those Men, who have
made it their business to subject the Faith and Worship of Christians to the
Determinations and Usages of one City. Wilfrid certainly gave much trouble, and
great disturbance to Theodore, to King Egbert, to King Alfrid; to England, to
Rome; and all this to very little purpose.

If any one now has a mind to satisfy himself in the difference between the old
Catholic, and the old Romanizer, he may compare the account which Bid gives
of Colman and his Predecessors, Bid, lib. 3. cap. 26.
with the Elogium which he gives of Acca, Bid, lib. 5. cap. 21.
Wilfrid's Successor; the first of these I have translated, and the other our
Adversaries may do, when they think good.
