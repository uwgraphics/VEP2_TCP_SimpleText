A most pleasant History of King Edward the fourth, and a Tanner of Tamworth.
IN Summer time when leaves grou green
and blossoms bud on every tree,
King Edward would a hunting ride,
some pastime for to see.
With hawke and hound he made him bound,
with horn and eke with bow,
Toward Drayton Basset he took his way,
whosoever does it know.
But as our King on his way rode forth,
by eight a Clock of the day,
He was ware of a tanner of merry Tamworth
was in a quaint of array.


A good russet Coat the tanner had on,
he thought it mickle pride,
He rode on a Mare cost four shillings,
and under him a good Cow-hide.
A pair of rough mittens the tanner did wear
his hood was buckled under his chin,
Yonder comes a good fellow said our King;
that cares not whether he lose or win
The tanner came singing on his Mare,
with one so merry a note;
He sung out of tune, he was past care,
he had no need to grease his throat.
Stand you here still my Lords now,
under the green wood spray,
And I will tide to yonder fellow,
to wit what he will say.
God speed good fellow said our King,
thou art welcome sir quoth he,
Which is the way to Drayton Basset,
I pray thee tell to me.
Marry that I will quoth the tanner,
right as here I stand,
The next pair of gallows that thou comes to
turn in upon thy right hand.
It is an unready way said our king,
I tell you so mote I thee,
I pray you show me the readiest way
the town that I may see.
Go play thee great Iauel quoth the tanner,
I hold thee out of thy wit,
All day have I ridden on Brocke my mare,
and I am fasting yet.
Why we will to the town said our king,
^
We will eat and drink and fare of the best,
and I will pay for the shot.
God have mercy for nothing quoth the tanner,
thou paiest for none of mine,
For I have as many Nobles in my purse,
as thou have pence in thine.
God give you toy of yours said our king,
and send thee well to priefe,
The tanner would feign have been a way,
for he wend he had been a thief.
What art thou good fellow quoth the tanner,
of thee I am in great fear,
For the clothes that thou wearest on thy back,
are not for a Lord to wear.
I never stole them said our king,
I tell you sir by the Rood,
No thou plaiest as many an unthrift does,
thou standst in the mids of thy good.
What tidings hear you said our king,
as you ride far and near,
I hear no tidings quoth the tanner,
but that cow hides are dear.
Cow hides Cow hides then said our king,
I know not what they be,
Lo here thou may see one quoth the tanner.
here lies one under me.
Know thou not a cow hide quoth the tanner,
and have gone so long to school:
If ever thou come to dwell in the Country
thou will be made a fool.
What crafts man are you said our king,
I pray you tell me now?
I am a Barker quoth the tanner
I am a Courtier said our King,
forth of service I am worn,
Full feign I would be your prentise he said,
your cunning for to learn.
Marry God forbid quoth the tanner
that such a prentise I should have,
He would spend me more than he would get
by forty shillings a year.
One thing would I wit said our King
if you will not seem strange,
Though my horse be better than your Mare.
with you feign would I change,
Nay there thou lie yet quoth the tanner
by Christ thou shall abide,
For if thou have Brocke my Mare
thou gets not my good Cowhide.
I will not have it said our King
I tell thee so mote I thee,
I will not carry it away
though you would give it me.
Why then we must change quoth the tanner
as needs me think thou will,
But if you have Brocke my Mare
I will look to have some boot.
That were against reason said our King,
I tell you so mote I thee,
My Horse is much better than your Mare,
and that you may well see.
A vise a vous now said the tanner,
whether thou will or no,
For my mare is gentle and will not kick
but softly she will go.
And thy horse is unhappy and un wieldie
But always skipping here and there
and therefore my mare is best.
What boot will you have then said our king
tell me now in this tide,
Never a single penny quoth the tanner
But a Noble of gold so red.
Why there is your Noble said our king
well paid look that you be.
I would have sworn on a book quoth the tanner
thou had not one penny.
Now has the king the tanners Mare
she is nothing fair fat nor round
And the tanner has the kings good steed
the saddle is worth forty pound.
The tanner took vy the good Cowhide,
of the ground where he stood,
He threw it upon the Kings Steed
in the Saddle that was so good,
The Steed stared upon the horns
under the green wood spraie,
He had weende the Devil of hell had bin come
to carry him thence away.
The tanner looked as fast on the Stirrops,
astonished sore he was,
He meruailed greatly in his mind,
whether they were gold or bras.
Help me good fellow quoth the tanner
lightly that I were gone,
My wife and my neighbors more and less,
will say I am a Gentleman.
The King took the tanner by the leg
and lift him up a loft,
The tanner girded out a good round fart,
his belly it was so soft,
You make great waste said our king,
your courtesy is but small,
Thy horse is so high; quoth the tanner again,
I fear me of a fall.
But when the tanner was in the saddle,
the Steed began to blow and blast,
And against the root of an old tree,
the tanner down he cast.
Abide good fellow said our king,
ye make over great have,
Thou shall have thy horse with a vengeance again,
for my neck is well nigh brast.
Why then we must change said our king,
as me think needs thou woot:
But if you have your Mare again,
I will look to have some boot.
What boot will thou have quoth the tanner,
tell me in this stouud.
Never a groat nor penny said our king,
but of thy gold twenty pound.
Nay here is thy noble quath the tanner again,
and Christ's blessing and mine,
Yea here is twenty good groats more,
go drink them at the wine.
So mote I thee then said our king,
it shall not slack my woe.
For when a noble is in small money,
full soon it is ago.
Do thou love to keep gold quoth the tanner.
the king answered and said ye,
Then I would thou were my near kinsman,
for I think thou will thrive and thee.
Now has the tanner Brocke his Mare,
and under him his good cowhide,
Our Noble King his horse again
which was a well fair Steed.
Now farewell good fellow quoth the tanner,
I will vide no longer with thee,
Carry yet a little while said our King
and some pastime we will see.
Our King set a Bugle to his mouth
and blew a blast loud and small,


Seven score Lords, Knights, Squires and Beome^
came riding over a Dale.
Now out alas quoth the tanner
that ever I saw this tide,
Thou art a strong thief yonder be thy fellows,
will have my Mare and my Cowhide.
They are no thieves then said our king
I tell you so mote I thee,
It is my Lord of Drayton Basset.
is come a hunting to me,
But when before the king they came,
they fell down on their knees,
The tanner had lever than a thousand pound,
he had been from their companies.
A collar a collar our king began call,
quoth the tanner it will breed sorrow,
For after a collar comes a halter,
I traw I shall be hanged to morrow.
Be not afraid tanner said our king,
I tell thee so mote I thee.
Lo here I make thee the best Esquier,
in all the North Country.
And Plumton Park I will give thee,
and Iacie in his tide,
It is worth three hundred pounds by year,
to prepare thy good Cowhide.
God a mercy good fellow quoth the tanner.
for this that thou have done:
The next time thou come to Tamworth town,
thou shall have clouting leather for thy shon.
Now God above speed well the Plough,
and keep us from care and woe,
Until every tanner in his Country.
