A Proclamation for Proroguing the Parliament.
WHEREAS by Our late Proclamation We declared Our pleasure for proroguing the
Parliament from the Sixteenth day of February last past, unto the Fifteenth
day of this instant March; Now for weighty and important reasons, We, with
the advice of Our Privy Counsel, have resolved to prorogue the said
Parliament yet further, unto the Twentieth day of April now next ensuing: And
to the end, that, as well the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, as the Knights,
Citizens and Burgesses of Parliament, may spare and forbear their attendance
accordingly, We have thought fit by this Proclamation, to publish and declare
Our resolution and intention therein; So that none of them (other then such as
for other occasions shall happen to be in London or Westminster, who may attend
the making of the said Prorogation) shall be bound to appear the said
Fifteenth day of March at the said City of Westminster, but are to hold their
appearance and meeting there, upon the said Twentieth day of April next
coming, to treat, consent, and conclude upon such matters, as in the said
Parliament shall then and there, of the Common Counsel of the Realm (by Gods
favor) happen to be ordained.

Given at Our Court of Theobalds the third day of March, in the two and
twentieth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.

Excellent Majesty. 1624.
