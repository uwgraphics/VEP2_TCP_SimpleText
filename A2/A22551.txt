royal blazon or coat of arms By the King.
A Proclamation commanding the Gentry to keep their Residence at their
Mansions in the Country, and forbidding them to make their habitations in
London, and places adjoining.
THe Kings most Excellent MAJESTY has observed, that of late years a greater
number of the Nobility and Gentry, and abler sort of His people with their
Families, have resorted to the Cities of London and Westminster, and places
adjoining, and there made their residence, then in former times, contrary to
the ancient usage of the English Nation, which has occasioned diverse
inconveniences; for where by their residence and abiding in the several
Countries whence their means arises, they served the King in several places
according to their Degrees and Ranks in aid of the Government, whereby, and
by their Housekeeping in those parts, the Realm was defended, and the meaner
sort of the people were guided, directed and relieved, but by their residence
in the said Cities and parts adjoining, they have not employment, but live
without doing any Service to His Majesty or His people, a great part of their
money and substance is drawn from the several Countries whence it arises,
and is spent in the City in excess of Apparel provided from Foreign parts,
to the enriching of other Nations, and unnecessary consumption of a great part
of the Treasure of this Realm, and in other vain delights and expenses, even
to the wasting of their Estates, which is not issued into the parts from whence
it arises, nor are the people of them relieved therewith, or by their
Hospitality, nor yet set on work as they might and would be, were it not for
the absence of the principal men out of their Countries, and the excessive use
of Foreign Commodities by this occasion also, and of the great number of
loose and idle people that follow them, and live in, and about the said Cities,
the disorder there grows so great, and the Delinquents become so numerous, as
those places are not so easily governed by their ordinary Magistrates, as in
former times, and the said Cities are not only at excessive charge in
relieuing a great number of those idle and loose people, that grow to Beggary,
and become diseased and infirm, but also are made more subject to Contagion
and Infection, and the prizes of all kinds of victuals both in the said
Cities, and in diverse other places from whence those Cities are served, are
exceedingly increased, and the several Countries undefended, the poorer sort
are vnrelieued, and not guided or governed, as they might be in case those
persons of quality and respect resided among them.

His Majesty finding those inconveniences to arise from hence, and foreseeing
that more will ensue, if timely remedy be not provided, has resolved for the
common good of His people, as by His Office He is bound to use all good ways
for preventing of those great evils.

And observing that His Noble Progenitors Kings of this Realm have used, when
for the common profit of the Realm it was necessary to command their people,
as well those of the Clergy of all sorts, as the Laity, to keep Residence at
their dwellings in the several parts of this Realm, where for defense, good,
and safety thereof, was most necessary, and to restrain their departure, or
changing their habitations from thence, under diverse pains upon the contemners
of those Commands: Therefore His Majesty does straightly charge and command
His Lords both Spiritual and Temporal, the Lieutenants and Deputy
Lieutenants of Counties, Justices assigned for conservation of the Peace,
Baronets, Knights, Esquires, and Gentlemen, and all Clerks having Benefices
with Cure, or Prebends or Dignities in Cathedral or Collegiat Churches, and
all other His Majesty's Subjects of the several parts of the Realm, that have
Mansion-houses and places of Residence in other parts, and are not of His
Majesty's Council, or bound to daily attendance on His Highness, His dearest
Consort the Queen, or their Children, That before the end of forty days next
after the publishing of this Proclamation within His City of London, they with
their families depart from the Cities of London and Westminster, Suburbs and
Liberties thereof, and places adjoining, and resort to the several Counties
where they usually resided, and there keep their habitations and hospitality,
attend their services, and be ready for the defense and guidance of those
parts, as their Callings, Degrees and Abilities shall extend, upon such pains
as are to be inflicted upon those that shall neglect the public service and
defense of the Realm in contempt of His Majesty's Royal Command: And that
as well those hereby commanded to return to their several Countries, as those
which are already there, do upon the same pains, continue the Residence of
themselves, and their families there, and do their duties and services as
aforesaid.

Nevertheless, his Majesty does hereby declare that it is not His purpose to
restrain the necessary access of any His Subjects to the said Cities or
either of them, for the following their suites or other necessary business in
Term time, or otherwise, so as they do not by pretense thereof remove their
families, but leave the same to continue in the Country, and keep their houses
and Hospitality, and themselves return thither as their business may permit
them, and to the end the better effect may hence follow, His Majesty does
charge and command the Lord Mayor of the City of London, and the Aldermen of
the same City, and the Justices assigned for conservation of the Peace there,
and in the City of Westminster and the Suburbs and Liberties of the same
Cities, and in the Counties and places adjoining, and all Constables and
Churchwardens in every Parish within any of those Cities, Suburbs, Liberties,
Counties, and places, That every of them make special observation of all those
that shall be disobedient to this Our Command, and from time to time present
their names to some of Our Counsel learned, whom We do Command to take due
examination, or notice of the qualities of their offenses, and to cause
prosecution to be had against them in Our Court of Star Chamber, or in any
other Our Courts of Justice as the case shall require.

And because His Majesty's loving people of the Cities, Suburbs, Liberties,
and places aforesaid, are exceedingly burdened and charged, by occasion of
this great and unnecessary concourse of those strangers among them, His
Majesty holds it equal and just, and is well pleased that in their aid and
contributions to his Majesty, and other common payments, they shall be charged
with respect to the inconvenience that comes by their residence in those
places, and that nevertheless in other parts of the Realm they be not
forborne in any usual payment which by Law may be laid on them, and which
they were accustomed to bear among their neighbors in the Country when they
resided there. And his Majesty does further charge and command, that when they
or any of them at any Assizes, Sessions, or other place of public service
shall make default of their service, or due attendance, that the penalties of
the Law be severely inflicted on them, without favor or excuse by reason of
their residing with their families at London, or Westminster, or the places
adjoining.

Finally, His Majesty does hereby declare that it is His firm resolution to
withstand this great and growing evil, by all just ways, and by a constant
severity toward the offenders in that behalf; For which cause His Majesty
does give this timely warning, that none do hereafter presume to offend, nor
put themselves to unnecessary charge in providing themselves to return in
Winter, to the said Cities and places adjacent but that they conform
themselves to this his Royal Commandment, as they tender their duties to His
Majesty, or the good and welfare of their countries and themselves.

Given at the Court at Greenwich, the twentieth day of June, in the eighth
year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord, CHARLES by the grace of God King of
England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
MAJESTY: and by the Assigns of John Bill. M.DC.XXXII.
