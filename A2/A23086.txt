The Statutes Prohemium Iohannis Rastell.
BEcause that the lawys of this real^ of eglo^d as well the statutes as other
iug^me^tis and decreys be made and wrytyn most co^mynly in the french tongue,
diverse men thereof muse and have often tymys co^municacio^ and argume^te
co^syderi^g that in reason every law whereto any people should be bo^^dyn ought
and should be wrytt^n in such manner and so opynly publyssed and decl^^yd that
the people might sone without great di^ficulte have the knowledge of the same
laws. But the very cause whithe said laws of e^glo^d were writi^ in the
french to^g should seem to be this First it is not vnknowyn that when wyllyam
duke of normandy came into this land and slew king herrold and conqueryd the
hole realm / there was a great no^bre of people as well gentilme^ as other that
came with him which understood not the vulgar tongue that was that time vsyd in
this realm but only the french to^g / and also by cause the said king and
other great wise me^ of his counsel perseiuid and supposid that the vulgar to^g
which was than vsyd in this realm was in a manner but homely and rude nor had
not so great copy and ^aboundau^ce of wordys as the french to^g tha^ (...)
^or that vullgare tongue was not of it sel^ suffycyent to expound and to declare
the matter of such lawis and ordenau^ces as they hade determine^ to be made for
the good governance of the people so effectually and so substauncyally as they
cowd indyte the^ in the french tongue / therefore they order^d wrote and indicted
the seid law is that they made in the french tongue. And forthermore long after
the coming of king wylya^ conqueror because yt the use of the french to^g i^
this real me began to mynyssh and because that diverse people tha^ inhabytyd
within this realm which coud another speak the vulgar tongue of this realm
another the french tongue. Therefore the wise men of this realm caused to be
orderyd that the matters of law and accyo^s between pertes should be pledyd
showed and defendyd / answered debatyd ^ ^uggyd in the englyssh vulgar to^g and
more over y^ wryttyn and enteryd of record in the rollys in the latin tongue by
cause that every man generally ^ indyfferently might have the knowledge thereof
as apperyth by a statute made. in the.xxxvi. year of Ed. iii. ca. vltimo.
wherefore as I suppose for these causes before rehersyd the law is of this
realm were i^dytid and wrytti^ in the french to^g which was i^te^dyd for a
right good purpose. But yet beside this now of late days, the most noble
prince our late souereyn lord king henry the.vii. worthy to be called the
second solomon (which excellyd in polytyk wisdom all other pryncis that
reyngned in this realm before his time) concyderynge and well perseyuynge that
our vulgar englissh tongue was maruelously amendyd and augmentyd by reason that
diverse famous clerkys and lernyd men had translate and made many noble workys
into our englisshe to^g whereby there was much more plenty and haboundan^ce of
englyssh vsyd than there was in tymys past. and by reason there of our vulgar
to^g so a^plified and sufficient of it self to expound any lawys or ordinau^cis
which was nedeful to be made for the order of this realm / and also the same
wise price consyderyng that the universal people of this realm had great
pleasure and gave the^self greatly to the redynge of the vulgar englyssh
tongue. ordeynyd and caused that all the statutys and ordinauncis which were
made for the commyn wealth of this realm in his days should be indytyd and
wryttyn in the vulgar englyssh tongue and to be publysshyd declared and
impri^tid so that tha^ universally the people of the realm might sone have the
knowleg of the said statutes and ordynau^cys which they were bound to observe /
and so by reason of that knowledge to avoid the danger an^ penaltes of the same
statutys / and also the better to lyffe in tranquylyte and pease. which
dyscreyt charytable and reasonable order our most drad souereyne lord that now
is king Henry the.viii. has co^tynuyd and folowyd and caused all the statutys
that have be made in his days to be also i^dytyd and written in our englyssh
tongue to the intent that all his lege people might have the knowleg there of
All which goodly purposys and intentys in my mind often tymys reuoluyde has
caused me to ^ake this little pain to translate out of french in to english
the abbreuyacyon of the statutys ma^^ before the first year of the reyn of our
late s^uereyn lord king Hen. the.vii. and also though y^ the statu^es made as
well in the time of the se^d king Hen. the.vii. as in the time of our
souereyne lord that now is be suffyciently indytyd and written in our english
tongue. yet to the^ that be desyrouse shortly to know the effect of them they be
now more tediouse to read than though the matter and effect of them were
co^pe^dyously abbreuiat wherefore now as far as my simple wit and small
learning will extend I have here takyn upon me to abbregge the effect of them
more shortly in this little book / Besechynge al them to whom the syghte there
of shall come to accept it in gre^ and though they shall fortune to find any
thing my^^eportyd or omyttyd! by my neglyge^s or ellis by neclyge^s of the
prynters yt it would like them to pardon me and to consider my good will which
have intendyd it for a comi^ wealth for the causes and consyderacyons before
rehersyd / and also if y^ it shall fortune them to be in dout in any point
thereof yet if it please them they may resort to the hole statute where of
this book is but a bred gemente and in manner but a kalendre^ And further more I
will aduertyse every man that shall fortune to have any matter in ure to resort
to some man that is lernyd in the laws of this realm to have his counsel in
such points which he thinks douteful concerning the said statutys by the
knowledge whereof and by the dylygente obseruyng of the same he may the better
do his d^wty to his prince and souerayngne and also live in tranquylyte and
pease with his neighbor acordynge to the pleasure and commandment of
almighty god to whom be eternal laud and glory. Amen.
