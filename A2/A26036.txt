GENTLEMEN,
BEing employed in the service of the City and State, to attend the
London-Brigade, now joined with Sir William Waller, and at that time entrusted
to acquaint you with our proceedings the last week; I am bold, after my humble
service, to present to you a brief Relation of the most remarkable Passages
between us and the Enemy, not only in duty to you, but also in love to all
those that long to be truly informed in the particular.

May it please your Honor; Upon Thursday the 21. of this instant March (our
Brigade being quartered at Midhurst) our Major General received Orders from
Sir William Waller, to advance toward Winchester to a Town called Traford,
which accordingly he did with incredible speed, almost at an hours warning, and
that night arrived there, which we found to be a small Village, not above seven
or eight houses to quarter all our men, there we met with much hardship,
staying for Orders till the Lords day following; Upon Monday the 25, we marched
forwards to ioyn with Sir William Wallers main body, which accordingly we did,
and that night were appointed to quarter at Westmean, three miles distant from
the main body, where we found a partee of the Enemies horse when our
Quartermasters entered the Town, which occasioned some action, though not much
considerable, we only took a Quartermaster prisoner; the next day, which was
Tuesday, we lay still, only our Scouts brought in some prisoners, 6 Troops
incountring with 16 of the Enemies, put them to flight* and brought away 3. of
them prisoners; The day following we discovered the Enemy, who took some fevv
of our men that were straggling from their colors, and soon after appeared in
a great body upon the hill on the left hand the Town, intending (as some
prisoners confessed) to take us at Church, it being the Fast day; but it
pleased God, who foresavv the Plot, to prevent the danger, directing us to
keep the Fast the Wednesday before, when we lay still at Midhurst, so that
we were provided to entertain them, and drevv our men into a body near the
town, which done, Orders came to march away, which accordingly we did, in the
Forlorn-Hope, expecting the Enemy every hour to fall upon us, so that we were
forced to make a stand a mile or more from the town in extreme danger, till Sir
William Wallers forces came up from Eastmean to join with us, then we marched
along till we came near to Cheriton, to a place called by some,
Lamborough-field, where we quartered all night, the Enemy lying upon Sutton
Common, and some part of them nearer to us, so near that the Sentinels could
hear one another talk: Upon Thursday morning a commanded partee was sent to
view the Enemy, which they did, and incountered with a forlorn hope of the
Enemies, and behaved themselves very bravely, so that day was spent in
skirmishes, where much gallantry and true valor was showed by our horse,
especially two men whose names I do not well remember, to the perpetual honor
of the actors, and great admiration of the spectators; by whose means a
considerable partee was once engaged, and the enemy came on with a great body,
which appearing, we discharged one*gun, which did such execution in our sight,
that they all fled.

This day a Counsel of War was called by both partees, both by us and the
Enemy, as since we are informed, and the engagement was such, that of
necessity they must give battle or retreat with much dishonor, the next
morning we prepared for the work, and having sought to God for assistance, we
did address our selves to the service; in the first place, a forlorn hope was
drawn out of our brigade, four files out of a company, led on by Captain
Tompson, a stout man, who were sent to take possession of a wood which lay on
the right hand between us and the enemy, which they obtained with ease in the
enemies sight; but such was their policy, that they foreseeing the necessity of
our gaining the wood, if ever we gave battle to them in that place, planted
their Drakes on the further side of the wood, which they discharged upon our
men so thick, that the place was not tenible, though the greatest part of our
Musketteers, and some others, were drawn up to them, so that they were forced
to retreat in one hours space, which gave great encouragement to the Enemy,
who presently came on with their main body of horse, very powerfully, and were
met as courageously, yet being of the greater number (for our whole body was
not then together) forced ours to a disorderly retreat, at which time the day
was doubtful, if not desperate, our foot all the while was engaged on the left
wing, to drive the Enemy from the hodges, where our men played their parts
gallantly, and drove them from hedge to hedge by degrees, till they had forced
them to the top of the hill, our horse doing little for the space of an hour
after their retreat, only some parties incountring with each other, at which
time our Noble Major General Brown (who was ever known to be a valiant man,
and must be looked upon as a special instrument in the work, Drew off 100. men
from the hedges, and in his own person led them on to charge the horse, which
they did most gladly and courageously, and forced the enemies horse to wheel
about, whereupon our body of horse came on again, and that very manfully, at
which time they charghed quice through the Enemies body and put them to a rout,
so that they were forced to retreat to the top of the hill, where they first
appeared, this was about two of the clock in the afternoon, at which time they
began to retreat, and sent their Carriages away, their body of foot followed
after, the horse and some few foot only being left to face and to fight with
us, at the the last it pleased God to raise up the spirits of some few, not
above 300. and to put such courage into them, as to adventure out of the
closings, to charge the main body upon the plain, which they did so resolutely
that they put them all to flight, our horse pursued them two miles at the
least, till the Enemies horse overtook their own foot, who cried out (as the
country people say) Face them, face them, once more face them; which they did,
but to small purpose; our horse came up, and at the first charge they were all
routed and fled, our horse pursued them till they overtook the foot, routed
them likewise, and dispersed them several ways, some fled to Basing, some to
Alton, and some to Winchester, and by the way they cried out, the Kingdoms
lost, the Kingdoms lost, etc. and when they left Alsford where they had long
quartered, they set the town on fire at both ends, which doubtless had burnt
to the ground, but that our men came in and put it out, there was only four or
five houses burnt.

Thus it pleased God (who alone is the giver of all Victory) to vouchsafe us
not only a deliverance (which we should have owned as a mercy) but a glorious
conquest. As for the instruments, I dare not challenge any of neglect in this
days service, to speak the truth, both Horse and foot quit themselves bravely.

We took prisoners in the fight; Sir Edward or Sir John Stowell, Major Gener:
of a Brigade, a man of a great estate: Col: Beard, Colonel of a Regiment of
Horse, and of a Regiment of Foot, who was employed in Ireland: Lieut. Col:
Kingston, Captain Price, Captain Chidleigh, Captain Jackson, Captain Seamer,
Ensign Cowper, Lieuten: (...) Ensign Mellis, Ensign Marsh; Ensign Midley,
Cornet Constable, Cornet Ducket, John Morsey Physician; Together with many
other Captains and Commanders, besides common Soldiers, the certain number I
know not* whereas we have not lost 40 men that we know of; one of our men
that was taken prisoner (but left behind by reason of his wounds) told me
himself, they had not taken 20 prisoners in all; and, I know not of 20 slain;
the most considerable loss on our part, is the Col: Tompson (a brave man) is
shot with a Drake, and his Leg is cut off, we are in great hopes of his
recovery; Major Boswell is desperately wounded, Captain Melton is taken
prisoner, some few are wounded, but I hope not mortally, the certain number of
the slain I cannot report; they told us in Alsford, that they fetched off
cart-loads of dead men, and some they buried, and some they carried with them,
the Lord John the Duke of Richmonds brother is slain, and General Ruthen as we
are informed, though the Malignants are loath to part with such a Soldier, or
to hear of his death, some say, he was not there; others say, he is escaped
safe to Re^ding; give me leave to tell the truth, I my self was at the house
where he quartered at Alsford, the Master of the house testifies that he was
there, and being troubled with the Gowt, went not into the field; in the
morning, news was sent to him (doubtless it went to Oxford too, we may chance
hear of a Thanksgiving for it) that the Londoners were routed, a thousand taken
prisoners, the rest fled, and were then in the pursuit, welcome News no doubt;
for presently he calls for a deck of Cards, and follows his sport, till at last
a messenger in all have tells him the tide was turned, their horse were routed,
and his presence required; away he goes into the field, and was saluted there
by Leivtenant Colonel Bump, and so the game was ended, our great gunne cut him
off, and he was brought dead to town: I could tell you of some others; (...)
Captain left behind in Alsford sorely wounded, does ^^^^r the Devil is in the
Roundheads they are such Firemen; they have slain, wounded, and taken
Prisoners, all their Commanders of any note* if it be an untruth, or any
Malignant please to give it a grosser title, consider out of whose mouth it
came; this for Friday. On Saturday morning I spoke with the Messenger, who came
from Sir William Waller to our Major General with Orders, for we stayed at
Alsford, 14 miles behind Sir William Waller, who affirmed that the Horse and
Foot were totally routed, not a body of 200 Foot to be found, of the great
Army, consisting in all of twelve thousand, that we had taken seven pieces of
Ordnance, many carriages, and that Sir William would set upon Winchester
immediately, being within a mile and a half of it then, I trust in God he is by
this time possessed of it. Many passages I am forced to omit for brevities sake,
both in and after the fight: we had both the same word, God with us: but see
what it is to dissemble with a God of truth. Our next word was, Jesus help us;
so he did: and then the last was, Glory be to God. Give me leave to end here,
and let this day be ever in our thoughts, and the word be ever in our mouths, a
day wherein God was seen in the high places of the field, a wise, mighty wonder
working God, there is not an Atheist that can own thee, and not acknowledge it
to be digitus Dei; It Is God alone that has done the work, to him alone be all
the praise; The rest is this,

March 30. 1644. Gentlemen, I am your humble servant, E. A.
The Queens Regiment being there, and Prince Maurices forces; most of the Irish
neither giving nor taking quarter.



FINIS.
