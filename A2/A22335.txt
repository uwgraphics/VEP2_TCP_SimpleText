A Proclamation for proroguing the Parliament.
WHereas by Our late Proclamation We declared Our pleasure for proroguing the
Parliament, from the second day of November last past, unto the sixteenth day
of February next coming, Now, for weighty and important reasons, We, with the advice of Our prime Council, have resolved to prorogue the said Parliament yet
further, unto the fifteenth day of March now next ensuing. And to the end, that
as well the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, as the Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses of Parliament, may stay, and forbear their attendance accordingly;
We have thought fit, by this Proclamation, to publish and declare Our
resolution and intention therein: So that none of them (other then such, as for
their own occasion shall happen to be in London or Westminster, who may attend
the making of the said Prorogation) shall be bound to appear the said
sixteenth day of February, at the said City of Westminster, but are to hold
their appearance and meeting there, upon the said fifteenth day of March next
coming, to treat, consent, and conclude upon such matters, as in the said
Parliament shall then and there, of the common Council of the Realm, (by Gods
favor) happen to be ordained.

Given at Our Court at Newmarket, the nineteenth day of January, in the two and
twentieth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.

most Excellent Majesty. ANNO DOM. M.DC.XXIIII.
