By the King.
FOrasmuch as the infection of the Plague is at this present greatly increased
and dispersed as well in the Cities of London and Westminster, as also in the
Suburbs thereof, The Kings most Excellent Majesty considering that great
peril and danger might ensue, not only unto his Royal person, the Queens
Majesty, the Prince, and Princess, the Honorable Ambassadors from sundry
foreign Princes, the Lords and others of his Majesty's Honorable Privy
Counsel, the Nobles of this Realm, and other his Majesty's loving Subjects,
if the people of all sorts, and out of all parts of this Realm, should resort
or continue together for their Suits and Causes this instant Term, commonly
called Trinity Term, and hoping that by dispersing of the multitude of people
now being in or about his said Cities, and by staying the access of others to
the same about Suits in Law, and by due observation of such good and necessary
Orders and directions, as are and shall be prescribed in that behalf, through
the merciful goodness of Almighty God, the said infection shall be stayed, so
as the Coronation and Inauguration of his most Excellent Majesty, to the
inestimable and universal rejoicing of all his loving and true hearted
Subjects, with all Princely solemnities and Honors thereunto apperteyning, may
be accomplished and performed, at such time and place as his Majesty has
already been pleased to appoint, Has therefore thought good by the advice of
his Privy Council, and Justices of his Courts at Westminster, to adiorne part
of the same Term, That is to say, in and from the second Return of this
instant Term, commonly called Octabis Trinitatis, until the fourth Return of
the same Term, commonly called Tres Trinitatis, and that to be for such causes
only, and for such intent and purpose, as hereafter is declared.

And therefore his Majesty does hereby signify and declare, that his Will
and pleasure is, That Writts of Adiornement shall be directed to the Justices of
either Bench, and to the Judges of all other his Majesty's Courts, to whom like
Writts have been usually directed, giving them authority to adiorne this
instant Term, in and from Octabis Trinitatis next, until Tres Trinitatis then
next following, And the said Adiornement to be made the first day of the said
Octabis Trinitatis, called the day of Essoines.

And whereas his Majesty considering in his princely wisdom what great
prejudice might grow to many his good and loving Subjects in their Causes and
Suits, if this Term should be wholly adiourned, Has therefore by the advice
of his said Counsel and Justices, determined to have some part thereof to be
holden and continued for some few days in the beginning and ending of the
same, as is aforesaid, His Highness most gracious intention in that behalf
is, That the same days for which some part of this said Term is to be holden,
shall be used only for the better expediting and continuing of Causes and Suits,
and returning and suing out of Process, and for such other like things, which
may be performed and done in the absence of the parties by their Attourneyes.
And therefore his Majesty does by this his Proclamation signify to all his
loving Subjects, that his will and pleasure is, That in and from the said
Octabis Trinitatis next, there shall not be any Trials by Iuries, or any
Judgments upon Demurrers, or special Verdicts or such like, in any of his
Highness Courts of Kings Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer. And also that
there shall not be any Judicial hearing or determining of any Causes or Matters
in any of his Majesty's Courts of Star Chamber, Chancerie, Exchequer Chamber,
Court of Wards, Duchy Chamber, or Court of Requests, in or from the said
Octabis Trinitatis next, during the said Term: And that no party shall need
to be present in person for any such Causes or Suites, but the same may be
attended and done by their Attourneys.

And his Majesty does hereby further notify and declare, That no party shall
be compelled or need to appear in person in any of his Majesty's said Courts,
in or from the said Octabis Trinitatis next, at any time during this said
Term, but may make their appearance by their Attourneys, saving only in Cases
of Outlawry, and other the Cases mentioned in the Prouiso hereafter following:
And also that no Iuries or any whom the same may concern, shall be compelled
or need to appear in any of his Highness Courts at Westminster in or from the
said Octabis Trinitatis next, at any time during the said Term for any cause
or matter whatsoever, unless it be for some special and important cause for
his Majesty's service only.

Provided nevertheless, and his Majesty's pleasure and commandment is, That
all Collectors, Receivers, Sheriffs, and other Accomptants, and all other
persons that should or ought to account or pay any sum or sums of money in
any of his Majesty's Courts of Exchequer, Court of Wards and Liueries, or of
his Duchy of Lancaster, or in any of them, or enter into any account in any of
the said Courts, shall repair to the accustomed places at Westminster, and
there to pay and do in every behalf as though no such Proclamation or
Adiournement had been had or made.

And his Majesty's further pleasure and commandment is, That all Sheriffs
shall return into his Majesty's Court of Exchequer, Court of Wards and
Liueries, and Duchy of Lancaster, all manner of Writs and Process issued out
of the same Courts, and returnable this Term, which in any sort concern his
Majesty's Revenues, Debts, or Duties, at or before the days of Returns
thereof, into such Offices from whence the said Writs and Process did issue:
And that all Commissioners likewise return all manner of Commissions and
Inquisitions returnable this Term, and from the said Courts sent, whereby his
Majesty is to receive profit and commodity: And all Sheriffs, Collectors,
all manner of Accomptants, and every person that is to pay any kind of Debt or
Duty unto the Kings Majesty in any of the said Courts, do either by
themselves, their Deputies, or Attourneys, pay the same in such sort as they
ought to have done if no such Proclamation or Adiournement had been made, or
else to sustain such damage of Issues, Seasure, Fine, Amerciament, and
Penalty to be imposed upon them, as has been accustomed, without any hope to
be discharged thereof: And that all Sheriffs, by themselves or their
sufficient Deputies, shall give their attendance at the day appointed for their
opposall in the Court of Exchequer, to answer their Returns before his said
Barons, as has been heretofore accustomed: And if any default shall be made
by any of the persons aforesaid, that then in respect of the Kings present
necessary and extraordinary charges, Sergeants at Arms and Pursuiuants shall be
sent to bring them up to answer their contempt and slacknesse in payment.

Given at our Manor of Greenewich the three and twentieth day of June, in the
first year of our Reign of England, France, and Ireland, and the six and
thirtieth of Scotland. God save the King.
