By the King.
A Proclamation declaring His Majesty's Royal Grace and Pleasure, to confirm
to His Subjects their defective Estates in their Lands and Possessions, by His
Commission lately renewed and enlarged to that purpose.
WHereas for the good of Our Subjects, We have been graciously pleased, to
renew and enlarge Our former Commission of Grace, and have thereby authorized
the Lords and others of Our Privy Council, and some of Our Judges and learned
Council, to sell, grant, and confirm to such of Our Subjects, whom it may
concern, their Defective Estates, Possessions, and Titles, in such Manors,
Lands, Tenements, Leases, and Hereditaments as they enjoy, not only by color
of void or insufficient grants, or by Patents of concealements: but for those
Lands also which they now hold by intrusion only, without Title derived from
the Crown, and which are not established to them by Act of Parliament in the
one and twentieth year of Our late Royal Father.

And howsoever the former slacknes of Our Subjects in taking hold of the tender
of this grace in times before, might justly induce Us to cut off the Current
and course thereof now, and to make advantage thereof to Our self and Our own
benefit; Yet We out of Our Princely desires of the common good of Our people,
and to settle and quiet them in their Estates and Possessions, have been
pleased once more to make known these Our Royal Intentions of favor to such
of Our Subjects as shall timely embrace the same.

And therefore We do hereby declare Our Royal Pleasure to be, That such of
Our Subjects as shall seek to have their defezible and defective Estates and
Possessions, in any their Manors, Lands, Tenement, Leases, or Hereditaments,
derived, or detained from the Crown, to be made good and established to them,
upon moderate compositions, (which We intend shall be applied to Our own use)
That they before the beginning of Hilary Term next, do repair to Our now
Commissioners, at a house in Fleetstreete (where Our Commissioners for Our
Revenue (while We were Prince of Wales) did usually meet) where Our now
Commissioners will have their frequent meetings for the Suitors dispatch:
Nevertheless We do hereby also let them know, that such of Our People as
shall not now apprehend this present opportunity of Our Grace and Favor, may
not expect it hereafter, We minding by course of Law to reduce those Lands to
the Crown again, or otherwise to dispose them to such as shall become Suitors
to Our Commissioners to compound for the same.

Given at Our Court at Oatlands, the four and twentieth day of August, in the
eleventh year of Our Reign of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland.
