By the King.
A Proclamation declaring His Majesty's pleasure concerning Sir Walter
Rawleigh, and those who adventured with him.
WHereas We gave License to Sir Walter Rawleigh, Knight, and (...) of Our
Subjects with him, to undertake a Voyage to the Cou^^rey of Guyana, where they
pretended great hopes and probabilities to m^^e discovery of certain Gold
Mines, for the lawful enriching of them^^lues and these Our Kingdoms: Wherein
We did by express limitat^^^ and Caution restrain, and forbid them and every
of them, from a^^empting any Act of hostility, wrong, or violence whatsoever,
upon any of the Territories, States, or Subjects of any foreign Prince ^^th
whom We are in amity: And more peculiarly of those of our dear Brother the
King of ^paine, in respect of his Dominions and Interests in that Continent.

All which notwithstanding, we are since informed by a Common fame, that they,
or some (...)them have, by an hostile invasion of the town of S. Thome (being
under the obedience of (...) dear Brother the King of Spain) and by killing
of diverse of the inhabitants thereof, his S^^^ects, and after by sacking and
burning of the said town, (as much as in them for their own pa(...)ay;
maliciously broken and infringed the Peace and Amity, which has been so
happily estab^^^hed, and so long inuiolably continued between Us and the
Subjects of both Our Crowns.

We have therefore held it fit, as appertaining nearly to Our Royal Justice
and Hou^^ eftsoons to make a public declaration of Our own utter mislike
and detestation of the s^^ insolences, and excesses, if any such have been by
any of Our Subjects committed: And for t^ better detection and clearing of the
very truth of the said common fame; We do hereby s^^^itly charge and require
all Our Subjects whatsoever, that have any particular vnderstandi^^ (...)
notice thereof, upon their duty and alleagiance which they owe Us, immediately
after publi^^tion of this Our pleasure, to repair unto some of Our Privy
Counsel, and to discover and make known unto them their whole knowledge and
understanding concerning the same, vnde^^^ing of our High displeasure and
indignation; that We may thereupon proceed in Our P^^^^^ly Justice to the
exemplary punishment and coertion of all such, as shall be convicted and found
^^^^ty of so scandalous and enormous outrages.

Given at Our Palace Manor of Greenwich, the ninth day of June, in the
sixteenth year of Our Reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland
the one and fiftieth.
Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton, and John Bill, deputy Printers for the
Kings most Excellent Majesty.
