a Proclamacion, set forth by the kings Majesty, with thassent of his derest
uncle, Edward Duke of Somerset, Governor of his most royal person, and of his
Realms. Dominions and Subjects Protector, and others of his most honorable
Counsel, concerning certain Riotes and unlawful assembles, for the breakyng
up of Enclosures.
WHereas of late, the kings majesty moved of a Godly zeal and love, to the
common wealth of the realm, by the advice of his derest uncle, Edward Duke of
Somerset, Governor of his highness person, and Protector of all his Realms,
Dominions, and Subjects, and the rest of his majesty's privy counsel, did
by Proclamacion will and commau^d all manner of persons, who had offended
against the good and wholesome laws heretofore provided against the decay of
houses and unlawful enclosures, to amend their such offenses, and to
redress all faults by them committed, against thesaied acts and statutes,
and against the benefit of the common wealth upon pein to encurre the
daungiers and pains, in the same acts and statutes provided. And for the
better performaunce thereof, by thaduise aforesaied, willed and commanded, all
his highness officers and ministers, to whom it did appertein, to see the same
redressed, to receive informacions, make inquiry, and with all speed and
earnest endeavor, se to the redress and punishment, of all such offenders,
as by the laws and statutes of the realm, they might and ought to do. Upon
this most Godly warnyng, admonishement and Proclamacion, which was to keep
order and laws, his highness is advertised, that a great nombre of rude and
ignorant people, in certain Shires of England, has taken occasion, or at the
least pretended to take occasion, of doing great and most perilous and
heinous disordre, and contrary to all good laws and statutes, and thordre of
this realm, have riotously with routes and compaignies, with force, strength,
and violence, of their own head and authority, assembled theimselfes, plucked
down men's Hedges, dispacked their Parkes, and being led by furious and
light guydes of uproar, taken upon them the direccion of things, the Kings
royal power and sword, and committed thereby such enormitie and offense, as
they have justly therefore, deserved to lose life, lands and goods, and to
be made example to all other: But forsomuche as they have humbly submitted
theimselfes, and demanded pardon, being sorry for their former offenses, the
kings highness of a most high clemency, and tender love to his Subjects, is
content not to look upon his justice herein to be executed, but much more of
natural mercy and clemency, and so for this time, acceptyng that this
outrage was dooen, rather of folly and of mistakyng thesaid Proclamacion, and at
thinstigacion and mocion of certain leude and sedicious persons, then of
malice or any evil will, that his said subjects did bear, either to his
highness or to the quiet of this realm, of his majesty's most aboundaunt
clemency, and tender pity, by the advice of thesaied Lord Protector, and the
rest of his highness privy counsel, is contented and pleased, to remit and
pardon all thesaied outragies, misbehauours, riottes, and conspiracies, to all
and syngulet his said subjects, other then to such as be already apprehended
and in prison, as heddes and stirrers of thesaied outrage and Riottes, and
therefore wills and commands, all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriefes
Bailifes, and all other his highness officers and ministers, not tenterrupt,
vex, or trouble, for, and in his Majesty's behalf, any manner person, other
then is specified before, of, or for any offense, injury, contempt, or
conspiracy, done at thesaied stir or riottes lately made, about the breakyng
of enclosures, so that they do not attempt, or go about any such thing
hereafter. But if so be there be any just cause to complain, for default of
justice, or lack of redress, in any such enclosure, or default made against
thesaied acts and statu^es before specified, in this case prouid (...) who
find themself justly grieved or in^^^ied, may give informacion, make suit or
complaint to the Kings Majesty, or other his highness officers, depu^ed to the
redress of all such offenses, according to the laws of the realm, and the
good and lawful order of the same.

But if any man shall at any time hereafter, attempt, or go about to make any
such riot, or unlawful assembly, for any such cause before rehearsed: his
majesty's will and pleasure is, by the advice aforesaied, that all such
offenders, shall immediately be apprehended by the next Justice or Justices of
Peace, and lose the benefit of this most gracious pardon, and suffie such
peines of death, loss of lands goods and cattalles, as by the laws of the
realm in such case is provided any thing in this present Proclamacion,
heretofore mentioned notwithstanding:

Given the xiiii. day of June. 1549. And in the third year of his Majesty's
most gracious reign.
God save the King.
