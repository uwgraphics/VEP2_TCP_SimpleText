Darby, ESQVIRE: his singular good Master.
SIR:
EVer since it pleased you to vouchsafe me your Patronage, I have been pregnant
(with desire) to produce something that might express my zeal unto you: And
being assured that your serious judgment can expect no great increase, for
your many favors sown on so barraine a ground; I am thereby imbouldned, to
Dedicate these Infants of my Muze, to your honored protection: who (being of
an Ayerie spirit) are prone to try their untimely fortunes in the World, (like
the Lapwing, with the shell upon her head.) Yet if you deigne to shadow them
with your approbation, they will pass as current as Caesar's Image, (though on
Brass or Leather.) I confess the grace will be more then I can merit, but not
so much as your constant love to our Art does promise: which you might have
conferred where more Imenency of quality had been, but not on any whose heart
is more devoted to your Service, then that of

Your obedient Servant Michael East.
