By the Queen.
FOrasmuch as the Queens Majesty our sovereign Lady is credibly informed,
that the infection of the plague is at this present in sundry places, in and
about the city of London, and in other places near adjoining to the same:
Whereas by the continuance thereof, through the greater repair and resort of
her loving Subjects, great peril and danger might not only ensue unto her
most royal person, but also to her most loving Subjects repairing thither for
their Suits and causes, and thereby also give occasion of dispersing of the
same in other parts of the Realm: Her Majesty for the said necessary
considerations, and hoping that the same will by the goodness of Almighty God,
with the coldness of the year, and such wholesome orders as are taken in her said
city, the rather cease by the adiornment of part of this next Term of Saint
Michael now at hand, from the vtas of the same until the fourth return of
the said Term, called Mensis Michaelis next coming: Her Majesty therefore
of her especial favor and clemency, is pleased and contented to adiorne the
said Term of Saint Michael, That is to (...) from the vtas thereof unto the
said fourth return of the said Term, called Mensis Michaelis next coming,
which her Majesty signifies to all and singular her loving subjects of this
her is Realm, to the intent that they and every of them, which has cause or
commandment to appear in any of her Highness Courts at Westminster, in or at
any day or t^me from and after the said vtas of Saint Michael, may tarrye at
their dwellings, or where their business otherwise shall be without resorting
to any of the said Courts for that cause before Mensis Michaelis next
coming, and that without danger of forfeiture, penalty, or contempt to
incur toward her Highness in that behalf. And nevertheless her Majesty's
pleasure is, that two of her Justices, that is to say, of either Benche one,
shall the first day of Michaelmas Term, called Octabis Michaelis, according
to the ancient order of her Laws, keep the Essoynes of the said Octabis
Michaelis, at which vtas of Saint Michael, Writtes of Adiorment shall be directed
to the said Justices, giving them authority to adiorne the said Term of
Says Michael, That is to say, from the vtas thereof until Mensis Michaelis,
as before is said. And the said adiornement shall be made in the first day of
the said vtas, commonly called the day of the Essoynes. And further her
Majesty's pleasure is, that all matters, causes and suits, depending in any of
her other Courts, between party and party, as in her Highness Courts of
Chanceric, Star Chamber and Exchequer, Courts of Wards and Liveries, Duchy
of Lancaster and Courts of Requests shall have continuance, and the parties
shall have day from the date of these presents unto Mensis Michaelis, as
before is said.

Provided always, and her Majesty's pleasure and commandment is, that all
Collectors, Receivers, Sheriffs and other Accomptants, and all other parsons
that should or ought to account or pay any sum or sommes of money, in any of
her Majesty's Court of Exchequier, Court of Wards and Liveries, or of her
Duchy of Lancaster, or in any of them, or to enter into any account in any of
the same Courts, shall repair unto the accustomed places at Westminster, where
her Highness has appointed such Officers and Ministers, as for that purpose her
Majesty has thought expedient, and there to pay and do in every behalf, as
though no such Proclamation of Adiornment had been had or made. And her Highness
further pleasure and commandment is, that all Sheriffs shall return their
Writtes and Process against all such Accomptants and detters at the days
therein appointed. And if any parson or parsons, who ought to account or pay
any sum or sommes of money to her Majesty in any the Courts and places
aforesaid, do make defaulte therein, That then her Highness Writtes and Process
shall be awarded, and sent forth against every such parson and parsons, (...) the
same to be duelye and orderly served and returned by the Sheriffs and Officers
thereunto appointed, in such like manner and form as the same should have been,
if this present Proclamation had not been made. And if any Sheriff or other
Officer shall make default or be negligent in serving, executing and retorning
of any the writtes and process aforesaid: That then every such Sheriff and
other Officer shall incur such pains and penalties, as by the said Courts,
or any of them shall be taxed and assessed: Willing and commanding all and every
her Majesty's Sheriffs, Officers, Ministers and subjects, to whom it does or
shall apperteyne, to observe and keep their assemblies and apparances, with
all their Retornes and certificates, in her highness said Courts at
Westminster, in Mensis Michaelis next coming, then and there to be holden and
kept, and there to do their offices and duties in every behalf, in like manner
and form as they should or ought to have done, if this present Proclamation
had not been had or made. As they will answer to the contrary at their
perils.

Given at our Manor of Otelands, the xvi. day of September, in the ninetenth
year of our reign.
