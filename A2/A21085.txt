THE History of Ariodanto and Ieneura, daughter to the King of Scotts, in
English verse, by Peter Beuerley.

Imprinted at London, by Thomas East, for Fraunces Coldocke.

To the Worshipful M. Peter Read, Peter Beuerley, wishes perfect felicity.
IF I had thought (right Worshipful) that Sla^ders tong^ could greter have
en^ed this my rude Book, then the ^how of my good will h^er^by unto you,
should ease my desirous mind, I would then have st^yed this bold enterprise,
which with hasarde of goo^ report I have attempted. But such is the affection
of a well meaning heart, that sooner it offers it self to the s^ightfull blotte
of scornful defame, then desire should want either by sign or deed, to
requit^ received benefittes. The tossed bark, seld finds the desired port,
without the storms of the air, the surges of the sea, and the force of the
enemy: and it is as hard for the idell merchant to increase his stock, as it
is for the cowarde Knight to gain lasting memory: So hard it is for me
(whose ability is as well known to your worship, as to my self) without the
poys^ned hate of the stinking tong^e, the malicious scorns of the envious
head, and the dispightfull scoffs of the shameless countenance, to advertise
you of my desirous mind, ready at all times to pleasure you. The enfection of
whose filthy jaws, I have rather chosen by happy adventure to escape, then
by lurking silence, still to re^aine an unknown welwiller. This only rests,
and this is it which seeks to stay my hasty hand: The simplenes of the
gift, which if you regard not, but think well of the willing giver, I live
happy, naught fearing the force of scorns blast. Thus wishinge to your
worship happy health, wealth to the best contentation of your heart, lasting
life, and to me (yours) ability once to answer your great courtesy. I end.
From my chamber at Staple June. the first day of August.

Your VVorshippe as his own Pe. Beuerley.
To the Reader.
TO thy friendly acceptance, (gentle Reader) more boldly then advisedly, I have
offered here y^ unripe fruits of my barren orchard, the bitter taste whereof, is
more liker to annoy thy sugared lips, then please thy longing mind. But see
as by diligent search, the laboring Be fyndes the wholesome honey amydst the
infectiue herb: So may thou (if thou list indifferently to read, and
carefullye to mark) hap the sage advise of good counsel, and learn by
others mischiefs to shun thine own decay. Thou know within the hard
shell shrowdeth the sweet curnell, and amongst pricking thorns the fragrant
Rose is fostred, within the hard flint (they say) the precious Diamound is
found, and amongst the v^perfectnes of my rude verse, the force of treason is
showed and his just desert. If thou can by falsehood learn to shun
disceite, I have my wish, and thou happy. If just revenge for foul oaence can
admonish thee to serve God, obey thy Prince, no doubt, but thou shall live an
honest life, and die thrice blessed.

Through two fields thy way is directed, the one full of briars, has the
perfect path to felicity: the other (more pleasant to the vicious mind)
leads to endless misery: choose with advise, and shun with discretion. And
to me thy unknown friend, lend (I pray thee, as fr^endly judgment, as I
shall wyshe for thy prosperous estate.

Farewell.
Ariodanto, and Ieneura.
AMongst the vanquished Regions,
that worthy brute did win:
There is a soil in these our days,
with Occean Seas cloasde in.
That fertile is, and peopled well,
and stord with pleasant fields:
And has for tillage lucky land,
that yearly profit yeeldes.
Within y^ land sometime there dwelt
a King of noble fame:
whose acts were such, as gaind to him
an everlasting name.
Who, when he Cepter long had held
and ruled his realm with right:
In quiet rest, in spite of foe,
and force of friendles might.
Did take to wife a noble Dame,
of egall Parentage:
Of bewty great, of virtues more,
and of a youthful age.
By whom he had a Daughter fair,
that ^oyed his aged years:
And pleasure great at length did bring
unto his hoary hears.
This child as tune began pass from her,
so bewty does increase:
And as in years she began to grow
so virtues to her prease.
Of sh^p^ and seemly favor, she
lackt naught that nature could
In goodli^st wise bestow of her.
or frame in fairest mould.
To this such gifts of heavenly hew,
full fraught with courtly grace:
And modest mirth, eke gentle mind
^re^aging royal race.
That who excels Ieneuora.
(for so this Lady hight:)
Or who more bewtifull then she,
or pleased more each sight.
For proof behold how swift report
does brute in foreign land:
This Princes name, her shape and hew
of each estate is scand.
The Kings that join unto her sire,
(...) seek her grace to win:
The Ladies eke that virtues love,
to serve her grace begin.
But see far of in Italy
this Ladies name is blown:
And there her gifts of n^turs art,
to all are lively known.
Where at that time two gentlemen
of honest family:
Italians both by birth and blood
and brothers there did lie.
The eldest namd Lurcanio,
that spear and sheld desird:
The other eke Ariodant,
that more to love aspierd.
These two y^ long had lived at home,
and loth^ with Idle life:
And moved eke with this report,
that every where is rife.
Are now agreed to leave this ease,
their friends and native soil:
And mind to seek adventures far
with weary travels toil.
And therefore first their land they sell,
for present payment told:
And other goods they do convert,
(for carriage light) to gould.
This don, their business eke dispatched
and heavy parting past:
From wailing friends that woe their will,
they leave the town at last.
And pass y^ mountainshie unknown
and seek the desert dales:
And escape by guide the raggy rocks
and tread the trodden vales.
Thus when their werie steps had scapte,
a thousand dangers past:
And that they needs must leave the land,
and yield to sail and mast.
To Neptunes will they do commit
them selves, and then do pray:
The master for to guide his ship,
to Scottish Realm the way.
So said, he keeps his bidden course,
and has a gale at will:
The mariner at case also,
his part does well fulfill.
So long these werie trauelers,
are tossed with sea and wind:
That now the long desired port,
and wyshed soil they find.
Then naught there is but hale and pull,
the Ancars are out cast:
The master has his earned hyre,
and prays their life long last.
This don, the brothers ask the way
that leads to the Court:
whereas the noble king of Scotts,
does keep his Royal port.
Which known, with speed they seek to see,
and in their ^rauell, they
devise their tale, their whole request
and chieflye, how they may
Get intertainment in the Court,
and how Lurcani^:
Should spokeman be for both, but see
whilst talking thus they go,
The wau^ring vanes of gleming gold,
that Phoebus cau^ed to shine:
App^re, and ^^ard up walls on hie,
that sed their gredy eyes.
They see the carved turrets tops,
they see the regal place:
The fight whereof had forced them run
a weary wandering race.
Thus are these strangers happily,
arrived at the Court,
Whereas this peerles Dame abides,
of whom ringes this report.
There walk they forth with comely grace
and enter in the hall,
Where after greating, they declare,
what chance had them befall.
To seek that land: their names they tell,
and eke of whence they are:
This told, one shows unto the king
of two arrived theare.
And word for word, as he had hard
he tells, and eke there state
And comlines he hides not:
Besides he does dilate.
Their friendly gretings, and their tal^
this said, he kneling stays.
The king that pawsing with him self,
and waying diverse ways,
What harm might lightly him ensue,
if such he should retain,
As under cloak of friendship, might
put him and his to pain:
I mean as might spy out the strength
of all his region:
And eke what corner weakest wear,
and easiest to be won.
And so when ^e in age should think,
to lead a surest life:
They should him force through their dece^
to end his days in strife.
These thoughts, this wise and wary pri^e,
does ponder in his brain
Long time, and in these doughtfull fitts,
he silent does remain.
Yet minds he not to let them part,
till what they would were known:
And till the cause of their ariue,
were plainly to him showen.
Wherefore he does bid call to him,
these strangers two in haste:
That banished have their native soil,
in his court to be plast.
Which message done, these brothers two,
as men nothing dismayed:
To speak before the Emperor,
whom erst they had obeyed.
Present themselves before the king,
where after silence done:
Lurcamo in their two names,
thus has his tale begone.
THat king, that first gave life to you,
increase your happy days:
(Oh king) and keep your noble court,
from force of foes always.
Whilst we Italian brothers two,
in Italy did dwell:
And whilste with ease we past the time,
as chance and t^es befet.
Behold report that wandering flies,
in every region:
Resound your name and worthiness,
at last unto the town
Where we abode consuming time
in drousie idelnes:
And spending aye our youthful years
in irksum quietness.
These childish toies thus lothd (I say)
these news agreing eke
with us, that thought each day a mo^th
till we the bands might break.
Of this long discontented life,
we do forthwith agree
All needful things at home dispatched,
this court of yours to see
And there if we might favor get,
and grace likewise obtain:
To serve your highness faithfully,
and loyal to remain:
Til death we mind. This forced has us
(O king) to leave our port:
Our friends, our goods, our kinsmen al
to whom we were comfort.
In hope to be retaind of you,
which is our whole request:
Wherein we trust for to perform,
that seems a courtier best.
The king that well had marked his tale
his countnaunce and his grace:
And saw him feawtred well of lim^
and of a warlike face.
And praising long within him self,
the youngest brothers chere:
That sober was presaging truth,
forthwith does banish fear.
And biddes these weary trauelers,
welcome unto the place
Desired long. And intertaines,
them both with friendly grace.
Into his court, commanding them,
all falsehood to expel:
And geues them pencions yearly,
wherewith they may live well.
Thus are these glad Italians,
new courtiers both become:
That seek each way to purchase love
as well of all as some.
THe king that for disport does use,
often times for to pursue:
The dreadful ^ase of gris^ie beasts,
so Idle life t'eschue:
Comma^nds the hunt prepared be,
the morrow next by prime:
And that each one appareld be,
in arms against that time,
To wait upon his highness then
that will on h^nting go:
And eke with him the strangers two
he does command also.
The night is past, and Sopor flies,
and in his steed Aurore
Does show her gladsome countenance
and for to joy the more
Each sight, ^r Phoebus golden rays,
from east begins tappeare,
then naught there is within the court,
but trud^ing here and there.
Sum saddels fit, sum armor scour
sum bridell foming steed:
And sum do wheat the steeled glaiue
to give the Bear his meede.
Sum trapers trim, sum couple dogs
sum wear in s^eede of steel,
A maled coat, with armed sword,
to make his enmies reele.
The pages trim their lords in haste,
the hunt cries loud away:
The steedes are forth, that stamping fast,
on champing bit do play.
The werbling note the hunter blows,
the king on courser strydes:
The lusty rought of knights make have,
that pri^ing forward glydes.
The hunt is up, the game is found,
each seeks a diverse way:
The noble rought of Che^alrie,
dispersed now do stray.
Some here do meet the tusked bore
some finds the Lyberd stout:
Some do encounter with the Bear
some rouse of Hearts a route.
Thus dog and man is occupied,
him self for to defend:
And for to gain a lasting name,
do stu^die strokes forth send.
The king in case has lost his mates,
and in his wandering, he
Finds, out a loathsome Lion coucht
that monstrous was to see.
whereto he makes a thundering course
with spear well set in rest:
the Lion rampant meets the staff,
that it to sheuers breast.
Then glaiue he draws like noble knight,
and strikes with courage stout:
And pricks, and breathes, and strikes again,
as one deuoide of double,
But all in vain those strokes are spent
his traunchfer, naught does carue,
But either slydes from side to side,
or in his hand does Swar^e.
Where at, he half aghast does fear,
least he were put to shame:
And least his former worthiness,
should end with vanquished name.
Wherefore he mightily defends
him self from Lions claws,
That rasethall attained to
with those his persing paws.
Yet warely warding since he could
nothing prevail in strength,
But ward, and stroke, are bootles spent
when down he must at length.
Thus as the Lion had the best,
and almost won the feelde:
Adventure drove Lurcanio
with Spear in hand and sheelde
To seek^ that place, but when he saw
his sovereign at the wurst,
No boot to bid him spur his steed^
and to the battle thrust.
For first he knightly brake his spear^
and after draws his blade,
wherewith within a moments space,
a large wound he had made,
Upon the Lions shoulder bone,
that caused him for to kneel^:
And then his head he carved of
and so made him to r^l^:
The king delivered thus from death,
by s^out ^urcanio,
With thousand thanks imbrased him
in both his arms also.
Till that his menn^ had (...) him out,
to whom he hidetu naught:
But how he nigh confounded was,
and how the straun^er fought.
In his defense so (...),
and with so mighty fo^ce,
That after many mortal wounds,
he parted head from dorse.
Now is report n^w occupied,
in blasing martial ^^ates:
Wherewith the court so pressed is,
that up to Skies it beats.
And flies to town both far and (...):
and now ascendes again,
And puts fame to w^rie t^yle,
and to an endless pain.
But to return, the king is ho^st,
that does for wer^es:
Leave of the chase, (...) homeward all
their diverse happes e^presse.
Thus talking, are these hunters ^^me
unto the Pa^^as gates.
Where each disarmes his werie bone^,
and welcomes home his mates.
There naught is talked within the Court,
but of the strangers might
And how he nobli^ saude their liege,
and killed his foe in fight.
The Ladies do extol this act,
up to the cloudie skies:
The knights by heap^s of his great strokes
do diuersiy d^uise.
The night renewes his careful course,
^itanis lodgd in west,
All seek their soft and quiet bed
their weary bones to rest.
Ariodant (that longs to see
this long desired Dame)
Is also coucht in tumbling bed,
where he records her name.
A thousand times, and thus consumes
half Iunos wanny race:
And if ^e sl^pe, he dreams strait ways
of that most heavenly face.
The Cock crows forth his dawning note:
the day stars shows in east,
The Nightingale the gladsem tunes
sings out with cheerful breast.
The courtiers rise that use dispor^es,
as pleases best their will,
Some Hanks reclayme, some Coursers ride
and some do dance their fill.
Some is ye in reading Histori^s,
and se^^ in Musikes art,
Thus time is spent in comely sports,
as pleases best their heart.
Now is the King at dinner set,
there waytes Ariodant,
That is the siem^i^st of them all,
and one that no^ght does want.
Of natures craft, by whom the King
does send a couerd mease:
To Princes fair Ieneuora,
that is his life's increase.
This message does Ariodant,
perform in seemliest wies:
Who kn^^ling does the cates present
before her crist^ll eyes.
The Lady thanks the messenger,
and gives him in reward:
A costly gem, which he receives,
but naught he does regard.
The gift so much, as that her look,
which is so fixed in heart:
That from that time he holds it fast,
till life from lims do part.
And she again (that marked has
so well his comely face:
His shape, his view, his countnance grave,
and eke his semely grace.)
Says in her heart this same is he
whom I in breast will shrine:
Till sisters three with fatal reele
my vital web untwine.
Thus Venus child has tainted two
with his sharp persing dart:
And yet unknown to both it is,
how each joys others heart.
Ariodant that clokes (^ say)
this hot new kindled fire:
(His duty done) departs again,
with gain of double hire.
And makes his waiting very short,
and thunnes the taste of meat,
And to his chamber hi^ss in have,
to cool his scorching heat:
There does he often record her talk,
he sees her similing cheer,
He sees those colors angellyke,
h^ sees her ^listring hear.
He viewes (he thinks) those Rubic libb^s
that thankt him for his pain,
He feels (he thinks) those azurd veins
that gave him that great gain:
But when he sees he is deceiud,
a thousand sighs depart,
With floods of tears, and d^adly sobbe^
out from his careful ha^t.
And thus begins a long discourse
of this new t^sted fit,
Which as I can I shall declare,
thou Pa^ias guide my ^it.
From whence proceeds this ^inching pain,
and griefs of deadly smart?
Orel^ what ^ct has c^aunged thus
(oh soole) thy joyful heart,
That thus thou lothst those pleasant sports,
that here in Court are use,
And seekst a drousi^ caban touch
thy wonted mirth refuse?
Tell what has made this soden change,
bewray these griefs of mind,
The pacient, when the wound is green?
a salve does soonest find.
A salve Alas^ it is booteles wynd,
Its death that must me cure:
My wound does festred lie in heart,
and will till life endure.
(Oh fool) that so were fed with fame,
such toil to undertake
For her, that naught does rue thy care,
ne sorrows none will make.
For thee, and yet she is the cause,
that thus thou do sustain,
These griping griefs of grisly death
which will foraye remain.
Oh cr^ell hap and destenie,
oh wight unfortunate,
Oh catiue vile, unhappy thrice,
and borne to cruel fate.
What joy did take thy idell brain,
when thou did see her face,
Thus to be trapt with heaps of grief
in so short time and space.
Oh Cokadrill of Uenus shape
why have thou thus beguild?
The wight, that for thy fame him self
from nature soil exyld.
But how is that known unto her
whom blameles I accuse?
Or why should I uncivil beast
that worthy shape abuse?
Whose outward show presageth truth,
and store of courtesy,
As lately by her great reward
was showd sufficiently.
No, no, it is he that works my woe,
who forces Kings to love,
That bl^^dly shotes his peysned dart
from stately throne above.
That Cupide stroke mis^celes ghost
full well I know, when I
Beheld that goodly countenance,
with two fast persing eye.
Wherefore his dome I must obey,
though love venegall be:
And though I spend my youthful days
in this vile misery.
This doleful tale, thus ^ould, the tears
proceed from swelling eyes:
By streams, and now the grievous grons
increase his woeful cries.
Now hope reu^ues his dying limbs,
despair now drives in death:
And now does fear make senses fail,
and stop his vital breath.
Thus long he spends a lingering life,
and craves a happy day:
Or else he wills by greedy grave,
his last fate for to pray.
But to speak of Ieneuora.
and to recount her ^ittes:
And how in closet she does fare,
as one ber^ued of wits:
My pen should rather meisture want
to write that I intend:
Then store of cares for to dilate,
that would whole volumes spend.
For after she had known his name,
and how an aliant borne
He was, her heart began to cool,
as one welny forlorn.
And thus with faultring tongue she said,
why sekest thou longer life:
That by this ^ct deseruest death,
with point of bloody knife.
Oh catiue vile, and vylest wretch,
that lives under skies:
And may not race of Royal blood,
thy foolish mind suffice?
Nor noble line of Scottish soil
where thou may choose a fear:
Thy childish will at full content,
but thou must hold him dear.
That has through theft exild him self
or else by murdring hand:
Estrangd him from his earlish kin,
and now seeks foreign land?
Will thou assotted be of him,
that like a wandering slave:
Is come unto thy fathers court,
some liuelihood to have?
What, seekst thou to shame thy self,
and to abuse thy kin?
And myndst thou thus to purchase hate,
in hope a slave to win.
A slave. Oh spiteful sting of hate,
for Ladies far unfit:
Why do I thus with poysned words,
misuse my praised wit.
Why should I term him felon eke
that is so gracious:
Or else of murder him accuse
that is so courteous?
Wh^ do I live to call him slave
that is the comliest wight,
That ever scapte from natures hands
or ever past my sight?
And if that lackt, his brothers deed
would show his race right well,
Whose worthy rescue of the King
does make his name excel.
Therefore as I am Princess true,
I vo^n Ariodant.
By him that Skies and Earth did frame^
and trees and herbs did plant,
Til lise does leave my careful corpse
to love thee faithfully,
As ever Lady loved her feere,
in spite of vile adversity.
She said, and down to ground she falls
in sound, and draws no breath
Long time, as one that had re^ind
her life to wished death.
And when she does revive again,
the stilling tears depart
Like silver drops from drowned ^yes,
and gastlie sighs from heart.
Thus leaves she Ladies company,
and shunnes each kind of sport,
In steed whereof, to desert walks,
she daily does resort.
Where sundry thoughts opresse her mind:
now fear for to obtain
Like love of him, for whom she does,
these passions hard sustain:
And now the Kings consent she fears,
whose hest she must obey,
And eke whose mind is chiefly bent
tencrease her slate each way.
These arguments full fraught with doubt
are rise within her brain,
And if she find one pleasant thought
a thousand griefs remain.
Like fittes do saint Ariodant,
that wandering here and there:
Can find no plare to case his pain,
nor damp his doughts of fear.
Wherefore his blo^d consumes away,
his sleshe to boanes do fade,
His color when as clod of clay
most like a senseless shade.
The youthful suits which erst he ware
vnworne do ^ye in chest,
And now the black and tawny hew
does please this heavy gest.
In fine, these fittes so much annoye
his weary irksum life:
That now he seeks unhappy man,
to fall on persing knife.
Lurcanio, that marks this change,
and sees with woo this state:
And fears least that he might be wayle
his brothers grief^ to late.
Spies out at length both time, and place,
for to discharge his mind
To him, and listing tare required,
spends thus his boteles wind.
HOw long shall these consuming fittes
increase thy brothers g^iefe:
From whom (unkind) thou hidst thy cares,
that seeks for thy relief.
What meaues (I say) these p^ning pains,
whence springs these sluddes of care:
What fever fit has forced thee,
thus ruth^ully to fare?
Why speak thou not? why stays thy tou^g
disclose thy long disease.
And wylt thou thus with shortning days
the heavenly ghostes displease?
If sickness do opresse thy corpse,
then physics counsel use,
If fond conceytes of matters past,
do forse thee for to muse,
And shun the joys that here be used,
then seek sweet musikes art,
Which will (they say) all heavy dumps,
to joyful fittes conuart.
Perhaps the apre of this land,
thy nature does dytest:
And makes thee thus to feel disease,
and taste unquiet rest.
If that it be, no fear of death,
time will wear that away,
As earstit did, when in the Sea^
this part we learnd to play.
But what does mean this mourning w^eds
and loths^me tawnic hew,
As though thou had thy fredom lost,
to serve fond Uenus crewe.
If so thou have, advise thee well,
so choice be egall plaste,
Beware in time, shun froward dame,
least wind, and words be west.
By proof I say (my brother) I,
this lesson short is true.
The Faulkner seld is suer of Hawk,
till she be close in mewe.
Therefore let wits be guide to deeds,
thou warnd may learn to live,
Shun thraldoms yocke thy brother biddes,
that does this council give.
Ariodant that hard this speech,
but reason naught esteemed,
With strayned voice thus answer made,
as one with care consumd,
(As you have said my brother dear)
a lethsome life I lead,
But whence, or where, or he wit comes
it is h^^ from me in deed.
No qua^taine fit has freated me,
ne fury fond of mind,
Ne change of skies, but gods above,
th^^ ^lage have just assingd,
For my fore passed days in sin,
wherefore let this content,
Thy doutfull head, since just it is
which Jove himself hathsent.
Think you these toys of veneire
^ should lodg^ within my brain:
Or Ladies love in hope to win,
should make me thus sustain
Those s^orching griefs, and pyning pains.
and storm^ of deadly smart?
No, no, those fittes most ferdest be
from my unskillful heart.
Wherefore, in (...), I thus conclude,
as sin did smart deserve,
So Jove that high and mighty God,
from pity will not swerue.
This answer made, ^urcanio
d^parts with pleased mind,
Now de^ing least but word for word
as he had hard to find.
Ariodant (that naught was moved
to leave his wanted woes.
For brothers words to whom his love
he hates for to disclose)
Does still consume a weary life,
with endless griping pain,
And daily fear augments his doole
least love be voud in vain.
Besides thinks he, if she should yield
like love to my desert:
And then by love unequal we
should foresed ^e to part:
These eyes should never s^e again
the rays of Titans light,
But poison strong, or bathed blade,
my desprat death should dight.
But yet if she would rue my care,
I ^orst not Princely might:
For rather then the love should slacke^
we suro would make a flight.
And better it is in my conce^t,
to live in pouer^ie
With joy, then in these cancred car^s,
to t^st flouddes of prosperity.
For i^ye bryngs health to aged limbs,
when cares consume the corse,
And joy does make l^ng life to men,
when couples care deuorse.
What profits wealth to ^yu^ in woe,
what gyines possessi^ns great,
When heart is ve^t continually
with cares of fiery heat?
The best and happy state I count
in this unstable life:
Is pleasure plast with quietness.
denoyde of storms of strife.
Should we then let in hope to find
this wi^h^^ ^^litie
To leave a Princ^^^ Pallas fraught
with this ^yle misery.
And is it not better tail for ^ence
with willing sweat of browe,
And laboryng hand to dyg and d^lue.
or else to dryu^ the plowe:
And then when labor finished is
to sit by t^sting fire:
And sing, and why^^le mirely,
with gain of earned hyre?
Then here in court to go as brave,
as rays of glistryng Sun:
And have a heart that daily seeks,
his vital breath to shun?
Besides what shame can turn to us,
to live in soil not known:
For banished wights, but laboring souls,
to toil to keep our own.
Oh that these words might once proceed
from those thy rub^e ^ippes:
Whos^ countnance, shape, and comlines,
has forced me feel these fittes.
For at the least till thou shall take
some pity of my care:
These grie^s, and pa^gs of wished death
my ghost will never spare.
Thus makes his faltring tengue an end,
and he on tumblyng bed
Does cast his weak and weary lyins,
when now from troubled ^ead
Does pass, and soft and slumbring ^^cape.
and now in dream appear,
Two ladies dect with robes of gould
that purpu^ have do wear:
Upon their heads two crowns they had,
well set with precious stone,
And in their hand Ieneuora,
that semd to make great moan.
Thus past they soorth with stately steps,
and now approach the place
Where he does lie, and thus begins
the one with seemly grace.
Behold thine own, (Ariodant,)
whom cares of love do kill,
Whose life and death thou skillesse houldst,
to save or else to spill.
At length let pity placed ^e,
within thy friendly breast,
That she may gain, and thou not lose,
the fruits or wished rest,
(Quod (...)), and than the other said,
How long shall freating pain
Consume her Rosiat color that
all earthly shapes does stain.
See here unkind whilst thou do sleep,
and take thy quiet ease,
Ieneuora does feel for thee
the fittes of vi^e disease.
Wherefore dispatch, ca^ sleep away
bring health to her again:
That since she (...) did see thy corpse,
has felt this pyning pain.
These words had scarsly left her lips
when they wear out of sight:
And he that care had choked me,
and fed with great delight,
To see his Lady and hi^ love,
in presence face to face,
And gone again so suddenly,
before he could embrace
Her tender limbs, these sights I say
has forced him to awake:
But when he knows it is a dream
an cut cry he does make,
As though his heart had felt the st^he,
of fires untimely death,
And like as if ^o lofty Skies,
he (...) resing^^ his breath.
And does it not suff^se (quoth he)
a w^kyng wight to wrong,
With h^pes (...) undeser^ed p^ynes,
and fittes of death among.
But (...), and fond alu^^ns two,
must help for to augment,
My scorching cares that long or this,
my life had welnye spent?
O^ ^row^ing goods and merci^es,
that seek to feed my v^yne,
with fond perswa^ions, that my love
is quite with love again,
These eyes saw my Ieneuora,
that s^d to pyne away.
Because she ferd to joy my loue^
as Ladies two did say^
which were the heauenliest creatur^
that erst mine eyes did see,
Bedect with gold, and crowns they had
and suer Gods they be.
Oh blessed sight, and joyful news,
to good for troth I fear:
And may it be that thou thus farest
for him that houlds the dear.
Then fie of care, and farewell couch,
rejoice in joy my heart,
For then within my skyn shall lodge
^no more this daily smart.
But why should I thus trust in dreams
that fancies be of mind:
And eke unconstant grounds of troth,
as writers have definde.
At least a dream is contrary,
and then to true in deed
It is, that loathsome loves despair
my griping griefs does feed.
Yet Poets say that dreams be true
and things to come foreshowes,
For proof, they tell a doleful dream,
that Creasides ghost well knows.
And wast not told Andromaka,
in vision plain by night:
That Hector should the morrow next,
depart from life by fight?
If Poets fail, let Scripture serve,
and did not Pharao breame:
What great increase, and derth likewise
should hap unto this Realm?
And Joseph saw in slumbring sleep,
what honor should befall
To him, and how his brothers shefes,
before his shefe did fall.
These prove y^ dream is messenger
of good and bad ensue:
As warning sent from God above
these sinful deeds teschue.
Therefore in hope of happy hap,
despair I do deste:
And henceforth bouldly I do intend
to seek some remedy.
And if such lotte belotted me,
as I may her inioye,
No more these cares I do protest,
my senses shall annoy.
Now is the pacient plai^^er laid,
to his long fretted wou^d:
And now his wits he calls to him,
to help with counsel sound.
He leaves those careful couches now
he seeks to salve his sore,
As ^ne that shunnes the furious meats,
instruct by Phisickes lore.
The desert wal^es which erst he tr^d,
are desert now for him:
And now remembrance of his dream
reioyseth in every limme.
In fine his care does now consist,
only for to disclose:
His fittes unto Ieneuora,
and his long tasted wors.
Wherein so wisely he has wrought,
and played so well his part:
That now by life or else by death,
to ease his laden heart.
a means he finds.
When Cupid had with poysned dart,
performed his full intent,
Upon these silly lovers two,
and forced them to consent.
(Unknown to both,) unto his lore,
by mutual burning love:
He left each wayling others chance,
and clymes to skies above.
But she alas) whose color sh^wes,
the passions of her mind:)
Stays not to wayle her bitter chance,
with tears and was^ed wind.
And still complaynes in secret wise,
of this consuming fit:
Which for to ease, she cries to death,
her heart in have to slit.
The Ladies crave by gentle means
to know her cause of care:
But she (with skill) naught more than that
detesteth to declare.
The night is past with tumbling often
within her weary bed:
And seld or never does approach
one sleep unto her head.
In stead whereof contrary thoughts
do occupy her brain,
And then whole floudes of brokish tears
depart from eyes amain.
Her moystie pilow she does leave
long or the day appear:
And rechlesly she deckes her self,
naught forcing what she wear.
Thus clothd, she spends welny the day
in temple much devout.
Accompanied with one alone,
(and not with glistring rout.
Of Courtly dames) this Lady has
in charge her book to bear,
As one that for her parentage
the Princes held full dear.
This soon espide Ariodant,
that long had sought to find
Convenient place, and time as fit,
to utter out his mind,
Which seen, welcome the time (he says)
of me desired long:
Wherein I hope to be releast,
of this my solom song.
For if I may such friendship find,
of her that bears the book:
As ones to wait in stead of her,
for more I do not look.
Then shall my plaint, which written first,
and cold in secret wise:
Within the book, disclose my care,
^t full before her eyes.
Wherein she shall perceive also,
the fittes of my disease:
And how my cause to her I yield,
to order as she please.
And if she be of nature good,
Though she disdain my name:
Yet will she keep it secretly,
that thereby grow no blame.
And if she hate to rue my care,
I know the end of all:
The worst is, that my desperate corpse
on goring knife shall fall.
But if she take me to her grace,
who lives in better plight:
Or who can vaunt of greater bliss,
or is^a happier wight?
T^us he concludes and finds out time,
and place, and now does crave:
Of her that daily bears the book,
the carriage for to have.
The morrow, when her Lady does
to chapel take the way:
Which frienship showd, shall bind me yours
for to remain always.
(He said). And she y^ knew no guile,
^e what was his intent,
Ercept to get the Princes grace,
his wily head was bent.
Which by that means might soon be won
and then the fruits of gain:
As hopte reward for seruitur,
in recompenes of p^yne.
As moud with terms of courtesy,
does yield unto his will:
Who frindly said you have your ^est
your mind I do fulfill.
Therefore see that to morrow next,
about the hour of eight:
You give attendance in this place,
in my stead for to weight.
Ariodant with thousand thanks,
requites this freindly grant:
And voues for her in all assaies,
his power shall not want.
Thus part they two, the Lady shee^
to Princes grace again:
Does hie: And he, in chamber close
does take no little pain.
In writing out at large, the cause
of his long proved woe,
And when, and where, and how he did,
his li^^rtie forgo.
First how her fame, did force him leave
the joys of native land:
And taught him skale the craggie rock,
and ^aile by fearful sand.
Then how by soden sight, her shape
did steal from him his heart:
Since when, he tells how he has felt,
the pains of mortal smart.
Herein he makes a long discourse,
and ends with answer craud,
In gentlest wise, that might have moved,
a heart of stone I graud.
This letter made, and sealed with war,
he hides in secret wise:
And all that night, in stead of sleep,
he does thereof devise.
Sometime a loathsome thought, does bid
him leave his rash intent:
And reason tells him thousand doughtes,
his purpose to prevent.
Sometime, he fears least rechlesly,
she might his letter lease:
Or else bewray it to her Sire,
his hory ^ead to please.
See here the seed that lovers sow,
whereof does spring the grain:
Of doughtfull bliss, that subject is,
to drought and storms of rain.
But fear or shame or dought of death,
can naught this lover move:
Though silence if he could have choosd,
seemde best for his behoue.
And for to move Ariodant,
his wylfull path to shun:
As easy it wear to see the stream,
against the tide to run.
Auroras bo^mes has banished night:
sir Phebe does vaunt in East,
Whose pleasant hew, rejoices byrds
and joys both man, and beast.
Ariodant forsakes his bed,
he fears to come to late:
He prays the happy Mercury,
to send him happy fate.
Now is he come unto the place,
where he was warnd to stay:
And thinks long till Ieneuora?
to Chapel go to pray.
The Princes is at tired now,
she calls for her book:
Whereon she daily wonted is,
in temple for to look.
The Lady does present her self,
before his mistres eyes:
With book in hand Ieneuore,
in have to chapel hyes.
They pass wheras^ Ariodant
does stand in readiness:
To have the promise now performd
which erst I did express.
She was as mindful of her grant
as he of his request:
And therewith gave to him the book,
which she in hand has pressed.
He folowes our Ieneuora,
she backward does retire:
His letter in the book is cold,
as he would best desire.
The Princes is come to the pew,
where wonted she does pray,
He humbly yield to her the book,
and so departes away.
But when she saw Ariodant,
whom more then life she loud,
(As one amazd) the blushing blood,
from wonted course is moud:
Which drives away the color pale,
which erst was in her face:
(A sign they say of tried truth,
and store of giltles grace)
In doughtful plight the Lady kneels
if vision she had seen:
Or if conceit of idle brain,
the cause thereof had been.
The truth it self does hardly lodge,
within her doutfull head:
Besides the novelties thereof,
have ^ouell fancies bread.
In these conceits, she opes the book
the letter is deseride:
She languisheth till that theffect
thereof she has espide.
With ravish brayn she has purusd.
her lovers doleful plaint:
And twenty times she does unread,
how love did him attaint.
She reads (with ruth) is terms of grace
and eke her answer craud:
His vowed troth, for ay she reads,
which in her heart is graud.
What should I say, the happy news
with ancient woes contend:
So diversely, within her corpse,
that backward she does bend.
In sound, as one that longer had
no power to fost^r life:
Among her vexed limes, (I say)
there is such mortal stri^e.
Thus neuel joys have won the field
and banished woe away:
And gasping life and breathing breath,
do help to part the fray.
The banished blood retires again,
the dampishe could is fled,
Assured hope confounds despair,
and conquers drowsy dred.
Her sco^ched heart has mois^ure fosid
her scared joints are strong,
The burning beat, and Isie could,
that troubled her so long.
Are quite exild, and in their steed,
the Elements do rule
Indiffrently, and hasty health,
begins for to recule.
See here, the wise Chyrurgion,
has found one sal^e to cure
His own disease, and hers, that did
in woe long time endure.
Oh happy thryse Ariodant,
thy pacient well may far:
When as thy letter has such grace,
to banish cares away.
For as by pearsi^g look, each one,
became eahe others thrall:
And as by dome of Cupids might,
in bondage they did fall:
So b^ Melp^mens sugared style,
new freedom each possessed,
He by his letter gaynd that he wuld,
an^ she that pleased her best.
WHen dying fits constraynd by joy,
had lost their chokyng force:
And gasping breath, began to rule,
in late forsaken corse,
When lively blood, which erst forsook
his wanne and swelling heat:
Had vanquished death from every part,
and pulces fast began beat:
Then with two streams of joyful tears,
the letter bathed is:
And twyse ten thousand times I think,
the paper she does kiss.
Now does she finely close it up,
and puttes it next her breast,
Again unfolded now it is,
now reads she his request.
She came to Temple much devout,
devotion mo^d her mind:
But to the Gods, this rau^sht dame,
in prayers spends small wind.
she rather seek^s which way she may
^^haue her to her love:
And eke which way, they best may work
for both their best behoue.
She thinks it sin to deal with him,
as some coye Dames do use:
To feed him with a ^ayre look,
and after him refuse.
She rather minds, (to case his care)
an answer for to send:
Wherein like cause, like fits and woe,
she myndeth shall be pend.
but least the gasing eye might view
the secrets of their mind:
And least their lavish letters sent,
might raise a sclaundrous mind:
S^e does devise a secret means
how he, without suspect
May easily those letters find,
which are to him direct:
And she may have, at that self place
the answer of her friend,
And so, each one may partner be
of others faithful mind.
With these conceits, the burning chair
does clyme on hiest heaven,
The Clock agrees with the Sun,
and says it is ^leuen.
The Lady wayteth by the pewe,
and has three hours large:
Her only prayer is to God,
that others hah her charge.
Thus are her mistres orisons,
in order said each one:
Her homeward countnance shows how that,
her God has easd her moan.
Yet modestly her smiling eyes,
with sober look is clad:
She means her mirth with solom chere
although not all so sad.
Thus has she left y^ temples rights,
to Court she hies again:
She tasted there late lot^ed mea^es,
she filles with joy her brain.
The Ladies smile to s^e this change.
the King does hear this news,
His heavy heart does leap for joy,
he does no longer muse.
But he (poor soul) Ariodant,
when he with quaking cheer:
And shaking hand, had geu^ the book
unto his La^ydaere:
His hasty steps do leave the pewe,
his prayers soon are done:
And secretly in chamber he
thus has his tale begone.
What wants there now Ariodant?
what is there now behind?
What hard attempt is yet undone?
or what is in thy mind?
Not yet performd, thou may atcheue,
and bring unto an end,
Before the grievous ghastly grenes,
thy woeful heart does rende.
Behold these eyes of mine, have seen
the last of all thy joy:
And this unhappy head to late,
does wayle thy great annoy.
Oh friendles wretch, y^ heuens agree,
to see thy fatal fall:
And these thy endless doleful plaints
are joy unto them all.
Else, had thy folly never forced
thee to attempt this joy:
Which scand, and judged indifferently,
depriues thee of thy joy.
Think thou her noble heart ca^ brook
thy gross unequal love:
Who for her shape and s^melines,
might match with Gods above.
Think thou, with pati^^ce she can view
the folly of thy brain:
Whose passing wisdom, well approude
all earthly wits does stayne.
Think thou to escape without thy hire,
of him that rules the lant?
Think thou thy wandering letter, sound,
of all shall not be scand?
Oh witles wretch when steed is ^c^n^,
thou see what may ensue:
But when thou meughst thou could not tle^
a pre^ent harm eschew.
Oh more then thryse unhappy wight,
each open mouth shall sound
To Skies thy shame, when thy vile corpse
forgot shall lodge in ground.
Dispatch therefore, why stays thy hand
to give thy heart his meede:
Whose foolish lust, and fond desire,
was causer of this deed.
And therwithall he vrew his blade,
his desperate part to play:
But reason with her wholesome skyll,
forced hasty hand to stay.
Nay rather yield thou fool (quoth she)
to reasons sound advise:
Who greater fits then thou do feel,
can cure with a tryse.
Will thou with desperate death deserve,
the pains of lasting smart:
That may with eased mind a while
find salve to heal thy heart?
Perchance thy Lady does require,
thy love with love again:
Why will thou then till troth be known
with dread increase thy pain.
Perchance or this her heart has felt,
for thee like fittes and care,
And truth it is, she crased is,
and heauely does fare.
And wait not be that Cupide is
a judge indifferent:
Who for ta^gment your joys the more,
does thus your lymmes torment,
But love, thou say, unequal plast
is causer of thy care:
(Ah fool) and have thou now forgot,
how Cupide none will spare.
And is not King, and Kayser perst
with his artylerie?
and know thou not how (blinded) he
at ventures lettes it fly?
Can thou alone then suffer shame,
(if shame a man might call
An honest love, when worlds of men
to love are hound and thrall?)
Suppose the King might know thy love,
what harm can then ensue:
Himself or this could hardly shun,
the sparks of Uenus crewe.
Wherefore, let thought be fordest, from
the bounds of quiet heart:
And with advise what is best to do,
these passions set apart.
Thy Lady is a gentill Dame,
her beauty does declare:
Who for to ease thy greedy mind,
an answer will not spare.
Crave once again the carriage of
the book, thou late did bear,
And in the carriage search the book,
if ought be lodged there:
Perchance as thou did first invent
so she will now devise:
And will her answer there enclose,
thy mind for to suffice.
These thoughts, (as Phoebus clears the sky)
from foul infectiue mist:
Do ease his mind, ^ banish thought,
out from his cloudy breast.
In western seas swift Phae^on,
does plunge his gleaming chair,
And in his steed the gliding stars,
^oth compass lofty air.
When in his bed Ariodant
does couch his heavy head:
In hope to sleep but fanstes new,
do rule in Sopros stead.
The Princes is to closet gone
not rekles of her friend,
And least her deeds might be espide,
the door is locked and pynd.
Then takes she paper, pen, and Ink,
and thus writes to her own:
Take this (not as an answer sent)
from one to thee unknown.
But let these lines be guide to thee,
which way thou may attain,
Unto my answer, craved that does,
by Olive tree remain.
Kepayre therefore Ariodant,
to privy gardayn where:
Under the mighty Olive tree,
by me lies hidden there.
That thou did crave, this may suffice,
at f^ll thy longing mind:
Till more at large, at fitter time,
thou shall my answer find.
(This done) she takes an other shet^
of paper, which does serve:
To answer to his letter sent,
for which he nie does sterue.
Therein she blisseth thryse the time
when he did tread on ground:
Of Scottish Realm, whose like (quoth she)
in earth can not be found.
Therein she blisseth eke him self,
that would take such great pain:
To see so mean a wight as she,
in whom does not remain.
Half that great praise, which he bestows,
on her unworthy shape:
Which is the worst that ever did,
from natures hands escape.
Then dolefully she does lament,
his long sustained woe:
His pining fittes, unquiet rest,
his cares she rues also.
Now is the time, when Uenus first
did thrall her to her lore:
Declared eke, and care, for care,
she does requi^e, and more.
Now does she, (like an Oratres)
persuade him to be true:
She vows by Jove to shun the paths,
that she wills him eschew.
What should I say, she tells y^ time,
she tells the secret place:
When either, other person, may
without suspect embrace.
Until which time, she wished him,
amendment of his fittes:
With thousand joys, which to declare,
would trouble sore my wits.
Well weary hand and watched eye,
seek now long shunned rest:
As sleep to work thy drousie charm,
at hand is ready pressed.
This night, the glad Ieneuora,
of sleep receives more:
Then in six months and odd (I think)
she did receive before.
Ariodant (as Merchant tossed
with storms from kenned land:
That fears by rock, or swallowing goulfe,
his deaths day is at hand)
Dispayring lies, and dreadful thoughts
oppress his crased mind:
And doughting most that battred bark,
so soon good port should find,
Yet as he had concluded, he
by break of day does rise:
And in dispite of fortune, minds
tachtefe his interpryse.
Ieneuora, (though heavy head,
did crave more golden sleep,)
Is not unmindful of her charge:
ne longer bed does keape.
But long before Ariodant,
she does unknown arise:
And with her letter hastily,
to privy garden hies.
And as she had devised erst,
within her little scrowle:
She hides it by the Olive tree,
unknown to any soul.
That done, to warm an easy bed
(not waking any wight,)
She plies again, and lies till
Aurora gives light.
Then up she startes, and decks her self,
with costly robes of gould:
Her glistring hear, in sumptuous call
the courtly Dames do ^ould.
Then close in closet she does put
the scrowle into the book:
Which first she made, of purpose, y^
her friend thereon should look.
That done, she thus commaundes her mayd^
if he does come this day:
That last did bear the book, when I,
to chapel went to pray.
And crave the book again of you,
graune him (quoth she) his mind,
The stranger shows a courtiers part
it comes from gentill mind.
With duty done, the Lady graunts,
unto her, Ladies will:
That in her stead does wish he had,
of waiting full his fill.
Ariodant, abides n^we,
in his appointed place:
But fearfulnes compels him hyde,
his blushing, bashful face.
Till that the Princes past the place,
where lurking he did stay:
She is scarce gone, when secretly,
the Lady he does pray.
Once more in steed of her to wait,
and carriage for ^o have:
Of paayer book, she graunts it him,
he has that he did crave.
Then secretly the fearful man,
does pry within the book:
The scrowle he finds, and takes it out,
he cannot therein look.
For fervent joy: he puts it up,
she is now come to pewe:
He geues y^ book with blushing face,
his Lady that does vewe.
Her smiling chere, bids him farewell:
his hasty foot does part:
These friendly looks, which after that
for ever lodge in heart.
This longing lover is aryud,
at chamber, now in have:
He opes y^ scrowle, and word for word,
he finds in order plast.
As erst I could: he heues his hands,
and streacht out arms to skies:
His clothes he bathes with gushing tears,
that run from swelling eyes.
His joy is in her secretnes,
that minds not to disclose:
His preferred love, as by thappointted
place he does suppose.
For though (quoth he) the answer be
not as my fancy would:
Yet by this means to show my mind,
no doubt I may be bold.
And though she now does light esteem,
and will not hear my plaint:
In tract of time my fittes I trust,
her stony heart may taint.
For rust in time, will canker in
the gad of sturdy steel:
And littel worm in tract of time,
does make the Oak to reele.
In time, by drops of raynie dew,
the fi^ie ^^int does freat:
In time also the beating sea,
the ruggie rock does eat.
And may not then in time my sobbes
and tears, from drowned eyes:
Pearse gentil heart, whose nature is,
to rule on woeful cries?
Besid^ if looks may move me think
my love she does requite:
IN need no greater proof then that
whereof I late had sight.
For did not color change in face,
when she beheld me fast:
First read as any Rose in May,
and pale again at last?
Some say that these be arguments,
of vexed, and troubled mind:
And sonest seen in lovers face:
(as I in writers find.)
But why do I thus spend the time,
in dought, and doughtfull toys:
When answer seen and once perusd,
may ease perhaps annoyes.
And there withal, like greedy wolf,
nigh sterued for his pray:
He ^eaues his talk and hastily
to gardin takes the way.
Where privily, at bidden place,
he seeks with curious eyes:
The answer which his Lady did,
for him of late deuyse.
The joyful man has found it out,
his labor now is don:
He leaves the gardin for that night,
he does to lodging run.
Where carefully, he does unfold,
the letter clos^^ie sealed:
And reads eke by surcumstance,
that was by dream reueald.
And (as I said how she extolles,
his shape unto the skies:
And how of her renoumed grace,
she basely can devise.
Then how she rewes y^ scorching fits
which he so long has felt:
And then as touching her ill rest
how love with her has dealt.
Next that, her wise persuasion he
with leaping heart does reed:
Then fi^ed faith and plighted troath,
till death does crave his meed.
Oh happy news, oh joyful lives,
oh sentence glad pronounst:
That makes h^ seek for ravished wits,
that so in cares wast trounst.
Come help y^ Mountain Ladies al,
and leave Pernassus hill:
Come help me with your sugared style
my charge for to fulfill.
And thou, oh Spring of eloquence,
come help to guide my hand:
That rudely does presume to write,
in verse but grossly scand:
Of joys, that had their ginning first
of black and loathsome fittes:
Come help therefore Apollo thou,
to wheat my dulled wits.
And help oh knights of Cupid^ crew
on whom ^ame Uenus smiles:
To write of bliss, and more the joy,
that floudes of cares exiles.
For your report must make my skill
by prou^e I naught can write:
Of joys, although (y^ more my ruth)
of cares I can indight.
But since the listing ear does wait,
to hear how he does fare:
That late receiud these gladsome news
such wind I now will spare.
And since both Musts, Gods, and Men,
disdain to rue my plaint:
You must with baser verse, (my lords)
your learned heads acquaint.
Therefore, when hungry eyes had (...),
long time on pleasant news:
And gladness bad his pining corse,
s^^h mourning to refuse.
With bowed knee, his joined hands,
to hautie heaven he houldes:
And then unto the mighty Jove,
he thus his mind vnfouldes.
Perpetual praise immortal God,
(that all of naught did frame)
Be dew to thee, and lasting grace,
be given unto thy name:
That from the top of hiest heaven
to deepest vale below:
Do (like a gentell Savior,)
on me such pity show.
Whose sinful deeds, do daily move,
thy godly mind to ire:
And purchase eke, (by just desert,)
the pains of dreadful fire.
Thy goodness (Lord) no ^ong can tell,
ne head can well devise:
No p^ can paint such worthy praise,
as may thy deed suffice.
My heart unable is to think,
t^y goodness showd to me:
That with thy might, have socourd one,
quite drowned in misery.
For was not I the wofulst wretch,
that lived under skies:
Consumd with care, nigh chockt with sobbes,
besprent with tears, and cries.
And now, who lives in greater bliss
who now more happier wight,
Whose fate does fortune favor more,
or who in better plight?
Wherefore, if thou (oh mighty Jove)
wilt bring to happy eno,
This love begone, which in thy law
we mind till death to spend:
If thou (I say) (as thou do know,
the secrets of my heart,
Be quite from guyle, and fardest from
the sin that asks smart:)
Wilt turn our former passions
of vile consuming care,
To lasting joy, and perfect ^ lisse,
and grant to us, the share
Of spousals rights, which more then goods,
or friends, or life I love,
I vow, by all that erst thou framdst
in earth, and heaven above,
By this my soul I vow, I swear,
I firmly do protest,
To loue^ to dread, and serve thee lord
whylst life lodge in my breast.
This vow he made, and up he starts,
he feels he thinks no ground:
His limbs that erst for weakness bowd,
in strength do now abound.
His mind runs on Ieneuora,
and of her worthy hew,
He gives to her the chiefest praise,
of all fair bewties crewe.
He thinks now of the courteous lines,
which she to him did send:
He reads them till by heart each word
he knows, and then does rende
The paper, least by some mishappe,
the letter lost and found:
Might turn to his decay, and hers,
to whom he chief is bound.
Now thinks he of the joyful place,
which she did late invent:
Where he with sight of her his joy,
his mind he might content.
Against which time he deckes himself
with suits of joyful hew,
And throws away his mournyng weeds,
he lothes on them to vewe.
He now does vaunt him self, amongst
the rout of courtly mates:
His gladness, has brought hunger to,
he seeds on costly cates
He is not now on tomblyng bed,
nor wandryng now alone:
He does not nightly now lament,
nor filles the skies with moan:
But like a careless youth the day,
in sundry sportes he spendes,
And so the nights in maskes, and shows,
he brings to their ends
In fine, each care, that whylom was,
to him grief and annoie:
Is now become a treble bliss,
and twenty fould more joy.
Then if he erst had never felt,
of woe the cutting fittes,
Or if the storms of ^othsome l^ue
had never tossed his wits.
His brother, (that was partner long
of his unquiet rest)
Is glad with him, ^ drives ^orth with
vile care from careful breast.
His mind, (y^ erst was dulled quite)
his lyms, (that lothed disport)
Is wakt from dream, and now he is
as stiff as mighty fort.
Now wants he naught but mates to stand,
the dint of his great spear:
Or such as would in open field,
against him armeur bear
But none there are in Scottish soil
no none that bears life:
(That knows his might) that dare advance
him self before his knife.
Therefore, instead of instes on horse,
and tourneis done on soote,
In forest wide, the savage beast,
in dens he seeks out,
Whereby the country man does live
at home in suertie:
And keeps thereby him self, and his,
from former ieoperdie.
But why do I of profit speak,
where pleasure is my song?
Or what has Bloody Mars to do,
amongst Cupi^^s throng?
Why say thou pen, to speak of him
that armed is with joy:
And pressed against fair Ladies foes,
his might for to employ?
Why tel^^ thou not how he has now
disclosed to his love,
(I^ pres^nce) all his former woes,
(which hard) forthwith do move
The Cristal drops from smilyng eyes
by streams for to descend:
She shows like fittes, which forse from heart
the broken sighs tassend.
Then he with ^oulded arms imbrast
her small and semely wast:
And she her slender joints, about
her lovers neck has cast.
A thousand times he kissed has
her lips of ros^at hew.
As often she does vnkisse again,
her friend and lover true.
Now does his tongue confirm those fittes,
which pen did late indight:
As how with sighs the day he spent
and with like tears the night.
Then how with hope he was alurd,
to sue for wyshed gra^e:
and how in dream with goddess two
he saw her heavenly face.
The princes hears, this pleasant talk
and then she did unfold,
What sightes, what shapes, and visions, she
in night time did behold.
With such like talk, the time is spent,
and now is come the hour:
When sugrie presence, they must change
for pensife parting sour.
They rue their want, and hate the time,
that byds them to depart:
But needs they must, though corsie strong,
it is for them to start.
He geues in sign of loyal love
unto the Princes grace,
A Diamond of passing prise,
a ringe that did abace:
All Iuels that before that time,
were seen in Scottish land:
Whose gleming stone causd gasing eyes
on musing often to stand.
She takes the ring with joyful heart,
she geues to him again
A token, which does signify,
she faithful will remain.
With joined lips, they say farewell,
with pressed hand in hand
They vow: that to that place each day
to come no let shall stand.
Again they kiss, and faintly then,
mine own adieu (quoth he)
With becked hand, and bowed head,
my heart farewell (quoth she)
Their backward looks show loath to part,
their hearts agree also:
That to enjoy each others sight:
great wealth they would forgo.
Thus are they come, she to the court,
among the glistring rout
Of chaste Dianas nymphs, and he
repayres, amongst the stout
and sturdy band, of Scottish knights
where he does pass the day,
In decent games, in courtly sportes,
and other seemly play.
Sometime with racket he does toss
the light reboundyng ball,
And carfully does mark the chase:
now he his hawk does call:
And now his varbed horse he traynes
to pass his swift carear:
Or ^ls to gallope round the field,
now does he with his spear,
By steadie crurse obtain the ryng,
and now by forsed might,
He breaks his staff, ^ now he learns
his caruyng glayne to byte
On forged sheld (That done) on foot
he runs a breathyng race,
And then returns to court to wayt,
before his Lieges grace:
Which he can do in seemeliest sort,
therein he has such skill:
That better then the best he does,
his courtly charge fulfill
The dinner don, he filles his ears,
with heavenly melody,
And he him self on solom lute,
can stryke sweet hermonie.
And now amongst the Scottishe Dames,
(as though he wear to choose)
He would discourse of histo^^es,
and tell of foreign news.
As first the s^ege of worthy Troy,
what knights therein wear sl^yn:
And how that Helen was the cause,
that Grocians felt such pain.
Then how, the chaste ^enelope,
did lead a widows life:
Til her Ulix, and Anthenor,
did end the ten years strif^.
Next how Cneas, falsely dealt,
with Dido, Cartha^e Queen,
And how for falsing of her faith,
False Creseide fell unclean.
A thousand such this curious knight
reports unto this crew,
And all (god knows, was to the end
his Lady for to vewe.
The Courtiers they delight to hear
his passing eloquence,
They thank him al, he seeks no more
he has his recompense.
He is (good soul) a happy man,
that by that means he may:
At pleasure and without suspect,
see his Ieneuora,
Amongst these iestes, he mindful is,
of secret meetyng place:
He cannot that forget, where he
his Lady shall embrace.
There (as it lighted in his head)
he does vnloode his brain,
And she, as amors forse her speak,
does yield the like again.
Their other passions I commit
to you that lovers be:
I cannot think, much less to write,
their fittes of iolytie.
But many days these faithful ones
did spend in great delight:
And longer had, if fortune had,
not wrought them great dispit:
For whilst they two with quiet minds
had driven away the cloud
Of carefulnes, and nou^ht but bliss,
within their hearts did shroud,
(I faint to tell) that Serpent vile,
that works Princes woe:
That treason black, forced them (alas)
their ^reedom to forgo.
Therefore, a dew, without desert,
ye Nymphs of Helicon:
Possess your Mount I need you not
let my rude verse alone.
It Is Sibil she that Profitesse:
that knows, the darksome den
Of Plutos Realm, that must be aid
to guide my rugged pen.
We must amongst the loathsome shades,
seek out Alecto vile:
That may with moan, and solome tune,
deck this my doleful style.
Thou Jove grant that I may find out,
The bough of golden ^ewe:
And that the teeth of hellish dog,
I safely may eschew.
And thou (I say) that worker art,
of this my changed song:
Help with thy Snakie hears to show
the sting of treason strong.
For thou, thou Witch, thou hellish hagge,
thou wrinkled fury fell,
Have forced my pen that painted bliss,
of foul mishappe to tell.
But since with scorched limbs he craves,
to wpite his cruel fall:
Whom fortune late with honor decked,
and reard to noble wall.
I will assay to turn my style,
from lovers happy life:
To frowning fittes, to sobbes, to cries,
to falshod cause of strife:
And since he seeks to have his fall.
a myrrour to the rest:
That line, I will begin with him,
and let the other rest.
THere was amongst the Scottish Lords,
(whom honor did advance
To noble style,) a mighty Duke,
of blood, although hard chance,
Oh filthy fact, dispoyld him quite
of former dignity:
And forced him leave his tipe of might,
to perverse misery.
This Prince was Duke of Albany,
and Pollinesso hight:
And vassal to the Scottish king,
a subtle crafty knight.
Who well increast in aged years,
(and yet to choose a fear)
Began greatly love Ieneuora,
whom he as live held dear.
And since he was of noblest birth,
of subjects in the land:
He thought thee rather to obtain,
that he did take in hand.
Wherefore he is in mind often times,
to move the King herein:
Whose grace once got, he sooner thiks
the Princes for to win.
Again thinks he, if she should know
my mind is for to crave:
Her fathers grant, before I do
her favor seek to have:
The stately dame perhaps would dain
my suit and profred love:
Therefore he minds this way to deal
as for his best beh^ue,
He seeks (I say) to spend the time,
with her in stately court:
To play with her at chesse, or cards,
or other chamber sport.
And when he sees she pleasant is,
and in her merry vain:
To break to her such amors, as
within his heart remain.
So thought, so don, he wears the day
as erst he did devise:
He has his fill of Ladies looks,
he feades there with his eyes.
But see the spite that ^^lousi^
that prieth every where,
Has brought him in an ag^nie,
and in a soden fear.
He sees the stranger of resort,
to his rejoicing place:
He sees his Lady shows to him
a pleasant smiling face.
But most of all, and that that most
augmentes his jealousy:
Is strangers ring, which she does wear,
still gleaming in his eye.
Wherewith, dispayring in his mind
of his late hoped gain:
He thinks to spend more time therein
is booteles and in vain.
Yet does affection tell him that
his doughtes b^ contrary:
The Stranger comes to the court
(says he) of courtesy.
And she requires, like, for like,
what if she wear his King?
The stone is rich, and happily,
she has therein liking.
Besides, will she bestow her love
of one a stranger borne:
Of mean estate? when Princes loves
she often has had in scorn?
Thus hope, and dought do hold this Duke,
he long has felt what pain:
Despair does bring, and eke what toys,
in doughtfull fittes remain.
And when he saw that wearing time,
could nothing wast his dought:
Inforst by love and ielous^e,
this fetch he has found out.
Firstly, for to acquaint him self,
with this Ariodant:
That daily dot^ (as well as he)
to Princes lodging haunt.
And then, for to inuit him home,
unto his mancion:
Where he concludes to put in ure,
this last invention.
That is, to hawk and hunt with him,
and pass the time away:
In such disportes as he delights,
chiefly to wear the day.
In which mean time he will disclose
the secrets of his mind:
To him, as both his own affairs,
and such as are assingde.
B^ privy counsel, for the wealth,
of all the Scottish land:
And eke what acts the king intends,
with speed to take in hand.
Then of his pr^uate deeds to tell,
and how he leads his life:
And eke with whom he is in leage,
and eke with whom in strife.
Al these and more then these, this Duke
does mind for to disclose:
To his invited gest at home,
only of this purpose.
To have the stranger yield again,
the secrets of his heart:
In recompense of that which he,
to him did late impart.
Amongst which things, he hopes to here
of this suspected love:
And so to be resolud of that,
which jealousy did move.
And if it be (as he suspect)
(I mean) that she has chusde
Ariodant unto her fere,
and he has eke refusde.
All other for Ieneuora,
then he in friendly wise,
Will beat into the strangers head,
what harms thereof may rise.
Or else to persuade him that,
his time is spent in vain:
In suing to obtain her grace,
that does great ^ordes disdain.
And how, that she does mind dif^^it,
and naught esteems his love:
As Lady wily heads do often,
the ^ielie soul to prove.
With such conceits as these, the Duke
does think for to beguile:
This careless man, that falshods craft,
has farde^^ in exile.
And now, from crafty Parliament,
he calls his wily wits:
In mind, in have to put in ure
this same, to ease his fittes.
And finding now Ariodant
amongst the courtly crewe:
Of Scottish D^mes, y^ joys in har^
his Lady for to vewe.
He does acquaint him self with him
and with a friendly face:
Inuites him to his stately home,
and courtly dwelling place.
The stranger (that for courtesy
excells the Scottish rout)
(Whose giltles mind cold not deuis^
this treason to search out)
With bowed knee, and humble thanks
requites his ientlenes:
And shows him self at his commau^d
as pressed in readiness.
^he Duke is glad, that thus he has
achevd his interpryse:
The stranger joys, ^ hopes hereby
some happy hap may rise.
Now both have left y^ Regal court,
both leave their Ladies sight:
And now amidst the plesaunt fields
to sport do both delight.
Sometime their running feet^ pursue
the cry of yelling hounde:
Sometime they joy to smite the dear^
or else the heart to woun^.
Sometime in arms, they seek y^ chase
of Bear or ^yon fear^^:
Or else with sharp and cutting glayue
the t^sked Boar to pearce.
When day is gone, they welcome night
with shows and harmony:
Or else with well squard champions,
to force their treasure fly.
Amongst these sports and pleasant jests
the Dukes let not to ^el:
What diu^rse^haps have chaunst to him,
and all that ea^st be^ell
As well to him, as to the Realm,
he tells to him the state:
Of all the soil, and Region:
besides he does ^ilate.
What is agreed, by close consent,
of all the Scottish pears:
And then what laws are ordained,
he heates into his cares.
Then how in youth he trapped was,
with traynes of Cupides might:
(He tells) and how unhappy man,
he serude a scornef^ll wight.
Since when, (he says,) how he has lothd
such passions to sustain:
The fruit whereof will not (quoth he)
half counteruayle the pain.
Ariodant, with listing ear,
marks well this diverse talk
And takes good heed unto his tale,
when lavish tongue does walk.
But from his lips do not proceed
the secrets of his heart:
Ne from his close, and privy mind
no passed acts depart.
He countes it vilanie to tell,
that he could well declare:
And taught he was from infancy,
a walking tongue to spare.
Therefore unto him self he keeps,
that lodges in his mind:
And stays his mouth from breathing out
his thoughts unto the wind.
Wherewith the Duke, not well content,
but moved much with ire.
(Considring that it fell not out
as he did erst desire)
(With angry cheer) Unkind (quoth he)
is this the courtesy
That you unkind Italians,
requite for amity.
How can thy greedy ears keepe^ in,
such store of secrets told:
Without imparting like for like,
and not for to unfold.
Such iestes as hidden lie in breast,
which may content my mind:
And ease perhaps a troubled head,
as thereby friends often find.
This said, and hard, with blushing face,
the stranger as dismayde:
With fired look, and sober chere,
unto the Duke thus said.
I trust my Lord your honor will
not to account (quoth he)
Of him that does remain as yours,
(...) (...) from falsehood free.
For we that ^e of Italy,
and bor^e in foren land:
Do b^nk it mearest vanity,
and fond to ^ake in hand.
To ^reat of that, that profit small
redoundes to them that hear
The same, and most of all, in vay^e,
that goulden time does wear.
To hold your honor with such acts,
as I my youth did spend
In Italy (my native soil)
to small effect would tend.
Since both the land to you unknown,
the deeds of such purporte:
As heard and iudgd, your self would say
do not discerue report
And since my wandering feet did leu^
the bounds of Italy,
No act has past from me that has,
deserved memory.
Therefore (w^ pardon cravd my Lord)
I trust you will esteem,
But well of this my silent tongue,
and rightly thereof deem.
(Quoth he) and then began the Duke
no, no, Ariodant,
Thy deeds are not so secret done,
^e yet my wits so scant.
But well I can behold the thing,
that thou do shun to say:
Both how thou have and love now,
the Prince Ieneuora.
Thy often resort unto her court,
discloseth thy intent:
Thy pleasant looks to her do show,
thy will thereto is bent.
But if thy reckles head had w^yde,
my good will borne to thee:
Thou wuldst not once have stickt to tell,
those secrets unto me.
Whose sage advise perhaps might move,
thy mind from that intent:
Which yelds in fine naught else but sighs,
and cares for time so spent.
Yet since at first, my fancy had,
in thee so good thinking,
I will enforce my tongue to speak,
against my lusts lyking:
Know thou therefore, (Ariodant)
the Princess hates the tour,
And scorns that thou should so presume^
thereto her grace to move.
For though with smyling ^here ^he does,
reward thy courtesy:
Yet is her mind most fardest from,
the l^ste^ of Uenorie^
Believe well, Ariodant,
thy love is evil imploy^e,
For I it is, whom she does love,
whose heart I have in ioyde.
Long time, of whom I may command,
what lists me to crave,
And eke obtain what so I ask,
as proved often I have.
And least thy doughtfull head might them
untroth in this my tale:
I will (to put thee out of dought)
this enterprise assail:
That is, to bring the morrow next,
from my Ieneuora:
Thy Dyamond, thy gift to her
the ring (that men do say)
In clearnes shames our Scottishe gemmes,
whereby, thou may perce^ue,
How well of thee, and of thy love,
thy Lady does conceive.
This tale, no sooner enterd had
into the strangers ear:
But therwithal a heap of thoughts,
within his mind appear.
Yet least his changed countnance mou
be wray his secret care:
And least his stayed speech might show^^
how he ny chokt does fare:
with strain^d voice, and moved mind,
he firmly does deny,
Each point of his accusing tale,
and profers for to die,
If ever so his mind was bent,
or if he sought to move
At any time she Princes grace,
with his v^egall love.
And as unto his often repair,
unto her graces Court:
Shows naught (quoth he) but youthful mind
with Ladies ^or to sport.
As courtiers use, (of lusty age,)
to wear the time away,
In dance, in talk, in melody,
and other chamber play.
But all for naught, Ariodant
his tongue and speech does spend,
His vows are vowed all in vain,
the Duke hates to attend
Unto his long excusing tale,
and how he does deny
The gift of that rich Diamond,
which he did late discrie.
Wherefore the Duke in have depart^,
and does command beside,
His st^ede for to be^ sadled straight,
for he post h^st will ride.
Thus leaves he poor Ariodant,
and he to court does hie,
And (as he rydes) he studies how
this King he might come by.
At last, he does record, how that
there serves the princes grace
A Lady that Dalinda hight,
a maid of Scottish race.
Who erst was proferd to the Duke
in l^wfull marriage:
A ^^em^l^ wight, and Lady fair,
of noble parentage.
B^t he, naught forsed then the maid
his hautie heart was bent:
With hier match, and greater sums,
his will for to content.
To this forsaken Dame, this Duke
concludes forto go,
To crave, by proferd marriage,
the Dyamond also.
And as he ended had the thoughts,
of this subtle mind:
He is arrived at the court,
where he does seek to find
In secret wise, this waiting maid,
whom he at last has found
Disporting her, with Lute alone
low set upon the ground.
Her he salutes as time did serve
and she requites again
His court^^ie, that done, the Duke
still mindful of his pain:
Does crave a word in secreat with
the Lady for to have:
And she that least suspects disceite
does grant that he does crave.
And then the Duke with sober chere,
vnlodes his charged mind
Thus, to the li^^ning maid that longs
to hear of news by kind.
To hold thee long mine own (quoth he)
with painted tedious talk,
Or else, in glosing eloquence,
to strain my tongue to walk,
I seek not n^w, but simply, I
the secrets of my heart:
As plain, as of a perfect truth,
to thee I will impart.
Thou know (quoth he) not long or this
thy faithful friends did move,
(By reason good and great advise)
me greatly to thy love:
Thou know (I think) also the cause
that forced me not consent:
I mean, thy wealth, and parentage,
could not my mind content.
For I (as thou do know right well)
(without bost be it spoke)
For noble line, and living great,
might match with Royal stock.
But leauyng thus these lofty lettes
inforst through hautie mind:
And speakying to affections force,
that conquers all by kind.
Know thou, since then recording often,
those virtuous gifts of thine:
And eke thy beutie great, which does
excel before mine eyne:
Forgettinge eke, the causes all,
of that my former stay:
And calling now unto my mind,
thy worthy shape, I say,
I am as ready now to yield,
unto the friends desire:
As they to gain my grant, or this,
were wi^^yng to require.
And since, it is unknown to me,
which way thy will is bent:
And eke for proof how willingly,
thou do thereto consent:
If thou will not deny me that,
which I of thee will crave:
which thou at ease may grant, I seek,
no greater proof to have.
That is, when our Ieneuora,
in bed does take her rest:
And when the slumbryng sleep does rule,
within her quiet breast:
To help me to the Dyamond
which she esteems so well.
(I mean) the strangers ring that does,
in clearnes so excel.
If this to do, thou will not let,
by knighthoods lore (I swear)
To wed thee as my lawful wife,
and I to dye thy fear.
He said, and ends so his tale,
and she (when long in muse
Had stayde) in pleasant wise thse woord^
or like them thus did use.
If this proceed, my Lord (quoth she)
from bounds of spotles mind,
And if your proferd courtesy,
agree to noble kind:
If that the secrets of your heart,
^e void of bidden guyle:
And d^^pe deceit in this your tale,
be fardest in exile.
Though duty biddes me stay to grant,
unto your hasty will:
And reason says, with honor I
cannot your heste fulfill:
Yet to persuade your honor, that
I pressed am to obey:
To what so lists you demand
I will without delay,
Inforse my self against the grounds,
of bounden duties lore:
To help you to the Dyamond,
or else to die therefore.
Till then a while my Lord (quoth she)
stay you at this self place,
And I will to Ieneuora,
and wait before her grace,
Till that to sleep she geues her self,
and then I will again
Repair to you, with Diamond,
if here you will remain.
The Duke agrees to her devise,
and (with a joyful heart:)
Does yield to her a thousand thanks:
Dalinda does depart,
and leaves the Duke well easd of care
and now in perfect bliss:
Because he hopes the stranger will,
despair at sight of this.
The quiet time that nature yeldes,
unto the laden mind
Is come, and now the weary ^ones,
a resting place do find.
Ieneuora, (when bankettes all,
and revel routes wear done)
Repayres unto her quiet bed,
and watching crewe does shun.
Dalinda wai^es on her this night,
of purpose to obtain
The Diamond, which nightly did
on chamber boorde remain.
Ieneuora no sooner had
on pillow coucht her head:
But King Dalinda fingerd has,
of Diamond she is spead:
And (duty done) the slately couch,
she leaves for that night:
And to Duke Polinesse then,
she guydes her feet aright.
Who found in place appointed, she
presents before his eyes.
The Iem, and therwithall, these words
the spends in this wise.
As, to content your doughtfull mind
my might I have imployde:
And as in you my honor stays,
which carst my self inioyde.
So let me find (my Lord) again,
in gage of willing heart:
Like deeds unto those vowed words,
which late from you did part.
She said, and then, the Duke replies
thus to her just request.
Or else (quoth. he) thou God grant that
no life lodge in my breast.
In sign whereof, hold here (quoth he)
and so they joined hands:
Let this conclude till fitter time
the yoke of wedded bands.
Thus he departs, with promise made
before the break of day:
To yield again the Dyamond,
no let at all should stay.
Now is the Duke returned safe,
unto his heavy gest:
Who long has lurkt on weary bed,
bereud of former rest.
So much this late unlooked for tale,
dismayes his quiet heart:
That now well nigh he feels again,
her former woe and smart.
The Duke no sooner leaves his steed
but to Ariodant
He hies: that seems to be a sleep,
though ease in head is scant.
And with a pleasant voice he says,
what sluggard how, awake:
Thou dreamst to long: from closed eyes
the misty sle^pe of shake.
With that, the stranger (as gast)
does cast his heavy head:
Aloft, and start well nigh from out,
his tossed and tomled bed.
And therwithal, what news (quoth he)
who calls me thus in have:
How fares my lord y^ Duke his grace
and then his arms he cast.
Out of the bed, in mind to rise,
but then Duke Polinesse
Began name him self, and thus to him
these words he did express.
Let not my hasty call, mo^^st
thy head late easd of care:
Ne think no harm, in that (quoth he)
thus bo^ldly I do fare.
For as I have been grief to thee
by breaking of thy sleep:
So may I profit bring to thee,
if thou good heed wilt keape.
Unto this tale, which from the heart
of him, that wishes well:
To thee proceeds that found out
thy present cares terpell.
I trust thou doughtest not (quoth he)
of this my ^ ^alous mind:
Which since our first acquaintance, has
to help thee ben inclinde.
Since when thou know, by long discours^
what talk has past from me:
As touching these affections fo^d,
which I conceiud in thee.
At which self time, though thou did scorn,
to tell me what I knew:
Yet did I friendly promise thee,
to help thee to eschew.
Those happes, to bring from court with m^
thy famous Diamond:
Whose match cannot compared be
in this our Scottish ground.
Thereby, that thou moughtst plainly see,
what love in Ladies looks:
And that in time thou moughst be taught,
to shun their hidden ^ookes.
To quite my self to thee, therefore,
of faithful promise made:
And of my troth vnfa^nd to thee,
thy mind for to persuade.
See ^eer (...) th^r with showd the King
which he in pu^se did bear)
Believe thy self, not me, if that
thy Lady houldes the dear.
When al was said, and King was showd
and Duke had done his fill:
For to persuade Ariodant,
to brid^ll reckles will.
When in a muse the stranger had,
a little while remaynde:
S^t straight upon his quiet bed,
him self to speak thus strainde.
The courtesy which I have found
in this your graces court:
H^th bound me till my fatal day,
(my Lord) for to report.
Immortal praises of your grace,
to whom I do account:
My (...) as far indected to,
as my rude head can count.
And s^^h each way. I see my self,
unable to requite:
your least and smalest benefit,
(the more my grief and spite)
Yet count me as your own (quoth. he)
your vassal to command:
As one whose life, and goods are yours
till death his due demand.
My duty, thus acknowledged,
let these reply unto:
your graces tale, which in my mind
I well have wayd also.
I do record right well, (my Lord)
the sum of all (quoth he)
As of the Princes grace, what talk
past then twirt you and me.
I mindful am bestdes, what I
sp^ke in mine own defense:
What oths past eke from me to prove
my troth, or you went hence.
B^t that culd not suffice your mind
n^ change your wrong intent:
But needs you would (the rather to
enforce me to consent.
To that my giltles conscience lothd)
to court in have to hy^:
To bring from thence, a Diamond,
which, then she said, that I.
Did give unto Ien^uora,
thereby that I might see
What good account of you she makes,
and how ^he deals with me.
This was the very talk it self,
except I do forget:
The sum of that within mine ears,
is ringing still as yet.
To which, ^more the^ I answered ear^
I cannot now reply:
B^t as I said, so I protest
the same not to deny.
And as unto the remnant of
your last pronounced tale:
This shall suffice, if in your heart,
my truth may ought avail.
Know you, (my Lord) I do confess,
the Princes scorneth me:
For why, a simple courtier I,
and meanest in degree.
Not worthy to be thought upon,
in Princes hauty court:
Whose birth unknown, does rather seek^
with meaner match to sport.
And as I do confess the one,
so firmly I deny:
That erst I never saw this gemme,
that thus shines in mine eye.
Nor neue^ gave the like to her,
as I am subject true:
Unto my liege and sovereign,
and owe him service due.
Thus I conclude, in hope also,
as I have plainly toulde:
The hidden secrets of my heart,
and as I have unfold.
Naught else but truth, as you may tri^,
in time to come right well:
That so you will from doughtfull mind,
such strange c^nceites expel.
The Duke, (that hears with grief the end
of this late coined tale^
Amazed stands, since his inte^^^,
no better did prevail.
Yet minds he, since the stranger was
to him but as a gest:
Not ferder to eramine him,
but for to let it rest.
Till that at fitter time, he may
a better way invent:
For to annoy Ariodant,
and eke him self content.
And, therwithall, would God (quoth he)
I wish for thy behoue:
That as thou say, so tract of time,
the truth herein may prove.
And parting thence, good night (quoth he)
take now thy quiet rest:
And to your grace, god grant (quoth he)
such ease as likes you best.
Thus is Duke Polinesso come,
unto his chamber, where
Unto a secret friend of his
he geues the ring, to bear.
Unto his friend Dalinda, least,
the Diamond should be wanting:
And so prevent his purpose, and
turn to her great undoing.
Post have, therefore this messenger,
is prekt with Diamond
To court, who at the last, by hap
Dalinda has out found.
To whom, (with thou^and thanks) he geues
the gleaming gem^ again:
From Polinesso (mighty Duke)
that does her friend remain.
Thus leave I him that ended has
his message in his best wise:
And now unto Ariodant,
I will my style devise.
When Polinesso vttred had,
that lurked in his breast:
And showed had the Diamond,
unto his heavy gest.
When gone he was out of the sight,
of poor Ariodant:
Who in his new disquiet mind
old corsies did not want.
Then, gins the stranger to record,
the ring which he did see:
And fear does m^ke him think besides
that ring the same to be.
Which he did give Ieneuora,
wherefore through every part:
Of his distemperd limbs, proceed
an ache, and deadly smart.
From head, and heart, does pass also
a could, and loathsome sweat:
And temples both, and pulses two,
refuse their lively heat.
His hear right up, his eyes do stare,
his t^th he joins fast:
Much like a man distraught of wits,
and wholesome reason past.
Sometimes, (for lack of breath) he lies
^ereud of lively sprightes:
And in his rage, like frantike man,
his careful head he smyghtes.
And when his fittes be of least force,
then with a ^an^ing heart:
Unto himself in secret wise,
these words he does impart.
Oh deep descent, oh hidden guile,
oh falsehood fury fell,
Oh cruel spite, condemned be
thy ghost to loathsome hell:
That so can fawn on simple wight
with pleasant smilyng chere,
And with a heart inuenemed,
to kill that houlds the dear.
Oh wretch, I skorne the present joy
and eke thy Princely state:
And happy thrice were these my eyes.
to see thy latest fate.
Consumed be thy cherefull health,
and sickness scale thy corse:
Let sadness, from each part of thee,
all pleasure quite deuorse.
Converted he the cristall hew,
to foulest color vile:
And all diseases rule in thee,
when health is in erile.
for thou (oh careless wretch) have forced
my limbs that lyude in joy)
To taste the most unquiet rest,
that any can anoye.
And as he would have further said,
from stringes of swelled heart:
A deadly groan proceeds, and eke
most scorning sobbes depart.
And therwithall, oh death (quoth he)
wreake on my corse thy will,
Asunder sheare my vital thread:
oh Atrapos do kill.
The most unhappiest creature,
that treades on sinful soil:
And you oh sisters cut the thread,
and ease me of this toil.
Thus whilst he ways y^ brightness of
this goodly Diamond:
(Dispairing wise) in^ectiue fear
does nigh his wits confound.
But when he does call unto mind,
what friendly acts have past,
Twixt him and his Ieneuora,
he calls his wits at last.
To him, and then, his lavish tongue
he ginnes for to reprove:
And says, y^ naught but tried disceit,
should faithful friends so move.
And then he began to dought beside,
if that same wear the ring:
That erst was his, which Poliness^
from court with him did bring.
For though report, did blase (quoth he)
my gem to be the best:
yet may an other be as good,
though secretly it rest.
And daily proof, does teach us eke,
where Princes fancy frame:
There goes away the victory,
and gain of greatest name.
And though it were the ring it self,
that I did late enjoy:
yet till I know more perfect proof,
it shall me not annoy.
For how can such assured signs
of lasting amity:
Be joined with crabbed craftines
and with such subtlety.
Did not her letter show to me,
a lovers true intent?
Did not the passion of her mind
to faithful lines consent?
Did she not vow (with drowned eyes)
she lothed filthy ^guyle?
And did she not persuade me eke,
to shun such treason vile?
Could this proceed from double mind
could heavenly shape invent:
Such terms of truth, and after wards
to such disceit consent?
Can she, that since her infancy,
was traind in Princely court,
(Where wisdoms lore, ^ prudence skill,
is used for disport)
Bear in her heart such feigned truth,
and use such subtle wit?
Or else upon well meaning wight,
such spightfull hatred spitte?
Can craftines find harborow,
within so goodly shape?
when nature serude so worthy corpse
could truth from her escape?
Can double dealing lodge within
so worthy creature?
Who for her passing comelynes
gains lasting life tindure?
No, no, I do abandon now
my former fond conceit,
And eke the sparks of black despair
I will extinguishe strayt:
For till those eyes do plainly see,
or else those ears do hear,
Disdainful looks, or scornful words
such fittes shall not me dear.
Till then, (though some presuming
there be of fained love)
From chosen choice, ^ hearts desire,
no passion shall me move.
By this, the blustering blast is blown
that so amazd the mind:
And Delus from Orient seas,
does breath a pleasant wind.
The darksome clouds are drowned now,
that trobled erst the air:
And hope with beams of joyful light,
turns storms, to weth^r fair.
But sleep that does disdain to see
an other, to possess
^he ^lace which he by right should keep)
^oth seek for to redress.
This injury, and calls forth with,
his mates in his affairs,
That drowsy dream, and slumber sad,
and with his friendly prayers,
Does crave his aid, with forced might,
to yield to him again:
The place which he by right should have,
which others now do gain.
therewith old Slumber began employ,
with careful mind his might:
To conquer Hope or else to dye,
himself amidst the fight.
And with his Ingin he does scale
the fort but meanly mande:
And through the wall does make a way,
for to conduct his band.
This seen, poor Hope, (as vanquished man)
not able to defend
Him from the whyrling darts, that Sleep
about his cares does send:
Does yield himself cendicionally,
that next to Slumber, he
Within his batterd castle, may
be second in degree.
The conqueror does grant here to
poor Hope is peakte away:
And now does Dream amidst the press,
his drowsy part well play.
But Night that is the general
of all this s^^ggish crewe,
Began from the fardest Orient ^^ast,
the morning plainly vewe.
Then (least he should to long abide)
he seuds the Herault out:
(The Oule) y^ with her crooked trump
cries Retreat to the rout.
Whereby, the army leaves the land,
and flittes to Leathian seas:
Where they abide till Night again,
shall yield them former ease.
The cock (Auroras messenger)
sends forth from stretched throat:
With fl^ckring wings, and roused lym
his cherefull mornings note.
Hope heers this sound, and the^ he know
his foe is fled away:
Wherefore within his secret cave,
no longer he can stay.
But to his former crased fort,
with hasty foot he plies:
Where entering in, Ariodant,
does lie before his eyes.
Who was one of his soldiers, when
that sleep did give the foil,
And taken eke a prisoner,
as he for Hope did toil.
But, by good hay, no harm he had,
save only in his head^
A littell scarre, of fond despair,
that drousie Dream had made.
Him, Hope does comfort as he can,
and with a lusty cheer:
No h^rme, (quoth he) dismay thee not,
discharge this filthy fear.
Herewith, the seely crased man
does leave his easy bed:
And has concluded secreatly,
(within his vexed head.)
To leave the Duke, and to return^
unto the court again:
Least by his still abiding there,
the Duke might seek a mean
To searc^e of him the truth herein,
which, though he loath to show:
yet might such word^ proceed unawares
as thereby harm might grow.
Wherfore^ when Duke of Albany
had left his chambers rest:
Ariodant, (with bowed knee,
began of his grace request.
For to depart, his license, an^
his favor for to have:
And he, (though with unwilling mind)
does grant that he does crave.
Thus leaves the stranger Polinesse
and he with speed, to court
Does plie again for to renew,
his fourmer joy and spourt.
yet can he not (by any means)
the sight of showed ring
Forget, though hope with pleasant words,
good signs of joy does bring.
By this, he is aryude amongst
the crewe of Courtiers stout:
That joy to see him safe retournde
among that lus^y rought.
His brother eke Lurcanio,
(inforst by course of kind)
Does welcome home Ariodant,
with joyful pleasant mind:
And of such iestes as happened,
since he did leave the court:
Unto his brothers lustinge ears,
he makes along report.
But he, (this careful lover) that
is ny caught with despair,
Does somon all his wits at once,
to help in this affayre.
And since upon two fickell points,
his present state dependes:
To take advise or he begins,
his wyly head intendes.
I Need not now for to recount,
what guyle Duke polynesse
Did use, with Princes Dyamond,
tannoy his hidden guess.
Nor how ^e faild ^f his intent,
^e of the diverse talk,
That now from Polinessos lips,
and now from strangers walk.
but al you know (my Lords) how y^
Ariodant did fear,
That this was the self Dyamond,
he gave his Lady dear.
which fere, so to^t his troubled brain
that as a man for^orne,
He shuns each youthful company
and life he had in scorn.
To ease these fittes, two only ways
this careful lover spies:
Whereof, (as present state did crave)
he began this to devise.
Firstly, thinks he, if with my pen
I causles should accuse:
Or else in presence, by complaint,
I blameles should abuse.
The Princes grace, to whom I must
accombt me chiefly ^ound:
Whose zealous mind, (except I fail)
I faithful often have found.
If that I should once move (I say)
these doughtfull thoughts of mine:
Under her grace, by letters sent,
or else before her eyne.
For to a^cuse her troth, unknown,
then let us see the end:
Hereof, and to what pass,
our taunting tale would tend.
At first, (as well she might in deed)
she should bestow on me,
At fond suspecting lovers name:
and most untrue to be.
That at the sight of every toye
would take occasion:
To blame her troth, and eke to liu^
in vile suspicion.
Then after that, for to withdraw
her love so evil employed:
And eke repent that such an one,
so long has it enjoyed.
Which if these ^ies sh^ld once behold
these hands with bloody knife
S^uld take revenge upon my tongu^
by ridding of my life.
And if she gr^unt^ (as vile despair
persuades me for to deem)
I mean, that she does love this Duk^
and evil of me esteem.
If this she say, what then tell me,
what is then our remedy^
In faith by cor^^es, bane, or cor^,
to die in misery.
Again, if to my self I should,
these secrets sole impart:
Lettes see if this may change our (...)
or else our cares convert.
This charge (quoth he) to make the salve
that cures the burning w^und:
Tasswage the humors cold, that dot^
the patient ^ye confound.
As hard i^ is ^o ease the wight,
with freting furious meat:
Whom fe^^rs force continually,
to ^^^ning bones does eat.
So hard it is, that silence which
augments my misery:
Should salve y^ sore, which nothing el^
but talk can remedy:
For see, as belching poison broils,
within the panting breast:
And scorching heat, conuerts y^ health,
to most vnqui^t rest.
So do the cares of ve^ed mind,
consume the crased heart:
Till by disclosing of his grief,
he finds to ease his smart.
But if (as this my case does stand)
be wraying brings death:
Tweare better thus to prove the end
then for to wast my breath.
They say, that corsy ministered,
unto them poisoned corse:
Will cool the fearse contagious he^t
and quench the burning force.
Why may not the^ the troubled mind
by silent tongue annoy:
That health, which silence banisheth,
and does the heart enjoy.
For if my doubts be false indeed
and she does love me still:
What then but silence can prevail,
and bridell lavish will.
And if she use me for disport,
and scorns my proferd love:
The knowledge of the troth therein,
a desperate death does move.
Whereas, if yet my love cannot
within her heart prevail:
yet silence, truth, and tract of time,
hereafter may avail.
Wherefore as reason seems ^^gr^^
unto a secret heart:
So from these lips, those lewd co^ceit^
I mind shall not depart.
But, as before the news I hard,
so now amidst the crewe:
Of courtly dames, my wonted sport^
I will forthwith renew.
This last devise thus ended has
his arguments each one:
He listes^ no longer to consult,
in have he is forth gone.
The Princes court, where no man is
more welcomer then he:
As well unto Ieneuora
as to the Ladies free.
And there, (like to his wonted guile)
he daily does discourse:
Of histories: or riddels else
he learnes to tell by course.
Thus leave I him that shows a face
of perfect bliss and joy:
Though now and then amidst disportes
despair does him annoy.
And to the Duke I must again
my solom verse return:
That seeks (unhappy man) each way,
to cause the stranger mourn.
THough Polinesso well had wayde,
unto what small effect:
His former fond, and lewd denise,
by ill luck was direct.
Though he perceiud how contrary
each point thereof did prove:
And that no sight of gem, ne talk,
could ough^ the stranger move.
Yet could he not slack longer time,
(inforst by jealousy)
But needs he must devise of new,
some other policy.
Wherefore, when that Ariodant
was gone unto the court:
He leaves his home, and thither to,
in have be does, resort:
Where like unto his former wont,
he feeds his doting eye
With Princes looks, and takes thereat
a great felicity.
And she again, (that knew right well
the skill of courtesy.)
Does friendly intertaine the Duke
into her company.
But furdest from her honest heart,
(I dare avowe) was love:
To him whose grauer years, should shun
such youthful toys to move.
This aged amorous sire (I say)
thus caught in Cupides not:
Cannot digest this jealousy,
which be in stranger set.
But rather by the often repair,
of young Ariodant:
New coa^s ar put to burning fl^mes,
that fire did not want.
Therefore when grief had long oppressed
this careful Duke his mind:
In counsel to Ariodant,
he thus does spend his wind.
If that (quoth he) Ariodant,
I thought my words would take,
More surer ground within thy min^
then when I la^^ly spoke
To thee, of this Ieneuora,
I would once more assay,
To turn thy youthful head from that
that works thy nown decay.
I see with sighs, and mark with moan
(for so does friendship mo^^)
That nether talk, ne sight of ring
can change thee from this love.
I see, I see Ariodant,
thou have to good conceit,
And do self will to much inbras^
^ that works thine own disceit.
I see, how lightly thou regardst,
that I told late to thee:
I see thou scornst my sage advise
and takst me false to be.
Else would thou not so sodenlie
forget that might have taught
Thy skilles youth, to shun the bayte
that has thee captive caught.
But since thus far I have assaid
to move thee to believe:
That neither gifts, ne looks, ne talk
can ought thy Lady meue.
I will, (to quite my self of troth
faith vnfaind to thee)
Once more attempt a greter charge
then thou before did see.
Thou know, at court within three days
is kept a solom feast:
When each to honor more to same
with brauest gear are dressed.
Then will the Princes decked be
with ^obes of shining gold:
And none so rich as she that day,
ne goodlier to behold.
If then twixt nin^, and ten at night,
thou will repair with me:
Unto a secret place, when I
a sign shall give to thee.
Thy self shall see Ieneuora,
and me Duke Polinesse
Imbrasing each, and eithers corpse
in others arms to press.
So that at sight hereof thou will,
give place unto my love:
And leave these fickell fantasies
that youthfulness does move.
The Duke thus stays his filed tongue,
and then Ariodant
This answer made unto his tale,
that forced senses want.
Show this^ (my Lord) and then (quoth he)
I yield to your desire:
As one that is (...) ^our command,
(...) what you list require.
^o here my hand: (quoth Polinesse)
I swear by this my Grace,
To show thee what I promised,
at ^etted time and place:
But as to ease thee of thy grief,
I do that reason nould:
So as t^ou art a gentilman,
do ^ot my tale unfold.
The stranger grau^ts, and vows thereto
and thus they two depart:
Ariodant to chamber close,
and Duke as likes his heart.
But when this thrice unhappy wight
this careful wretched man:
Was come unto his mourning den,
he does begin to scan.
Upon this false and forged tale,
and despratly does tear:
His trembling flesh, and rendes all that
that he that day did wear.
His head he smites with bended fist,
his feet he stampes on ground,
His holow sighs, and groaning sobbes,
from heart to skies resound.
Now groueling on the ground he crawles,
and scrapeth with his nails
The earth, and now again him self
his hasty hand assailes.
Now chokt with grief, he specheles lies
as one bereud of breath:
And now to end this furious fittes,
he cries thus after death.
Oh death (quoth he) the end of cares
if ever thou did grant
Unto a woeful wretches will,
that waylings does not want.
If ever thou did yield unto,
a haples mysers hest,
Or if unto the vex^d corse,
thou ever yeldest rest:
grant now to me (unhappiest slave)
whose panges of pining pain,
Is more then natures kyndly course
can brook or else sustain:
A fatal push at last for all,
and end oh death this care,
Dispatch this loathsome lingryng life
give me this only share,
With fatal dart, (oh gentill death,)
let lively blood depart
By streams, out of this carcas vile
and slyse this trembling heart.
Thou doleful bell ring out at last,
my last deperting knil:
Or living else close me in grave,
my mouth with earth do fill,
But unto her, that causer is
of this my mortal strife:
Oh death give crooked aged limbs,
with loathsome lingering life.
For she it was, that straunged me
from pleasant Italy:
And forced me like a banished wight,
to live in strange count^^e.
She, she, berevd from me my bliss,
she brought to me this care,
She has restraynd from me my joy,
and cau^ht me in the snare.
Her smiling looks, her friendly ^tile,
and eke her vowed truth:
Has brought me in this misery,
alas the more my ruth.
Oh heart more hard than Adamant,
oh false dissembling tongue,
Oh painted face, (whose worthiness^
fame so far of has ^unge)
False Greseids gain, be thy reward,
that art more false then she:
And worthier a thousand fould,
a Leper for to be,
My careful dead cannot devise,
like plagues for thy desert:
Ne yet my tongue declare the half,
of thy deserved smart.
When first, these wretched eyes of myue
did see that cra^tie corse:
And when this head did so believe,
thy lines of faithles force.
Would God this hand, had ^earst this heart,
with caruing vlaudie knife:
Or else that Lions tearing ^awes
had rid me of my life.
Oh haples wretch Ariodant
that by the heavens consent,
Mu^t work thine own unhappiness,
through lot ^some loves torment.
O^ abject slave, whose fortune is
to fall into her hand:
That neither knows her self, ne yet
^ a friend does understand.
Thrice happy had thou ben, when that
to love thou gave thy mind:
That nature had closd up thine ears,
and that thou had ben blind.
But oh what gayues this lavish talk?
what profittes wish, and would:
When judge, upon condemned wight,
has dreadful sentence told?
Dispatch therefore, thou dastard slave,
give end unto thy care:
Play morderer, with stabbing knife,
the veins a sunder share.
What, do thou joy in misery,
that fearful hand does stay?
Or know thou any remedy,
to vanquish death away?
Does any hope remain as yet
to comfort thee with all?
Does any spark of bliss appear,
that may to thee befall?
Have thou not hard thine own decay,
and lacks there ought but fight:
And can thou live for to behold,
that foul and filthy spite?
Thou doughst belike dec^itfulnes,
in Polinessos talk?
Who, as his willing heart did wi^h,
thou think his tongue did walk.
To ease thy heavy mind therein
content I am to stay:
But that once seen prepare thy self,
for sight of Dismal day.
And with a grisly groan he ends,
his careful heavy plaint:
And scorching sighs, and deadly sobbes
do forse his members faint:
And overcome with grief of mind,
his weary limbs have found
A slumbring sleep, wherein he lies,
as caught in mortal sound.
Thus leave I this Ariodant,
upon his careful bed:
Amidst a heap of dreadful dreams,
that swarm in vexed head.
And once again unto this Duke,
(this false perjured man)
I must return to blase again,
his treason as I can.
Therefore when false dissemblyng Duke,
had easd his swelled mind:
By belching out these careful news,
and vouched oaths, to blind
The more, this true dispairyng wight:
he byddes him then a^ewe,
And trackes no time, ne lettes aught slip,
his purpose to pursue.
Wherefore the even before the feast,
D^linda he ought spies:
And thus amidst his other talk,
this tale he began devise.
As joyful news as ever came
to th^^ D^linda erst,
Or gladder far then ever yet,
thy l^ft^ng ears have pearst.
I will im^ert to thee my nowne
and chiefest faithful friend)
With whom, the rest of this my life,
in wedlock I will spend.
Leave of therefore, those musing dumps,
that trouble so thy mind:
And to my happy tale se that,
thy open ears be inclinde.
Thou long have seen with grief (I know)
what signs of love have past,
Betwixt thy Lady mistres, and
twixt me thy friend (at last,)
Thou know, how long I suid, and servd,
her grace for to obtain:
And eke thou know how loyal I,
all that time did remain,
Thou know (mine own) that only was,
the chiefest cause that I
So slenderly requited thee,
and thy great courtesy.
But se^, as fond affections forse,
and signs of seemly grace,
As bewties beams, assotted me,
to serve that froward face:
So now (at last) that coyeishnes,
and her disdainful mind,
Has turned my heart intrapped long,
that beauty so did blind
To lothsomnes, and like disdain,
and now I am as free,
(Thank God) as when indiffrent eye
did egally each see.
Wherefore, in sign of this dispite,
and of more careless heart:
What in my mind I have deuis^,
to thee I will impart.
Thou know (quoth he) there is in court
a row of houses old:
That wast do lie, vnoccupide,
unable scarce to hold.
Them s^lues a loft upon the ground
a place of no repair:
E^cept with dogs, or vermyn vile
or else with fowls of thayre.
Against these rotten walls there is,
(as thou right well do know)
Imbossed ought from joined frame,
a stately bay window.
Which is as void as is the rest,
a lodging fit for none:
At that self place, I have deuisd^
that thou thy self alone:
About the hour of ten at night
shall mete thy Polinesse:
Tomorow, dekt with princes roabe^
and eke thy self shall dress.
With glistring ^al^ and iuels rich,
with those she ware that day:
Where I in scorn of Princes will
with thee Dalinda play.
And eke imbrase thy worthy corpse,
as dear so me as life:
Of whom (as soon as time shall serve)
I mind to make my wife,
This is theffect of my devise,
this is the sum and all:
Of that which brings liberty,
to thee that now art thrall.
For here in court thou subject art,
to beck and to obey:
Where next to me in Albany
thou chief shall bear the sway.
Therefore if spark of faithfulness
lodge in thy gentell breast:
If ever yet to pleasure me,
thy friendship has been pressed.
Fail not with corded ladder and
with Princes brave attire,
At that same place and at that time,
to yield to my desire.
Said crafty Duke, and therewith stai^s,
his false deceitful tongue:
The sting whereof, so seruenly
has our Dalinda stung.
And eke that vile ambition,
has so infect the maid:
That presently she yeldeth to,
all that before he said.
Thus has the Duke, (as heart would wish)
performd his enterprise:
And finished has his false request
as he co^ld best devise:
And now unto his careless couch
with ^asd mind he hies:
And lies til the golden globe,
does drive night from his eyes.
The irksome shade, that so annoyes
the heavy pensive wight,
Forsakes the skies, and morning now
has banished drous^ night.
The ^oyfull day does show his face,
the gromes no longer lie,
But to perform his charge, each one
with careful mind does plie.
The massy roabes for princes grace
from wardrobe are out brought:
The borders brave of gouldsmithes craft,
with stone and pearl I wrought:
The Iu^ler delivers to
the Ladies of the court,
with tablet, cheine, and brasl^ttes dekt,
with stones of diverse sort.
with those the careful ladies dress,
Ieneuora that day,
That rather seems of heavenly mould,
then of dame natures clay.
thus dressed, this peereles princes plies
for to perform her rights,
To chapel, well accompanied
with rought of Scottish knights.
There all the morning she does spend
as temples hestes require,
And prayers said, to court again
the Princes does retire.
But what needs longer stay herein,
what booteth to report.
The dayntie cates, servd in that day,
and of the diverse sort.
As well of pleasant ^acchus cups,
as Ceres dainty dish:
And of the dulcet musickes skill
as sweet as care would wish.
Since far from blis my style is changd
this day has causd that care:
That neither head can well devise
ne pen can well declare.
Therefore let courtiers joy in court
and give me leave a while,
To write of hopeles wretches haps,
whom treason did beguile.
The setted time by Polinesse
approaches on a pace:
when stranger should behold y^ Duk^
the Princes to embrace.
Wherefore as one not well assurd
of Scottish faithfulness:
Ne certain that the Duke did mean
as late he did express.
Least that (I say) in some dark place
he had imbusht a crewe:
Of traitors to inuyron him,
when he this sight should vewe.
He comes unto his brother then,
whose might he knew right well,
Would succor him assuredly,
if any then would mell.
whose company he craves that night
when he should see him g^:
With Polinesse, and that he would
bring sword with him also.
Lurcanio, whose life and death,
his brother might command
With willing mind consents unto
Ariodants, demand.
Duke Polinesse, not careless of
thappointed hour and time:
(which now is come) when y^ I should
perform his filthy crime.
Comes to this most unhappy man,
and biddes him follow fast:
If that he list to see the thing,
whereof he told him last.
Ariodant that l^ng had stayed
to see the careful end:
Obeys the Duke, and after them
Lurcanio does wend.
To desert houses they are come
the Duke has brought his mate
Unto a place direct against
the window which of late
I told you of, where (Princes like)
Dalinda should appear:
before y^ Duke, dect with those robes
their Prince that day did wear.
Ariodant thus plaste, the Duke
does bid him cast his eye
Upon that window, where (quoth he)
thou shall thy Lady spy.
^urra^o that longs to see
the sequel of this jest:
Is come within ten feet whereas
Ariodant does rest.
Where he unseen may view likewises
that window at his will:
There secretly the stranger stands,
that doughtes some present (...).
Duke Polinesse, no sooner leaves
the penciue lovers place:
But t^ thappointed window, he
directes his feet apase.
Where he had not remained long,
but see, with glistring light
Of gould, Dalinda does appear
like angel to the sight.
and as the Duke had given in charge
so she in brauest wise:
with shining robes, with Diamonds set
that glem^ before the eyes
Like burning torch in winter night
is come into this place:
Where Polinesse like Iud as does
her scorned limbs embrace.
And to the end, the stranger should
more perfectly behold:
His loving toys, her kisses eke.
and how his arms do fould
Her griped wast he does approach
as nere as window will
give leave to him, to strangers sight
that he might view his fill
Thereof, and how she ^l^spes her arms
about his stretched neck:
Whose store of kisses do declare,
her mind void of suspect.
Lurcani^, whose glasingeyes
are not unoccupied:
Upon the window stating stands
where he has now espied
Ieneuora, (as he did deem)
because of Iuels bright:
And eke the golden roabes did shine
so lively in his sight.
But for to know, who so did toss
the Princes rich attire:
Pis staring eyes and greedy looke^
by no means could aspire.
This sight, thus seen, Lurcanio
(accompting brothers health
As life, to him,) in secret wise
(unknown) is come by stealth.
Where most unhappy lover stays,
who seeing all this jest:
As man distraught, his rapiere he
in hasty hand has pressed.
And scorning longer life, has set
the hilts upon the ground:
In mind by falling on the point
to carue his fatal wound.
And as he did on groaning blade
his desperate body bend:
(Behold the mercy great of God)
his brother does defend.
His trembling heart from deadly pushe,
by hol^ing in his arms
His falling breast, and that once done
he thus his brothers charms.
What deulish act annoie^h thus
thy head bereud of wit:
What desperate joy has taunted thee
what foul and loathsome fit
Has so beguile thy senses al,
that thus (unhappy wight)
Thou sekst by this untimely death
thy passions vile to quite.
In this the end of all our toil?
is this our travels gain?
Is loathsome death thy just desert
and is an endless pain
A gwardon fit for me, (think thou)
that leaving native soil:
(Like banish slave) sha^ live in court,
consumd with cares tourmoyle
For loss of thee, whom as my life,
thou know I hold as dear?
And shall I live to see the day,
the heavy news to bear.
Unto our careful pensive friends,
that by his own consent:
Their wre^ched friend Ariodant,
his latest days has spent?
O^ reckles friend of brothers life,
and could thy heart agree:
To leave thy brother destitute,
of friend in strange country?
Or if thou had nowhit esteemd
thy faithful brothers life:
Could Ladies falshod force thee run,
on point of persing knife?
What sure has enchanted (tell)
thy skill in wisdoms lore:
What madness has intoricate
thy pleasant thoughts so sore.
That neither loss or joyful life
no fear of dampened ghost:
Can change my mind from this intent
(o^ wretch of wretches most)
Can beauty bleare thy wilful eye
and forcy thee for to love:
And cannot sight of ^oule deceit,
from amors force thee move.
Can fancy frame that am^^tit
by sight of seemly grace:
Which present guile, and filthy fact,
by no means can displace?
And can thou wreake such sharp reueng^
upon thy giltles heart:
And see her love that is the gr^und
of this thy present smart?
^oo^e out (I say) such ugly thoughts
from bounds or troubled mind:
And seek by reasons sweet advise
some wholesome salve to find.
If eye did choose a faithful friend
and fancy did agree:
If hope intiste thy drowned hart^
to serve assuredly.
Let now to s^er signs of hate,
let proufs of like disdain:
Lodge scornefulnes in careless heart
for love long vowde in vain.
So shall thou drive these dreadful ^^nges,
out from thy panting breast:
And to thine own Lurcanio,
bring lasting joy and rest.
Said careful soul Lurcanio,
unto Ariodant:
That has as many ^ares to hear,
as has the Adamant.
So altered has this sight his wits
and eke his stayed intent:
That sage advise was bootles given,
the sequel to prevent.
Yet lest his brother might perceive
his changeles will to die:
And least by striving with his force,
be might his purpose spy.
Though overcome with mortal ^angs
he mute and dombe does stand:
(In sign of grace,) he puts his blade
into his brothers hand.
That don, from that unhappy place
to chamber close they hie:
And (as the time of night did crave)
to bed they both do pl^e.
Lurcanio (in hope his words
had changd his brothers mind)
(Naught doughting of the present i^)
a quiet sleep does find.
But he, surprisd (...) dreadful thought^
with visage pale and wanne
In stead of sleep, in frantike mind
a thousand times does banne.
The day which first gave light to him
^e curses eke the teate
That in his fancy did give,
to him his sucking meat.
As often he bannes his damned eyes,
that so could (...) their sight:
And eke his tongue y^ sude for grace,
of one so false a wight.
He curses now his open ear
that so did mark her guyle:
And hasty heart that trusted so
her lips so fraught with wile.
What should I say, both head, and hand,
and all he could invent:
In steed of bliss, and wishes good,
he does with curse torment
So in this wise each night is spent
and day renues again:
His wonted course, but night, ne day,
can change this lovers pain,
But still upon some present death,
he gladly does devise:
As one that only finds that salve,
to ease his scorchi^ ^^i^s.
Wherefore to drive sus^ on
the more from brothers ^rest:
He cloaks his care, and ris^th when,
Lurcanio leaves his rest.
And finding then occasion
to leau^ his company:
He hies in have by wilf^ll death
to end his misery.
As stricken heart, whose bleading wound,
declares a present death,
With reckles feet climmes hill and vale,
whilst he has life and breath:
As greadie Bear, that is berevd,
(whilst she do^^ raunge for pray)
Of littell whelp, does howl and roar,
and dreadfully does bray:
As Lurtel Dove that is beguild
of hoped faithful mate,
In pining wise mis^^king spendes,
her time till latest fate:
So fares it with Ariodant,
this wretch full fraught with woe,
Whose trembling feet no sooner had
left poor Lurcanio:
But out unknown to fields he hies,
and raunging here and there,
Like frantike man, now runs he fast
and now (as caught wi^h ^eare)
^e creeping by y^ ground does crawl
and now (like one aghast)
He staring stands not moving joint
and now he vies as fast.
But still v^on this tragedy,
upon his let part,
His heavy mind, is occupide,
and eke his desperate heart.
Wherefore, at last approaching near
unto a River deep:
He does conclude his last devise,
no longer now to sleep.
But calling to a traueler
that then past by the way:
With broken s^^bes and faltring tongu^
he thus to him does say.
My friend (quoth he) although unknown
perhaps I am to thee,
Yet let me crave thy courtesy,
thus much to do for me:
That is, that thou forthwith wilt go,
unto the Scottish court,
Where from me, to Ieneuora,
thus much thou shall report.
Through to much sight Ariodant,
has found untimely death:
And yielded to the greadie stream,
his last departing breath,
This same is all, this do form,
let p^^ie move thy mind:
Since power wants for to requite,
that friendships lore does byn^e.
This said, the cloudie sighs proc^^de
from scorched heart by heaps:
And therwithal deep sobs and groans,
from gasping throat out leapes.
The traueler, aghast to hear,
these strange and careful news,
Does feel his vital senses fail
and falls in mortal mewse.
And coming to him self again
in fair and friendly wise,
(Like to his skill) he utters
what harm thereof might rise.
As first, his death once bruted forth,
his life is had in scorn,
And there with lasting memory,
with liueles limbs is worn
Except report reproachful blast
in every coast does sound:
How wilfully Ariodant,
his desperate course has dround.
Besides the danger of the soul,
he puts into his mind:
And eke the terror of the pain,
that is therefore assingde.
B^t care of heaven, or dought of hell,
is fardest from his thought:
And how y^ world would deem of him
he neither cares ought.
Wherefore when no persuasion
could change his black intent:
with drowned eyes, y^ stranger does
to his request consent.
Then from the top of craggy rock,
he looks to stream below:
^ stretching ^ooth his shaking arms.
him self forthwith does throw
^midst the stream, y^ foulds his corse
and there withal does ^inke
Unto the ground, and there remaynes,
which causd the stra^nger think
That gredi go^lf had chokt his breath
and that he had been dead:
Wherefore he hies unto the court,
with mind complet with dread.
Ariodant, (though noble heart,
did scorn for to remain
In such distres, and rather chusd
by death to ease his pain,)
Yet feeling pangs of loathsome death,
which kind could not endure:
He strives again to get that life,
which care did erst procure
To banish from his vexed limbs,
and using lothed might:
by force of arms and stretched legs
life there has won the fight.
And death is fled, with whom retires
that foul and dreadful thought:
Which careful wretch Ariodant
to dear well me had bought.
Thus quite from death, the stranger now
does sommon wits again,
To counsel what is best to do
amidst these storms of rain.
First, pleasure biddes him to repair
again^ to lu^^y court,
Where sone thou shall distroy (quoth he)
these thoughts through pleasant sport.
And since thou art by skill instruct,
to shun false Uenus bayte:
Persuade thy self, the blinded boy
no more for thee will wait.
With that conceit affection,
does seem for to agree,
Although in reasons they be all,
and therefore thus says he.
How know thou Lurcanio
will brook these heavy news,
What grief of mind shall he endure
what torments will he use
(Think thou) when he shall hear thy death)
to ryd his lothed life?
The best is think by pining days,
if not by persing knife.
And I (quoth virtue) can not yield,
unto your joint consents:
I see small reason to induse
me, to so strange intents.
We say, that man thryse happy is
whom others proved ha^ me,
From falling hedlong to such haps,
can warn and warely charm.
The court was causer of thy care,
by court did spryng thy pain:
Then let these dangers of the court
from court strange the again.
The wyly byrd can shun the net
which erst enthrald her so:
The sely mouse once caught in trap,
can shun the guyle also.
But vessels said with sower wine,
keep still their former tast^
And that which in the boane is bred,
from thence is hardly plast.
So hard it is to master love
which rooted is in heart:
But rather by continual sight
is grown a greater smart.
And as unto Lurcanio,
how he these news will take:
I dought it not but for thy death
he great complaint will make.
But for to say, in desperate wise,
he will him self confound,
That's very strange, ^ hard to mak^
that in mine ears to sound,
He loves thee as a brother ought,
(so nature does him move)
But self love touches nearer kind^
this tale thou true shall prove.
At first thy death is grief to him,
^ls kindly force is gone:
But as the wearing time does wa^^e
so does abridge his moan.
wherefore leave lusty bloods in court
let brother morn his fill:
Let fading worldly pleasures be,
and ^erke than to my skill:
Learn thou with remnant of thy days,
the blissed sacred lore,
Seek now at last tappease the heu^s
whom thou offendst so sore.
So shall thou learn by life to die,
and die to live in joy:
So shall not then thy fleshly lusts,
thy sin^ull ghost annoy.
This sentence was no sooner told
but for to show consent,
Each lymme and joint are eased well
and lyppes pronounce, content,
The Parliament thus ended is,
to virtue stranger yeldes:
And running here and there abroad
amidst the desert fields:
He does at last a sheapard spy,
whom he in friendly wise
Salutes, and after that, he crau^s
the sheapard to advise
Him of some holy place, whereas
a man might lead his life
In quietness, and where he might
abandon worldly strife.
Upon this hill (quoth shepard then)
if that thou list to go:
Thou shall there find an Hermetage
an aged man also,
That there alone does pass away
his weary aged time.
In prayers much devoutly for
remi^^e of former crime.
This known, Ariodant does leave,
the Sheapehard with farewell
And mountes on hauty hill, whereas
the Hermit poor does dwell.
And finding him amidst his beads
with hearty greatings made:
The goodly courtier strayns his spech
and thus to him he said.
That god that formed the earth and seas
and framed man of naught.
Increase thy faith, and send thee that
which thou so long have sought
^ood father, though, (through tender age,)
the frail unbridled youth
Does lack the deep discretion,
to seanne and judge the truth:
And thought the motions of the flesh
provoke the fickle brain
To light esteem the heavenly food,
and honor fancies vain:
Yet (you do know) by turning often,
the true discourses old
Of ancient acts, how God above,
disdaynd not to unfold
His hidden secret mysteries
unto the tender age:
When contrary, he does dispyse
to show that to the sage.
for proof we need none other show
then Daniell the child:
Who savd Susanna from the flames
and justice eke did yelne,
Unto the aged Judges two,
who failing their intent:
Concluded to condemn to fire
the sily innocent.
So David, (in his infancy,)
inspird with heavenly might:
Did conquer stout Goliaghs limbs
in open combat fight.
which prove not time, but godli giftz
sent from the spring of grace:
Do rule within the virtuous,
and in his heart take place.
That heavenly beck, and fountain clear
has moysted so my lust:
Oh father, that the vanities,
(which late my ghost did rust,)
Are washed clean from my fretted heart,
and now I am in mind:
(It thou will grant) by more advise
more store of grace to find.
And since the chaste and secret life,
abandons fading wealth:
And poor and sparing abstinence
lettes in the lasting health:
Deny me not thy fellowship,
grant me thy company:
Help now to save a sinful soul^
that eraues a remedy.
So shall I bridell foul desire,
and thou do service great
To him, that has prepared for us
(I hope) a heavenly seat.
He said, and staid, and Hermit then
with bended looks to skies,
With heaued arms, and watrie plants
directs his tale this wise.
That faith, which Samuel possessed,
God grant thee to enjoy:
God send thee Samso^s strength to help
when feeud would thee annoy.
As wise as Solomon the wise,
as chaste as Jacobs son:
As constant as Abednago:
whom, fyrie flames did shun.
Hold here my shaking hand (quoth he)
I do embrace thy will:
Be thou to me a lasting mate,
if deeds thy words fulfill.
Thus is our lusty courtier made,
(by taking small degree)
An hermit, poor, and learneth now
a holy man to be.
whom I must leave amidst his roots
(in steed^ of dainty cates)
And now unto the traueler,
(that is come to the gates.
Of Scot^ish court) I must return,
who craves in gentill wise
To speak with fair Ieneuora
that careless does devise.
Of sundry sports amongst her mayd^
she is advertised
Of traueler, and sends for him
he comes nigh chockt with dred.
And after humble duty done,
and trembling every vain:
With hollow voice, ^is paly lips
he thus to speak did strain.
what news (oh Princess) I do bring
what message I declare:
If good, or bad, as it is unknown,
so let thy highness spare.
The skilles m^ssenger, that is
by faithful promise bound:
This ruthful message to pronounce,
and in thine ears to sound.
The same, which wretched cati^e ^,
with these mine eyes did see:
Which as they are, and as I was
comma^nded, take from me.
Through to much sight, Ariodant
has found untimely death:
And yielded to the greedy stream
his last departing breath:
This he did say, which I have showd
unto your majesty:
And then he lept into the stream,
and died, (oh ruth to see^)
Now to your skillful judgments, I
oh Ladies do commit:
To show upon these careful news
what kind of cruel fit.
Oppressed unhappy Princes ghost,
what thoughts of endless pain,
what scorching grief, what frose fear
within her temples rain.
What flashing blud does bo^le within
her limbs of heavenly mould:
What trembling dread does shake each joint
then nipping ise more could.
Such terms (I say) of mind oppressed
I leave unto thy skill:
Oh Phoenix byrd, that of like ^oyes
for friend have found thy fill.
But since (my Lords) your doughtfull heade^
can hardly deem such fittes:
To ^well in Ladies pleasant heads,
I will enforce my wits.
To tell you here the whole discourse
of her lamenting case:
And eke what pensive passions love
within her heart did place.
This message dark, pronounced thus,
the messenger departs:
But message he does leave behind:
to sauce the Princes smartes.
The sound whereof no sooner had
perst through her listing ear:
But after it unto her head
do follow storms of fear.
Which makes the golden frisled hear^
right up in head to stand:
And fury for^^ her crystal eyes,
to burn like fire brand.
O^t from her nose and mouth does pas,
a stream of gushing ^loud:
And eke like rubie trickling dr^pp^^
f^^m bathed eyes do scu^.
From gasping throat no breath proceeds,
each limme has lost his life:
Twixt sobbing ^art and dreadful death,
appears a mortal strife.
Her (...) ioynte, with senceles corse,
do founder to the ground:
In fine, each piece, each part, and all
are fallen into a sound.
But (Lord) what stir the Ladies keep^
what mones the maids do make:
What skreekes, and cries, they send to skies,
what careful pains they take,
For to releaue their mistres dear,
whom they did love so well:
Does pass my wit, and skilles head,
in writing plain to tell.
For one with careless hand
her tender fingers wring:
And she with pinching of her nose
does make the blood out spring.
This matron bends her heavy head,
down to her crased breast:
And this, her joined jaws and teeth,
does force with key to wrest.
She cales for Aqua fortis, and
Ieneuora she cries:
And she in steed of helping hand,
spends tears from drowned eyes
For troth no old experimen
that dying fittes could cure:
No tears, no cries, no doleful tune,
that sorrow can procure:
But these bewayling Ladies, have
at full attempted, and
With willing heart and careful mind,
assayd and taken in hand.
T^rough which attempts, and using so
her sensles figure fair:
Out from her ^ha^ed mouth does pa^
a slender breathing air.
And then her setted eyes in head,
she heavily does roll:
As though she presently would yeld^
unto the heavens her soul.
And thus with groaning voice she says,
oh haples harmefull hands:
That would not suffer death to rid
my gh^st from careful bands.
Oh careless foes what profittes you,
to see me diyng live:
Wh^t shall you gain to see this hand
my deadfull stroke to give.
Oh dismal day of my d^^tresse,
oh my Ariodant:
Naught ^ls but my departing soul,
thy flying ghost does want.
which, (since thy life was my increase)
thy death shall now enforce:
By bloody hands to yield to thee,
with wounding of my corse.
But oh, what ^ight so much annoyd
thy comely personage:
That unto thy Ieneuora,
thou could do such outrage?
In drowning y^ which I more dear
then friends or life di^ h^uld,
The sight whereof brought health to me,
when I did it behold.
What sight so vile, the view whereof
could master so thy mind,
That unto me thy vowed friend
thou could be so unkind?
Did ever sign of foul untruth,
appear before thy sight?
Did ever deed or word make false
that faith that I did plight?
To thee: and which I never sought
since first I ^ound to lo^^?
Dorst ever yet these lips of mine,
presume for to disclose.
(Till now to late) our ^ecret love?
oh speak thou flying ^prite,
And ease me of this one conceit,
as thou art faithful knight)
To late, to late. (a less) I cry,
in vain I wast my breath:
But out to soon: to soon, (a less)
I wayle thy cruel death.
And shall I live bereud of fri^nd,
shall mourning let in age?
And is it enough with heavy mones,
my passions to assuage?
No, no, mine own Ariodant
my first approved friend:
And eke ^he last with whom I mind
my days in love to spend:
Even as thy lively feature,
inforst me to thy love:
So shall thy death, let in my death,
as time right well shall prove.
And as she did begin at first,
nie chockt with mortal sound:
Even so she ends her heavy plaint,
with falling down to ground.
Amidst ^^ele storms of deadly grief
and p^ssi^ns ^^oarde with pain:
Rep^rt with treble sounding voice
his yelling ^^rdaie does strain.
And puttes into each open ear,
how that by sel^ consent:
Amidst the stream Ariodant,
his latest days has spent.
And now into Lurcanios ears,
this heavy news he blows:
And how, ^ when, he drowned him self
to him he plainly show^s.
wherewith y^ careful brother caught,
with sting of pearsing death:
Resines his warlike force, and falls
ther^with down to the earth.
Where after many griping groans,
inforst by grief of mind:
His noble heart has won by force
his banished breathing wynd.
But festred lies in heart the care,
that troubles every vain:
And deep in thought is lodgd y^ cause,
of this new proved pain.
The force whereof so calmed has
his flerce coragious heart:
That see from eyes long time dryd up,
a flood of tears depart.
Which mixed are with heavy sobbes
from manlike broyling breast:
And compast in with smoking sighs,
and flames of great unrest.
All these in dungeon deep below
Alecto fires espies:
Whose nature is, in vexed ha^t
pale hatred to devise.
Wherefore (her snaky hears wound up)
she leaves her loathsome den
And flies unto the Scottish court:
whereas, ^urcanio then
Was heaue^y bewayling of
his wretched brothers death,
To whom (like aged matron dight,)
she ^pends this devilish breath.
When shall thy childish plaints have end?
when shall thy cares be spent?
when shall thy latest sighs be brethed
that tend to small intent?
Oh, false unto thy brothers ghost,
do wome^ns mones suffice,
To answer that, which for reueng^
to thee each hour cries?
Shall murder thus be suffored?
shall bloody hands enjoy
A longer life, is this the love
thou sekst for to imploye
On him, that (whilst he lived on earth)
held thee then life more dear?
Is this a brothers just reward?
do thou such friendship bear
Unto thy most abused friend?
and can thou live to see
Thy brother dead, his foe alyue^
him sterud, and she still free?
has nature formd thee void of wit?
(oh cruel to thy kind)
Has pity so asso^ed, this
thy worthy warlike mind?
That neither brothers amity,
ne lynke of justice lore,
Can move thee for this foul offense
just judgment to implore?
Leave thou these lamentations long,
dry up these childish tears,
And spedely see that thou put
into thy souereignes cares:
How that the Prince Ieneuora
dishonored has her state:
In feeding her dishonest lust
with one thou saw of late,
And that of body she is false,
see thou defend with force:
So shall thou yield a just reward,
by burning of her corse.
This spightfull spite, thus vomited
from ugly loathsome pate
A snake she pulles which for to move
Lurcanio more to hate.
She throws into his bosom right,
where stinging it remaynes:
And poysneth so each joint and limme,
and swelles so all his veins,
That raging, (like a f^an^ike beast,)
unto the king he hies:
To whom, his duty finished,
this tale he does deu^se.
That faith (oh king) which subjects bare
unto their soncraigne:
That io^^ that to their Princely st^te,
within their hearts remain.
That care which to their high renown,
and honor eke they have:
And last, that great regard they use,
their virtue still to save:
Has forced my trembling tongue to speak
against the l^^t of mind,
and charged my closed lips to tell,
that duties force does bind.
Which news, though some unrest do bring
unto your horie hears,
Yet yelding justice for the same,
gaynes life that never wears
Oh worthy king, and my liege Lord
(though but alyde by vow)
The noble intertainment, which
I have received of you,
Commaundes me not to hide a fact,
so hemous from your grace,
though deed be done by such anon^,
as comes of r^yall rare.
Whordom (oh king) committed by
the Prince Ieneuora
It is, that so has moved my tongue
and lips from l^nger stay.
which th^se my eyes (to soon) have seen
at place and time unfit:
In proof whereof, ^oo here my gage,
I will my life commit
Into his hands, that gives the palm
unto the faithful wight,
and yeldes the gain of victory
to him that fights in right.
I need not now declare what thought ^
oppress the pensive king,
Ne what ill rest to aged head,
these careful news do bring:
Since prone it is to testie age
to take in fretting wise
A small offense, and every fault
is great before their eyes.
wherefore his present panges I pass,
I leave his heavy heart
Wrapped in with web of carefulnes,
and gript in grave of smart:
And to this kings reply, I will
direct my pen again,
Who pausing long from careful thought^
at last he does refrain,
and thus he says.
LUrcanio, thy service good
and faithful unto me,
Does arg^e in my doughtfull head,
thy mind from falsehood free:
But if my age be not disceiud,
if fame do not beguile
My hoping heart, such shameful acts
are fardest in exile
from her whom thou have now accusd
whose parents goodly age,
Was never justly tay^ted with
a deed of such outrage.
Wherefore since doughtfull yet it lies,
within our princely mind
And since none but Lurcanio.
this foul abuse does find
We will before our sentence given
examine this accusd:
That has by whordom (as thou say)
our state so much abusd.
And least thou deem me partial,
I do accept thy gage
Condicionly, that thou thy self,
this proferd fight shall wage
Against who lists to maintain
her truth against thy might
(Like to our ancient laws ordeind)
by force of combat fight.
And it thou gain the victory.
then she to flames of fire:
If vanquist thou, she free shall live,
thou death shall have for hire.
Which fight we will shall be performd
upon the fifteenth day:
Ensuing next, when God (I trust)
the right with right will pay.
So said, Lurcanio leaves the King,
and to his chamber hies:
Where for his brothers death he does
renew his wonted cries.
But careful king, (when stranger was
departed from his sight:)
(In mind to try his truth herein)
does send a faithful knight.
For careful Ieneuora
whom messenger does find:
Amidst her maids lamenting still
with head to breast inclind^.
To whom his duty finished,
his message he does show,
Thef^e^ whereof Ieneuora
when perf^^tly does know,
^he wiping clean her bathed cheke^
and trimmeth up her hear,
Does so repair unto the king,
though with unchanged cheer.
To whom, she is no sooner come,
but voydance then is made
Of each estate, and then the king
with trickling tears thus said.
They say, that child thrice cursed is,
whose vile and viciou^ life,
Does cause the loving parents dye
consumde with careful strife
which endless grief, god grant (quoth he)
thy acts force me not prove,
But that thy hoped virtues do,
from such conceits me move.
It Is so (quoth he) Ieneuora
whylst in our Princely court
We weard away our crooked age,
like to our wonted sort:
Before our presence does appear,
the stout Lurcanio,
Who of free will did justify
and threw down gage also
To prove: that thou have don the deed
that has deserved fire,
I mean that thou have purchased death
through whordoms foul desire.
which deed, him self did see he vowed
at place an^time vnmeet^
And judgment he did crave also
for such offense most fit.
which judgment I have stayed yet,
to hear what thou can say:
why dreadful doom of present death,
should longer for thee stay.
This said, the king complete with car^
does stay his choked breath:
And feels the force of mortal ache,
and latest pangs of death.
But she, whose wretched ghost has felt
the worst of all her smart,
With countnance fearse (disdayning life)
all fear does set appart,
And answers thus unto the king,
my lord and sovereign.
Of catiues all she wretch is m^st
she feels most store of pain.
whose heavy hap does rather ^idde
the tongue for to confess
Untroth, then by accusing tale
to plead for her redress.
Oh king, of whom this earthly shap^
by ^ome I do enjoy,
Let not these latest words of mine,
thy Princely mind annoy:
But hear indifferently what cares,
thy child does now sustain:
That rather seeks to suffer death,
then long to taste this pain.
My dread, and sovereign Lord and king
thy skillful horie hears
Know, well, how from the cradell up
unto the latest years:
We subject are to every sin,
and thrald of natures kind,
By thought, by word, by deed, and sight
unto the fancies blind
Of worldly cares, and naught there is
within our sinful heart
But fancies fond, which reason wills
should taste a lasting smart.
Such thoughts, such words, such deeds, and fights
oh king have ruled in me:
And do, and will, till of the yok^
of life my ^imm^s he free.
Amongst which sinful passions,
one (...) annoyed my mind,
One act there (...) wherein (oh king)
I greatest grief do find:
which fith both time and present stat^
byds t^ll unto your grace,
I will disclose, and from my heart
all damps of fear displace.
whereby I shall drive dought (I trust)
out from your doughtfull breast,
And make you privy of such hap^
as in me lurking reast.
Amongst the train of this your court
and of your courtiers stout,
Amongst the worthy company
of all the courtly rought:
There was (your highness knows right well)
one knight Ariodant:
In whom that should adorn a man,
no gift at all did want.
A seemly wight, of spotles faith,
although an alien borne:
Whose shape with thousand comely gifte^
dame nature did adorn.
His noblenes, his grace, and shape,
enforce my virgins heart:
Long time to plunge in goulfs of care
and taste of lovers smart.
He turned my chaste disposed mind
from thoughts of maidens life:
And taught me seek to salve y^ wound
of Cupides fatal knife.
But see (the heuens I think it would)
that stroke which pearst my breast,
Did carue in him a griefly gashe
and in his heart did rest.
Thimpoisned push, which forced him
to feel like fittes and pain:
And in like storms of troubled mind
long time for to remain.
Till y^ a means he found, which way
he might disclose his love
To me, and eke for to bewray,
that Cupides force did move.
Which when I understood, no wight
did ever taste like joy
As I (glad soul) that banished then
that erst did me annoy.
And waying long his virtues great,
and eke his good intent:
(Which caused my affection)
at last I did consent.
Unto his love and choosing then
him as my dearest friend,
I did conclude in wedlocked band,
w^^h him my life to spend:
But see the fr^tes of this our bliss,
see here unstable state:
See, see (oh King) the end of all,
this our most happy ^ate.
Whylst we in link of loyal love
thus led our restles life:
And whylst my careless heart did ioy^
the change of wonted strife.
I know not I, what cruel fact
inforst my hearts delight:
My friend, mine own Ariodant,
to work this cruel s^ight.
On me, amidst the choking streame^
(oh fierce untimely death)
He drowned him self, and to the waves
he did resign his breath.
whose death (oh heart) shall work thiwo
and end thy wonted joy:
And force my heavy head to learn,
how life I may destroy.
Yet know (oh Sir) in all this love,
naught did offend but thought:
Naught trespased, but that unknown
to thee (oh King) I sought
To choose a fear of race unfit,
unto your Princely state:
Whose r^ial ti^e co^mau^ds me choose
a far more firter mate.
But if this gain, by breach of law
the death of scorching fire:
Then do pron^u^^e the sentence stayed
it is death I so desire.
Only let this persuade your mind
no eye did ever see:
This corpse of mine, with whordoms bl^e,
so spotted for to be.
This long discourse of amors past,
and eke de^iall made:
That never cloud of shame could yet
her honor justly shade.
She stayed her weary jaws, and ends
her heavy panting breath:
And wonted wo^s do force herfall,
in sound down to the earth.
The aged King that sees this fit,
nigh caught with like disease,
with shaking hands her temples rubs
and seeks each way tappease.
These choking griefs, but all in vain
he rubs and chafes his child:
For death has nummed every part,
and life is now exilde.
Til panting heart with strained might
receives his wonted force:
And lets in wholesome breath again^
into the senceles corse.
which joyful king (with heart reuyud)
does see and drives fear
Away, and strayning then his sprites,
he thus the Princes does cheer.
I was or this resolved long
of thy unspotted grace
My sweet and dear Ieneuora,
wherefore in heart displace.
These cankerd cares from tender breast
fear not the pains of death:
Let not the loss of desprate friend
force thee resign thy breath.
For I not only will provide
for sauegard of thy life:
But for a ^rend that shall thee please
and guard thy heart from strife.
And kissing long her rubie lips
and wiping clean her eyes:
He takes her by the crystal hand
and cease to devise
Of former talk, and then himself,
conueies her to her court:
Where, (he once gone) she does renew
her wonted careful sport.
But pensive king does tract no time
ne leng^r makes delay:
For to provide a champion,
to help in this assay.
Wherefore with blast of trompets sound
it is proclaimed each where:
That who so list in mortal fight
his spear and armor bear.
Against the stout Lurcanio,
and conquer him in fight^
Shall have to wife Ieneuora,
and all her Princely right.
now with this message pric^ y^ posts
the Herhautes try their steades:
He rides to Brutus worthy realm,
he takes the way that leads
To famous France, and he both hi^
unto an other soyl^^
In fine, each one for Princes does
by land and sea t^^rmoyle.
But bootles do the Posts proclayme
this booty dangerous:
For none list venture, for the gain
a deed so perilous.
Wherefore co^plet with cares they do
return to court again:
And there declare the ill success,
of this their message vain.
But see the hap, one of these Posts
returning void of aid:
Rydes by the Hermitage, whereas
Ariodant stayed.
And meeting then the Hermit old,
that sought for roots abroad:
(Their greetings don) his head he does
of message then unload.
And shows unto the holy sire,
how Prince Ieneuora
For lack of aid should burned be
upon the second day.
Ensuing next, and then be tells
how she was first accusde
By one, that said by whordom vyl^
she had her self abusde.
Thus when they chatted had enough
the Post leaves of his t^lke:
And plies to court, and Hermit he
unto his home does walk.
Where he no sooner i^ arivde,
but (like to wonted sort)
These nouels to his holy mate
he does forthwith report.
But who had seen y^ cou^tnaunce the^
of this Ariodant:
And marked how color went and came
and how his veins did pant.
Mo^ght well have de^de some present pange
had vexed his troubled mind:
And that by this report, his heart
some stra^^ge conceit did find,
For troth, this tale no sooner ^oulde,
and hard with open care:
but ^^oarming thoghts, in ravished head
do cluster now a rear.
Yet virtue, ielously does blame.
his fickell wauring mind:
And constancy condems his thoughts
that fly like dust in wind.
But amors old, prouokes his hart^
to die in her defense:
Record of former amity,
forgettes supposd offense.
The diyng spar^s of ^upides coals
do now revive again:
Her b^utie great and comelines
inforseth former pa^ne.
His youthful years begin to scorn
such pinching misery:
This pining diet makes him loath
such ^^ly penury.
Hope does assure him to win
her true an^ faithful love:
If for her sake, in her defense:
he will this battle prove.
Now nature, does forbid him fight
against Lurcanio:
(For he it is he knows right well)
that was the Princes so.
Love tells him that his brother has
deserved death by right:
In that he has accused her
that is the lamp of light.
Thus fansi^s rule within his head,
as motion^ move the mind:
And changing thoughts do alter still,
as reason right does find.
But to conclude devotion droups,
poor penury is past:
youth likes not now to purchase heaven
with faint and feeble ^ast.
The civil fight with brother, he
regardes n^owhit at all:
His loye, his care, his (...), his death,
he cares not what befall.
Wherefore, as he unknown did come
unto the Hermitage:
So he departs by stealth, without
farewell to father age.
And wanders in the fields, till that
the mantell black did hide:
The gladsome day and then he ^yes
unto the town vnsyide.
Where secretly he comes unto,
his well approved host:
(Whose friendship stood him in great stee^
when cares annoyd him most.)
To whom when long he had discourst
of his adventures all:
He does disclose what he intends
and says, (what so befall)
He will against his brother fight
to save his Ladies life:
Or else before her, end his days,
on point of brothers knife.
Wherefore, he wills him to provide,
a complet armor sure:
That he the better may, against
his brothers force endure.
And sturdy spear, and shield as stiff
he wills him to provide:
And barbed steed, both strong and light,
that tempest like will glyde.
All these he wills him to prepare
and all of color black:
For Sables shall bewray (quoth he)
o^ wanted joys my wrack.
Thus leave I now the busy host,
and eke coragious gest:
Prepa^ing armor such as may
desend the stranger best.
And to the court complet with care
My pen and I must plie:
To tell their dole, their grief, their woe
and mones of misery.
The weary Posts are now return^
unto the heavy court:
Where every one his seurall hap
does dolefully report.
But when the aged king perceiues,
no aid is to be found:
His weak and feeble limbs do fall
for sorrow to the ground.
His counsel eke (that see the cares
of their unhappy king)
Do feel welnie his grief and smart
and weep, and wayle, and wring
Their fingers, and with drowned eyes
lament his wretched state:
And with a thousand doles and plaints
they rue his ruthful fate.
Yet seeing him so sunk in grief,
and fearing present death:
They seek to banish diyng panges,
by reasons wholesome breath.
But sooner might y^ mou^tain move
or sea forsake his tide:
The^ gnawing fits to want the forcs
that through each part do slide.
Of wythord age, and crooked lymmes,
and styng so ^eble heart:
That joy is gone, and bliss resingde,
care turns good hap to smart.
This is the sely Syers state,
the Ladies lead like life:
With whom, naught else but tears, and cries,
and heaviness is ryfe.
For when they hear no help is found,
to aid the Lady dear:
Each chamber sounds of solom tunes,
and cares bring dreadful fear,
So much, that see in clustring heaps,
whylst trembling maidens keep,
And there, whylst with one perfect voice,
they wayle, they woe, and weep:
This fearful soul, does see (she thinks)
the shape of ou^ly sprightes:
She hears in rynging care the sound
of clam^^s loud and skrykes.
The outmost of the prease, does feale
a pull^ng hand to strain
Her slender arm, and shrinkes away,
and couldly sweates for pain.
Thus fear, thus care, lamenting long,
and spring of brackish tears:
With drouping dread, and freating fittes,
in heart op^rest appears,
But she, for whom was all this care,
that had most cause to wayle,
Is void of carefulnes for death,
ne grief does her assail:
Save death of her Ariodant,
that was, th^n corsies bayne
More worse: wherefore for present death
the wishes still in vain.
Ye^ bea^es she with advised mynd^,
the Prelates sage advise:
That wills her to forget the world,
and wonted joys despise.
And biddes her call to mind, the bliss
that never shall have end:
Wher^o by faith and steadfast troth
she shortly shall assend.
He byddes her cast the fear of death,
from bounds of godly breast:
For he can sh^elde her heart (he s^^^s)
from pain, that brings rest.
He voucheth sacred scriptures now,
to st^blish her belief:
He tells what joy the soul receives,
when flesh does suffer grief
And lastly, he persuades her that
she gains by giltles death,
A seat amongst the martyrd saints,
that seed on heavenly breath.
As Abell doth^ whose cruel death
the cursed Cayn does rewe.
Who moud with indignation.
his native brother slew.
With these de^out persuasions
the Prince is mortifide,
Who does for latest brunt of death
with wellyng mind abide.
Amongst these passions ^ragicall
and acts of en^les care:
List now my Lorde^, ^ow Polinesse
that wretched Duke does fare.
Whose guilty mind finds littel case,
so much does fear oppress
His traitrous heart, least that Dalind
his treason should con^^sse
Wherefore, (for greater suertie
of this conc^ald offense)
He does devise a cruel crime
through marriage cl^kte pretense.
That is^ for to persuade Dalind
the morrow next, he will
By sacred law of spousals rightes,
his promise vowde fulfill.
And her consent once gotten, he
deuiseth for to send:
Her with two trusty men of his
unto a wood, to the end.
There to bereue from her, her life
insteede of wedlockes band:
Thereby to ease his doughtfull breast
that fearful yet does stand.
But whilst hereof his wits do muse
see where Dalinda cummes:
Whose hasty pase and heavy cheer
his senses thoroughly nummes.
To whom, her reverence performde,
she shows how that the king
^ath given unto the Steward charge
that he forthwith should bring.
Unto his presence, all the trayn^
of careful Princes grace:
Of purpose to examine them
of this accused case.
(I think quoth she) wherefore my Lord,
I thought convenient:
Upon a matter of such wayght,
to know your wise intent.
This said, the subtle Duke (as though
he wear to seek for wits)
A while with fired eyes on ground
on seat he musing sittes.
But when he had dissembled long
his answer ready made:
With smiling cheer, and foulded arms
thus unto her he said.
I never was deceiud (quoth he)
of thy assured troth
Mine own, and chiefest faithful friend
to whom I would be loath
That any yot of feule mishappe,
should chance or else befall:
Or that to any fretting grief,
thy free mind should be thrall.
But do not thou dismay thy self
I will provide for thee:
I will devise and seek forthwith
for thy best suertie.
I have a house not far from hence,
beyond the mighty wood:
Whereto I will thou do repair,
(if so thou think good.)
By break of day the morrow next,
where thou shall stay for me,
who will upon the Princess death,
with spee^e come visit thee.
And there by deed perform the thing
that vow did erst protest,
By knitting (...) the wedlocks knot
that I so much request.
The ^ot^ng maid misdoughts no guyl^
the soon does condiscende
Unto his tale, and all that night
the ^ath in s^crete spend.
But she once gone, the Duke sends for
two trusty men of his,
Whose cur^^d hands with murdered blou^
had been imbrude ere this:
To whom when long he had discourst,
what faith they ought to bear
Unto their Lord, and eke what troth
within them ought tappeare:
He tells what forced him send for them
and how it was his will:
That whylst they road amydst the wood,
they should Dalinda kill
The ruffyns vile, with small request
moude to so foul a deed:
Consent unto their truell Lord
and show them selves agree (...)
Unto his hest. Who for to move
them more unto this sin,
with promise great of large reward^
he does them fully win.
By this the pensive day is past,
and now the mourning shade
Of black and fearful night appears:
and does each where invade.
Wherein judge you what ease they take,
that are wrapped in with woe,
And coucht in cave of carefulnes,
and bathd in bed also:
Judge you the fathers quiet ease,
and deem the daughters rest,
Think how the goulden sleep does please
the ghost with grief oppressed.
And I will tell how night is gone,
with countenance dark and sad:
Because amydst the restles court
so littel ease he had.
And he thus gone Aurora shows
her cheerful visage gray,
And after her the blushing Phebe
his countnance does bewray.
Who scarce does clime on lowest step,
when as the watching maid,
(Dalinda) leaves her lothed sleep,
and hastes (as afraid
To come to late) to Polinesse,
who puttes her in the guide
Of those ungracious Ruffians,
that he appoynts to ride
With her, unto his house expressed,
and biddes them tarry there
(Dissemblyng wise) till he does come
to quench the sparks of fear.
(If any then did ^indell in
the rechles maidens mind)
Who hopes for troth, as erst she hard
so every thing to find.
Thus ride they forth, and riding I
will leave them for a while:
And to the careful court again
that does forthwith exile.
His drousie domps, I will return
and g^yde my weary hand:
And of their last extremest fittes
who list to understand.
shall hear the end.
THe weary night has brought again
the dry and dreadful day:
When heavy looks, and cloudy sighs,
a storm of ears bewray.
The court has left his tossed couch,
their restles bed all sh^nne:
The ladies have their persing plaints
and doleful tune begone.
Amidst a w^rld of griefs the king
forsakes his bathed bed:
Who for the Prince Ieneuora,
a flood of tears has shed.
But kingly justice ruling still
within his regal mind:
Does t^ll hi^ that the day is come
which he of late assignde.
When either force of victors hand,
should fade Lurcanio:
Or else in fl^mes I^neuora,
her senses should fo^go.
These thoughts of justice force him clek^.
the anguish of his heart:
Affection lurkes in panting breast,
in secreat lodges smart.
Wherefore in hasty wise he does
command unto the fire
The giltles Princes whose deserts,
gain not so foul a hyre.
Whose sentence known, Ieneuora
obeyes with pleased mind
Who decking her like her estate
with lemmes of precious kind.
Like heavenly ghost not earthly wight
she tears her chariot straight
That couerd is with black, on whom
a rought of Ladies weight.
whose moorn^g weeds declare y^ care^
of their disquiet hearts:
And argue to the gasing eye,
the proof of present smartes.
Next them, the king his train is past,
whose heavy pensive cheer:
Agree with those black solom lutes,
which they that day did wear.
Then folow^ careful Counselers.
and then the aged king
In color like, and after them
a world of folk do fling.
In this array, they are aryvd^
upon the dreadful place:
where Princess must resign her lyf^,
if that some spark of grace.
Bety^e her not, there she abydes
to taste her latest care:
Amidst the gho^^ly Prelates that
of heavenly joys declare.
The king scarce set on stately seat
but all in complet steel
Lurcanio comes unto the list,
his challenge to fulfill.
Who seen by false Duke Polinesse,
that then was Martial:
To guide the feeld, he does demand
of him the sum and all.
Of that he sought within the listes,
to whom Lurcanio:
Thus said, I am approached here
to prove against my so.
That by the filthy whordoms crime,
which I (quoth he) did see:
Ieneuora deserved has,
here burned for to be.
This said, he entres in the lystes
and by the relickes there:
In proof of that which erst he said
he does devoutly swear.
Naught wants but execution now,
for that they only stay:
Which to perform, Ieneuora
^oncludes without delay.
Who first disrobes her self of all
her Princely brave attire:
And only in her kyrtell she,
does mind to taste the fire.
Then prostrate on the ground she fallen,
and with a cherefull voice:
She prays to God, with whom she hopes
shortly for to rejoice.
But who had seen the waylings then,
of all the lookers on:
And how each eye is drowned w^t cars
and every month does moan.
might well have seen y^ mothers grief
for death of loved child:
And fathers plaint for nati^e son,
whose life fears death exilde.
Whilst thus the Princess prepares her self
unto her heavy feast:
And whilst each on lamenting stays,
with ruthful sighyng breast.
See where a Knight stands houering,
clad all in armor black:
And mounted on a barbed steed
with sheeld behind his back.
A mighty spear in hand he held
and sword gyrt by his side,
His visar close before his face,
least that he wear discride.
The Marshall spies this Knight vnknown^
and as he said before,
So now he does demand also,
of him, the cause, wherefore:
He is arivd in that array
amydst that worthy press,
To whom Ariodant does
these knightlike words express:
To save (quoth he) from fyry flames
this false accused wight:
Though Scots do fear, I do inten^,
to venture life and might:
Naught doughting but as giltles she
condemned is to die:
So this my spear and sword (I trust)
her truth right well shall try.
The stranger enters thus the liste^
where stoutly he does swear:
That of that foul supposed crime
Ieneuora is clear.
This don, without a longer stay,
the Heraultes cry to fight:
Now do your best, and god him sheel^
that draws his sword in right.
Lurcani^ leaves now to muse,
his spear is coucht in rest:
He forward like the wind does (...)
with sheld before his breast?
Ariodant, not ignorant
with whom he is to fight:
Sets forward to with thundering pase
and meets his brother right.
^ he spears all crushed do mount aloft
each keeps his saddell sure:
Ariodant against his so,
does mightily endure.
Then leave they foming steades, (...) (...)
they draw their shining blades:
Wherewith each one his enemy,
with courage stout inuades.
He smytes a car^ing blow upon,
his adversaries shield:
And he does send a cantell from,
his helmet to the feelde.
Lurcanio is nothing nice,
of his approved might:
Ne yet Ariodant behind,
his alms for to requight.
But far unequal is the match,
Lurcanio seems to play:
When as Ariodant is forced,
to ward, or else decay,
yet as he can he lendes a blow,
and then he shifts again:
From dint of brothers stroke, whose forse
would well requite his pain.
Thus he does strike, and he the blow
receives upon his shield:
And he again, (the vantage spyde)
a buffet byg does yield.
Lurcanio thinks of brothers death,
and fightes like Lion fierce:
Ariodant, (his Lady spied)
both steel and male does pearse.
with bluddy blads they prick and thrust
the ground is dyd^ with blou^e
Now breath they both, and now again
they rage like Tigers wood
In this conflict I must them leave,
each seeking others end:
And to Dalinda once again,
my pen and I must bend.
Who once aryvde within the wood,
where she must yield her life:
In steed of sol^m marriage,
on edge of Ruffyns knyfe.
They bid her light of from her horse,
and with a countnance fie^s:
The sum of that they ha^ in charge
to her they do rehears.
which when she knew, from wonted talk
her closed lips refrain:
And fear of death do force her feel
the panges of deadly pain.
Her careless head, late occupid^
with blissed wedlock^s bands
Is comefortles, and now poor wretch
as stone in wall she stands.
So far her present thoughts be od,
as hope of ^uertie:
And now to sure signs of smart
and storms of misery.
But making of necessity
a present virtue, she
Decrees as time did serve to make
her soul from bondage free.
And kneling then upon the ground
betwixt these ghostly mates:
That mind by caruing of her head
to end ^er latest fates.
She prays unto the Creator
to pardon her offense:
And that he would forget her sin
and way her penitence.
Then with a stream of tears she rews
her Ladies giltles death:
For whom, the anguish of her heart.
does choke welny her breath.
What should I say, for thousand sins
which she did never know:
(To length y^ time) she prays to God
that he will mercy show.
but see how in most dangerous tides
often times does happen bliss:
See how in present stroke of death
the heart relieved is.
whilst thus she prays adventure drove
through search of nearest way:
To Scottish court, upon the place
where she devout does pray.
The famous knight Raynaldo, who
beholding with his eye:
betwixt two Ruffians naked swords
a Lady pressed to die.
He spurs his Steed, and draws his blade
and drives unto them two:
In mind to reseue if he could
that careful wight from woo.
The tormenters that saw him come
dispayring of their might:
Forsake y^ maid and mount on Steeds
and save them selves by fight.
which when Dalinda vews, she thus
unto Raynald began say:
Yet let me crave this curtes^e
or thou depart away.
(Oh worthy Knight,) that is, y^ thou will be my guide unto
The most vnhapiest Scottish court
and most complete with woe.
Where I shall bring the ioyfulst news
that ever came to king:
And tell the gladdest tale that erst,
a messenger did bring.
Raynaldo grauntes to her desire
she is now horst again:
They forward post, and as they ride
she greatly does complain.
Of false Duke Polinessos guyle
she blames his subtle will:
And for revenge to god she cries
for such offense most fit.
Thus weary time is spent, and now
they are within the vewe:
of flaming bronds of glistring swords
and of the Scottish crewe.
The^ with a strayne^ balowing voice
stay how Raynaldo cries:
Depart the Knights, and with y^ word
^^ne casts up his eyes.
To see from whence proceeds y^ voice
that ringes so in their ears:
And therwithall Raynaldo and
Dalinda, do appear.
who passing through y^ mighty prease,
at last approach the seat:
Of Scottish King, whereas Dalind
begins for to entreat.
Of all the treason which the Duke
and she did late devise,
But crying first, stay Polinesse,
thus to her tale she plies.
Why should I longer stay (oh wretch)
why should my lips refrayn
From sounding out the perfect troth
which hidden, seeks to stayne
The giltles Imphe of virtues school
whose spotless troth does cry
For just revenge for such offense,
to him that rules sky.
Oh king let dought of daughters crime,
no more dismaye thy mind.
Ne let thy heart to fearful thoughts,
for princes be inclinde:
For this thryse cursed tongue of mine,
shall plainly show to thee:
Who did offend, who gaind this fire,
from which the prince is free.
And though mine own reproach, I must
blase here amidst this press,
Yet gnawing thoughts of gilty mind,
enforce me troth confess.
This Duke (oh king) this Polinesse
this false disceitful Knight
And I unhappiest wretch it was,
that gaynd these flames of right.
For see disceit: whilst in the court,
I led a rechles race,
And whylst amongst the courtly train,
I servde the princes grace.
There came to me this Polinesse,
who with a smyling chere,
And glosing words began long discours^
what friendship he did bear
To me, and how his whole desire
was to obtain my love
Which for to get with tedious suit,
he seeks me long to prove.
But see, as forced watch does make,
the savage Hawk to fist:
As strained bitte the Coult vntamd,
does make apt to the lift:
So did this Dukes continual suit
enforce me to consent:
In hope of lawful marriage,
unto his false intent.
The conquest gaind, he shows him pleased,
and I, in hope of bliss,
Do find my self not discontent,
at thapp^ hap of this.
This past, and I remaining still
within the princess court:
Upon a day Duke Polinesse
thus to me began report.
If that I thought my former words
whereof such perfect force,
As might (quoth he) from wavering mind
all damps of dought d^uor^e:
I would refrain that now I mind
in presence here declare,
And closly in my secret mind,
such passions I would spare.
But deed shall show the sum (quoth he,)
of my well meaning heart,
And eke in words my just intent,
to thee I shall impart.
Thou know (quoth he) what goulden time
in service I have spent:
In hope to gain at last for hyre
the princess like assent.
Thou partli know, my faithful heart
and loyal love to her:
Thou know what diverse ways ^ used
her friendship for to styre.
But only I to well have known
how euel she did requite
My vowed troth, and how my love,
she had in great despite.
Which when with grief I vewd (quoth he)
I sought by reasons skill
To master love, and by advise
to tame affections will.
And thinking that the second nail,
could soon expel the first,
I hardly find this moisture can
assuage my former thrust.
Thus tossed am I with bylowes great
of great unrest (quoth he)
And only find by sage advise,
this only ^uertie.
I think (quoth he) the heavens it will,
that that self same attire
Which she did wear, when first I did
so much her love desire.
Should quite my former thraled heart,
of evil requsted love:
And from thy breast it doughts remayn^
dispairing doughts remove.
Wherefore I will, that with those robes,
that prince in feast does wear^
Hard by the outwast houses thou
Dalinda shall appear
To me where I in scorn of prince
will toss her princely train:
And there refigne the latest fittes,
of my long proved pain.
With small request I granted have
to his so sugared tale:
And to thappointed place also,
to come I did not fail.
Where I in robes of princes grace,
when sleep the prince possessed:
With Iu^ls, tablets, cheins, and ringes,
did yield to his request.
This same was it, and that was I
whom stranger so didisee:
The night when feast in court was held^
whereof princess is free.
But hear oh king the end of all,
judge of this traitrous part,
See how the filed words agreed,
with false disceitfull heart.
When giltles thus Lurcanio had
accused the princess grace
And when for trial of her truth
the time and setted place.
Was known to all, Duke Polinesse
still caught I think with fear
Least that this treason done by us
might any ways appear:
And doughting still my secret mind
he sought the only way
By former pleasant ^ained words,
^o work my last decay.
And feeding then my hungry vain,
with Duches princely state:
He minds to put in practice now,
his long pretensed hate.
And sending me with Ruffians two,
unto a desert wood:
(In steed of present marriage,)
he seeks to shead my blood.
But see, betwixt their dredful blade^
whylst knelyng I did pray,
And whilst for end of my last words
the tormenters did ^^aye:
This Knight, my guide, aryvd vp^n,
the place where I should dye:
who savd my life and forced my fooes,
to leave their arms, and fly.
Thus have you hard oh king (quoth she)
the troth of treason strong^
My gained death, his like desert,
and your sustained wrong.
The sum of all this cruel crime.
disclosed thus to each ^are:
Reuiues their ^ying ^ares that erst
were caught with dreadful fear.
But Polinesse that hears theffe^^
of all this cruel deed
Dis^losed thus, a heap of griefs
which in his head do breed.
Yet as he had a countnance erst
to work his own de^ayr:
So he den^^s all that which now
Dalinda did bewray:
And proferst therv^on to try,
his troth against his foe
In combat fight, and gauntlet he,
unto the ground does throw
As chalenger, which Raynold spies,
and does receive h^s gage,
In mind without a longer stay
the battle for to wage.
And once ^^ayde in every point,
fit for a mortal fight:
They mount on Steeds, and with the spears
ecne seeks his foe to spite.
Duke Polinesse discharged has,
his spe^re that clymes the skies:
But through both breast and back the spea^^
of stout Raynaldo hics.
Which when the Duke perceiues, and feels,
the panges of present death:
And knows his life does fade away
through want of gasping breath:
He yeldes him self as recreant,
and dy^ng does confess,
In circumstance, the treason which
Dalinda did express.
And how inforst through ielous mind
which he did then suspect,
Twixt princess and Ariodant,
he was thert^ direct.
Then how his last devise he used
to move Ariodant:
That only his desired love
the Prince in heart did plant.
Which only sight I know (quoth he)
was cause of strangers death
And with that word his sinful soul
resingde his wicked breath.
Whose carcass was no sooner dead,
and life had lost his force:
But in the mydst of flashing flames,
his wounded senceles corse
Entombed was, with joyful shouts,
that God did save the right,
And with deserved punishment,
he did the guilty quight.
But she, whose fired mind to die,
did loath a longer life:
Augmenteth rather wonted woes
then wants her former strife.
Wherefore she is in mind oftyme^
to taste the force of fire,
For rather that, then loathsome life,
she gladly began require.
^he king whose aged head did erst
taste never such great joy
To see the princess giltles tryde,
does wonted cares distroy.
Who first calls for Ariodant
that fought for Princes grace:
Of whom he fre^dly craves the sight
of his desired face.
Wherefore his head piece laid asid^,
his visage is bewrayde:
And then to pens^ue Princes thus,
he kneelyng briefly said,
How here oh thrice renouned prince
had falsehood brought to end
Thy worthy race, whose spotles ly^e
with saints may well contend?
How nere had tresons force preuaild
how near had vile disceit
Entrald thy noble giltles heart,
with hidden falshods baytes?
But oh how near had my mistrust,
ben cause of thy decay:
whose wretched head to sugared talk^
to greatly did obey?
wherefore not only Polinesse,
ne this Dalind deserve,
A shameful death, but myser I,
whose faithles heart did swerue
So far from duties lore, as gains
an everlasting pain:
And as he would have ferder said,
(through grief) his lips refrayn
From farther talk, and senses fail,
and he does fall to ground:
And there he lies, berevd of breath,
and chokt with fainting sound^.
But when Ieneuora had vewde
long time with persing eye:
The face of her Ariodant:
and plainly eke began spy.
by co^tnance, look, by shape, and speech
the same her friend to be:
who^ greedy stream had forced she feared
to die in misery.
Oh judges that can, what fancies the^
did rule within her mind:
What passing joy, what happy bliss
her crased brain did find.
For neither head, ne tongue, ne hand
can think, can tell, or write:
The least or smalest percell of
her late conceyvde delight.
Not she her self, can ease the toil
of joyful panting heart:
whose striving force extreme delight
to trance does straight convert.
And there as in a quiet sleep,
a while she does remain:
But once reuyvde, her dryry lips,
she thus to speak did strain.
And does the guyder of my life,
the only proppe and stay:
Of this my weary limbs, yet live?
oh happy thryse I say.
Oh blessed fates, and do thou live?
and do these eyes behold:
Thy wished shape, whose comely lim^
these ^rmes so often have ^ould.
And lives in deed Ariodant,
Ieneuoras delight:
And was it he that for his frend^
so manfully did fight?
Oh soppe of joy more pleasant far
then wealth of worldly bliss:
Oh sovereign salve, naught cures so well
the crased heart as this.
Oh welcome thou more dear to me,
then goods, then friends, then life:
A gest more gladder to my heart
then cares carst caused strife.
Thy health does force me wish y^ lif^
which fame of thy decay
Intised late through heavy lot,
to serine in cloddes of clay.
Amidst this tale a thousand times,
they friendly do embrace:
And with their silver tricki^ng drop^
each bathe others face.
She lays her happy head upon
her joyful lovers breast:
And he again his body bendes^
to yield his Lady rest.
Thus now in words, and now in deeds
and now by signs of love:
Each shows, y^ joined faithful hearts
does such affections move.
The sight whereof brings youth again
unto the aged King:
Whose trembling heart, for very ioy^
in blisfull breast does spring.
But when this great felicity,
had vanquished every care:
And when amidst this world of ioy^,
each on receivde his share.
The^ by commandment trompets sound
and oyes loud is cride,
Wherefore the rought give audience,
and then the king thus said:
How far we are indetted to
the heavenly powers divine:
My lords and friends, you have well seen
this day before your eyne.
As both by fatal chance, how this
vile treason was bewrayd:
As how by knightly prowess, which
Ariodant assayde.
Against his native brother, he
has savde Ieneuora:
From fyry flames, and brought us health
that looked for last decay.
And last, how falshod paid is
with death for gaind desert:
A myrror good, for such as live,
infect with traitors heart.
Wherefore as bounden duty biddes,
first let us yield the praise:
To him, that quites the innocent,
and pays the false always.
And we (as reasons lore ^oth charge)
will seek for to requite:
Forthwith received benefittes,
with all our power and might,
For as to thou Ariodant,
for this thy noble heart:
Thy curtesi^, and loyal love,
^e yield thee this as part.
Of recompense, take thou to wi^^
the Prince Ieneuora,
and we, for maintnau^ce of your state^
will soon provide a stay.
Be thou to her a faithful fear,
and she a ^ouing wife:
Bear du^ie to thy Lord and King,
whilst thou have breath and life.
and since by thee sir knight unknown,
this treason came to light:
We will as best shall please thy heart
thy friendship well requite.
Lurcanio ^ke, since brothers death
prouokt thee to this ire:
Shall freely live, and use our grace,
as thou shall best desire.
For pardon of Ieneuora,
small suit I think will serve:
Whose gentil mind from pities lord
as yet did never swerve.
But as t^ thee Dalinda, since
thou soughtst by ^reason vile:
To seek thy mistres death, we will
that thou into exile.
For ever shall be put, and eke
to run a banished race,
Till better hope of truer heart,
shall win thee favors grace.
This sentence said, the tossed caps
do cut the cloudie sky:
and eueri mouth, with strained voic^
God save the King do try.
The lovers two, on ground prostrate
a thousand thanks impart.
Unto their Liege and Sovereign,
with most contented heart.
But to recount what passions past,
betwixt the brothers twain,
would make an other history,
and work my treble pain.
wherefore let this suffice, my Lords,
not one but lives in joy,
Not one there is amidst the prease,
that cares do now annoy.
Amidst which mirth, to court again
the King and all return:
And as they ride, in sign of joy,
each does the streates adorn:
with tynsell bright, with arras rich
and glistring cloth of goulde:
And ladies perch on wyndowes hie
the lovers to behold.
who pass the streates with happy hearts,
and so ariue on court,
where every one seeks to augment,
his late received sport.
And where, upon a solome day,
appointed by the king,
The Princess and Ariodant,
with sacred words and King:
Recey^e the right of marriage,
as glad to them as life:
who long in bliss did spend their daie^
and died deuoydt of strife.
FINIS.
