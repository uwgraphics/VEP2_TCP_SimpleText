royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
WHereas there is lately published in Print our Apology heretofore made for
the Oath of Allegiance, enjoined by Act of Parliament to all our Subjects in
certain cases, with a Premonition in our Name dedicated to all Christian
Princes and States; which Book, by the rashness of the Printer, and error of
the Examiner, is come forth uncorrected of some faults varying from the
Original Copy, and which do nota little pervert the sense: Like as we
disclaim from all the Copies published before the date hereof, as adulterate,
and set out contrary to our express Commandment to the Printer given: So our
will and pleasure is, and we do hereby straightly charge and command all our
Subjects, and all others within our Realm, to whose hands any of the said
Books be come, that they do presently, and without delay, bring in all such
Books as they have, to our Printer; from whom they shall have other Copies
for the same, corrected to the truth. And that hereof they fail not, as they
will answer to the contrary at their peril.

Given at our Palace of Westminster, the seventh day of April, in the seventh
year of our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.

ANNO DOM. 1609.
