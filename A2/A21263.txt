By EDWARD ELTON Preacher of the word of God, in the Parish of St. Mary
Magdalens in Barmondsey nere LONDON.

1. Concerning God. 2. Concerning Man, his creation, fall, and state of
corruption. 3. Concerning man's deliverance by Christ. 4. Concerning the means
of being partakers of Christ and his benefits. 5. Concerning the means of
obtaining faith, and the good things that follow faith. 6. Concerning the
estate of man in death, after death, particular judgment, and the last and
general judgment.

The Preface to the Catechism.
THE chiefest thing a man or woman should desire and seek after, is, how to
live and dye comfortably: and after death, how to remain blessed for ever.

Now this can never be attained, unless a man know God aright, and have a
right knowledge of Jesus Christ, Ioh: 17.3.
whom he has sent.

The way to true comfort and blessedness both in this life and for ever, is, to
know God to be our Father in Christ by the revelation of his spirit, according
to his word. And this knowledge is not in us by nature, and one special means
to attain unto it is instruction in the grounds of Religion.

I will draw that I purpose to deliver in this kind of exercise, to certain
general heads and grounds of Christian Religion, needful to be known and
believed of all Christians, and handle these grounds by way of Qu stion and
Answer, that they may the better be conceived.

Now then, the first ground, and principle of Religion, I purpose to handle,
shall be concerning God, what we are to conceive and believe concerning God.

A Form of Catechizing, set down by Questions and Answers; Wherein the
principal grounds of Christian Religion are delivered.
Question. WHat is God?

A. God is a spirit, or spiritual substance, Joh: 4.24.
most wise, most holy, eternal and infinite.

Q. How are we persuaded that there is such a God?

A. Besides the evidence and testimony of Scripture, by these reasons.

1. By the creating and making of the world and all things in it: and
especially the soul of man. Rom: 1.20.


2. Secondly, Zachar. 12.1.
by the works of Gods providence, and chiefly his fearful punishments, Psalm.
9.16. Psalm. 58.10.1^
on monstrous and notorious sinners in this life.

3. Thirdly, by common consent of all Nations, who rather worship any God or
gods, than none at all.

Obi^ct. Ephesians. 2.12. The Gentiles were without God in the world.

Answ. The meaning is, they were without the true God.

4. Fourthly, by the accusation and terrors of conscience: a man that commits
any sin in secret, his conscience naturally checking him, accusing and
terrifying him for the sin, Romans 2.15. Isai: 33.14.
and as it were drawing him before a judgment seat.

Q. How many Gods be there?

Deuteronomy. 6.4. 1. Tim. 2.5. 1. Cor. 8.6.
A. Only one and no more.

Object. Psalm. 82.1. God stands in the assembly of Gods.

Answ. The word is there taken for Judges and Magistrates, because they stand
in Gods place or room.

Q. How is this one God to be conceived of us?

A. Not by framing any image of him in our minds: Deuteronomy: 4.16.
neither can we conceive him in his glorious nature, but we are to conceive
God, Judge: 13.18. 1. Tim. 6.16.
as he has revealed himself in his word, by his properties and works.

Q. What be the chief properties of God?

A. First, he is most wise, 1. Property of God.
Job 12.13. Romans 16.27.

Q. What is that wisdom of God?

A. It is that by which God does distinctly and perfectly know himself, and
all other things aright: and knows the nature, reason, and causes of all
things.

Q. What is the second property of God?

A. He is most holy, Isai: 6.3.

Q. What is that holiness of God?

A. It is a most absolute and perfect purity of all Gods properties and
attributes: Exodus 20.5.6.
and it appears in that he is most just, and merciful unto his creatures.

Q. What is the third property of God?

A. He is eternal, Isaiah 41.4. Revel. 1.4. And that every way, without
beginning or end of days. Angels and the Souls of men be eternal, but not
every way, though they shall never die, yet had they a beginning, and they are
eternal not absolutely but by participation.

Q. What is the fourth property of God?

A. He is infinite.

Q. How many ways is God infinite?

A. Two ways: First, in presence. Secondly, in power.

Psalm. 139.7. 1. King. 8.27. Jer. 23.24. Deuteronomy. 10.17.
In presence. He being present in all places filling heaven and earth.

In power. He being able to do whatsoever he will. Psalm. 115.3.

Ob. God cannot lie, Tit. 1.2. or deny himself, 2. Tim. 2.13. therefore he
cannot do all things.

Ans. To lie or to deny himself are works of impotency and weakness, and not
of power, and therefore cannot befall God.

For works of impotencie, or things contrary to the nature of God, as to
destroy himself, or not beget his Son from all eternity. Or things that
imply contradiction: as to make a truth false, or that which is not, to be, at
the same time, cannot befall God.

Q. How many ways is Gods power taken or distinguished?

A. Two ways, it is either absolute or actual.

Q. What is his absolute power?

Math. 3.9. Phil. 3.21.
A. That by which he is able to do more then either he does, or will do.

Q. What is his actual power?

Psalm. 135.6.
A. That by which he causes all things to be which he wills, and does
whatsoever he will.

Q. What are the works of God by which we are to conceive him?

A. They are two, creation and preservation.

Q. How are we to conceive of God in respect of creation?

A. Ier. 10.12. Acts 4.24.
That he is the most mighty Creator of the world, and of every thing that has
a being in the world.

Ob. There be many evils and hurtful things in the world, as venomous and
poisonfull beasts, herbs, and such like, yea, evil spirits, the Devil and
his Angels, did God create them?

A. Yes, God did create all these things, Genesis 1.20.25.
but we must understand, that God made not poysonfull creatures so at the
first, but they became so by the fall of man. Hurtful and poysonfull creatures
which now are for the correction and punishment of man for sin, should not
have been so, if man had not fallen.

Again, God made the Devil and evil spirits, at the first very good and
glorious spirits, but they willingly and of their own accord, Jude. 6.
fell from that purity in which they were created, and so their being is from
the will of God, but their being evil is from their own wills.

Q. Did God make sin, sicknesses, diseases and death, or no?

A. No: these be no creatures of God, we find not the making of these in the
first creation of all things. Sin is no Creature of God, but the destruction of
Gods Image, which is a Creature: and sicknesses, diseases, and death came into
the world by sin, and follow sin. And though they come from God as
corrections, Romans 5 12. 1. Sam. 2.6.
exercises or punishments: yet are they no Creatures, as things that have a
being in the world, but rather as destructions of such things as have being.

Q. What is the work of creation?

Gen 1. Heb. 11.3.
A. It is the making of all things in their several kinds, of nothing, by the
mighty power of God in the first six days of the world.

Ob. Man was made of the dust of the earth, Genesis 2.19.
fishes of the water, beasts and fowls of the earth, woman of man: How then
did God make all things of nothing?

A. God made the first matter of all things of nothing, and then of that matter
were all things formed.

Q. What is the second work by which we are to conceive God in our minds?

A. The preservation of all things created by his special providence, we are to
conceive him in our minds, as the most wise and mighty Preserver of all things
created. 1. Pet. 3.19. God is a faithful Creator, he did not only make heaven
and earth and all things in them, and so leave them; but he by his wise
providence and mighty power does preserve and govern the same.

Q. What is that work of preservation of all things?

A. It is the hand and power of God, Psalm. 119 91. Ioh. 5.17.
continually exercised in sustaining and disposing of all things created.

Q. How does God sustain all things created?

A. Heb. 1.3.
He vpholdeth them all in their being by his mighty word.

Q. How does God dispose of all things created?

A. Mat. 10 29.30. Prou. 16.33.
He guides and employeth them to good ends and uses, yea, even the least
things, as the fly, the gnat, and such like: so that nothing comes to pass by
chance, not so much as a little sparrow hoppeth or falls on the ground
without the providence and disposing hand of God.

Q. How know you that God orders and governs all things by his most wise
and mighty power, and by his special providence?

A Besides the evidence of Scripture, Leuit. 26.26.
by experience, we see that meat and drink being void of life, yet preserve
the life of man: Matthew. 4.4.
clothing being void of heat, yet it keeps the body warm, which could not be
but by the special providence of God giving virtue to them.

Q What are we further to conceive and believe concerning God?

A. That in one simple and undivided Godhead, in o^^ divine essence there be
three distinct pers^ns, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost* and that these
three persons are equal in eternity and glory, that they are alike eternal,
none of the three persons being before or after another in time, and that they
are equal in all things that bel^^g to the nature of God.

Q How is the Trinity of persons proved?

A. By these places of Scripture, Mat. 3.16.17. cap. 28. verse. 19. 2. Cor.
13.13. 1: Ioh. 5.7. There be three which bear record in heaven, the Father,
the Word, and the Spirit, and these three are one. In that he says three, he
notes the distinction of the persons: and in saying one, he shows the unity
of the essence, that in one undivided Godhead there be three distinct persons.

Q. What is the Father?

A. Psalm. 2.7. Ioh. 5.26.
In respect of order he is the first person in the Godhead without beginning,
being of himself and from none other, and giving personal being to his Son.

Q. What is the Son?

A. Ioh. 3.16. Ioh. 5.26. Prou. 8.22. to 32. verse.
He is the second person in the Godhead, having personal being from the
Father, of whom he is begotten from all eternity.

Q. What is the Holy Ghost?

A. Ioh. 15.26. Romans 8.9.
He is the third person in the Godhead, having personal being from the Father
and the Son: he proceeding from them both from all eternity. Gal. 4.6.
He is called the spirit of Christ: whence we gather and that truly, that he
proceeds no less from the Son, then from the Father.

Q. Are these three persons three several Gods, as three persons amongst men,
are three several men?

A. No: The three persons are but one God. Because the divine essence is
infinite, and admits no division: and the whole divine essence is in every one
of the persons; which are not severed, but only distinguished one from another.

Q. How are we ^o conceive the three persons in the Godh^ad distinct one from
another?

A. Two ways.



The Father is the person which begets; the Son the person who is begotten of
the Father; and the Holy Ghost the person, who proceeds from the Father and
the Son.



To the Father the beginning of working. Ioh. 5.17.19.


To the Son, wisdom and counsel, and the dispensation of the work, Ioh.
1.3. All things were made by it (that is) the Word, the second person in the
Godhead. Heb. 1.2. By whom also he made the worlds. Hence he is called
Wisdom, Prou. 8.22.

To the Holy Ghost, virtue, Job 26.13. 1. Cor. 12.11.
and power, and efficacy of operation. In a word, God the Father, in the Son,
by the holy Ghost works all things. This doctrine is beyond all reach and
understanding of man, yet to be believed as that which God has revealed in
his word, for our salvation which cannot stand without it.

The second general Principle shall be concerning Man, 2. Principle of Man.
what we are to conceive and believe touching man, and our selves in
particular.
Q. Of all visible Creatures which is the heifest?

A. Man: for in man above all other visible Creatures the Lord sets forth the
glory of his wisdom, Prou. 8.31. Psa. 8.5.6.7.8.
power and goodness.

Q. What was the state and condition of man at the first, in his first
creation.

A. It was an holy and an happy condition, a state of innocence and a state of
life.

Q. Wherein stood that holy condition of man?

A. In that he was free from sin, and created after Gods own image and
likeness. Genesis 1.26.27 Genesis 5.1.


Q. What was that image of GOD in which man was created at the first?

A. It was a conformity of man to God, Coloss. 3.10. Ephesians. 4.24.
even a conformity of all the powers of the soul of man to the will of God,
standing in wisdom and holinesie.

Q. What was the wisdom that was in man at the first?

A. A perfect knowledge of God his Creator, and of his will to be obeyed: and
of his wisdom and will touching the particular Creatures. For Adam named them
according to their natures.

Q. What was that holiness that was in man at the first.

A. It was a conformity of the will and affections and the whole disposition of
man in body and soul, to the will of God his Creator.

Q Wherein stood that happy condition of man in his first creation?

A. In three things.

Adam. Genesis 1.29.


Genesis 1.28.
an example whereof we have in Genesis 2.19. Genesis 2.19.
when all creatures presented themselves before him to receive their names from
him.

Genesis 2.25. Romans 5.12.
there is no question seeing death came in by sin.

Q. What employment had man in his first state?

A. Twofold, particular and outward, to till and dress the garden. Genesis 2.25.
And general and spiritual, Isa. 43.7.
to worship and serve God his Creator: to which he was fitted of God with
freedom of will and ability for perfect obedience, having the moral law
written in his heart by nature.

Q. How does that appear?

A. By two things.

First, by the effect of the law in his heart, for man having sinned, the guilt
of his conscience forced him to hid himself from Gods presence. Genesis 3.8.


Secondly, by the remainders of the Law of God in all mankind, who having not
the Law of God, Romans 2.14.15
are a law unto themselves.

Q. Did man continue in that state in which he was created?

A. No: he left it and fell from righteousness to sin. Genesis 3.6.


Q. How was it that man lost his first state and fell from righteousness to
sin?

A. God suffering Satan to tempt him, and leaving him to the liberty and
mutability of his own will: he fell into sin, eating of the forbidden fruit:
hence Satan is called by Christ, a murderer from the beginning. Genesis 3 1.
etc. Job. 3.44.


Q. How did Satan tempt man?

A. He used the Serpent a subtle beast as his instrument, and spoke out of him,
Genesis 3.1 3.4.5
first to the woman, and after by her to the man, 2. Cor. 11.3.
pretending greater love to them, and greater care of their good then was in
God.

Q. How did man and woman our first parents yield to temptation, being created
good?

A. Genesis 3.6. Eccles. 7.31.
Being left of God to the liberty and mutability of their own will, they
voluntarily inclined to that evil whereunto they were tempted.

Q. What is the state of man, being fallen from his first estate in which he
was created?

A. It is a state of corruption and misery.

Q. What is that state of corruption following the fall of man?

A. It is the loss of the image of God in which man was created at the first,
Genesis 5.3. Ephesians. 4.22. Ioh. 3.6.
and the image of Satan succeeding in the place or room of it, so that man in
that ^tate can do nothing but sin, and this the Scripture calls the image of
Adam. The old man. The flesh. And in a word, it is the state of sin.

Q. What is sin?

A. Sin is any swaruing from the Law of God, 1. Ioh. 3.4. Romans 7 7. Gal. 3.10.
though it be but in the least want of that which the Law requires.

Q. How many sorts of sins be there?

A. Two, original and actual. Sin is either the corruption of nature, or the
evil actions that proceed from thence, as the fruits of it.

Q. What is the corruption of nature?

Romans 7.7. Iam. 1.14.
A. It is that corruption that is derived from our first parents by natural
generation, called lust or concupiscence.

Q. Wherein stands that corruption?

Romans 7 18.
A. In two things.

First, in an utter disability and enmity to that which is good. Romans 8.7.


Romans 7.14.
Secondly, in a proanesse to all manner of evil.

Q. In whom is that corruption of nature found?

A. In all men and women none excepted, discending from Adam by natural
generation. Romans 3.23. Gal. 3.22.


Q. How is it, that all men and women are defiled with the corruption of
nature?

A. Through the infidelity and disobedience of our first Parents in eating the
forbidden fruit, Romans ^.12.18.19.
all men being guilty of that sin.

Q. How are all men guilty of that sin?

A. First, because they were in the loins of our first Parents, Heb. 7.9.10.
from whom they should by course of nature descend.

Secondly, because our first Parents were by Gods appointment, to stand or
fall, not as singular persons only, Romans 5.19. 1. Cor* 15.22.
but also as heads and roots of mankind, and as public persons representing
al mankind. As we see Noblemen and great men by treason do not only hurt
themselves, but strain their blood also.

Q. How then is all mankind in the state of sin since the fall?

A. Thus; every one naturally descending of Adam is guilty of Adams sin, it
being imputed to him, Romans 5.19. Psalm. 51.5. Ephesians. 2.1.
and is also conceived and borne in original corruption, and is by nature dead
in sin, and has in him the seed of all sins.

Is. Is original corruption found in all and every man equally?

A. Yes, it is: for that which is borne by natural generation is nothing but
corruption; Ioh. 3.6.
Original sin is not in some men more, and in some men less, but it is in
every man equally, as all men do equally from Adam participate the nature of
man, Ephesians. 2.3.
and are equally the children of wrath.

Q Does this corruption of nature break forth and show it self equally and
alike in all natural men?

A. No: it does not, though original corruption be found equally and alike in
all men naturally, and all men have in their corrupt nature the seeds of
every sin, yet does God for the good of human society, limit man's
corruption, and restrain many from notorious crimes, Romans 13.3.4.4
by their natural temper, by fear of shame and punishment, desire of honor
and reward; and such like.

Q. In what part of man is this corruption of nature found?

Genesis 6.5. 1 Thessalonians 5.23.
A. In the whole man, both in body and soul, and in every part and member of
the body, and in all the powers and faculties of the soul.

Now there being many powers and faculties of the soul, as the mind,
conscience, will and affections, the next Question is,

What is the natural corruption of the mind of man?

A. It is both the dullness and the blindness of the mind concerning heavenly
things, whereby the mind is altogether ignorant of spiritual things, 1 Cor.
2.14. 2 Cor: 3.5. Ephesians. 4.18.
concerning the true worship of God, and eternal happiness: and is of it
self utterly unable to conceive them.

And it is also the readiness and fitnes of the mind to conceive evil
things, Romans 1.30. Ephesians. 4.17. Isaiah 5.20. and 44.20.
whereby the mind is carried to error and vain imaginations.

Q. What is the natural corruption of the conscience of man?

A. Tit: 1.15.
It is the impurenesse of the conscience.

Q. Wherein stands that impurenesse of the natural conscience of man?

A. In two things: either in want of remorse, in a benummednes and
vnfeelingnesse of the conscience in respect of sin, Ephesians. 4.19.
the conscience being benumbed with sin: or in the stirring of the
conscience, the conscience sensibly either accusing or excusing.

Q. How is the stirring of the conscience impure in the sensible accusation of
it?

A. Two ways: first, in accusing for well-doing, Col: 2.21.22.
as sometimes the natural conscience does; this we may see in superstitious
Idolaters. Secondly, in accusing for sin, Isai. 29.23.
and continually turmoyling and terrifying a man for sin, Isa. 57.20.21.
and giving him no rest, no ease, nor peace at all.

Q. How is the stirring conscience impure in excusing sensibly?

A. Two ways likewise: first in excusing when it should rather accuse, Mar.
10.19.20.
as when a man lives a civil honest life, free from gross sins, as murder,
adultery, and such like, and serves God outwardly, then excusing him and
falsely telling him, that he is just before the judgment Seat of God, and this
excusing conscience is found in most men.

Secondly, excusing for doing that which is evil: Ioh. 16.2.
as when men think they do God good service, in excommunicating and killing
the servants of God: or as the Papists do, for saying over so many Creeds, so
many Ave Mary's, so many Pater nosters, and such like, think they shall be
heard for their vain repetitions and babbling in prayer. Math: 6.7.


Q What is the natural corruption of the will of man?

A. It is both the impotencie of the will, Philip. 2.13. Ioh: 6.44.
whereby the will is utterly unable of it self to will or lust after that
which is truly good. And it is also the repugnancie and rebellion of the will,
whereby it is altogether auerse and striving against that which is truly good,
Gen: 6.^. Job 15.16.
and willing only that which is evil continually.

Q. What is the natural corruption of the affections of man, as of love, joy,
hope, desire, and such like?

A. It is the disorder of them, Iam: 4.1. 1 King: 21.4. and 22.8.
whereby they eschew that which is good, and pursue and follow after that which
is evil.

Q. What is the natural corruption of the parts and members of the body?

A. It is both a fitnes in them, as porters to let sin in, Mat: 5, 28, 29,
30. Isai: 59.7. Ier: 9.3. Rom: 3.13.
and to convey it to the soul from outward objects and occasions; and a fitnes
in them, as instruments to execute sin and to practice it.

Thus we have heard what the corruption of nature is: the next Question is,

What is actual sin?

A. It is a fruit of original corruption, Iam: 1.15. Mat: 15.19.
and it is a particular and actual breach of Gods law.

Q. How is actual sin distinguished?

A. Into inward and outward. It is either in the inward faculties of the soul,
as the mind, or will and affections: or in the outward members of the body.

Q. What is the actual sin of the mind?

Gen: 6.5. Pro: 6.18. Ioh: 13.2. 1 Chro: 21.1. Act: 5.3.
A. It is the evil thought or intent of the mind, which comes either by the
conceiving of the mind it self, or by Satan's suggestion.

Q. What is the actual sin of the will and affections?

A. It is every motion, lust, and desire, Gal: 5.^7.24.
stirring in the heart contrary to Gods law.

Q. What is outward actual sin in the outward members of the body?

A. It is that which is committed by the members of the body, concurring with
the faculties of the soul, 1 Cor: 6.18. 1 Thessalonians. 4.4.
as by hands, eyes, ears, tongue, feet, etc. yea sometimes by the whole body.

Q. How is actual sin effected?

A. Two ways: either by omission or commission: it is effected either by
omitting that which ought to be done, or by committing that evil that is
forbidden and ought not to be done, Isai: 3.8.
whether it be inwardly in mind, will or affection, or outwardly in word or
deed.

Q. What be the differences of sin actually committed?

A. They are many: but especially these.

First, a partaking with others in sin, Mar: 6.^4. Act. 22.20. Rom: 1.31. 1 Timothy: 5.22.
by consent, approbation, counsel, presence, enticement, or the like.

Secondly, a sinning ignorantly, or of a conscience misinformed Psalm: 19.12. 1
Cor. 8.7. 1 Timothy: 1.13.
.

Thirdly, a sinning of knowledge through infirmity Romans 7.19.
.

Fourthly, Psalm: 19.13. Psalm. 50.17.
a sinning presumptuously upon knowledge. Eccles. 8.11.


Fifthly, a sinning upon knowledge obstinately and on set malice against God:
and to this belongs the sin against the Holy Ghost. Heb: 6.6. and 10.28, 29.


Hitherto of the state of corruption following the fall of man: Now follows
the state of misery.

Q. What is the state of misery following the fall of man?

A. It is a continual subjection to the curse of God, Gen: 2.17. Deuteronomy. 27.26.
Galat. 3.10.
whereby man by the just sentence of God, is continually subject and liable to
Gods curse for sin, and that in this life, in the end of this life, and after
this life is ended: and this was signified by expelling our first Parents out
of Paradise after the fall. Genesis 3.13.


Q. Wherein is man for sin subject and liable to the curse of God in this
life?

A. In his body and outward estate, in his soul, and in the whole man.

Q. What is the curse of God due to man, and whereunto he is subject in his
body and outward estate?

Deuteronomy. 28.21.22.
A. It is all manner of outward grief, anguish, vexation, trouble and want, as
sickness, diseases, aches, pains, shame, Mala^: 2.2. Psalm: 69.22.
servitude, penury, and such like; yea blessings and good things cursed to
him, and turned to snares.

Q. What is the curse of God due to man, and whereunto he is subject in his
soul?

A. It is all manner of inward disorder, trouble, grief and want in the
faculties of his soul, Rom: 1.28. Deuteronomy. 28.28. Leuit: 26.36.
as blindness of mind, hardness of heart, horror of conscience, madness,
astonishment of heart, and such like.

Q. What is the curse of God due unto man, and whereunto the whole man is
subject?

A. It is a bondage under Satan, whereby man is subject to the regiment of
Satan, and Satan is his Lord and Master: 2 Cor: 4.4. Ephesians: 2.2. 2 Timothy: 2.26.
hence Satan is called the God of this world; and the Prince that rules in the
air, and the spirit that works in the children of disobedience.

Q. How shall a man know that he is thus in bondage under Satan?

A. If he take delight in the evil motions Satan puts into his heart, and do
yield to them with pleasure, Ioh: 8.44. 1 Ioh: 3.5.
expressing them in his life and conversation.

Q. What is the curse of God whereunto a man is subject in the end of this life?

A. It is the power of corporal death, the death of the body, whereby the
soul is severed from the body. Rom: 5.12. Gen: 2.17.


Q. What is the curse of God due unto man, and whereunto he is subject after
this life is ended?

A. It is eternal death of body and soul in the fire of hell, called the
second death, which is a final separation from the comfortable presence of
God, the Father, Mat: 7.23. Mat: 25.41. 2 Thessalonians. 1.9. Revel. 20.6.
Son, and Holy Ghost, and a sense and feeling of Gods wrath in that
separation.

The third Principle, touching Man's deliverance from that damnable estate.
Q. What means of deliverance is there, 3. Principle.
whereby a man may escape this damnable estate?

A. God of his infinite mercy has given a Savior and Deliverer to mankind.

Q. When was that Savior and deliverer given to Man?

A. He was set apart to that office in Gods decree from everlasting, Heb. 5.5.
Ephesians. 1.4.
from all eternity, but promised and propounded immediately after the fall in
Paradise, Genesis 3.15. Galat. 4.4. 1. Tim: 2.6.
and manifested and exhibited in the fulness of time.

Q. Who is that Savior and deliverer given to man?

A. Jesus Christ. Mat: 1.21. Act. 4.12.

Q. What is Jesus Christ?

A. The eternal Son of God made man like to us in all things, sin only
excepted, and so God and man in one person. Matthew. 1.23. Ioh. 1.14. Rom: 9.5.
Isai: 9.6.

Q. How prove you that Jesus Christ is GOD?

A. Besides the plentiful testimony of Scripture, it is clear by his many
miracles, by his knowing the hearts of men, Rom: 1.4,
and especially by raising of himself from the dead, together with the
continuance of his gospel from time to time, not by carnal means, nor by
humane power or policy, but only by the power of his spirit, Revel. 12.11.
and patient suffering of his Saints.

Q. How prove you that Jesus Christ was very man like to us in all things,
sin only excepted?

A. Besides the testimony of Scripture, it is clear by many experiments,
especially by his partaking of humane infirmities common to man's nature; as to
be hungry, thirsty, weary, sad, sorrowful, angry, ignorant of some things,
and such like, and by his suffering of death.

Q. How could Christ be very man, and yet be without sin?

A. Because he was not begotten after the ordinary course of nature, by
natural generation, but as man he was formed of the only substance of the
Virgin Mary his mother, and that substance was sanctified in the conception,
Luke 1.34.35.
that is, severed from all stain of sin, by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Q. Wherefore was it needful that Christ should be man?

A. For two reasons: First, that he might die and suffer the punishment due to
sin, Heb. 2.14. Philip. 2.7, 8.
which the Godhead could not do.

Secondly, Romans 8.3. 1. Pet. 2.24.
that he might appease Gods wrath in the same nature, wherein God was offended.

Q. Wherefore was it needful that Christ should be God also?

A. For two reasons likewise.

First, that he might uphold his manhood in suffering, and vanquish death.

Secondly, that the doings and sufferings of his manhood might be of infinite
worth and virtue. Heb. 9.14.
hence the Church is said to be purchased by the blood of God. Act: 20.28.


Q. What are we further to know and believe touching Christ his being God and
Man?

A. Two things:

First, the distinction of his two natures. and

Secondly, the union of them.

That his two natures are distinct one from another, and that they are also
united and make but one person.

Q. What are we to know and believe touching the distinction of the two natures
in Christ, his Godhead and his manhood?

A. That there is a real distinction of those two natures, Mat: 26.39. Ioh:
10.17.18 Act: 3.21. 2 Cor: 13.4.
without any mixture of the one with the other, and without any conversion or
turning of the one into the other, and that the essential properties and
actions of both natures remain distinct one from another.

Q. What are we to know and believe touching the union of Christ his two
natures, his Godhead and his manhood?

A. That they are united by personal union, that the Godhead and manhood in
Christ make but one person.

Q. What is that personal union?

A. It is the assuming of the humane nature into the person of the Son of
God, so as the manhood being not a person in it self, is received into unity
of person with the second person in Trinity, Ioh: 1.14. Heb: 2.16.
and does wholly and only subsist in the same: this is a mystery of godliness
so called. 1. Tim: 3.16.

Hitherto of the person of Christ, now come we to the office.

Q. What is the office of Jesus Christ being God and man in one person?

A. It is his Mediatorship to be the only Mediator between God and man, Isai:
42.6. and 49.8. 1 Timothy: 2.5. Heb. 9.15.
to ratify and confirm the covenant of grace, and to make perfect
reconciliation between God and man, being parties infinitely and every way
disagreeing.

Q. How was Jesus Christ fitted for the accomplishment of that office?

A. He was anointed of his Father, and so made fit for the perfect
accomplishment of it: hence he is called (Christ) which signifies anointed,
and this was figured and shadowed out in the annoynting of Prophets, Priests,
and Kings in the time of the old Testament.

Q. Was Christ anointed with visible and material oil as they were?

A. No: Ioh: 3.34. Act: 10.38. Heb. 1.9.
but with the graces and gifts of the Holy Ghost, and that most fully and
without measure.

Q. What be the several functions and offices of Christ as he is Mediator?

A. They are three: namely his Prophetical, Priestly, and Kingly
office.

Christ was anointed of his Father to be the only Prophet, Priest and King of
his Church.

Q. What is the prophetical office of Christ?

A. It is the office of revealing the will of God, Isa: 61.1. Math: 17.5. Ioh:
1.18. Mat: 23.8, 10.
and the means of salvation to his Church in all ages, Christ having been,
now being, and ever shall be the only Teacher of his Church.

Q How did Christ perform this office, and how does he now perform it?

A. Two ways.

First outwardly, by the ministry of his word, Math. 23.37. 1. Pet: 3.19. 2.
Pet. 1.21.
as before his incarnation, by the Prophets and Teachers of the old Testament.

And in the days of his flesh in his own person. Heb. 2.3. 2 Cor. 5.19.20.
Ephesians. 4.11.12.
And since his ascension by his Apostles and Ministers called and fitted by him
to that purpose.

Luke 24.45. Act. 16.14. 1. Cor. 3.6, 7.
Secondly, inwardly, by the operation and teaching of his Holy Spirit.

Q. What is the priestly office of Christ?

A. It is that whereby Christ has and does reconcile God to his elect, Heb
5.9. Heb. 7.24, 25.
he performing all those things to God, for them, whereby they may come to
eternal life.

Q. Wherein stands the performance of the offiice of Christ his Priesthood?

A. In doing three things for Gods chosen.

Q. What is the first of those?

A. It is the fulfilling of the law of God, 1 Cor. 1.30.
and performing perfect righteousness for them.

Q. Wherein stood that perfect righteousness of Christ?

A. In two things.



1 Pet. 2.22, 28 Romans 8.3, 4.
he doing all that the law required of him for Gods chosen.

Q. What is the second thing?

A. Ioh: 1.29. 1 Cor. 5.7. Heb. 9.14.26.
It is the offering of himself unto God his Father a sacrifice holy and
without spot, thereby appeasing his wrath for all their sins.

Q. How was Christ offered in sacrifice?

A. As he was man consisting of body and soul? Isa: 53 10. Heb. 10.10.


Q. How often did Christ sacrifice himself?

A. Only once and no more. Heb. 9.28. Heb. 10.12.14.

Q. What manner of death did Christ suffer, when he sacrificed himself?

A. A death on the Cross, an accursed death, Luk: 22 44 Ioh: 12.27. Gal. 3.13.
whereby his soul was not only severed from his body, but he felt also the
extreme horror and most bitter pangs of hell in his soul.

Q. What is the third thing?

A. It is Christ his entering into heaven and there appearing before his Father,
Romans 8 34. 1. Ioh. 2.1.
continually making intercession for all the faithful.

Q. After what manner does Christ make intercession in heaven for the
faithful?

A. Not by prostrating himself and uttering words to his Father, by putting up
a prayer or supplication to his Father: but by presenting himself and the
sacrifice of himself once offered upon the Cross, and the infinite and
invaluable merit of that sacrifice before the eyes of his Father, Heb. 9.24.
Ioh: 17.24.
willing as he is God and man, and desiring as he is man that his Father would
accept of his perfect satisfaction: for all that are given unto him.

Q. What is the fruit and benefit of Christ his intercession?

A. It is this: it keeps every true believer in the state of grace, and in the
favor of God continually, and it makes their weak prayers, and imperfect
Obedience acceptable and pleasing to God by a special and continual
application of the merit of his death and obedience to them. 1. Ioh. 2.2. 1.
Pet. 2.5. 1. Ioh. 2.2. 1. Pet. 2.5.


Q. What is the Kingly office of Christ?

A. It is that, whereby Christ exercises the power given him of his Father
over all things, distributing his gifts, Psa. 130.1.2.3 Ier. 23.5.6. Matthew.
28.18.
and disposing of all things for the good of Gods chosen.

Q. Wherein stands the performance of Christ his Kingly office?

A. In two things.

First, in the spiritual government of his Church.

Secondly, in the destruction of his and their enemies.

Q. Wherein stands the spiritual government of his Church?

A. Partly in collecting and gathering his Church and the members of it, Ephesians.
4.12. Coloss. 1.13.
out of the world, and from under the tyranny of the Devil, Isa. 9.7. Ioh.
10.28. Jude epist. 1. verse.
Sin and Death. And partly, in keeping it, being collected and gathered in
the way unto life everlasting.

Q. What be the Laws of Christ his spiritual government by which he gouernes
his Church and the members of it?

A. They are two.

First, his word, namely, the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, Mark.
1.14. Isa. 53.1. Romans 3.27.
written in the old and new Testament.

Ierem. 31.33. 1. Cor. 4.20.
Secondly, the power and operation of his spirit in the hearts of his servants.

Q. How does Christ destroy the enemies of his Church?

Luke 14.27. Psalm. 110.1.
A. By bringing confusion on them in his own good time.

Q. When does Christ confound his enemies?

A. Partly in this world, Psalm. 2.9. Psalm. 110.5. Psalm. 2.9. and 110.5.


1. Cor. 15.25. 2 Thessalonians. 2.8.
But most fully in the end of this world in the day of judgment.

Hitherto of the means of deliverance God has vouchsafed to man from his
miserable condition. Now to the fourth Principle, 4. Principle.
concerning the use and application of those means. Namely; What we are to
know and believe concerning our participation of Christ and his benefits, and
how we are made partakers of them.
Q. How is Christ and his benefits auailable to us?

A. By being made ours. For as other men's riches avail nothing to help us
being in debt unless they become ours: so Christ and his benefits, unless
they become ours, profit us nothing though he be abundantly rich.

Q. How may Christ and his benefits be made ours?

A. If we be mad one with Christ, by the benefit of our union with Christ, Ioh.
6.53.56. Philip. 3 9.
we are made partakers of Christ and of all his benefits.

Q. How are we united to Christ and made one with him?

A. As many as are united to Christ, are incorporated and made members of that
mystical body whereof Christ is the head, Ephesians. 4.15.16. and cap. 5.30.
which the Scriptures set forth under the similitude of marriage.

Q. What manner of union is it whereby we are made one with Christ?

A. It is a mystical union, our incorporation into Christ and union with him
is a great mystery. Ephesians 5.32.


Q. How are we to conceive of that our mystical union with Christ.

A. Thus: That our mystical union with him is a most near and real union. 1.
Cor. 12.12.
That our whole person body and soul are united to the body and soul of
Christ; Ephesians. 5.30. 1. Cor. 6.15.
so that we are members of his body and of his flesh and bones. And by his
flesh we are also joined to his Godhead, to his divine nature; For that
whereby we have fellowship with God, ioynes us to God. Heb. 10.20.
Now by the flesh of Christ we have our fellowship with God.

Therefore the flesh of Christ does join us to God.

Q. What kind of union is it whereby we are joined to Christ?

A. It is not a corporal union by touching, mixture, or the like, 1. Cor. 6.17.
but a spiritual union, 1. Cor. 6.17.

Q. What are the means by which we are united to Christ spiritually?

A. They are two.

First, the Spirit of Christ, 1. Cor. 12.13. 1. Ioh. 3.24. and cap 4.13.
one and the same Spirit being both in Christ and in us. First in Christ and
then in us.

Secondly, faith, Ioh, 1.12.
for faith also knits us to Christ, and by faith we receive Christ and his
benefits offered unto us.

Q. What is faith?

A. Faith is a special gift and grace of God bestowed on his chosen and wroght
in their hearts, Ephesians. 2.8. Coloss. 2.12. Tit. 1.1. Ioh. 1.12. Romans 5.17. Gal.
3.27.
by the power of his Spirit, whereby they do apprehend and apply Christ and
all his benefits to themselves particularly.

Q. How does a man apply Christ to himself seeing Christ is now in heaven and
he here on earth?

A. The applying of Christ is by an inward persuasion of the heart, Psalm. 35.3.
a man being verily and particularly persuaded by the effectual persuasion of
Gods Spirit, that his sins are forgiven, Romans 8.16. 1. Cor. 2.12.
and that God is his gracious and merciful Father in Jesus Christ.

Q. How shall a man know that he is so persuaded by the persuasion of the
Spirit of God?

A. By these two notes especially.

First, if he find in himself a love to God because of Gods love to him, and
that he loves God, because God has loved him first. 1. Ioh. 4.19.


Secondly if he find himself inwardly rebuked for every known sin, and that
he gives himself no liberty to continue in any known sin. Ioh. 16.8.


Q. How are Gods chosen brought truly to believe in Christ?

A. God does first prepare their hearts, that they may be fit to receive faith;
and then he works faith in them.

Q. How does God make their hearts fit to receive faith?

A. By mollifying, softning, and bruising of their hearts. Ezech. 11.19. Hos.
6.1.


Q. How is the heart of man mollified and softened?

A. By being humbled and cast down.

Q. How does God humble and cast down the heart.

A. By working in man a knowledge and sight of his sins both original and
actual and a true sorrow for them.

Q. How comes a man to have a knowledge and sight of his sins?

A. By the moral law of God, Romans 3.20. and Romans 7.7.

Q. What is the moral law of God.

A. It is that law that was first written in the heart of Adam in the time of
his innocence, and since that; in tables of stone in the days of Moses, Exodus
34.28. Deuteronomy. 4.13. and chap. 10.4.
and so published and committed to the Church for all ages, commonly called the
decalogue or ten commandments.

Q. Where find we the moral Law of God published and set down?

A. The sum of it (namely) the ten Commandments we find written Exo. 20
from the 3. verse at the beginning of it, to the end of the 17. verse, but
expounded in many places of Scripture. For so often as the Prophets and
Apostles entreat of virtues and vices, they be the true Interpreters of the
Law, and Christ himself expounds some of the Commanmandements, Matthew. 5.21.22.

You see now I am come to the Commandments, but I purpose not to stand on them
at large; hereafter God willing I will entreat more at large on them, only now
I will show in general what sins a man may find in himself by the ten
Commandments in order.

Q. What be the sins in general that a man may find in himself by the
first Commandment?

A. First, his denial of God, his thinking there is no God at all, Psalm.
14.1. Psalm. 14.1.
Psalm. 10 4. Psalm. 10.4.


Isa. 51.12.13. Philip. 3.19. Ephesians. 5.5. Coloss. 3.5. Ier. 17.5.
which indeed is not God, setting his affection on it, fearing it, loving it,
putting his trust and confidence in it.

Q. What be the sins in general that a man may find in himself by the
second Commandment?

Ezekiel. 8.10.12 16.
A. First, his worshipping of a false God. Romans 1.23. 2. King. 16.10 Coloss.
2.23.


Secondly, his worshipping of the true God after a false manner.

Q. What be the sins in general that a man may find in himself by the
third Commandment?

A. Mal. 1.6.12. Math. 4.6. 1. C^^* ^0.31.
Even all those wrongs and indignities that are offered by him to the name and
glory of God by abusing his titles, word and works.

Q. What be the sins in general that a man may find in himself by the
fourth Commandment?

A. His profaning of the Sabbath any way, Isa. 58.13. Nehe: 13.15.
as by doing any thing on that day that ought not to be done: whether it be a
work of his calling, or a work of the flesh.

Or by leaving undone the works of the Sabbath, which ought to be done.

Q. What be the sins in general that a man may find in himself by the
fifth Commandment?

A. His thinking, speaking, Pro: 30.11. Jude. verse. 8. Rom: ^.30.
or doing of any thing against the dignity God has bestowed on others in
respect of age, place, or gifts.

Q. What be the sins in general that a man may find in himself by the
sixth Commandment?

A. His thinking, willing, speaking or doing any thing that may tend to the
hurt or hinderance, Gen: 9.5, 6.
either of his own life or the life of another.

Q. What be the sins in general that a man may find in himself by the 7.
Commandment?

A. His thinking, willing, speaking or doing any thing, 2 Cor: 7.1. 1 These.
4.3, 4.
to the hurt or hinderance either of his own chastity or the chastity of
another.

Q. What be the sins in general that a man may find in himself by the
eight Commandment?

^ His hurting or hindering by any v^^^ ^^full way, 1 Timothy: 5.8. 2 Pet: 2 14. 1 Thessalonians. 4 6.
the wealth or outward g^^^ ^^tate either of himself or of another.

Q. What be the sins in general that a man may find in himself by the
ninth Commandment?

A. His hurting or hindering of the good name either of himself or of another,
Math: 7.1. Phil: 4.8. 1. Cor: 13.^.
by any untrue and unjust opinion or report.

Q. What be the sins in general that a man may find in himself by the
tenth Commandment?

A. All his evil lusts both original and actual, Ier: 4.14. Math: 15.19.
Iam: 1.14.
even all those evil thoughts and motions that are stirring in his heart
contrary to charity and the love of others, though he give no liking nor
consent to them. Ier. 4.14. Math: 15.19. Iam: 1.14.

Q. How is a man brought to a true sorrow for his sins?

A. By the fearful and terrible curse of the law of God.

Q. What is the curse of the law?

A. Both temporal judgment and eternal damnation denounced for the least
disobedience and breach but of one commandment of God, Deuteronomy: 27.26. Gal: 3.10.
2 Cor: 3.7.
though it be but once in all a man's life, and that (...) one thought, without
offering any hope of pardon.

Q. What is true sorrow for sin?

A. A true touch of conscience, or compunction of heart, Luk: 15.21. Ezra 9.6,
7.
with a lively feeling of Gods displeasure for sin, in such sort, as a man,
utterly despaires of salvation in regard of any thing in himself, Dan: 9.7, 8.
Act: 2.37.
and acknowledges that he has deserved everlasting confusion.

Q. When a man is thus brought to a sight of his sins, and a true sorrow for
them, and so made fit to receive faith, how does God work faith in him?

A. By working certain inward motions in his heart as the seeds of faith, out
of which faith breeds.

Q. What is the first of those motions?

A. When a man being humbled, and cast down upon the sight of his sins, and
with true sorrow for them, does feel and acknowledge that he stands in great
need of Christ and Gods mercy in Christ. Luk: 1.5^. Luk: 1.53.
Math: 11.28. Math. 11.28.
Luke 15.7. Luke 15.7.


Q. What is the second of those motions?

A. An hungring desire of that grace that is offered in Christ, Math: 5.6. Ioh.
7 37. Revel. 21.6.
and a longing to be made partaker of it, as a man hungers and thirsts after
meat and drink.

Q. Wha^ is the ^h^^d of those motions?

Gal. 3.24. Heb. 4.16.
A. A slying from the sentence and terror of the Law and an approaching to the
throne of grace.

Q How does a man being humbled and sorrowing for his sin, approach to the
throne of grace?

A. Two ways: first, by an humble confession of his sins before God, Psalm:
32.5. 2 Samuel 12.13. Luke 15.18.
particularly, if they be known, and generally, if they be unknown.

Secondly, by craving pardon of his sins with unspeakable sighs and groans,
Hosea 14.2, 3. Romans 8.26. Psalm: 51.1.
and sending up loud cries to heaven for Gods mercy in Christ, never ceasing
so to do till the desire of his heart be granted.

Q. What follows after these motions?

A. After these motions, God according to his own gracious promise, imprints
in the heart of a poor sinner, Isai. 65.24. Job 33.26. Matthew: 7.7. 1 Timothy
1.15.16.
by the work of his holy spirit, a special and particular persuasion of his
love toward him in Christ, and that his sins are forgiven him for Christ his
sake, and this special and particular perfwasion is a true and a lively faith.

Q. Is every true believer, in like measure and degree persuaded of Gods love
toward him in Christ, and of the pardon of his sins?

A. No: Romans 1.17. Luke 17.5.
there be different degrees and measures of faith.

Q. What is the smallest measure of true faith?

A. It is a persuasion in the heart of one truly humbled for his sins, that his
sins are pardonable, and therefore desires the pardon of them, Mat. 8.26.
and with his heart even with sighs prays to God, for the pardon of them,
and this is called little faith or weak faith, which is like smoking flax,
Isai: 42 3. Mat: 17.20.
and like a grain of mustard seed.

Q. What is the greatest measure of true faith?

A. It is a full persuasion of the heart, whereby a Christian makes full
account that God loves him in Christ particularly, Rom: 4.20.21 etc. 8.38.39.
and will bestow on him in particular Christ and all his graces that pertain
to eternal life.

Q. When comes a Christian to this full persuasion?

Psalm: 23.1, 2, 3, 4, 6 2 Timothy: 4 7, 8.
A. Not at the first, but after the sense, observation, and long experience of
Gods love toward him in Christ.

Q. How may a man know that his faith is true and unfeigned?

A. By the fruits of it which are good works. Galat: 5.6. 1. Tim: 1.5. Iam:
2.18.

Q. What are the benefits that a true believer receives by his faith in Christ?

A. Perfect reconciliation with God, Rom: 3.25. 1. Cor: 1.^0. Act. 15.9.
justification in the sight of God, and sanctification.

Q. What is it to be justified before GOD?

A It is to be accounted just in the sight of God through the obedience of
Christ. Rom: 5.19. and cap. 10.4. 2 Cor: 5.21.


Q. Wherein stands our justification in the sight of God?

A. In two things:

First, in the remission of our sins.

And secondly, in having Christ's righteousness imputed to us.

Q. What is the remission of our sins?

A. It is our discharge and freedom from the guiltiness and punishment due to
our sins by the merits of Christ his death and sufferings. Col. 1.21, 22 1
Pet. 2.14. 1 Ioh: 1.7.


Q. What is it to have Christ his righteousness imputed to us?

A. It is to be accepted before the judgment seat of God, Philip, 3.8, ^ Romans
4. man^ verses. 2 Cor: 5.21.
and to be accounted worthy of eternal life, by the merits of Christ his
righteousness.

Q. Do not the good works of true believers make them worthy of eternal
life?

A. No: they do not.

Q. Why so?

A. Because they are not perfectly good, Psalm. 143.2. Isai. 64.6. Gal: 5.17.
but stained with sin, and imperfect through that corruption of nature, that
remains in true believers.

Q. To what use then serve good works?

A. They serve to these three purposes.

Mat: 5.16. 1. Pet. 2.12.
First, to glorify God.

1. Pet. 1.10.
Secondly, to make our calling and election sure to our selves. and

1. Cor. 10.23, 24.
Thirdly, to the profit and good of our brethren.

Q. What follows on justification in the sight of God?

A. Adoption is ever annexed to it, which is a power and privilege to be
actually accounted the children of God, Ephesians. 1.5. Ioh 1.12. Galat. 4.5.
by Christ.

Q. What is it to be sanctified?

Tit 3.5. 2 Cor. 3.18. Ephesians. 4.24.
A. It is to be inwardly changed, and renewed in nature according to the image
of God, in righteousness and true holiness.

Q. How is sanctification wrought?

A. By the power and virtue of Christ his death and resurrection, Romans 6 4.5.
Coloss. 2.12.13.
being made effectual to such as are justified by the divine power and working
of the holy Ghost, he thereby creating holiness in their hearts.

Q. Wherein stands the work of sanctification?

A. In two things. In mortification or dying to sin, and in vivification or
quickening to newness of life.

Q. What is mortification or dying to sin.

A. It is a part of sanctification, whereby the power, tyranny and strength of
natural corruption is weakened, Rom 6.6. 1. Pet. 4.1.
and by little and little abolished by virtue of Christ his death.

Q. What is vivification or quickening to newness of life?

A. It is another part of sanctification, Ephesians 2.1. 1 Cor. 15.45. Philip. 3.10.
whereby inherent holiness, being begun, is still increased more and more by
the virtue of Christ his resurrection.

Q. In what part of man justified is sanctification wrought?

A. In every power and faculty of his soul, 1 Thessalonians. 5.23.
and in every part and member of his body.

Q. Is sanctification wrought in all true believers equally and at all times
alike?

A. No: it is wrought in true believers differently and by degrees, and it is
wrought in them in this life, only in part, and shall not be perfected in them,
Rom 8.23. 1. Cor. 13.9. 2. Pet 3.18.
before the end of this life.

Q. What is the effect or exercise of sanctification?

A. It is repentance. For no man can or will truly repent, except he be
justified and endued with true faith. Though repentance do first show it self
in such as be truly converted, yet in the order of nature it follows faith
and sanctification.

Q. What is Repentance?

A. It is a turning from sin to God, or a through change of the purpose of the
heart and course of life from evil to good. Isai. 1.16.17. Ezech: 33.11. Acts
26.20.


Q. Whence coms this through change?

2. Cor 7.9.10.
A. From a godly sorrow, or a sorrow according to God.

Q. What is a godly sorrow?

A. It is a sorrow for sin, whereby a man is grieved for no other cause, but
only for this, that by his sins, he has displeased God, who has been to
him a gracious and merciful Father. Thus it was with Psalm: 51.14.
David, and thus it was with Mat. 26.75.
Peter, and thus it was with the Luke 7.44. compared with 47,
Woman.

Q. What be the things that follow Repentance?

A. These two: First, a continual striving against sin, a resisting of all
motions and temptations to sin, Heb. 12.4. Ephesians. 4.27. Iam 4.7. 1 Pet. 5.9.
whether coming from our own corruption, or from the suggestion of Satan, or
from the enticements of the world, even to blood if need require.

Secondly, Matthew: 3.8. 1 Pet: 3 10.11
a bringing forth of new fruits, worthy amendment of life.

Q. How shall a man know that his repentance is true and unfeigned?

A. By the generality of it in these two respects: First, Psalm. 119, ^ verse:
128. Psalm. 139.24.
if it extend to the abhorring and shunning of all known sins. Secondly, if it
reach to the practice of all good duties that concern him according to his
measure of grace and strength given him. Palm: 119.6.128.


Q. When is Repentance to be practiced?

A. The practice of it ought to be continual, even to day before to morrow,
and continually. Heb. 3 7.13. 1 Pet 4.2.
Yet at sometimes there ought to be more special practice, and renewing of it;
Psalm. 51.1 etc.
as after great and grievous sins committed: In fear of some judgment
hanging over our heads for our sins. Amos 4 12.
Or when we would fit our selves for receiving of special mercies. Genesis
35.1.2.3 etc.
Thus it was with Jacob.

Q. What are the signs of renewed repentance after great falls?

A. They are seven, set down 2. Cor. 7.11.

First, a care to leave sin into which a man has fallen.

Secondly, a clearing of our selves, that is, an utter condemning of our selves
for the same, and a craving pardon for that sin.

Thirdly, an holy anger and indignation against our selves for our carelessness
in falling into sin.

Fourthly, a fear, lest we fall into it again.

Fifthly, a desire ever after to please God.

Sixthly, a zeal to that purpose, seconding our desire to walk with God, and
to fear and please him.

Seventhly, punishment and an holy revenge upon our selves, for that sin.

The fifth Principle. Touching the ordinary and usual outward means of
obtaining faith, and all good things that come by faith, and of the increasing
of it.
Q. What outward means must we use for the obtaining of faith, and all good
things that do follow faith?

A. The hearing of the word of God preached. Prou. 29.18. Romans 10.14.


Q. What is the word of God?

A. It is the will of God revealed needful to be known to salvation, set forth
in the holy Scriptures, and written in the books of the old and new Testament.

A. Are all things needful for us to know to salvation, contained in the holy
Scripture?

A. Yes: For God being full of wisdom and goodness, 2 Timothy 3 15.16.17.
has in them set down whatsoever is requisite for us to know to salvation.

Q. How do we know that the Scriptures are the word of God and the will of God
revealed?

A. By many infallible notes, as by the purity, the perfection, the antiquity,
the majesty of them in plainnes of speech, and the consent of one part of
Scripture with another, but especially by these two notes.

First, by the evidence of the Spirit imprinted in the Scripture, Ephesians: 1.13.
and persuading us that they are the very word of God.

Secondly, by the power of them over the conscience, and the wonderful effect
of them being truly preached, we see in ^^perience they do humble men, and
throw them down as low as hell, Heb. 4.12 1 Cor:14.24.25.
and then raise them up again.

Q. What need is there of hearing the word preached, seeing we may read it?

A. Deuteronomy: 18.17. Rom: 1.16.
For two reasons.

First, because it is the ordinance of God, and his power to salvation.

Secondly, we have need to have the word not only propounded in gross, but
also expounded, Romans 10.14. Act 8.30 31, 2. Tim. 2.15.
rightly divided and applied by the ministry of it, by such as are called to
that office.

Q. What is the use of the word of God preached?

A. In respect of Gods chosen it serves.

1. To breed faith in their hearts: Romans 10 14.17. Romans 1.17.
and

2. Then to increase it.

In respect of the reprobate it serves through their own corruption, 2. Cor.
2.16.
as an occasion of their further damnation.

Q. How must the word of God preached be heard, that it may be effectual to
salvation?

A. First, with an hungry heart, 1 Pet. 2.2. Iam: 1.19.
desiring it as the food of our souls.

Secondly, with attention. Acts 16.14.


Thirdly, mixing it with faith.

Fourthly, Heb: 4.2.
submitting our selves to it in fear and trembling, Isai. 66.2.
even when we are justly reproved.

Fifthly, hiding it in our hearts, Psalm. 119.11. Luke 11.28.
that we may frame our lives and conuersations by it.

Of the Sacraments in general.
Q. What other outward means must be used for the increasing and confirming of
faith?

Romans 4.11. Rom: 9.14.
A. The receiving of the Sacraments, and prayer.



Q. What is a Sacrament?

A. It is an holy ordinance of God, which he has appointed to be used in his
Church, adjoined to the preaching of the word, Genesis 17.11. 1 Cor: 11.12. etc.
whereby Christ and his benefits are by such outward rites as he has
prescribed, signified, exhibited, and sealed to them, Galat: 3.1. Rom: 4.11.
that truly believe in Christ.

Q. What things are to be considered in a Sacrament?

A. These two things.

First, the parts of it.

Secondly, the agreement and proportion of those parts,

Q. What be the parts of a Sacrament?

A. These two; The signs appointed to be used: and the things whereof they are
signs.

Q. How are those signs that are to be used in a Sacrament distinguished?

A. Thus: They are either representing signs, as the outward elements that are
to be used in a Sacrament: Or applying signs, as the actions that are to be
used about those elements in the administration and receiving of the Sacraments.

These we shall see when we come to handle the Sacraments severally.

Q. How many Sacraments be there?

A. Two and no more (namely) Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.

Q. Why be there only these two Sacraments and no more?

A. First, because Christ the maker and Mediator of the new covenant, ordained
these and no more as seals of that covenant.

And secondly, because we can have no more inward grace applied to us, 1 Cor:
10.1, 2, 3. and cap. 12.13.
than Christ and his saving graces which are fully represented and sealed up
unto us in these two Sacraments.

Q. What difference is there between Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord?

A. Besides the difference in the signs and sacramental rites; there is this
difference between them.

Baptism is a Sacrament of new birth of entrance into covenant with God, Tit:
3.5. Genesis 17.11. Romans 6.3. Mat: 28.19.
of incorporation and ingrafting into Christ, and of admission into the Church
of God, and therefore we are once only baptized.

But the Supper of the Lord, is a Sacrament of confirmation of faith, of
renewing Gods covenant with us, 2 Chronicles: 30.6.8. 1 Cor: 10.2, 3, 4. 1 Cor:
11.24, 25.26.
and of ours with God, and of further nourishing of our souls to eternal
life, and therefore we are often partakers of it.

Of the Sacrament of Baptism. Come we to the Sacraments severally, and first
of Baptism.
Q. What is Baptism?

A. It is a Sacrament of the new Testament, wherein by the Ministers once
washing with water in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, is
represented and sealed to the right Receiver the powerful washing of the blood
of Christ and of the Spirit of Christ, Math: 28.19. Ephesians. 5.26. Ioh: 3.5.
Galat: 3.27. 1. Cor: 6.11.
and so his engrafting into Christ, his new birth and his entrance into the
covenant of grace.

Q. What be the parts of this Sacrament?

A. The signs appointed to be used in it, both representing and applying, and
the things whereof they are signs.

Q. What representing signs be there in this Sacrament?

A. Only one (namely) the outward element of water, Ioh: 1.31. Act: 8.30.38.
Ephesians. 5.26.
set a part by the word of God and prayer to an holy use.

Q. What be the things signified by water in Baptism?

A. The blood of Christ and the spirit of Christ. Ephesians. 5.25, 26, 1. Cor. 6.11.


Q. How stands the proportion between the water in baptism, and the blood of
Christ and the spirit of Christ?

A. Thus: as material water serves to wash away the filthiness of the body,
1. Ioh. 1.7. Ezech. 36.25.
so the blood of Christ, that is, the force of his death, and the spirit of
Christ, serve to cleanse the soul of a right Receiver of Baptism from the
filthiness of sin.

Q. What be the applying signs in the Sacrament of Baptism?

A. They are the action of the Minister, and the action of the party baptized.

Q. What is the action of the Minister?

A. It is the action of washing, by dipping or sprinkling the body of the party
baptized, Ephesians. 5.26. Act. 8.36. Math. 28.19.
with the element of water, in the name of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost.

Q. What are the things signified by the Ministers washing, by dipping, or
sprinkling of the body with the element of water?

A. These two.

First, a sprinkling of the soul of the party baptized with the blood of
Christ, Act. 22.16.
to the washing away of the guilt of all his sins.

And secondly, a clensing of his soul by the Spirit of Christ, Tit: 3.5. Rom:
6.3, 4, 5.
from the filthiness of sin, which is his spiritual regeneration or new birth.

Q. How stands the proportion between the outward washing by dipping, or
sprinkling with water, and these spiritual things?

A. Thus: as washing by dipping or sprinkling with water, does indeed cleanse
the body, and take away the filthiness of the body, To: 3.24, 25. Rom: 5.9. 1.
Cor. 6.11.
so the blood of Christ (that is) the merit of his death applied and received,
and the spirit of Christ being powerful in the party baptized, do indeed
cleanse the soul both from the guilt and from the filthiness of sin.

Q. What is the action of the party baptized?

A. It is twofold.

Q. What is the first?

A. It is the offering and the giving of his body to be washed with the water
of baptism, by the hand of the Minister. Act. 8.36.


Q. What is signified by that offering and giving his body to be washed with
the water of baptism, by the hand of the Minister?

A. The consecrating and giving of himself to the Lord, promising to believe
all his promises, and to obey all his commandments, and utterly to renounce
the flesh, 1. Pet: 3.21.
the world, and the devil, 1. Pet: 3.21. there called the stipulation or
interrogation of a good conscience.

Q. What is the second action of the party baptized?

A. It is the receiving of the outward washing by water, as appears likewise
in the Eunuch. Act. 8.38. Act. 8.38.


Q. What signifies that receiving of the outward washing by the water?

A. A receiving of the inward washing by the blood of Christ, Mark. 16.16. Act.
8.37. and cap. 10.43. and 48. compared.
and by the spirit of Christ, the party baptized believing in Christ and
repenting of his sins.

Q. Does the inward washing always accompany the outward washing?

A. No: though God for his part do ever offer it at the present to all, Ezech:
24.13. 1 Cor 10.2.5. 1 Pet. 1.2. Gal. 3.27.
yet only Gods elect do effectually partake of that inward washing, and that
whenever by the spirit and by faith they are united to Christ.

Q. How far forth does Baptism being effectual to Gods chosen, cleanse them
for sin?

A. It cleanses them from the guiltines of all their sins, 1. Cor: 6.9, 10, 11.
both original and actual, 1. Ioh. 1.7. Isa: 1.18.
and as well committed after baptism as before.

Q. What necessity is there of being partaker of the sacrament of Baptism?

A. There is not an absolute and simple necessity of it to salvation; for want
of baptism when it cannot be had does not condemn, but the contempt of it
when it may be had, yet that is a pardonable sin: but there is a necessity
of baptism in part, and that in two respects.

First, in respect of Gods commandment who has enjoined us to use it.

And secondly, in regard of our weakness, who have need of all helps that may
strengthen our faith.

Q. Who are to be admitted to the Sacrament of Baptism?

A. All such as be in the covenant in likelihood, or in the judgment of
charity.

Q. Who be those?

A. Either persons of riper years that join themselves to the true Church of
God, Act. 2.38. and cap: 8.37.
and make profession of the true faith of Christ.

Or infants borne of Christian Parents, for infants of believing Parents are in
the covenant of grace Genesis 17.7.
according to the promise of God, Act. 2.39. 1. Cor: 7.14.
and the promise belongs to all believing Parents.

Of the Lords Supper. Now to the other Sacrament, (namely) the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper.
Q. What is the Lords Supper?

A. It is also a Sacrament of the new Testament, wherein by the Ministers
blessing and delivering of bread and wine according to the institution of
Christ, Math. 26.26, 27, 28. Luke 22 19, 22 1. Cor: 11.23, 24, 25, 26.
is signified, exhibited and sealed to the right Receiver, the nourishment of
the soul to eternal life, by the body and blood of Jesus Christ crucified,
and so his further growth in Christ and his further confirmation in the
covenant of grace. 1. Cor. 12.13.


Q. What be the parts of this Sacrament?

A. The signs appointed to be used in it both representing and applying, and
the things whereof they are signs.

Q. What be the representing signs in this Sacrament?

A. They are two, (namely) bread and wine blessed and set apart, by the
recital of the promises of God and prayers used to that purpose, Mat. 26.26.27
1 Cor. 11.26.
from their common uses to an holy use in the Sacrament, as appears in the
institution.

Q. What be the things signified by bread and wine in the Sacrament of the
Lords supper?

A. The body of Christ and blood of Christ. 1 Cor. 10.16.


Q. How stands the proportion between the bread and wine in the Sacrament of
the Lords Supper and the body and blood of Christ?

A. Thus: as bread and wine serve by Gods blessing on them to preserve the
natural life, Psalm. 104.15.
and to strengthen the body of man: So the body and blood of Christ (that is)
Ioh. 6.54.55. verse. 48.
the merit of his death and benefit of his passion serve to nourish and
strengthen both the body and soul of the right receiver of this Sacrament to
eternal life. And for this cause Christ calls himself the bread of life.

Q. Why be th^re two representing signs in the Sacrament of the Lords supper?

A. For two reasons.

First, that we might know that in Christ we have whole and perfect spiritual
nourishment, and whatsoever is requisite to salvation. Ioh. 6.35.54.55.


Secondly, for a more lively representation of Christ his death and passion,
Ioh. 19.34.
in which his blood was separated from his body.

Q. What be the applying signs in the Sacrament of the Supper?

A. The action of the Minister and the action of the Receivers of the Sacrament.

Q. What is the action of the Minister?

A. It is twofold.

Q. What is the first?

Matthew. 26.26. Mark 14 22. Acts 2 42. and 20 7.
A. The breaking of the bread and the pouring out of the wine.

Q. What signifies the breaking of the bread and the pouring out the wine in
the Sacrament of the Lords supper?

A. The breaking of the body of Christ and the shedding of his blood, that is,
1. Cor. 11.24. Mark. 14.24.
his enduring of infinite torments in his passion, both in his body and soul
for Gods chosen.

Q. How stands the proportion between the breaking of the bread and the
pouring out of the wine in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and the breaking
of the body of Christ, and the shedding of his blood?

A. Thus: as the bread is broken and the wine powered out, that they may be
received to the refreshing and nourishing of the body.

So Christ his body was broken and his blood shed on the cross (that is) he
suffered infinite torments on the cross, Isa. 53.5.
that he might be received by true believers to the comfort and nourishing of
their souls to life eternal.

Q What is the second action of the Minister?

A. It is the giving of the bread broken and the wine powered out, into the
hands of the Receivers, Mat. 26.26.27. Mark. 14.22.23. Luke 22.19.20.

Q. What is signified by the Ministers giving of the bread broken and the wine
powered out into the hands of the Receivers?

A. Thus much: that God does offer Christ his body and blood to all, yea, to
hypocrites, and gives his body and blood, indeed, to the right Receivers of
the sacrament to nourish their souls to eternal life.

Ioh. 6.32.50.51.
For together with the signs God does truly offer the thing signified.

Q. How stands the proportion between the Ministers giving of the bread broaken
and the wine powered out, into the hands of the receivers, and the action of
God, his offering of the body and blood of Christ to all, and giving of Christ
his body and blood to the right Receivers?

A. Thus: as the Minister gives the bread and wine to every Communicant
severally, so God does offer every one severally, Ioh. 6 32. 1. Cor. 10.16.
and does give to every right Receiver particularly the body and blood of
Christ, that is, the merit of his death and the benefits of his passion.

Q. What is the action of the Receiver of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper?

A. It is twofold.

Q. What is the first?

A. It is the taking and receiving of the bread and wine in to his hand.

Q. What signifies the taking and receiving of the bread and wine into his
hand?

A. A spiritual apprehending and receiving of the body and blood of Christ,
Ioh. 1.12. cap. 6.35.
(that is) the merit of his death by the hand of faith.

Q. What is the second action of the Receiver?

A. It is the eating of the bread, and drinking of the wine to the nourishment
of the body.

Q. What signifies the eating of the bread and drinking of the wine in the
Sacrament?

A. A spiritual feeding on the body and blood of Christ, that is, Ioh. 6.56.
1. Cor. 10.16. Ephesians. 3 17. 1. Ioh. 5.10.12.
an applying of the merit of his death by faith to the comfort and nourishment
of the soul to eternal life.

Q. Is our feeding on the body and blood of Christ in the Sacrament, only
spiritual and not corporal?

A. Yes verily; though Christ his body and blood be truly given and received in
the Sacrament, yet they are not given and received corporally, Ioh. 6.63.
but spiritually and sacramentally.

Q. How may it appear that Christ his body and blood are not corporally given
and taken in the Sacrament?

A. By these reasons.

First, we receive the body and blood of Christ in the Sacrament as the
Disciples of Christ did in the first institution of it.

And the body and blood of Christ were not corporally received by them, but
only spiritually.

Secondly, Christ his body is ascended and taken up into heaven, and the
heavens must contain him till the end of the world. Acts 3.11.


Thirdly, Christ has but one body, and that a true body, Heb. 2.14. Matthew.
28.6.7 Luke 24.^9. Ioh. 20.27.
and such as cannot be in many places at once, and it fills a place
wheresoever it is, and may be both seen and felt etc.

Thus far touching the substance of the Sacrament: Now concerning the Persons
who are or may be partakers thereof.
Q. Who are to be partakers of the Sacrament of the Lords supper?

A. All that have been baptized, and are of years and sound judgment, Ezod.
12.26.27. 1 Cor. 11.27.28.29.
and able to examine and prepare themselves, that they may come unto it
worthily.

Q. How ought every Christian when he comes to the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper to examine and prepare himself, that he may come unto it worthily?

A. He ought to search and try himself, whether he have in him those things
that are required in every worthy Receiver.

Q. What are those?

A. They are six in number.

Q. What is the first?

A. Deuteronomy. 16.15. Psalm. 110.3. Romans 12.11:
The first is an holy desire of the Sacrament and a cheerful coming to it.

For in all the duties of Gods worship cheerfulness is required.

Q. What is the second?

A. The second is a measure of sound knowledge, Prou. 19.2. 1. Cor. 11.29.
touching the things and actions in and about the Sacrament and the use of them.

For without knowledge the heart cannot be rightly affected.

Q. What is the third?

A. The third is a true and a lively faith in Jesus Christ crucified.

For in the Sacrament Christ is represented to us in no other estate, Matthew.
26.26.27.28.
then that he was in when he was on the cross, as appears in the first
institution.

Q. What is the fourth?

A. The fourth is true and unfeigned repentance.

For the heart or life, being defiled with any known sin, Tit. 1.15.
not repented of, it polluteth and defiles all the holy things of God to that
party.

Q. What is the fifth?

A. An unfeigned and a godly purpose of amendment of life. Psalm. 85 8. Psalm.
119.106.


Q. What is the sixth.

A. A love to God for his mercy, appearing in the great work of our
redemption, and a love to all that bear the image of God, and especially to
such as are renewed according to the image of God in holiness and
righteousness, 1. Cor. 10 16.17. Ioh: 13.34, 35
and are the members of Jesus Christ crucified.

For in this Sacrament we make open profession of our union with Christ and
with his Church.

Q. How ought every Christian to behave himself in the receiving of the
Sacrament?

A. With reverence and seemly gesture of his body, with diligent attention to
that which is done during the time of the whole action. Psalm: 5.7. 1. Cor.
14.40. Act. 1.14. cap. 2.46.
and

With a serious consideration of the things and actions used in the Sacrament.
And a thankful remembrance of the death of Christ. 1. Cor. 11.26.


Q How ought every Christian to behave himself after the receiving of the
Sacrament?

A. Ioh. 6.57. Ioh 15.5.
He must endeavor unfeignedly to find and feel the fruit of it in himself
(namely) an increase of faith in Christ, and of his love to all Gods children.
Gal. 2.20.
A greater measure of dying to sin, and a greater care to live in newness of
life. For none touch Christ with a true faith, Mat. 5.28.30.
but they receive virtue from him.

Of Prayer. Hitherto of the Sacraments. Now to the other means of increasing
and confirming of faith (namely) PRAYER.
Q. What is prayer?

A. Prayer is an humble, hearty and holy request made according to God in will,
Philip. 4.6: Dan. 9.8.9 1 Samuel 1.15. Psalm. 42.4. 1 Ioh. 5.14. Ioh. 14.14. 1 Timothy 2.1.2.
and offered up by faith to God in the name of Christ, for things needful
either for body or soul.

Q. What necessity is there of using prayer?

A. Prayer is necessary in four respects especially.

Q. What is the first of those?

Psalm. 50.15. Matthew. 7.7. 1 Thessalonians. 5.15.
A. The first is because God has commanded it.

Q. What is the second respect?

A. The second is for the supply of our wants. For every one wants many
things, both spiritual and temporal, and where should we seek for supply of
our wants, but at the hands of God, the fountain of all goodness, Iam. 1.17.
the author and giver of all good things.

Q. What is the third?

A. For the exercise of our faith, Matt. 6.41. watch and pray, that is, be
vigilant and careful in the practice of this duty, that ye may be stronger in
faith, and enabled to resist the force of sin.

Q. What is the fourth?

A. That we may enjoy the Lords promise of help, deliverance, protection, 1
King. ^.25. Matthew. 7.7. Luke 7.13.
and spiritual graces, and good things.

Q. To whom must we direct our prayers?

A. To God alone; even to one God in Trinity and none other, and that for these
reasons.

First, he, Genesis 17.1. Psalm. 115.3. Ephesians 3.20. Philip. 1.4.6.
to whom prayer belongs must be able and willing to give us whatsoever we pray
for, but God only is so.

Secondly, in him to whom we pray there must be knowledge of our hearts.

Because prayer sometimes is (suspirium cordis) but a sigh or secret lifting up
of the heart. Exodus 14.15. 1 Samuel 1.13.


Acts 1.14. Romans 8.27.
But the Lord is the only searcher of the heart.

Romans 10.14.
Thirdly, prayer must go no further then faith.

But we must believe only in God.

Therefore to God only must we pray.

Q. In whose name must we pray?

Ioh. 16 24.
A. In the name and mediation of Christ only, and that for these reasons.

Heb* 4.15.16.
First, we are commanded in the word of God to pray to God in the name of Christ
only.

Ioh. 14.13.14. 2 Cor. 1.20.
Secondly, in the name of Christ only we have promise to be heard.

1 Ioh. 2.1.2. Romans 8.34 1. Tim. 2.5.
Thirdly, Christ is the only Mediator between God and man, both of redemption
and intercession.

Fourthly, in Christ alone, we are made the children of God, Gal. 4.4.5.
and have liberty to call him Father.

Q. What is it to pray in the name of Christ?

A. It is to beseech God to hear our prayers, not for any thing in us, or any
other, but only for the merits of Christ Jesus continually offered to him for
us. Dan. 9.18. Heb. 10.19. etc. Dan. 9.18. Heb. 10.19. etc.


Q. In what manner must we pray?

A. For the right forming and framing of prayer three things are required.

Q. What is the first of those?

A. The first, is knowledge add understanding; we must know what things may
lawfully be asked, and how God will have them asked: we may not ask things
simply promised, with condition, 1. Ioh. 5.14. 1. Cor. 14.15.
as spiritual things appertaining to eternal life and salvation. Nor
temporal things, which are promised with condition, may we pray for absolutely
or without condition.

Q. What is the second?

A. Psalm. 143.6. Mark. 11.24. Romans 10.1.
The second is an earnest desire of grace for the supply of our wants.

Q. What is the third?

A. The third is assurance to be heard, Mark. 11.24. 1. Ioh. 5.14.15 Iam. 1.6.
Psalm. 55.22.
submitting our selves to the will of God, for the time, and for the manner of
granting our requests.

Q. Whereupon is our assurance to be heard, grounded?

A. On two things:

First, on the promise of God, Psalm. 50.15. Psalm. 65.2. and

Secondly, on the mediation of Christ. Ioh. 16 23. Heb. 4.15.16.

Q. What things must we pray for?

A. Only for those things, which concern the glory of God and our good in this
life, and our everlasting salvation in the life to come, all which things are
comprehended in that form of prayer which Christ has given us, namely, Our
Father which art in heaven, etc. set down Matt. 6. from verse. 9. to the 14.
Luke 11.2.3.4.

Q. What are the things there prescribed to be prayed for?

A. These six.

First, that Gods name may be glorified.

Secondly, that he may rule and reign in us by his word and spirit.

Thirdly, that we may both do and suffer what he wills, with willingness
and cheerfulness.

Fourthly, that he would give us all things needful for this life, and that
we may depend and rely upon his good providence, for all the means of this
temporal life.

Fifthly, that for his infinite mercies sake, he would forgive us all our
sins, and receive us graciously into his favor.

Sixthly, that he would be present, with us, with the power of his grace, and
strengthen us against all temptations unto evil.

Q. For whom must we pray?

A. For our selves and for others, Psa. 50.15. Iam. 5.16.

A. May we pray for all other men?

Q. For all mankind or all men, as they make one whole body together, we may
not pray but for others yet living in the world, of all sorts, places and
conditions whatsoever, 1 Timothy 2.1. 1 Ioh. 5.16.
we may pray unless it be apparent that any one has sinned against the Holy
Ghost.

Of gesture in Prayer.
Q. What gesture of body must be used in praying?

A. Such as does best express and show forth the inward reverence, humility,
earnest desire and affiance of the heart, Matthew. 26.39. Luk 22.41. Ephesians. 3 14.
1. King. 8.54. Lam. 3.41. Ioh. 17.1. 1 Samuel 1.10. 2 King 20, 3.
as casting down the body, bowing of the knees, lifting up of the hands and
eyes to heaven, shedding of fears and such like.

Q. Are these gestures always necessary in praying?

A. No: they are not absolutely and always necessary, Luke 18.13. Psalm. 6 6.
2 Samuel 7.18. Psalm. 143.8. 1. Cor. 14.40.
so that the heart be lifted up to God, and nothing be done against good
order, and unbeseeming the company with whom we pray, or superstitiously.

Q. In what place must we pray?

A. Prayer may be made in every place, it is not tied now to any one place, more
then to another in regard of holiness; but only in respect of order, 1. Tim.
2.8. Mal. 1.11. Ioh. 4.20.11. Acts 21.5.
as the public place of meeting for the worship of God, best fitteth common
prayers, and a private place best fitteth private prayer.

Q. When must we pray?

A. Continually and at all times. 1 Thessalonians 5.17. Ephesians. 6.18. Luke 18.1.

Q. How must we pray continually?

A. Thus: either by set and solemn prayer, Psalm. 35.17. and 92.2.
and that upon set and solemn occasions, as at the beginning of the works of
our callings, Coloss. 3.17. 1. Tim 4 4 5.
at the receiving of the creatures of God, as meat, drink and such like, or at
our going to rest, or upon a sudden by a secret lifting up of our hears to God,
Nehem. 2.4.
according to the present occasion.

Q. Must set and solemn prayer be used only at set times, and upon ordinary
occasions?

A. No: it must sometimes be used extraordinarily, and we must sometimes set
apart more then ordinary time, and give our selves wholly to solemn prayer,
Psalm. 119 ^2. 164. Hosea 14.3. 1 Cor. 7.5.
as when we either fear some great affliction, or heavy judgment to come upon
us: or when it is already come on us; or when we would obtain some needful
grace either for body or soul.

Q. What help must we use to make us pray more earnestly on extraordinary
occasion?

A. The exercise of fasting, 1. Cor. 7.5.

Q. What is fasting?

A. It is an abstaining from all suffenance of the body, Joel 26. Ezra 8.21.
Hester 4.16. Neh. 1.4.
and from all the delights of the sense for a time, that thereby we may be fit,
thoroughly to humble our selves, and more earnestly to seek the face and favor
of God.

Now to the sixth Principle. Touching the estate of man after he has led a
short life here in this world.
Q. After a man has lived here in this world for a time what follows?

A. Death.

Q. What is death?

A. It is the enemy of nature, or the end of natural life, 1 Cor. 15.26.
even a separation of the soul from the body.

Q. Must all men die?

A. Yes verily, all, both good and bad, both the godly and true believers,
Psalm. 49.19. Psalm. 89.48. Eccies. 2.16. Heb. 9.27. 1 Cor. 15.51.
and the wicked and unbelievers must die, save only such, as shall be found
alive at Christ his coming to judgment, to them a change shall be in steed of
death.

Q Death being a punishment of sin, how is it that the godly and true
believers die, to whom all sins are forgiven?

A. Death to the godly and true believers is not a punishment of sin, but
through the death of Christ, a good thing and a blessing of God, and that in
three respects.

Act. 7.60. 1 Cor. 15.18. 1 Thessalonians. 4.13.14. Revel. 14.13.
and hence it is called a sleep.

Romans 6.7.
and the accomplishment of their mortification.

Eccles. 12.7. Luke 16.22. and cap. 23.43. Philip. 1.23. 2. Cor. 5.1.


Q. What follows immediately on the death of every man?

A. Two things.

First, particular judgment, namely, Heb. 9.27.
the sentence of particular absolution, or of particular condemnation.

Secondly, the conueyance of the soul immediately by the power of God and the
ministry of Angels, Luke 16 22.23
into a state either of happiness or misery.

Q. What shall follow after particular judgment?

A. A day of general judgment, at the second coming of Christ, wherein all
men that ever have been, Eccles. 12.14. Mat: 12.36. Act: 17.31. 2 Cor: 5.10.
are now, or shall be hereafter, shall be judged, and every one shall receive
according to his works.

Q. When shall the day of general judgment be?

A. The time of it is uncertain, no man can know or set down the day, Mat:
24.36. Mar: 13.32. Act. 1.7.
week, month, year or age wherein it shall be: Christ himself as man in the
days of his flesh had no express notice of it.

Q. Why is the time of that day of general judgment uncertain?

1 Thessalonians. 5. to the end of the 6. verse.
A. That from the uncertainty and suddenness of it, we might learn to be
always prepared and ready for it.

Signs foreshewing the last judgment.
Q. What signs be there foreshewing the last and general judgment?

A. The signs foreshewing it are of two sorts.

Some going before and further off from the coming of Christ to judgment, and
some nearer to his coming and joined with it.

Q. What are the signs foregoing and further off from Christ his coming to
judgment?

A. They are these.

First, Mat: 24.14.
the publishing of the Gospel throughout the whole world.

Secondly, 2 Thessalonians. 2.3. 1 Timothy: 4.1.
an apostacy and departure of most men from the faith and from the truth of
Religion.

Thirdly, 2 Thessalonians. 2.^, 4, 8. 1. Ioh. 2.18.
the revealing of Antichrist the man of sin and child of perdition.

Fourthly, Mat: 24.12, 37, 38, 39. Luke 17.26, to the 30. etc 2 Timothy 3.1. 1 Thessalonians. 5.3.
common corruption in the manners of men, with security and exceeding deadnes
of heart.

Fifthly, great and grievous calamities in the world and in the Church. Matthew:
24.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 24.

Sixthly, Rom: 11.25.
the calling of the Jews to the faith of the Gospel.

Q. What are the signs nearer to the coming of Christ to judgment and joined
with it?

A. The shaking of the powers of heaven, the darkning of the Sun and Moon,
Mat: 24.29, 30.
the falling of the stars from heaven, 2 Pet: 3 7, 10, 11.
the firing of the whole frame of heaven and earth, and the dissolution of the
whole world, which is called the sign of the Son of man.

Q. What shall follow after these things?

Math: 24.30. Act 10.42.
A. The coming of Jesus Christ, who shall be Judge of the whole world.

Q. In what manner shall Christ come to judgment?

A. He shall in his humane visible body suddenly like lightning break forth
through the heavens, Act: 1.11. Mat. 24.27.30 2 Thessalonians. 1 7. 1 Thessalonians: 4.16. Jude
verse: 14 Mat: 25.31.
and come in the clouds, with great majesty and glory, with an infinite host
of elect Angels, and with the voice and shout of an Archangell, and the
trumpet of God, and shall sit down on the glorious throne of judgment.

Q. What shall follow after that Christ is set in his throne of judgment?

A. The citing and presenting of all men both quick and dead, Mat. 25.32. Jude
verse. 6.
and the devils also before his glorious throne to judgment.

Q. How shall all men be cited to judgment?

A. By the voice of Christ uttered by the ministry of Angels, Ioh: 5.25, 28,
29. Mat. 24.31. 1 Cor: 15.52. Job 19.16.27
even by that shout and trumpet of the Archangell, which shall be so powerful,
as that it shall change the living in the twinkling of an eye, and cause all
the dead to rise again, every one with his own body and every part and
parcel thereof.

Q. Shall the elect and reprobate be raised from the dead without any
difference?

A. No: though they shall both be raised by the same almighty voice and power
of Christ, Ioh: 6.54. 1 Cor. 15.20, 22, 45.
yet it shall be with this difference: The elect shall be raised as members of
Christ his body, by virtue of his resurrection.

But the reprobate shall be raised by the power of Christ, as he is a Judge,
and by virtue of Gods curse set down Gen: 2.17. that that sentence may be
verified on them.

Q. Shall the dead rise again in the same bodies wherein they lived on the
earth?

A. Yes verily, in the same bodies for substance, but altered in quality, 2
Cor: 5.10. 1 Cor: 15.52, 53.
and made immortal and incorruptible, and able to abide for ever in that
state, whereto they shall be adjudged.

Q. What difference shall there be between the bodies of the elect and of the
reprobate being raised from the dead?

A. This difference.

The bodies of the Elect shall be glorious, 1. Cor. 15.43, (...) 44, 49.
Philip: 5.21.
powerful, free from all passion and suffering, and like unto the glorious
body of Christ.

But the bodies of the reprobate, shall be on the contrary, full of
uncomeliness and ugly to look on, Dan: 12.2. Ioh. 5.29.
agreeable to the guiltiness of their consciences, and liable to suffer
extreme torments.

Q. How shall all men be presented before Christ his throne of judgment?

Luke 21.28. 1 Thessalonians. 4.17.
A. The elect shall with great joy be caught up into the air to meet the Lord.

And the reprobate, with the devil and his Angels, Luk: 21.26. Revel: 6.15,
16, 17.
shall with extreme horror and confusion, be forced to come before him.

Q. What need is there, that the dead should be brought to judgment, seeing
particular judgment was given of them before, whether they be good or evil?

A. It is needful for two causes.

First, because that first judgment pertaines only to the soul, 2. Cor. 5.10.
but the latter to the whole man, both to body and soul.

Secondly, that that particular judgment may be made manifest before all men,
and that there may be a more manifest declaration of Gods just judgment. Romans
2.5.


Q. What shall follow after that all men and evil Angels are cited and set
before the throne of Christ?

A. A separation of the elect from the reprobate. Mat. 25.32.33
Christ shall then set the elect as sheep on his right hand, and the reprobate
as goats on his left hand.

Q. What shall follow, after that separation?

A. The act of judgment wherein the elect shall be first acquitted, Matthew.
25.54. Luke 22.30. 1. Cor. 6.2.3.
and then by way of approbation shall join with Christ in judging of the
reprobate both men and Angels.

Q. How shall Christ proceed in the act of judgment?

A. Thus: He shall first examine and try every man's particular cause, and after
trial and examination made, give sentence.

Q. How shall every man's particular cause be tried?

A. By his works. 1 Cor. 3.13. 2 Cor. 5.10.

Q. Why shall men be tried at the day of judgment by their works?

A. Because works are open and manifest signs and testimonies either of
faith, Matthew. 12.36.37. Iam. 2.18.
or of unbelief.

Q. How shall men's works be then made manifest?

A. Thus: the Lord who certainly knows all the thoughts, words, and works of
men, shall then by his mighty power so enlighten the conscience of every one,
Revel. 20.12. Romans 2.16.
as it shall perfectly remember whatsoever good or evil he or she has done
in the time of this life, 1 Cor 4 5.
the secrets of all hearts being then revealed, and this is called the opening
of the book of conscience.

Q. How shall men's works being made manifest, be tried whether they be good or
evil?

A. Two ways.

Q. What is the first of those ways?

A. The first is this, they shall be tried by the law of God, which has been
revealed to men, whether it be the law of nature only, Romans 2.12.
which serves to leave them without excuse, Romans 2 16. Ioh. 12.41.
who never heard of Christ; Or the written word of GOD vouchsafed to his Church
as the rule of faith and life.

Q. What is the second of those ways? Romans 2, 15.


A. The evidence of every man's conscience bearing witness with him or against
him.

Q. After trial and examination of every man's cause how shall Christ give
sentence?

A. He shall according to the evidence of conscience touching works give
sentence of salvation to the elect, and sentence of damnation to the reprobate,
Matthew. 25.34.41.
adiudging them with the devil and his angels to the curse of everlasting
fire.

Q. Shall men be adjudged to salvation or damnation for the merit of their
works?

A. Sentence of damnation shall be given on the reprobate, they being out of
Christ for the merit of their works.

Romans 6.23.
Because their works are perfectly evil and deserve damnation.

But on the elect sentence of salvation shall be given for the merit of Christ,
apprehended and applied to themselves by faith. Job. 5.24. Iam. 2.18. Gal 5.6.
Ioh. 3.26.
And they shall be pronounced just.

Because their good works though imperfect do approve their faith to be a
true faith working by love.

Q After Christ has given judgment on the elect and reprobate, what shall
follow?

A. The execution of judgment.

Q. How shall judgment be executed on the elect and on the reprobate?

A. Thus: Christ by his Almighty power and commanding voice, shall send the
reprobate with the Devil and his Angels into hell, and bring Gods Elect into
the possession of life and glory in heaven. Matthew. 10.28. Matthew. 25.46.
After Christ has said, Come ye blessed children of my Father, inherit the
kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world: and depart from me
ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels: Then
it follows, and these shall go away into everlasting punishment; but the
righteous into life eternal.

Q. In what state shall Gods Elect be in heaven?

A. They shall enjoy unspeakable; inconceivable and everlasting blessedness
in the kingdom of heaven. 1. Cor. 2.9.


Q. How are we to conceive of that blessedness, as the word of God has made it
known unto us?

A. Thus: that it shall be a most happy and a most blessed state, Matthew. 5.8.
Ioh. 3.2. 1. Cor. 15.28. Revel. 21.3.23.24. and cap. 22.1.2.3.4 5.
wherein the elect being most fully joined to Christ their head shall enjoy the
presence of God, and shall see and behold the face and glory of God, and have
special fellowship with God, and God himself shall be to them through Christ
all in all.

Q. What be the parts of that bessednesse?

A. These two: eternal life, and perfect glory.

Q. How are we to conceive of that life eternal?

A. Thus: It shall be such a fellowship with God, as that God himself shall be
through Christ, Ioh. 14.19.20 23. Coloss. 3.3.4. 1 Ioh. 4.15.
life to all the Elect immediately quickening them by his spirit, and that for
ever.

Q. What shall be the condition of that life eternal?

A. The condition of it shall be in two things.

Q. What is the first of those?

Isa. 25.8. 1. Cor. 5.54. Reu. 7.16.17. and cap. 21.4.
A. This: it shall be free from all manner of miseries, and all manner of
infirmities.

Q. What is the second?

A. It shall have a full and perpetual sufficiency in it self of all good
things, Psalm. 36.9. Revel. 21.23. Revel. 22.5.
serving to make a most blessed life needing none of the means of this life.

Q. How are we to conceive of that perfect glory in heaven?

A. Thus: It shall be a wonderful and unspeakable excellency of the Elect,
whereby they shall be even as Christ himself, Luke 20.36. Philip. 3.21.
Coloss. 3.4 1. Ioh 3.2. Revel. 21.11.
although unequally and in a lower degree, yet above measure glorious, and in
their souls and bodies in a far more excellent estate, then any heart can
wish.

Q. What shall be the glory of the souls of Gods Elect in heaven?

A. This: 1. Cor. 13.12. Ephesians. 5.27. Revel. 3.45. Revel. 19.8.
they shall be endued with a perfection of knowledge, wisdom and holiness.

Q. What shall be the glory of the bodies of Gods elect in heaven?

A. This: Matthew. 13.43. Luke 20.36. Philip. 3.21.
they shall be endued with perfection of beauty, brightness, majesty and
strength.

Q. What shall be the glory of Gods Elect in heaven belonging both to their
bodies and souls?

A, This: they shall be as Princes crowned with crowns of glory, 2. Tim. 4.8.
Revel 22.5. Matthew. 35.34. Romans 16.20. 1. Pet. 1.4. 2. Pet. 3.13.
and reigning with Christ for ever, and triumphing over Satan, death and hell,
and have possession of that new heaven and new earth, wherein dwells
righteousness.

Q. Shall all Gods Elect have the same degree of glory in heaven?

A. No: Dan. 12.3. 1. Cor. 15.21.22.
though every one of Gods chosen shall receive the full measure of glory,
whereof they shall be capable, yet one shall have a greater degree of glory
then another.

Q. How shall a greater degree of glory be given in heaven, to one of Gods
Elect then to another?

A. According to the greater measure of graces given and the more faithful
employment of those graces, Mat. 19.28.29 ^. Cor. 9.6. and cap. 4.17. Reu.
7.14.15.
either in doing good, or in suffering for the truth of Christ, in the time of
this life.

Q What shall be the fruits of both the parts of blessedness, namely, of the
eternal life and perfect glory?

A. The fruit shall be twofold.

Q. What is the first?

Psalm. 16.11. and 36.8. Ioh. 16.20.22
A. Fullness of unspeakable and everlasting joy.

Q. What is the second?

Reu. 7.15.
A. The perfect and perpetual service of God.

Q. Wherein shall that perfect and perpetual service of God consist?

A. In a continual acknowledging of Gods unspeakable mercy toward them in
Christ, Reu. 4.10.11. Reu. 5.12.13. Reu. 11.16.17
and in a continual lauding and praising of his great and holy name.

Q. After what manner shall Gods elect serve and worship God in heaven?

A. By God himself immediately, needing neither Temple, Ceremony, Sacrament,
Reu. 21.22.
nor any outward thing.

Of the misery of the Reprobate in hell.
Q. What shall be the state of the Reprobate in hell?

A They shall have unspeakable, Mat. 23 41 46
inconceivable, and everlasting misery in the fire of hell.

For as neither eye has seen, ear has heard, heart has conceived, or tongue
is able to express the joys of the Elect in heaven:

So certainly, neither eye has seen, ear has heard, or tongue is able to
express the misery of the damned in hell fire.

Q. How does the Scripture set forth that misery to us?

A. By things terrible and fearful and to be abhorred, Dan. 12:2. Mar.
9.43.44. Matthew 25.41. Reu. 19.20. and cap. 20.15. Mat. 8.12. and Mat. 13.42.
as by shame and everlasting contempt, by the worm that never dies, by the
lake burning with fire and brimstone, by fire that never goes out, by utter
darkness, by weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth and the like.

Q. How are we to conceive of that misery of the Reprobate in hell?

A. Thus, that it shall be a most miserable and a most wretched estate, wherein
the Reprobate being for ever severed from the comfortable presence of God and
glorious fellowship of Christ and his Saints, Matthew. 7.23. Luke 13.27.28 Matthew.
25.41. 2 Thessalonians 1.9.
and having eternal fellowship with the Devil and his Angels, shall feel the
whole wrath of God upon them.

Q. What be the parts of that misery of the Reprobate in hell?

A. These two (namely) eternal death and everlasting shame.

Q. How are we to conceive of that death eternal?

A. Thus: that it shall be such a separation of the Reprobate from God, Reu.
2.11. Reu. 21.8. 2 Thessalonians. 1.9.
as that their misery shall be as a continual death: wherein they shall be
always dying, and never dead, and this is called the second death and eternal
perdition.

Q. What shall be the condition of that death eternal?

A. The condition of it shall be two sold.

Q. What is the first condition of it?

A. This: it shall be void of all good things, and of all manner of comfort,
Matthew. 22.13. 2. Pet. 2.17. Iud: verse. 13.
and this is shadowed out by utter darkness, and by blackness of darkness.

Q. What is the second condition of it?

A. This: Isa. 30.33. Matthew. 13.42. Luke 16.23.24 etc.
it shall have a perpetual fullness of all evils and all manner of miseries
without the least means of ease or remedy.

Q. How are we to concciue of that everlasting shame in hell?

A. Thus: it shall be a wonderful unspeakable vileness of the Reprobate,
Isai. 66.24. Dan. 12.2. Revel. 22 25.
whereby they shall be even as the Devil himself above measure odious and
abominable, and in their souls and bodies in a more base and vile condition
then any man's heart can conceive; they shall be as dogs.

Q. Shall all the Reprobate have the same degree of wretchedness and misery in
hell?

A. No: although every one of them, shall have the full measure of misery, Mat.
10.25. and 11.22.24.
whereof they shall be capable, yet one shall have a greater degree of misery
then another.

Q. How shall some of the Reprobate have a greater degree of misery then
others in hell?

A. According to the greater merit of their sins, Luke 12.47.4^ Matthew. 23.14.
either in respect of the number or quality of them.

Q. What shall be the fruit of both the parts of that misery of the Reprobate
in hell, namely, of eternal death and everlasting shame?

A. The fruit shall be twofold.

Q What is the first?

Matthew. 25.46. Luke 16.23.14 Rom 2.9. Mar. 9.43.44.
A. Fulness of unspeakable and everlasting torment both of their souls and
bodies. Iud. verse. 6. Reu. 20.10.

Q. What is the second?

A. A continual and a most horrible and desperate weeping, howling and crying
out in consideration of the happiness of the Saints of God in heaven, which they
shall see and envy; Matthew. 8.12. Matthew. 13 42. Luke 13.28. Luke 16.23.24.26
and in respect of of their own endless misery and torment, out of which they
shall have no hope to escape.

And thus in part we have heard what shall be the state of Gods Elect in
heaven, and of the Reprobate in hell.

Q. What is the principal end of the blessedness of the Saints of God in
heaven, and of the misery of she Reprobate in hell?

A. The glory of God, Prou. 16.4. Romans 11.36.
who in his eternal purpose and decree, has foreordained all things to his
own glory.

Q. How are we to conceive of Gods eternal decree touching men and Angels?

A. Thus: that it is his free appointing and fore-ordaining them, Rom 9.22.23
1 Thessalonians. 5.9.
for a certain and everlasting estate for his own glory.

Q. What be the parts of that decree of God touching men and Angels?

A. Two: Election and Reprobation.

Q. What is election?

A. 1. Tim. 5.21. Ephesians. 1.5.6.
It is the Lords free ordaining of some both men and Angels to everlasting
blessedness for the declaration and glory of his goodness.

Q. What is reprobation?

A. It is the Lords free ordaining of some, Romans 9.22. 2. Tim. 2.20.
both men and Angels to eternal shame and dishonor, for the manifestation and
glory of his justice.

FINIS.
