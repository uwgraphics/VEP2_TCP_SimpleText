By the King. A Proclamation for prevention of future abuses in Purueyance.
SVch is the zeal and inward affection which we have found in all sorts of
our loving and loyal Subjects of this our Kingdom, as we are content to
acknowledge, that (besides the Christian care which all Kings are bound by the
Law of God and nature to take over all their People) our own sense and
apprehension of their complaints, does daily increase with the feeling we have
of their honest merits. In which respect, having taken some more particular
pains in the examination of diverse circumstances, then is common to many
Princes; we did not only command all our Officers to be very diligent to try
out and punish the offenses of Purueyors with all severity, but to fall into
serious consideration, how all occasion may be taken away hereafter, whereby
those inferior Ministers, which are used therein, may make themselves (under
color of our Prerogative Royal) the instruments of corruption and rapine: A
matter most odious to our own nature, Who have always more desire to give
then to receive from any our Subjects, except it be where necessity inforceth
us thereunto, even for the support and preservation of that state and dignity
wherein Almighty God has placed us. For better assurance whereof, We have
thought it very convenient at this time, to take some occasion in this manner to
express the fruits of our care and consideration concerning this particular
point of Purueyances.

FIrst, when we were informed that some inferior ministers had presumed to go
so far beyond their Commission, as they have adventured not only to take
Timber trees growing (which being parcel of our Subjects inheritance were never
intended by us to be taken) without the good will and full contentment of the
Owners, but have accustomed also to take up far greater quantities of
Provisions for our House and Stable, then ever came or were needful for our
use (as most especially in Wood, Coal, Hay and Carriage upon our Progress
iourneyes or remoues:) Although we have no cause to doubt, but that our
Officers of our Greenecloth have been and will be ever most ready to search out
and punish all such offenses upon just complaints; Yet we did not leave the
pursuit and trial thereof to them only, but did particularly direct our
Attorney general to inform against them on our behalf in our Court of
Star Chamber, where some of them upon their Confession, have already received
(by censure of that Court) condign punishment by Fine, Imprisonment, Pillorie
and loosing of their ears, And some others seeking to save themselves by
denying that wherewith they were charged do still remain under examination to
receive the like punishment, upon due proof thereof to be made against them.
By which example we persuade our selves, that all honest men will rest so well
assured of our good intention to reform abuses (even to their greatest
satisfaction when there is just occasion) as they will carefully and willingly
continue their obedience and conformity to those courses for furnishing such
provisions as are necessary for us which were taken by the consent of most of
the principal Gentlemen, and good Patriots in several Counties, And whereof
above sixteen Shires have had continuance by the space of forty years,
Especially considering how many good, and wise Princes of this Realm, that
have gone before us, where such agreements have not been made, have held
themselves to their Right of Purueyance, which is one of the most ancient
flowers of the Crown in our Progenitors, and must descend to our Posterity,
whom God we hope) both has, and will so far enable with his blessings, and
graces, as they shall prove themselves no less able, nor worthy then any
others, to enjoy and preserve the right, of a just and lawful Monarchy.
Wherein, because all wise men know sufficiently, that wheresoever there must
be a trust in Vulgar persons, it is not possible to keep their actions from
errors, and abuses; We have thought it fit for a further demo^stration of our
great care to prevent the same, to publish that which follows, as well to
terrify the evil, as to comfort the well affected, whose just grief shall
ever lie as near us, as our own.

BE it therefore known hereby, that we do give express charge and
commandment, that none of our Purueyors, nor other of our Officers or
ministers whatsoever, that now are, or hereafter shall be, or any of them, or
any of their Deputies or Servants, shall take for us, or in our name, to or for
any use whatsoever, any Timber trees of any our Subjects, growing in any place,
or places whatsoever, without the express consent, and agreement of the owner
thereunto had and obtained. Of which particular abuses we cannot conceal our
mislike, both in respect of the injury done thereby to that laudable policy of
the Realm for maintayning of Timber, and also in the particular feeling we
have in our own affections how grievous it is for any man to behold the
fruits, and honest pleasures of his own Labors or his Ancestors, defaced and
spoiled by the lewd and ravenous malice of base companions.

SEcondly, because we have considered that our Subjects may be sometime over
burdened (against the meaning of our principal Officers) by the unreasonable
taking of Wood, Coal, Hay, Oats and such like provisions in time of
Progress: We do expressly charge and command all our Officers, ministers, or
any of their Deputies and servants, to forbear to take either Wood, Coal,
Hay, or Oats in larger proportion, then shall be found necessary to be expended
for the service of our House and Stable.

ANd further our pleasure is, that none of our Purueiors or takers of carriage,
or carttakers (for the time being) nor any of their deputies or servants, nor
any other of our Officers or Ministers whatsoever, shall upon our iourneis,
remoues, or progress, take up any carts or cariages for any Nobleman,
Gentleman, Artizan, or others whatsoever, not being our servants in ordinary,
and necessarily for that time to attend us. In which point that it may the
better appear, how sparingly it shall be used, we do expressly command, that
there be no more cariages taken, then shall be particularly comprised in a
list, which shall be made for that purpose, and signed with the hands of the
principal Officers of our Chamber, Household, and Stable: And for the rest,
whatsoever they be, either Noblemen, Gentlemen, Artizans, or others that do
follow us, our express pleasure and commandment is, That they from henceforth
at all times hereafter provide their cariages (such as they shall like to have
or use) at their own proper costs and charges, and by their own means,
without using in any fort either our name or authority, or any of our
Purueiors, or any of their deputies or servants, for, or about the same.

ANd we do withal hereby signify unto all and every our Purueiors, their
deputies and servants, and all others that may receive any order from them
touching purueyance of carriages, or the making of any the provisions
aforesaid for any our progress, iourneis, or remoues, That if in any point
therein they do carry themselves contrary to this our express prohibition in
that behalf made, that for such their offenses they shall be proceeded against
in the seuerest manner, and receive such exemplary punishment, as by our Laws
may be inflicted upon them.

ANd we do straightly charge our principal Officers of our Household and
Stable, and other Officers of our Greenecloth, upon due information, and proof
made before them of any our Ministers offending in any the kinds before
specified, to deliver the said offenders into the hands of some of the Justices
of Peace of the said Shire or County, where the said offense, or offenses
were committed, to the end they may proceed against them in as severe manner,
as the Law and Justice of our Realm requires, or allows. And if any of the
offenses aforesaid shall seem fitter to be proceeded withal in the Court of
Star chamber, then in the Counties where the offenses shall be committed; Then
we do straightly charge and command our Attorney general for the time
being, that if information be given unto him by any our Justices of Peace of
the misdemeanor of any person so delivered, to see the said offender
prosecuted, and duly punished. Provided always, that our meaning is not
hereby to prohibit any our Justices of Peace, upon just complaints of any of
our loving Subjects, to examine, to bind over to the Sessions, or (if need
require it) to commit any such offenders in their several Shires: And then,
certifying the cause of such commitments to the Officers of our Greenecloth, to
proceed (upon good proofs) in further punishment of the faults, according to
the Laws of the Realm.

ANd we do in like manner expressly prohibit and forbid all persons, after the
end of this Session of Parliament, to make any purueyance without Commission
for every several Shire, containing the kinds, and quantities (so near as
may be) which they are to puruey within such a Shire. And that to the same
Commissions blanke Scedules be annexed, which cannot be taken off, wherein they
shall truly, in presence of such High Constable, or Constables, petty
Constable, or Constables, Headborough, or Headboroughes, as shall (by precept
to him or them directed) be privy to the delivery of any the provisions in
the said Commission specified, enter their takings presently, whereunto the
said Constable, etc. shall subscribe their names or sign Manuell. And that the
owners or sellers, if they will, may presently likewise subscribe their names
or marks to the same. And that when they have finished their takings in any
such Shire, That then they deliver a Duplicate of the said Scedule containing
their takings, and a true Copy of their proportions appointed, to one of the
next Justices of Peace, to the end it may appear that their takings exceed not
their Warrants.

FVrthermore, where We have been informed, that diverse complaints have been
made of some hard course taken by our Officers of our Greenecloth toward
diverse of our loving Subjects, at such times as they have informed against
Purueiors and such like Officers upon abuses; Although We have no doubt, that
any of our Officers will in any such case so much forget their respect to
Justice or Duty to Us (the principal Officers being Counselors of State, and
the rest Knights and Gentlemen of good quality and discretion) yet to the
intent our people may be satisfied that We have no purpose to suffer any
interruption of Justice, under pretext of our authority; We do hereby declare
it, and so is our will and pleasure, that in case any of our loving subjects
shall be imprisoned for so doing, that the Judges of our High Court at
Westminster shall award a Habeas corpus for their relief, according to our
Laws.

ANd for the better satisfaction of our people, of whose loyalty and inward
affections we stand so much assured, as they will not repine at any provision
delivered by Virtue of our Commission, if it may appear to come to our use,
our will and pleasure therefore is, that our Justices of Peace in every several
County or Country where any provision shall be taken by virtue of our
Commissions, shall at their quarter Sessions take particular reckning of the
high and petty Constables of all warrants coming unto them from any minister
of ours, together with what provisions or carriages they have delivered unto
them by virtue of our Commission; the true and just Certificate whereof they
shall half yearly at the least, under the hands and Seals of some of them
certify to our Treasurer and Comptrowler, or other our officers of
Greenecloth, who presently by the parcels and accounts of our house shall duly
examine the receipt from such Purueiors. And if it be found by Certificate of
the said Justices or otherwise, that they have taken more then they have
delivered for our use or expense, unless it shall appear to have had just
cause of miscarrying by the way: then we require our officers of Household, upon
pain of our displeasure, without delay to send the party so offending into the
County where such offense or offenses shall be committed, there to receive
punishment of life and member, as the good and ancient laws of our Realm have
formerly ordained and appointed.

FVrthermore, as we did in our return out of Wiltshire, being our first
progress, upon the examination of some abuses, draw down the number of our
carriages to such a proportion as two full third parts was diminished of the
numbers before time used: even so at this time, because we conceive that the
matter of carriages is the greatest grieuance, And that it is oftentimes no
less trouble to our people to come empty with their carts to Court to take in
carriages, then to convey them; We do therefore hereby also command all
persons used in the service of Carttaking for our remoues, to forbear to take
either more carriages then are of necessity to be used, or to warn or charge
carts in any City, Town, Burrow, or hundred above fourteen miles at any time
distant from the place where they are to receive their loding, upon pain of
loosing their Office and Service, and such further punishment as is to be
inflicted upon them for their contempts. And we do likewise require all high
Constables, upon receipt of any warrants from any our carttakers, their
servants or deputies for warning of Carts within their hundreths, that they
presume not to warn any but in such part of the hundredth as shall be within
compass of the fourteen miles above specified, upon pain of the penalties
before expressed; unless it shall appear by the Judgment and order of the
Justices of that County, or six of them at the least, that it shall be more
for the ease of the country to enlarge the extent of the number of miles
aforesaid.

FVrther, we charge and command the Purueiors of our Woodyard and Scullarie,
upon taking of any proportion of Wood or Coal for our provision, not to meddle
or assume authority unto themselves for warning any Carts for Carriage of the
same, but by the direction of two at the least of our Justices of Peace next
adjoining of that County, where such Wood, or Coals shall be taken, to the end
the same may be performed with the greatest ease to our loving Subjects, upon
pain of loosing their office, and such further punishment, as their contempt
shall require: Not doubting, but those Justices, which are made privy to their
Commission, will use such care, and expedition at all times, for the
furtherance of our service, and for the good and quiet of their country, as we
shall not be forced by their Remisnes, to return the wonted authority into
the hands of the Purueiors.

ANd lastly, as a further demonstration of our inward affection to our people,
notwithstanding our ancient Right and Prerogative of Purueiance so long
continued, we have caused some of our privy Council, (together with our chief
Officers of the Greenecloth) to fall into present consideration how to provide
(as soon as may be) some such convenient number of Carts, wholly to be
maintained upon our own charge, as may serve us whenever we shall make any
sudden remove, or private iourneyes for our exercise, and recreation, without
being forced to use any Commission, or to put the Countries to any charge for
furnishing us upon any of those uncertain occasions.

Given under our Sign manuell at our palace of Westminster the 23. day of
April, in the fourth year of our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most excellent
Majesty. 1606.
